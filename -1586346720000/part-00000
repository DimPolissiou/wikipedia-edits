Mecca, Saudi Arabia.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Mount Arafat|Plains of Arafat]] on the day of [[Hajj]], {{circa}} 2003.]]\nThere have been numerous incidents during the [[Hajj]]', the [[Muslim]] pilgrimage to the city of [[Mecca]], that have caused loss of life. Every follower of [[Islam]] is required to visit Mecca during the Hajj at least once in his or her lifetime, if able to do so; according to Islam, the pilgrimage is one of the [[Five Pillars of Islam]]. During the month of the Hajj, Mecca must cope with as many as three million pilgrims.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16442316|title=Pilgrims mark end of peaceful hajj: Circling of Kaaba brings to close perhaps largest-ever pilgrimage to Mecca]|work=BBC News|date=January 2, 2007|quote=This year\u2019s hajj was likely the biggest ever, with authorities estimating that around 3 million people participated.|access-date=November 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905054144/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/16442316/|archive-date=September 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Commercial aviation|Plane travel]] makes Mecca and the Hajj more accessible to [[pilgrim]]s from all over the world. As a consequence, the Hajj has become increasingly crowded. City officials are required to control large crowds and provide food, shelter, sanitation, and emergency services for millions. However, it has not always been possible to prevent incidents.\n\n==Crushes and failures of crowd control==\n{{wikinews|Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede}}\n[[File:Amellie - Stoning of the devil 2006 Hajj.jpg|thumb|[[Stoning of the devil]], 2006]]\nSometimes the dense, surging troupes, trekking from one station of the pilgrimage to the next, cause a [[stampede]], or more precisely, a progressive troupe collapse. At densities above 6 or 7 persons per square meter, individuals cannot move, groups are swept along in waves, individuals jostle to find breath and to avoid falling and being trampled, and hundreds of deaths can occur as a result. The [[stoning of the devil]] (''ram\u012b aj-jamar\u0101t'') ceremony is particularly crowded and dangerous. Pilgrims ritualistically throw pebbles at three walls (formerly pillars) which represent the three places where the Hadiths describes how the devil tempted Abraham. It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed during the Hajj.\n\nSome notable incidents include:\n*[[1990 Hajj disaster|July 2, 1990]]: A stampede inside a pedestrian tunnel (Al-Ma'aisim tunnel) leading out from Mecca towards Mina and the [[Mount Arafat|Plains of Arafat]] led to the deaths of 1,426 pilgrims, many of them of Malaysian, Indonesian and Pakistani origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-hajj/stoning_tragedies_(P1321).html |title=True Islam |publisher=Quran-Islam.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191242/http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-hajj/stoning_tragedies_(P1321).html |archive-date=2013-03-13 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/13/saudiarabia |title=A history of hajj tragedies &#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=January 13, 2006 |accessdate=2013-07-31 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829222419/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/13/saudiarabia |archive-date=August 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*[[1994 Hajj stampede|May 23, 1994]]: A stampede killed at least 270 pilgrims at the stoning of the Devil ritual.\n*[[1998 Hajj stampede|April 9, 1998]]: at least 118 pilgrims were trampled to death and 180 injured in an incident on Jamaraat Bridge.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/76348.stm | work=BBC News | title=Saudis identifying nationalities of 118 dead pilgrims | date=April 9, 1998 | access-date=January 12, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902175940/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/76348.stm | archive-date=September 2, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n*[[2001 Hajj stampede|March 5, 2001]]: 35 pilgrims were trampled to death in a stampede during the stoning of the Devil ritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1204816.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 MIDDLE EAST \u2013 Lessons from Hajj deaths|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020034151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1204816.stm|archive-date=20 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*February 11, 2003: The stoning of the Devil ritual claimed 14 pilgrims' lives.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2749231.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fourteen killed in Hajj stampede | date=February 11, 2003 | access-date=January 13, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112010915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2749231.stm | archive-date=January 12, 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n*[[2004 Hajj stampede|February 1, 2004]]: 251 pilgrims were killed and another 244 injured in a stampede during the stoning ritual in Mina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3448779.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 Hundreds killed in Hajj stampede|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020033945/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3448779.stm|archive-date=20 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*January  22, 2005: A stampede through the stoning ritual in Mina led to the killing of three pilgrims<ref>{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Timeline of tragedies during hajj pilgrimage in Mecca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/timeline-of-tragedies-in-mecca-during-hajj|accessdate=24 September 2015|publisher=theguardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010225904/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/timeline-of-tragedies-in-mecca-during-hajj|archive-date=10 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> \n*[[2006 Hajj stampede|January 12, 2006]]: A stampede during the stoning of the Devil on the last day of the Hajj in Mina killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured at least 289 more.

One such disease, which has prompted response from the Saudi government, is [[meningitis]] as it became a primary concern after an international outbreak following the Hajj in 1987. Due to post-Hajj outbreaks globally of certain types of meningitis in previous years, it is now a [[visa (document)|visa]] requirement to be immunised with the [[Neisseria meningitidis|ACW135Y]] [[vaccine]] before arrival.

In addition, the stoning ceremony must be carried out according to pre-determined schedules to prevent over-crowding and the attendant risks. The Jamaraat basin has been expanded from its current circular shape into an oval to allow better access to the pillars.

However, it has not always been possible to prevent incidents.\n\n==Crushes and failures of crowd control==\n{{wikinews|Hundreds dead in Hajj stampede}}\n[[File:Amellie - Stoning of the devil 2006 Hajj.jpg|thumb|[[Stoning of the devil]], 2006]]\nSometimes the dense, surging troupes, trekking from one station of the pilgrimage to the next, cause a [[stampede]], or more precisely, a progressive troupe collapse. At densities above 6 or 7 persons per square meter, individuals cannot move, groups are swept along in waves, individuals jostle to find breath and to avoid falling and being trampled, and hundreds of deaths can occur as a result. The [[stoning of the devil]] (''ram\u012b aj-jamar\u0101t'') ceremony is particularly crowded and dangerous. Pilgrims ritualistically throw pebbles at three walls (formerly pillars) which represent the three places where the Hadiths describes how the devil tempted Abraham. It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed during the Hajj.\n\nSome notable incidents include:\n*[[1990 Hajj disaster|July 2, 1990]]: A stampede inside a pedestrian tunnel (Al-Ma'aisim tunnel) leading out from Mecca towards Mina and the [[Mount Arafat|Plains of Arafat]] led to the deaths of 1,426 pilgrims, many of them of Malaysian, Indonesian and Pakistani origin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-hajj/stoning_tragedies_(P1321).html |title=True Islam |publisher=Quran-Islam.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313191242/http://www.quran-islam.org/main_topics/islam/pillars/al-hajj/stoning_tragedies_(P1321).html |archive-date=2013-03-13 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/13/saudiarabia |title=A history of hajj tragedies &#124; World news |publisher=theguardian.com |date=January 13, 2006 |accessdate=2013-07-31 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829222419/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/13/saudiarabia |archive-date=August 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n*[[1994 Hajj stampede|May 23, 1994]]: A stampede killed at least 270 pilgrims at the stoning of the Devil ritual.\n*[[1998 Hajj stampede|April 9, 1998]]: at least 118 pilgrims were trampled to death and 180 injured in an incident on Jamaraat Bridge.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/76348.stm | work=BBC News | title=Saudis identifying nationalities of 118 dead pilgrims | date=April 9, 1998 | access-date=January 12, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902175940/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/76348.stm | archive-date=September 2, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n*[[2001 Hajj stampede|March 5, 2001]]: 35 pilgrims were trampled to death in a stampede during the stoning of the Devil ritual.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1204816.stm|title=BBC News \u2013 MIDDLE EAST \u2013 Lessons from Hajj deaths|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020034151/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1204816.stm|archive-date=20 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*February 11, 2003: The stoning of the Devil ritual claimed 14 pilgrims' lives.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2749231.stm | work=BBC News | title=Fourteen killed in Hajj stampede | date=February 11, 2003 | access-date=January 13, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112010915/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2749231.stm | archive-date=January 12, 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n*[[2004 Hajj stampede|February 1, 2004]]: 251 pilgrims were killed and another 244 injured in a stampede during the stoning ritual in Mina.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3448779.stm|title=BBC NEWS \u2013 Hundreds killed in Hajj stampede|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=11 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020033945/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3448779.stm|archive-date=20 October 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n*January  22, 2005: A stampede through the stoning ritual in Mina led to the killing of three pilgrims<ref>{{cite news|last1=Staff|first1=Writer|title=Timeline of tragedies during hajj pilgrimage in Mecca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/timeline-of-tragedies-in-mecca-during-hajj|accessdate=24 September 2015|publisher=theguardian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010225904/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/24/timeline-of-tragedies-in-mecca-during-hajj|archive-date=10 October 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> \n*[[2006 Hajj stampede|January 12, 2006]]: A stampede during the stoning of the Devil on the last day of the Hajj in Mina killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured at least 289 more.

The Saudi government insists that any such mass gatherings are inherently dangerous and difficult to handle, and that they have taken a number of steps to prevent the problems. The fatalities in the largest tragedy in September 2015 are alleged to have been downplayed by the Saudis by as many as 1,700.<ref name= ap_crush />\n\nOne of the biggest steps, which is also controversial, is a new system of registrations, passports, and travel visas to control the flow of pilgrims. This system is designed to encourage and accommodate first-time visitors to Mecca, while restricting repeat visits. Pilgrims who have the means and desire to perform the Hajj several times have protested what they see as discrimination, but the Hajj Commission has stated that they see no alternative if further tragedies are to be prevented.\n\nFollowing the 2004 stampede, Saudi authorities embarked on major construction work in and around the Jamaraat Bridge area. Additional accessways, footbridges, and emergency exits were built, and the three cylindrical pillars were replaced with concrete walls to enable more pilgrims simultaneous access to them without the jostling and fighting for position of recent years. The government has also announced a multimillion-dollar project to expand the bridge to five levels; the project is planned for completion in time for the [[Islamic calendar|1427 AH]] (Dec. 2006 \u2013 Jan. 2007) Hajj.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4600310.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hajj ritual sees new safety moves | date=January 10, 2006 | access-date=January 12, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060112102841/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4600310.stm | archive-date=January 12, 2006 | url-status=live }}</ref>\nFollowing the 2006 incident, the Jamaraat Bridge and the pillars representing [[Devil (Islam)|Satan]] were demolished and reconstructed.  A wider, multi-level bridge was built, and massive columns replaced the pillars themselves.  Now, each level of the bridge allows easier and safer access to the columns representing Satan. In addition, the stoning ceremony must be carried out according to pre-determined schedules to prevent over-crowding and the attendant risks. The Jamaraat basin has been expanded from its current circular shape into an oval to allow better access to the pillars.

The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000. No single estimate is widely accepted.<ref>{{Citation|author=Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser & Mark Stoneking |journal=[[Current Biology]] |volume=13 |pages=1414\u20131417 |year=2003 |title=Molecular evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the origin of clothing |url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325 |issue=16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910120019/http://www.eva.mpg.de/genetics/pdf/Kittler.CurBiol.2003.pdf |archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref><ref name=\"Stoneking\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.024|title=Molecular Evolution of Pediculus humanus and the Origin of Clothing|journal=Current Biology|volume=14|issue=24|page=2309|year=2004|last1=Kittler|first1=Ralf|last2=Kayser|first2=Manfred|last3=Stoneking|first3=Mark}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Toups |first1=Melissa A. |display-authors=et al |title=Origin of Clothing Lice Indicates Early Clothing Use by Anatomically Modern Humans in Africa |journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution |doi=10.1093/molbev/msq234 |pmid=20823373 |pmc=3002236 |volume=28 |issue=1 |date=January 2011 |pages=29\u201332}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Reed\n|first=David\n|display-authors=et al.\n|title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: The evolutionary history of Anthropoid primate lice\n|journal=BMC Biology\n|year=2007\n|doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7\n|pmid=17343749\n|volume=5 |issue=7\n|pages=7\n|pmc=1828715\n}}</ref>\n\n==Functions==\n[[File:Well-clothed baby.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Infant|baby]] wearing many items of [[winter]] clothing: [[headband]], [[cap]], fur-lined [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[scarf]] and [[sweater]].]]\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=200\n| image1 = Black Boater Hat, Floral Print Dress, and Bronze Sandals (17250719875) (cropped).jpg\n| image2 = Polka Dot Sleeveless Top, Maroon H&M Skater Skirt, Cutout Ankle Boots, and a Black Lace Purse (22061303870).jpg\n| image3 = Strapless Polka Dot Peplum Romper, White Sandals, and a Tan Straw Hat (19335873624).jpg\n| image4 = Green Scalloped Shorts, Baby Blue Top, and White Sandals (17396821965) (cropped).jpg\n| footer = Four types of women's clothing which end above the knees: (clockwise from top) [[minidress]], [[miniskirt]], [[shorts]] and [[romper]], all worn by the same model.\n}}\nThe most obvious function of clothing is to protect the wearer from the elements. In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press.

Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts.

Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].

The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.

Clothing is typically made of fabrics or [[textile]]s but over time has included garments made from [[animal skin]] or other thin sheets of materials put together. The wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to [[human being]]s and is a feature of all human [[societies]]. The amount and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social, and geographic considerations.\n\nClothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the [[weather|elements]], rough surfaces, rash-causing plants, [[Insect bites and stings|insect bites]], [[splinter]]s, [[Thorns, spines, and prickles|thorns and prickles]] by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothes can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and they can provide a [[hygienic]] barrier, keeping infectious and toxic materials away from the body. Clothing also provides protection from [[Ultraviolet|ultraviolet radiation]].\n\nWearing clothes is also a [[Dress code|social norm]], and being deprived of clothing in front of others may be [[Embarrassment|embarrassing]]. In most parts of the world, not wearing clothes in public so that [[Sex organ#Mammals|genitals]], [[breast]]s or [[buttocks]] are visible could be considered [[indecent exposure]].\n\n== Origin of clothing ==\n{{see also|Evolution of hair|History of clothing and textiles}}\nThere is no easy way to determine when clothing was first developed. Estimates by various experts have ranged from 40,000 to 3 million years ago. Some more recent studies involving the evolution of body lice have implied a more recent development with some indicating a development of around 170,000 years ago and others indicating as little as 40,000.

In hot weather, clothing provides protection from [[sunburn]] or [[wind]] damage. In the cold it offers [[thermal insulation]]. Shelter can reduce the functional need for clothing. For example, [[Coat (clothing)|coats]], [[hat]]s, [[glove]]s and other outer layers are normally removed when entering a warm place. Similarly, clothing has seasonal and regional aspects, so that thinner materials and fewer layers of clothing are generally worn in warmer regions and seasons than in colder ones.\n\nClothing performs a range of social and [[culture|cultural]] functions, such as individual, occupational and gender differentiation, and social status.<ref name=\"Flugel1930\">{{citation |date=1976|origyear= 1930 |author=Flugel, John Carl |title=The Psychology of Clothes |series=International Psycho-analytical Library |volume=No.18 |publisher=New York: AMS Press.

Clothing may also function as adornment and an expression of personal taste or style.\n\nClothing has been made from a very wide variety of materials, ranging from leather and [[fur]]s to woven fabrics to elaborate and exotic natural and [[Synthetic fiber|synthetic fabrics]]. Not all body coverings are regarded as clothing. Articles carried rather than worn (such as [[Handbag|purses]]), worn on a single part of the body and easily removed ([[scarves]]), worn purely for adornment ([[jewelry]]), or those that serve a function other than protection ([[eyeglasses]]), are normally considered [[fashion accessory|accessories]] rather than clothing.\n\nClothing protects against many things that might injure or irritate the uncovered human body, including rain, snow, wind, and other weather, as well as from the sun. Garments that are too sheer, thin, small or tight offer less protection. Appropriate clothes can also reduce risk during activities such as work or sport. Some clothing protects from specific hazards, such as [[insect]]s, noxious chemicals, weather, [[weapons]], and contact with abrasive substances.\n\nHumans have devised clothing solutions to environmental or other hazards: such as [[space suits]], [[air conditioned clothing]], [[armor]], [[diving suits]], [[swimsuits]], [[Beekeeping#Protective clothing|bee-keeper gear]], [[motorcycle leathers]], [[high-visibility clothing]], and other pieces of [[protective clothing]]. The distinction between clothing and protective equipment is not always clear-cut, since clothes designed to be fashionable often have protective value and clothes designed for function often consider [[fashion]] in their design. The choice of clothes also has social implications. They cover parts of the body that social norms require to be covered, act as a form of adornment, and serve other social purposes. Someone who lacks the means to procure reasonable clothing due to poverty or affordability, or simply lack of inclination, is sometimes said to be scruffy, ragged, or shabby.<ref>Baradel, Lacey. \"Geographic Mobility and Domesticity in Eastman Johnson\u2019s The Tramp.\" American Art 28.2 (2014): 26\u201349</ref>\n\n==Scholarship==\nSerious books on clothing and its functions appear from the 19th century as imperialists dealt with new environments such as India and the tropics.<ref name=\"Jeffreys1858\">e.g. {{citation |year=1858 |author=Jeffreys, Julius |title=The British Army in India: Its Preservation by an appropriate Clothing, Housing, Locating, Recreative Employment, and Hopeful Encouragement of the Troops |place=London |publisher=Longman, Brown, Green, Longmans & Roberts |url=https://archive.org/stream/britisharmyinin01jeffgoog#page/n7/mode/1up |accessdate=8 September 2010}}</ref> Some scientific research into the multiple functions of clothing  in the first half of the 20th century, with publications such as [[J.C.

The man is in [[Suit (clothing)|suit]] and the woman is wearing a [[gown]].\n</gallery>\n\nIn most cultures, gender differentiation of clothing is considered appropriate. The differences are in styles, colors, fabrics, and types.\n\nIn Western societies, [[skirt]]s, [[Dress (garment)|dresses]], and [[high-heeled shoe]]s are usually seen as women's clothing, while [[necktie]]s are usually seen as men's clothing. [[Trousers]] were once seen as exclusively men's clothing, but can nowadays be worn by both genders. Men's clothes are often more practical (that is, they can function well under a wide variety of situations), but a wider range of clothing styles are available for women. Men are typically allowed to [[bare chested|bare their chests]] in a greater variety of public places. It is generally common for a woman to wear clothing perceived as masculine, while the opposite is seen as unusual.\n\nIn some cultures, [[sumptuary law]]s regulate what men and women are required to wear. [[Islam]] requires women to wear more modest forms of attire, usually [[hijab]]. What qualifies as \"modest\" varies in different Muslim societies; however, women are usually required to cover more of their bodies than men. Articles of clothing Muslim women wear for modesty range from the [[headscarf|head-scarf]] to the [[burqa]].\n\nMen may sometimes choose to wear [[men's skirts]] such as [[togas]] or [[kilt]]s in particular cultures, especially on ceremonial occasions. Such garments were (in previous times) often worn as normal daily clothing by men.\n\nClothing designed to be worn by either sex is called [[unisex clothing]]. Unisex clothes, such as T-shirts, tend to be cut straighter to fit a wider variety of bodies. The majority of unisex clothing styles have started out as menswear, but some articles, like the [[fedora]], were originally worn by women.\n\n===Social status===\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nRajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|''[[Achkan]]'' [[sherwani]] and ''[[churidar]]'' (lower body) worn by [[Arvind Singh Mewar]] and his kin during a [[Hindu wedding]] in [[Rajasthan, India]].

In [[ancient Rome]], for example, only senators could wear garments dyed with [[Tyrian purple]]. In traditional [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] society, only high-ranking chiefs could wear [[feather cloak]]s and palaoa, or carved [[whale]] teeth. In China, before establishment of the [[Republic of China|republic]], only the emperor could wear [[yellow]]. History provides many examples of elaborate [[sumptuary law]]s that regulated what people could wear. In societies without such laws, which includes most modern societies, social status is instead signaled by the purchase of rare or luxury items that are limited by cost to those with wealth or status. In addition, [[peer pressure]] influences clothing choice.\n\n===Religion===\n{{See also|Category:Religious clothing}}\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nGandhara Buddha (tnm).jpeg|The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] wearing [[Kasaya (clothing)|k\u0101\u1e63\u0101ya]] robes.

Sometimes it is worn only during the performance of religious ceremonies. However, it may also be worn every day as a marker for special religious status.\n\nFor example, [[Jain]]s and Muslim men wear unstitched [[cloth]] pieces when performing religious ceremonies. The unstitched cloth signifies unified and complete devotion to the task at hand, with no digression.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Sikhs wear a turban as it is a part of their religion.\n\nThe cleanliness of religious dresses in some religions such as [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Islam]] and [[Jainism]] is of paramount importance since it indicates purity.\n\nClothing appears in numerous contexts in the [[Bible]]; the most prominent passages are: the story of [[Adam and Eve]] who made coverings for themselves out of [[fig leaf|fig leaves]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]]'s [[Coat of many colors|cloak]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] and [[Tamar (Genesis)|Tamar]], [[Mordecai]] and [[Esther]]. Furthermore, the priests officiating in the Temple in Jerusalem had very specific garments, the lack of which made one liable to death.\n\nThe Quran says about husbands and wives, regarding clothing: \"...They are clothing/covering (Libaas) for you; and you for them\" (chapter 2:187).\n\nJewish ritual also requires rending of one's upper garment as a sign of mourning. {{Explain|date=February 2019}}\n\n[[Clergy#Christianity|Christian clergy]] members wear religious [[vestments]] during [[liturgy|liturgical]] services and may wear specific [[clerical clothing|non-liturgical clothing]] at other times.\n\n==Origin and history==\n{{Main|History of clothing}}\n{{See also|History of Western fashion|Category:History of clothing}}\n\n===Early use===\nAccording to archaeologists and anthropologists, the earliest clothing likely consisted of [[fur]], [[leather]], leaves, or grass that were draped, wrapped, or tied around the body. Knowledge of such clothing remains inferential, since clothing materials deteriorate quickly compared to stone, bone, shell and metal artifacts. Archeologists have identified very early [[sewing needle]]s of bone and ivory from about 30,000 BC, found near [[Kostenki]], [[Russia]] in 1988.<ref>Hoffecker, J., Scott, J., ''Excavations In Eastern Europe Reveal Ancient Human Lifestyles'', University of Colorado at Boulder News Archive, March 21, 2002, [http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html colorado.edu] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719175257/http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/b278a670675fd8d2ca0700cdc0e9d808.html |date=2011-07-19 }}</ref> Dyed [[flax]] fibers that could have been used in clothing have been found in a prehistoric cave in the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]] that date back to 34,000 BC.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Balter M | year = 2009 | title = Clothes Make the (Hu) Man | url = | journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1329 | doi = 10.1126/science.325_1329a | pmid = 19745126 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kvavadze E, Bar-Yosef O, Belfer-Cohen A, Boaretto E, Jakeli N, Matskevich Z, Meshveliani T| year = 2009 | title = 30,000-Year-Old Wild Flax Fibers | url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4270521| journal = Science | volume = 325 | issue = 5946| page = 1359 | doi = 10.1126/science.1175404 | pmid = 19745144 }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/data/325/5946/1359/DC1/1 Supporting Online Material]</ref>\n\nScientists are still debating when people started wearing clothes. Ralf Kittler, Manfred Kayser and Mark Stoneking, [[anthropology|anthropologists]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology]], have conducted a genetic analysis of human [[body lice]] that suggests clothing originated around 170,000 years ago. Body lice are an indicator of clothes-wearing, since most humans have sparse body hair, and lice thus require human clothing to survive. Their research suggests that the invention of clothing may have coincided with the northward migration of modern ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' away from the warm [[climate]] of [[Africa]], thought to have begun between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. However, a second group of researchers using similar genetic methods estimate that clothing originated around 540,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Reed |display-authors=et al | year = 2004 | title =  Genetic Analysis of Lice Supports Direct Contact between Modern and Archaic Humans| journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 2 | issue = 11| page = e340 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0020340 | pmid=15502871 | pmc=521174}}</ref> For now, the date of the origin of clothing remains unresolved.\n\n===Making clothing===\n{{See also|Garment industry||knitting|weaving}}\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Lady Going for Pooja.jpg|alt=Sari|thumb|[[Hindu]] Indian lady wearing [[sari]], painting by [[Raja Ravi Varma]]. One of the most ancient and popular pieces of clothing in the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]\nSome human cultures, such as the various peoples of the [[Arctic Circle]], traditionally make their clothing entirely of prepared and decorated furs and skins. Other cultures supplemented or replaced leather and skins with cloth: woven, knitted, or twined from various animal and vegetable fibers including wool, [[linen]], [[cotton]], [[silk]], hemp, and [[ramie]].\n\nAlthough modern consumers may take the production of clothing for granted, making fabric by hand is a tedious and labor-intensive process involving fiber making, spinning, and weaving. The [[textile]] industry was the first to be mechanized&nbsp;\u2013 with the [[power loom|powered loom]]&nbsp;\u2013 during the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\nDifferent cultures have evolved various ways of creating clothes out of cloth. One approach simply involves draping the cloth. Many people wore, and still wear, garments consisting of rectangles of cloth wrapped to fit&nbsp;\u2013 for example, the [[dhoti]] for men and the [[sari]] for women in the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Scottish [[kilt]] and the [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[sarong]]. The clothes may simply be tied up (dhoti and sari); or pins or belts hold the garments in place (kilt and sarong). The cloth remains uncut, and people of various [[Clothing sizes|sizes]] can wear the garment.\n\nAnother approach involves measuring, cutting, and sewing the cloth by hand or with a [[sewing machine]]. Clothing can be cut from a [[sewing pattern]] and adjusted by a tailor to the wearer's measurements. An adjustable sewing mannequin or [[dress form]] is used to create form-fitting clothing. If the fabric is expensive, the tailor tries to use every bit of the cloth rectangle in constructing the clothing; perhaps cutting triangular pieces from one corner of the cloth, and adding them elsewhere as [[gusset]]s. Traditional European patterns for men's [[shirt]]s and women's [[chemise]]s take this approach. These remnants can also be reused to make patchwork hats, vests, and skirts.\n\nModern European [[fashion]] treats cloth much less conservatively, typically cutting in such a way as to leave various odd-shaped cloth remnants. Industrial sewing operations sell these as waste; home sewers may turn them into [[quilt]]s.\n\nIn the thousands of years that humans have been making clothing, they have created an astonishing array of styles, many of which have been reconstructed from surviving garments, [[photo]]s, [[painting]]s, [[mosaic]]s, etc., as well as from written descriptions. Costume history can inspire current [[fashion designer]]s, as well as costumiers for [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[film]]s, [[television]], and [[historical reenactment]].\n\n==Contemporary clothing==\n{{POV section|date=July 2017}}\n{{Western dress codes}}\n\n=== Western dress code ===\n{{main|Western dress code}}\nThe Western dress code has changed over the past 500+ years.  The mechanization of the [[textile industry]] made many varieties of cloth widely available at affordable prices.  Styles have changed, and the availability of [[synthetic fabric]]s has changed the definition of \"stylish\".  In the latter half of the 20th century, [[jeans|blue jeans]] became very popular, and are now worn to events that normally demand formal attire.  [[Activewear]] has also become a large and growing market.\n\nJeans in the Western dress code are worn by both men and women. There are several unique styles of jeans found which include: high rise jeans, mid rise jeans, low rise jeans, bootcut jeans, straight jeans, cropped jeans, skinny jeans, cuffed jeans, boyfriend jeans, and capri jeans.\n\nThe licensing of designer names was pioneered by designers like [[Pierre Cardin]] in the 1960s and has been a common practice within the [[fashion industry]] from about the 1970s. Among the more popular include [[Marc Jacobs]] and [[Gucci]], named for Marc Jacobs and Guccio Gucci respectively.\n\n=== Spread of western styles ===\n[[File:Move In Day 2011 (6099706937) (cropped).jpg|thumb|University students in [[casual clothes]] in the US.]]\n\nBy the early years of the 21st century, western clothing styles had, to some extent, become international styles. This process began hundreds of years earlier, during the periods of European [[colonialism]]. The process of cultural dissemination has perpetuated over the centuries as Western media corporations have penetrated markets throughout the world, spreading Western culture and styles. [[Fast fashion]] clothing has also become a global phenomenon. These garments are less expensive, mass-produced Western clothing. Donated [[used good|used]] clothing from Western countries are also delivered to people in poor countries by charity organizations.\n\n=== Ethnic and cultural heritage ===\nPeople may wear ethnic or [[national costume|national dress]] on special occasions or in certain roles or occupations. For example, most Korean men and women have adopted Western-style dress for daily wear, but still wear traditional [[hanbok]]s on special occasions, like weddings and cultural holidays. Items of Western dress may also appear worn or accessorized in distinctive, non-Western ways. A Tongan man may combine a used [[T-shirt]] with a Tongan wrapped skirt, or [[tupenu]].\n\n===Sport and activity===\n{{Main|Activewear|Sportswear (fashion)}}\n\nMost sports and physical activities are practiced wearing special clothing, for practical, comfort or safety reasons. Common [[sportswear (activewear)|sportswear]] garments include [[shorts]], [[T-shirt]]s, [[tennis shirt]]s, [[leotard]]s, [[tracksuit]]s, and [[athletic shoe|trainers]]. Specialized garments include [[wet suit]]s (for [[human swimming|swimming]], [[Underwater diving|diving]] or [[surfing]]), [[salopettes]] (for [[skiing]]) and [[leotards]] (for [[gymnastics]]). Also, [[spandex]] materials are often used as base layers to soak up sweat. Spandex is also preferable for active sports that require form fitting garments, such as volleyball, wrestling, [[track & field]], dance, gymnastics and swimming.\n[[File:E1275480 (4315537281).jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Fashion show]]s are often the source of the latest trends in clothing [[fashion]]s.

Women wore dresses all day, everyday. Day dresses had a drop waist, which was a sash or belt around the low waist or hip and a skirt that hung anywhere from the ankle on up to the knee, never above. Daywear had sleeves (long to mid-bicep) and a skirt that was straight, pleaded, hank hem, or tired.  Jewelry was less conspicuous.<ref>Simon Bliss, \"'L\u2019intelligence de la parure': Notes on Jewelry Wearing in the 1920s.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 20.1 (2016): 5\u201326.</ref>  Hair was often bobbed, giving a boyish look.<ref>Steven Zdatny,  \"The Boyish Look and the Liberated Woman: The Politics and Aesthetics of Women's Hairstyles.\" ''Fashion Theory'' 1.4 (1997): 367\u2013397.</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century a diverse range of styles exist in fashion, varying by geography, exposure to modern media, economic conditions, and ranging from expensive [[haute couture]] to traditional garb, to [[thrift store]] [[grunge]].  [[Fashion show]]s are events for designers to show off new and often extravagant designs.\n\n==Political issues==\n\n===Working conditions in the garments industry===\n{{further|Garment industry}}\n[[File:Garments Factory in Bangladesh.JPG|thumb|Garments factory in [[Bangladesh]].]]\n[[File:Safety garb for women workers.

[[Mass-produced]] clothing is often made in what are considered by some to be [[sweatshops]], typified by long work hours, lack of benefits, and lack of worker representation. While most examples of such conditions are found in [[developing countries]], clothes made in [[industrialized nation]]s may also be manufactured similarly.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\nCoalitions of [[NGO]]s, designers (including Katharine Hamnett, [[American Apparel]], [[Veja Sneakers|Veja]], [[Quiksilver]], eVocal, and Edun) and campaign groups like the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]] (CCC) and the [[Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights]] as well as [[textile and clothing trade unions]] have sought to improve these conditions as much as possible by sponsoring awareness-raising events, which draw the attention of both the media and the general public to the workers.\n\n[[Outsourcing]] production to low wage countries like [[Bangladesh]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] became possible when the [[Multi Fibre Agreement]] (MFA) was abolished. The MFA, which placed quotas on textiles imports, was deemed a [[protectionist]] measure.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Although many countries recognize treaties like the [[International Labour Organization]], which attempt to set standards for worker safety and rights, many countries have made exceptions to certain parts of the treaties or failed to thoroughly enforce them.

It is currently associated in developed countries with expensive, designer clothing, although fur is still used by indigenous people in arctic zones and higher elevations for its warmth and protection. Once uncontroversial, it has recently been the focus of campaigns on the grounds that campaigners consider it cruel and unnecessary. [[PETA]], along with other [[animal rights]] and [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] groups have called attention to [[fur farming]] and other practices they consider cruel.\n\n==Life cycle==\n\n===Clothing maintenance===\nClothing suffers assault both from within and without. The human body sheds skin cells and body oils, and exudes sweat, urine, and feces. From the outside, sun damage, moisture, abrasion, and dirt assault garments. Fleas and lice can hide in seams. Worn clothing, if not cleaned and refurbished, itches, becomes outworn, and loses functionality (as when [[button (clothing)|buttons]] fall off, seams come undone, fabrics thin or tear, and [[zipper]]s fail).\n\nOften, people wear an item of clothing until it falls apart. Some materials present problems. Cleaning leather is difficult, and bark cloth (tapa) cannot be washed without dissolving it. Owners may patch tears and rips, and brush off surface dirt, but materials like these inevitably age.\n\nHowever, most clothing consists of cloth, and most cloth can be [[laundry|laundered]] and mended (patching, [[darning]], but compare [[felt]]).\n\n=== Laundry, ironing, storage ===\nHumans have developed many specialized methods for laundering, ranging from early methods of pounding clothes against rocks in running streams, to the latest in electronic [[washing machine]]s and [[dry cleaning]] (dissolving dirt in [[solvents]] other than water). Hot water washing (boiling), chemical cleaning and ironing are all traditional methods of [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] fabrics for [[hygiene]] purposes.\n\nMany kinds of clothing are designed to be [[Ironing|ironed]] before they are worn to remove wrinkles. Most modern formal and semi-formal clothing is in this category (for example, [[dress shirt]]s and [[suit (clothing)|suits]]). Ironed clothes are believed to look clean, fresh, and neat. Much contemporary casual clothing is made of knit materials that do not readily wrinkle, and do not require ironing. Some clothing is [[permanent press]], having been treated with a coating (such as [[polytetrafluoroethylene]]) that suppresses wrinkles and creates a smooth appearance without ironing.\n\nOnce clothes have been laundered and possibly ironed, they are usually hung on [[clothes hanger]]s or folded, to keep them fresh until they are worn. Clothes are folded to allow them to be stored compactly, to prevent creasing, to preserve creases or to present them in a more pleasing manner, for instance when they are put on sale in stores.\n\nCertain types of insects and larvae feed on clothing and textiles, such as the [[Black carpet beetle]] and [[Clothing Moth|Clothing moths]]. To deter such pests, clothes may be stored in cedar-lined closets<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bobvila.com/articles/cedar-closets/|title=Cedar Closets 101|date=2017-09-08|website=Bob Vila|language=en|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref> or chests, or placed in drawers or containers with materials having pest repellent properties, such as [[Lavandula#Other uses|Lavender]] or [[mothball]]s. Airtight containers (such as sealed, heavy-duty plastic bags) may also deter insect pest damage to clothing materials.\n\n===Non-iron===\n{{main|Permanent press}}\nA resin used for making non-wrinkle shirts releases [[formaldehyde]], which could cause contact dermatitis for some people; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. [[Government Accountability Office]] tested formaldehyde in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/11/your-money/11wrinkle.html When Wrinkle-Free Clothing Also Means Formaldehyde Fumes]. ''New York Times''.</ref> In 1999, a study of the effect of washing on the formaldehyde levels found that after 6 months after washing, 7 of 27 shirts had levels in excess of 75 ppm, which is a safe limit for direct skin exposure.<ref>[http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php Changes of Free Formaldehyde Quantity in Non-iron Shirts by Washing and Storage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722124023/http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200006/000020000600A0121887.php |date=2011-07-22 }}. ''Journal of Health Science''.</ref>\n\n===Mending===\n{{see also|Darning}}\nWhen the raw material&nbsp;\u2013 cloth&nbsp;\u2013 was worth more than labor, it made sense to expend labor in saving it. In past times, mending was an art. A meticulous [[tailor]] or [[seamstress]] could mend rips with thread raveled from [[hem]]s and seam edges so skillfully that the tear was practically invisible. Today clothing is considered a consumable item. Mass-manufactured clothing is less expensive than the labor required to repair it. Many people buy a new piece of clothing rather than spend time mending. The thrifty still replace [[zipper]]s and [[Button (clothing)|buttons]] and sew up ripped hems.\n\n===Recycling===\nUsed, unwearable clothing can be repurposed for [[quilt]]s, [[:wikt:rag|rags]], [[Carpet|rugs]], [[bandage]]s, and many other household uses. It can also be recycled into [[paper]]. In Western societies, used clothing is often thrown out or donated to charity (such as through a [[clothing bin]]). It is also sold to [[consignment shop]]s, dress agencies, [[flea market]]s, and in [[online auction]]s. Used clothing is also often collected on an industrial scale to be sorted and shipped for re-use in poorer countries.

It formed from personnel from Lu Brezhon, a Breton nationalist militia, under the leadership of [[C\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9]].\n\nThe unit became operational in January 1944 and participated in the arrest of [[French Jews]], labour service evaders, and resistance members in [[Brittany]] under the leadership of the German ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) secret police as well as a number of [[mass murder]]s of civilians. Following the [[Operation Overlord|Allied landings in Normandy]], it was gradually from August 1944 evacuated easterwards into France and [[Nazi Germany]] where it was dissolved in the aftermath of the German surrender. Part of the group, including Lain\u00e9, managed to evade arrest, while others were imprisoned or executed in the post war pursuit of wartime collaborators. Bezen Perrot left a legacy of brutality, hampering future attempts to form an independent Breton state.\n\n==Background==\n===Breton nationalism===\n{{main|Breton nationalism}}\n[[Brittany]] became part of [[France]] in 1536. Although it was gradually integrated into the French [[nation-state]], it retained a distinct sense of ethnic and linguistic identity which was increasingly emphasised by a local [[folklorist]]s and historians in the 19th century. The survival of the [[Breton language]] which was actively discouraged by the French education system became a particular subject of contention and by 1914 Breton had been embraced by the region's intellectuals through a literary revival; however, it failed to reach the masses.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|pp=51\u201355}}\n\nNationalist activity ceased during the course of [[World War I]] and many nationalists were killed in the trenches. The nationalist movement was revived by the periodical ''[[Breiz Atao]]'' (\"Brittany Forever\") founded in 1919.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|pp=56}} In 1923, it adopted [[Pan-Celticist]] ideals, drawing a line between [[Gauls]] and [[Bretons]], and arguing that the traditionally federal Bretons were oppressed by the autocratic rulers of France. Support was instead to be sought in the north; the [[Easter Rising]] and the [[Irish War of Independence]] were portrayed as the implementations of a successful formula that was to be emulated shall France find itself in dire straits. The incorporation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] into France as a consequence of Germany's defeat in World War I, led to the creation of an Alsatian autonomist movement that opposed the French imposition of ''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9]]'' (secularism). In 1928, ''Breizh Atao'' established contacts with the [[Alsace-Lorraine Party]], which in turn facilitated the spread of [[Nordism]] and [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' ideology]] into Breton nationalist circles. Ties with the ethnically German Alsatians strengthened and with them the idea of accepting ''[[Abwehr]]'' assistance, which was already being provided to the [[Flemish Movement|Flemish]] and Alsatian separatists alike.{{sfn|Leach|2010|pp=631\u2013637}}\n\n===Interwar radicalization===\n[[File:Flag of Brittany.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Brittany]], created as a Breton nationalist symbol in 1923 and widely adopted in following years]] \nInspired by the message of ''Breizh Atao'', in 1930 [[C\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9]], a reserve artillery officer, gathered a small group of companions to found [[Gwenn ha du (terrorism)|Gwenn ha du]], a terrorist organization advocating the creation of an independent Breton state through [[direct action]]. In August 1932, Gwenn ha du blew up a 400 year old monument dedicated to the union of Brittany and France. Lain\u00e9 was arrested; however, he was released after a former coworker provided him with an [[alibi]]. Gwenn ha du attracted the support of many young nationalists who became disillusioned with the failure of mainstream political parties to gain ground in formal elections.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=5\u20137}} Gwenn ha du ceased its operations between 1933 and 1936, while Lain\u00e9 was working at the [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kuhlmann|Kuhlmann]] plant in Loos, French Flanders. There, he established links with [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalists]], who introduced him to {{illm|Gerhard von Tevenar|de|Gerhard von Tevenar}}, an Abwehr agent, who converted Lain\u00e9 into Nordic neopaganism.{{sfn|Leach|2010|p=639}} Lain\u00e9 returned to Brittany in 1937, relegating Gwenn ha du the responsibility of sabotage and forming Kadevernn a group that was intended to form the nucleus of a Breton national army. Lain\u00e9's most trusted supporters from the two groups were placed in Service Sp\u00e9cial, a secret special operations unit.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=5\u20137}}\n\nIn November 1938, two Service Sp\u00e9cial members departed for Germany under the pretext of pursuing a degree in [[Celtic Studies]] at the [[University of Rostock]]. Their actual mission involved establishing contact with Abwehr's Department II, which was tasked with organizing subversive activities abroad. Lain\u00e9 and Gwenn ha du chief of operations Herve Helloco followed in July 1939. In early August, a crate containing {{convert|50|kg}} of Breton nationalist propaganda and seditious slogans such as ''[[Why Die for Danzig?]]'' washed up at [[Saint Aubin, Jersey]]. British police informed their French colleagues of the incident, prompting the surveillance of Breton radicals. Six members of Service Sp\u00e9cial were arrested, a five-month interrogation failed to produce any incriminating evidence leading to their release. A shipment of arms, munitions and propaganda material was successfully delivered and hidden in caches with the help of [[Scrignac]] priest [[Jean-Marie Perrot]].{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=8\u201310}}\n\n===Outbreak of World War II===\n{{see also|Breton nationalism and World War II}}\nOn 3 September, France declared war on Germany entering [[World War II]]. On 20 October, Breton nationalist parties were suppressed and their property was confiscated as enemy goods. Lain\u00e9 was recalled into the army, he was promptly convicted of sowing defeatism within his unit, and sentenced to five years of imprisonment by a military tribunal. Other nationalists followed his orders, defecting to the Germans at any suitable opportunity. Abwehr and [[Ahnenerbe]] set up separate concentration camps for Breton prisoners of war, recruits from the camps were employed in the establishment of Breiz Radio a propaganda radio station transmitting messages in Breton. Upon France's [[Battle of France|defeat]], Lain\u00e9 was freed by his comrades fleeing to [[Pontivy]]. Kadevernn was renamed into Lu Brezon (Breton Army), its members took part in drills and studied Lain\u00e9's [[Religious syncretism|syncretic]] neopagan religion and the doctrines of Celto\u2013Nordism. On 24 October 1940, [[Adolf Hitler]] installed [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] as the head of state of [[Vichy France]] in the Montoire Agreement, abandoning the idea of an independent Breton state to ensure French cooperation. Lu Brezon was partially disarmed, while the separatist leaders of the [[Breton National Party]] were replaced with autonomists.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=10\u201312}}\n\nThe [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 prompted many French communists to join the [[French Resistance]], augmenting its presence in Brittany significantly. The majority of Breton nationalists adopted a neutral stance, refusing to join French collaborationist units such as [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism]], while sharing their hatred of what they perceived as a worldwide [[Judeo-Bolshevist]] conspiracy. In the meantime, Breton nationalists became targets of a guerilla campaign waged by [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] (FTP) who continued to view them as traitors. The first such killing took place on 4 September 1943, with the shooting of Yann Bricler, a relative of Breton nationalist [[Olier Mordrel]].{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|pp=95\u201398}} Lain\u00e9 decided to directly aid the Germans in their anti partisan operations, hoping for a change in policy regarding the question of Breton independence. He believed that the mere presence of a purely Breton force would inspire others to join his cause.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=12\u201316}}\n\n==Bezen Perrot==\n===Operations in Brittany, 1943\u201344===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-002-26A, Frankreich, Einsatz gegen Resistance.jpg|thumb|Roundup of French civilians in [[Le Faou\u00ebt, Morbihan|Le Faou\u00ebt]], [[Brittany]] by German soldiers in July 1944]]\nOn 11 November 1943, Lain\u00e9 transformed Lu Brezon into Bezen Kadoudal, named after [[Georges Cadoudal]], one of the leaders of the royalist [[Chouannerie]] uprising of 1794\u20131800. Bezen Kadoudal was placed under the supervision of [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) ''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' Hartmut Pulmer, and under the military command of ''[[Hauptscharf\u00fchrer]]'' Hans Grimm, its headquarters were located at 7 Rue de Vincennes, [[Rennes]].{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=5\u20137}} Its initial 33 members were recruited from a variety of Breton nationalist organizations, some of them had already served in collaborationist militias. Terms of enlistment specified that it will only engage French opponents within the borders of Brittany.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=17\u201318}} On 15 December, Bezen Kadoudal was renamed as Bezen Perrot (Perrot Unit), in honor of the recently assassinated Breton nationalist Jean-Marie Perrot, German documents record it under the name ''Bretonische Waffenverband der SS''. At the top of its strength, the unit numbered 80 members; the pseudonyms of 65 of whom are recorded. Pseudonyms were used in order to protect the members' identities. It was headed by Lain\u00e9, and his assistants, field commander Ange P\u00e9resse and Jean Chanteau, the latter being responsible for intelligence.{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=5\u20137}}\n\nBezen Perrot enacted operations in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It took part in the arrests of Jews, [[Service du travail obligatoire|labour service]] evaders, and members of the resistance. Their knowledge of the Breton language was prized, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with the uniforms of [[Waffen-SS]] that lacked any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Broderick|2005|p=6}} On 7 February 1944, it took part in the arrests of 37 suspected ''[[Maquis (World War II)|maquisards]]'' of whom 12 were later sent to concentration camps.{{sfn|Broderick|2005|p=9}} The summer months of 1944 were marked by an increase of resistance activities. Between 16 May and 23 July, Bezen Perrot took part in 14 counter-insurgency operations, the most notable of them being: On 13 June, a fire fight between [[Free French]] commandos and Bezen Perrot members in the vicinity of [[Plo\u00ebrdut]] resulted in 2 deaths and 1 injury ([[Alan Heusaff]]) on the side of the collaborationists. On 19 June, Bezen Perrot participated in the arrest and forced disappearance of 3 resistance fighters. On 3 July, it executed 31 people in the village of [[Locmin\u00e9]], 5 were deported to Germany and 4 more to the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] where they were exterminated. On 7 July, a month after the [[Normandy landings]] Hitler ordered the liquidation of all partisans and resistance fighters. On 14 July, 57 partisans were massacred in the village of Saint-Hilaire. Several days later, 6 female resistance fighters were shot in the chapel of [[Quistinic]].{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Retreat and disbandment, 1944\u201345===\n[[File:Kristian Hamon - carte actions Bezen Perrot.svg|thumb|Maps of the operations of the Bezen Perrot in [[Brittany]], showing raids in yellow and mass killings in red]]\nIn early August 1944, Bezen Perrot was evacuated from Rennes joining the Germans in their retreat to the east, as Allied troops continued their advance from the north. During the unit's stay in [[Paris]], Chanteau deserted causing others to follow his example. Three of the deserters later defected to the [[French Forces of the Interior]], fighting in the [[Liberation of Paris]].{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=21\u201323}} On 15 August, it was stationed in [[Creney-pr\u00e8s-Troyes]] where it participated in the execution of 49 suspected ''maquisards''. It passed through [[Strasbourg]] in October, reaching [[T\u00fcbingen]] in December. On 16 December, the unit celebrated the first anniversary of its formation. Lain\u00e9 and P\u00e9resse were promoted to ''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' and ''[[Sturmscharf\u00fchrer]]'' respectively, 18 other members received promotions and decorations owed to them. On 29 December, Lain\u00e9 reorganized the unit into four groups of 8 to 10 men. The first group joined the Waffen-SS, the second and third groups were dispatched to the [[Black Forest]], where they received sabotage and radio operation training accordingly. The fourth group consisted of members who were unsuitable for all other tasks, a self-proclaimed propaganda section. The continued Allied pressure forced the 2nd and 3rd Groups to relocate to [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck]] on 25 April 1945. The staff of Bezen Perrot moved to [[Marburg]] in the same month. As Germany's defeat seemed imminent, members were instructed to return to Brittany and go into hiding to areas where they would not be likely to be recognized. Those who had not joined the Waffen-SS were left on their own.{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=8\u201310}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nGermany finally surrendered by 11 May 1945, with the [[French occupation zone]]. Lain\u00e9 stayed at a farm in the vicinity of Marburg until he was provided with false papers by Celtologist [[Leo Weisgerber]], allowing him to escape to the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1947 where he received asylum.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=25\u201327}} During the course of ''[[\u00e9puration l\u00e9gale]]'', 27 Breton nationalists were condemned to death and executed, the majority of them were members of Bezen Perrot.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|p=99}} Still, the core members of the organization evaded arrest, staying back in France and Germany, or fleeing to Brazil, Spain, Argentina and Ireland.

It formed from personnel from Lu Brezhon, a Breton nationalist militia, under the leadership of [[C\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9]].\n\nThe unit became operational in January 1944 and participated in the arrest of [[French Jews]], labour service evaders, and resistance members in [[Brittany]] under the leadership of the German ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) secret police as well as a number of [[mass murder]]s of civilians. Following the [[Operation Overlord|Allied landings in Normandy]], it was gradually from August 1944 evacuated easterwards into France and [[Nazi Germany]] where it was dissolved in the aftermath of the German surrender. Part of the group, including Lain\u00e9, managed to evade arrest, while others were imprisoned or executed in the post war pursuit of wartime collaborators. Bezen Perrot left a legacy of brutality, hampering future attempts to form an independent Breton state.\n\n==Background==\n===Breton nationalism===\n{{main|Breton nationalism}}\n[[Brittany]] became part of [[France]] in 1536. Although it was gradually integrated into the French [[nation-state]], it retained a distinct sense of ethnic and linguistic identity which was increasingly emphasised by a local [[folklorist]]s and historians in the 19th century. The survival of the [[Breton language]] which was actively discouraged by the French education system became a particular subject of contention and by 1914 Breton had been embraced by the region's intellectuals through a literary revival; however, it failed to reach the masses.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|pp=51\u201355}}\n\nNationalist activity ceased during the course of [[World War I]] and many nationalists were killed in the trenches. The nationalist movement was revived by the periodical ''[[Breiz Atao]]'' (\"Brittany Forever\") founded in 1919.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|pp=56}} In 1923, it adopted [[Pan-Celticist]] ideals, drawing a line between [[Gauls]] and [[Bretons]], and arguing that the traditionally federal Bretons were oppressed by the autocratic rulers of France. Support was instead to be sought in the north; the [[Easter Rising]] and the [[Irish War of Independence]] were portrayed as the implementations of a successful formula that was to be emulated shall France find itself in dire straits. The incorporation of [[Alsace-Lorraine]] into France as a consequence of Germany's defeat in World War I, led to the creation of an Alsatian autonomist movement that opposed the French imposition of ''[[la\u00efcit\u00e9]]'' (secularism). In 1928, ''Breizh Atao'' established contacts with the [[Alsace-Lorraine Party]], which in turn facilitated the spread of [[Nordism]] and [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' ideology]] into Breton nationalist circles. Ties with the ethnically German Alsatians strengthened and with them the idea of accepting ''[[Abwehr]]'' assistance, which was already being provided to the [[Flemish Movement|Flemish]] and Alsatian separatists alike.{{sfn|Leach|2010|pp=631\u2013637}}\n\n===Interwar radicalization===\n[[File:Flag of Brittany.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Brittany]], created as a Breton nationalist symbol in 1923 and widely adopted in following years]] \nInspired by the message of ''Breizh Atao'', in 1930 [[C\u00e9lestin Lain\u00e9]], a reserve artillery officer, gathered a small group of companions to found [[Gwenn ha du (terrorism)|Gwenn ha du]], a terrorist organization advocating the creation of an independent Breton state through [[direct action]]. In August 1932, Gwenn ha du blew up a 400 year old monument dedicated to the union of Brittany and France. Lain\u00e9 was arrested; however, he was released after a former coworker provided him with an [[alibi]]. Gwenn ha du attracted the support of many young nationalists who became disillusioned with the failure of mainstream political parties to gain ground in formal elections.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=5\u20137}} Gwenn ha du ceased its operations between 1933 and 1936, while Lain\u00e9 was working at the [[Charles Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kuhlmann|Kuhlmann]] plant in Loos, French Flanders. There, he established links with [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalists]], who introduced him to {{illm|Gerhard von Tevenar|de|Gerhard von Tevenar}}, an Abwehr agent, who converted Lain\u00e9 into Nordic neopaganism.{{sfn|Leach|2010|p=639}} Lain\u00e9 returned to Brittany in 1937, relegating Gwenn ha du the responsibility of sabotage and forming Kadevernn a group that was intended to form the nucleus of a Breton national army. Lain\u00e9's most trusted supporters from the two groups were placed in Service Sp\u00e9cial, a secret special operations unit.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=5\u20137}}\n\nIn November 1938, two Service Sp\u00e9cial members departed for Germany under the pretext of pursuing a degree in [[Celtic Studies]] at the [[University of Rostock]]. Their actual mission involved establishing contact with Abwehr's Department II, which was tasked with organizing subversive activities abroad. Lain\u00e9 and Gwenn ha du chief of operations Herve Helloco followed in July 1939. In early August, a crate containing {{convert|50|kg}} of Breton nationalist propaganda and seditious slogans such as ''[[Why Die for Danzig?]]'' washed up at [[Saint Aubin, Jersey]]. British police informed their French colleagues of the incident, prompting the surveillance of Breton radicals. Six members of Service Sp\u00e9cial were arrested, a five-month interrogation failed to produce any incriminating evidence leading to their release. A shipment of arms, munitions and propaganda material was successfully delivered and hidden in caches with the help of [[Scrignac]] priest [[Jean-Marie Perrot]].{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=8\u201310}}\n\n===Outbreak of World War II===\n{{see also|Breton nationalism and World War II}}\nOn 3 September, France declared war on Germany entering [[World War II]]. On 20 October, Breton nationalist parties were suppressed and their property was confiscated as enemy goods. Lain\u00e9 was recalled into the army, he was promptly convicted of sowing defeatism within his unit, and sentenced to five years of imprisonment by a military tribunal. Other nationalists followed his orders, defecting to the Germans at any suitable opportunity. Abwehr and [[Ahnenerbe]] set up separate concentration camps for Breton prisoners of war, recruits from the camps were employed in the establishment of Breiz Radio a propaganda radio station transmitting messages in Breton. Upon France's [[Battle of France|defeat]], Lain\u00e9 was freed by his comrades fleeing to [[Pontivy]]. Kadevernn was renamed into Lu Brezon (Breton Army), its members took part in drills and studied Lain\u00e9's [[Religious syncretism|syncretic]] neopagan religion and the doctrines of Celto\u2013Nordism. On 24 October 1940, [[Adolf Hitler]] installed [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] as the head of state of [[Vichy France]] in the Montoire Agreement, abandoning the idea of an independent Breton state to ensure French cooperation. Lu Brezon was partially disarmed, while the separatist leaders of the [[Breton National Party]] were replaced with autonomists.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=10\u201312}}\n\nThe [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the Soviet Union]] in June 1941 prompted many French communists to join the [[French Resistance]], augmenting its presence in Brittany significantly. The majority of Breton nationalists adopted a neutral stance, refusing to join French collaborationist units such as [[Legion of French Volunteers Against Bolshevism]], while sharing their hatred of what they perceived as a worldwide [[Judeo-Bolshevist]] conspiracy. In the meantime, Breton nationalists became targets of a guerilla campaign waged by [[Francs-Tireurs et Partisans]] (FTP) who continued to view them as traitors. The first such killing took place on 4 September 1943, with the shooting of Yann Bricler, a relative of Breton nationalist [[Olier Mordrel]].{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|pp=95\u201398}} Lain\u00e9 decided to directly aid the Germans in their anti partisan operations, hoping for a change in policy regarding the question of Breton independence. He believed that the mere presence of a purely Breton force would inspire others to join his cause.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=12\u201316}}\n\n==Bezen Perrot==\n===Operations in Brittany, 1943\u201344===\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1979-002-26A, Frankreich, Einsatz gegen Resistance.jpg|thumb|Roundup of French civilians in [[Le Faou\u00ebt, Morbihan|Le Faou\u00ebt]], [[Brittany]] by German soldiers in July 1944]]\nOn 11 November 1943, Lain\u00e9 transformed Lu Brezon into Bezen Kadoudal, named after [[Georges Cadoudal]], one of the leaders of the royalist [[Chouannerie]] uprising of 1794\u20131800. Bezen Kadoudal was placed under the supervision of [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) ''[[Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer]]'' Hartmut Pulmer, and under the military command of ''[[Hauptscharf\u00fchrer]]'' Hans Grimm, its headquarters were located at 7 Rue de Vincennes, [[Rennes]].{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=5\u20137}} Its initial 33 members were recruited from a variety of Breton nationalist organizations, some of them had already served in collaborationist militias. Terms of enlistment specified that it will only engage French opponents within the borders of Brittany.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=17\u201318}} On 15 December, Bezen Kadoudal was renamed as Bezen Perrot (Perrot Unit), in honor of the recently assassinated Breton nationalist Jean-Marie Perrot, German documents record it under the name ''Bretonische Waffenverband der SS''. At the top of its strength, the unit numbered 80 members; the pseudonyms of 65 of whom are recorded. Pseudonyms were used in order to protect the members' identities. It was headed by Lain\u00e9, and his assistants, field commander Ange P\u00e9resse and Jean Chanteau, the latter being responsible for intelligence.{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=5\u20137}}\n\nBezen Perrot enacted operations in January 1944. It was initially employed on guard and surveillance duty around German installations. It took part in the arrests of Jews, [[Service du travail obligatoire|labour service]] evaders, and members of the resistance. Their knowledge of the Breton language was prized, enabling the German authorities to intercept arms drops and infiltrate Breton resistance networks who used it to encode their communications. In March, their civilian clothing was replaced with the uniforms of [[Waffen-SS]] that lacked any Breton insignia and they were armed with submachine guns, operating in conjunction with the French collaborationist Selbstschutz Polizei.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Broderick|2005|p=6}} On 7 February 1944, it took part in the arrests of 37 suspected ''[[Maquis (World War II)|maquisards]]'' of whom 12 were later sent to concentration camps.{{sfn|Broderick|2005|p=9}} The summer months of 1944 were marked by an increase of resistance activities. Between 16 May and 23 July, Bezen Perrot took part in 14 counter-insurgency operations, the most notable of them being: On 13 June, a fire fight between [[Free French]] commandos and Bezen Perrot members in the vicinity of [[Plo\u00ebrdut]] resulted in 2 deaths and 1 injury ([[Alan Heusaff]]) on the side of the collaborationists. On 19 June, Bezen Perrot participated in the arrest and forced disappearance of 3 resistance fighters. On 3 July, it executed 31 people in the village of [[Locmin\u00e9]], 5 were deported to Germany and 4 more to the [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp]] where they were exterminated. On 7 July, a month after the [[Normandy landings]] Hitler ordered the liquidation of all partisans and resistance fighters. On 14 July, 57 partisans were massacred in the village of Saint-Hilaire. Several days later, 6 female resistance fighters were shot in the chapel of [[Quistinic]].{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=8\u20139}}\n\n===Retreat and disbandment, 1944\u201345===\n[[File:Kristian Hamon - carte actions Bezen Perrot.svg|thumb|Maps of the operations of the Bezen Perrot in [[Brittany]], showing raids in yellow and mass killings in red]]\nIn early August 1944, Bezen Perrot was evacuated from Rennes joining the Germans in their retreat to the east, as Allied troops continued their advance from the north. During the unit's stay in [[Paris]], Chanteau deserted causing others to follow his example. Three of the deserters later defected to the [[French Forces of the Interior]], fighting in the [[Liberation of Paris]].{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=21\u201323}} On 15 August, it was stationed in [[Creney-pr\u00e8s-Troyes]] where it participated in the execution of 49 suspected Maquis. It passed through [[Strasbourg]] in October, reaching [[T\u00fcbingen]] in December. On 16 December, the unit celebrated the first anniversary of its formation. Lain\u00e9 and P\u00e9resse were promoted to ''[[Untersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' and ''[[Sturmscharf\u00fchrer]]'' respectively, 18 other members received promotions and [[Wound Badge]]s when they were due. On 29 December, Lain\u00e9 reorganized the unit into four groups of 8 to 10 men. The first group joined the Waffen-SS, the second and third groups were dispatched to the [[Black Forest]], where they received sabotage and radio operation training accordingly. The fourth group consisted of members who were unsuitable for all other tasks, a self-proclaimed propaganda section. The continued Allied pressure forced the 2nd and 3rd Groups to relocate to [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck]] on 25 April 1945. The staff of Bezen Perrot moved to [[Marburg]] in the same month. As Germany's defeat seemed imminent, members were instructed to return to Brittany and go into hiding to areas where they would not be likely to be recognized. Those who had not joined the Waffen-SS were left on their own.{{sfn|Broderick|2005|pp=8\u201310}}\n\n==Aftermath==\nGermany finally surrendered by 11 May 1945, with the [[French occupation zone]]. Lain\u00e9 stayed at a farm in the vicinity of Marburg until he was provided with false papers by Celtologist [[Leo Weisgerber]], allowing him to escape to the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1947 where he received asylum.{{sfn|Leach|2008|pp=25\u201327}} During the course of ''[[\u00e9puration l\u00e9gale]]'', 27 Breton nationalists were condemned to death and executed, the majority of them were members of Bezen Perrot.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|1982|p=99}} Still, the core members of the organization evaded arrest, staying back in France and Germany, or fleeing to Brazil, Spain, Argentina and Ireland.

They minimize sedatory effects due to their focused effect on peripheral histamine receptors.

of drug that opposes the activity of [[histamine receptor]]s in the body.<ref name=\"H1 receptor NF-\u03baB signaling\" /> In this sense of the word, antihistamines are subclassified according to the [[histamine]] receptor that they act upon. The two largest classes of antihistamines are [[H1 antagonist|H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines]] and [[H2 antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-antihistamines]].\n\nH<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines work by binding to [[HRH1|histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptor]]s in [[mast cells]], [[smooth muscle]], and [[endothelium]] in the body as well as in the [[tuberomammillary nucleus]] in the brain. Antihistamines that target the [[HRH1|histamine H<sub>1</sub>-receptor]] are used to treat [[allergic rhinitis|allergic reactions in the nose]] (e.g., itching, runny nose, and sneezing). In addition, they may be used to treat [[insomnia]], motion sickness, or [[vertigo]] caused by problems with the [[inner ear]]. H<sub>2</sub>-antihistamines bind to [[HRH2|histamine H<sub>2</sub> receptors]] in the upper [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]], primarily in the [[stomach]]. Antihistamines that target the [[HRH2|histamine H<sub>2</sub>-receptor]] are used to treat [[gastric acid]] conditions (e.g., [[peptic ulcers]] and [[acid reflux]]).\n\n[[Histamine receptor]]s exhibit [[constitutive activity]], so antihistamines can function as either a neutral [[receptor antagonist]] or an [[inverse agonist]] at histamine receptors.<ref name=\"H1 receptor NF-\u03baB signaling\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Canonica GW, Blaiss M | title = Antihistaminic, anti-inflammatory, and antiallergic properties of the nonsedating second-generation antihistamine desloratadine: a review of the evidence | journal = World Allergy Organ J | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | pages = 47\u201353 | year = 2011 | pmid = 23268457 | pmc = 3500039 | doi = 10.1097/WOX.0b013e3182093e19 | quote = The H1-receptor is a transmembrane protein belonging to the G-protein coupled receptor family.

[[Sedation]] is a common side effect of H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines that readily cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]]; some of these drugs, such as [[diphenhydramine]] and [[doxylamine]], may therefore be used to treat [[insomnia]].  H<sub>1</sub>-antihistamines can also reduce inflammation, since the expression of [[NF-\u03baB]], the transcription factor the regulates inflammatory processes, is promoted by both the receptor's constitutive activity and agonist (i.e., [[histamine]]) binding at the H<sub>1</sub> receptor.<ref name=\"H1 receptor NF-\u03baB signaling\" />\n\nA combination of these effects, and in some cases metabolic ones as well, lead to most first-generation antihistamines having [[analgesic-sparing]] (potentiating) effects on [[opioid]] [[analgesics]] and to some extent with non-opioid ones as well.  The most common antihistamines utilized for this purpose include [[hydroxyzine]], [[promethazine]] (enzyme induction especially helps with [[codeine]] and similar [[prodrug]] opioids), [[phenyltoloxamine]], [[orphenadrine]], and [[tripelennamine]]; some may also have intrinsic analgesic properties of their own, orphenadrine being an example.\n\n[[Second-generation antihistamine]]s cross the [[blood\u2013brain barrier]] to a much lesser extent than the first-generation antihistamines. They minimize sedatory effects due to their focused effect on peripheral histamine receptors. However, upon high doses second-generation antihistamines will begin to act on the central nervous system and thus can induce drowsiness when ingested in higher quantity.

Normally, histamine acts on H<sub>2</sub> to stimulate acid secretion; drugs that inhibit H<sub>2</sub> signaling thus reduce the secretion of gastric acid.\n\nH<sub>2</sub>-antihistamines are among first-line therapy to treat [[gastrointestinal condition]]s including [[peptic ulcer]]s and [[gastroesophageal reflux disease]].  Some formulations are available over the counter. Most side effects are due to cross-reactivity with unintended receptors.

At the same time, a war between the demons and the guardians of light took place, with the demons led by the Black King of Darkness attacking the lands in the sky. The Black Prince however, despite the wishes of the Black King, defied his orders and falls in love with the White Maiden, in hopes that their union would end the war. Both were not meant to meet and love each other as the war ravaged the world around the land and the skies.\n\nSeveral millennia after the war, in a world consisting of numerous isles, a young hero from the Astora Isle encounters the adventurer Kyle and follows him on an expedition on the isle. They meet a mysterious girl named Iris and a talking white cat named Catra, and together they make their way to the isle's ruins, where they find a flying island. Kyle becomes consumed by darkness there, and the party resolves to travel to the ends of the world on the flying island in order to find the seven \"Great Runes\", following Kyle's words before he disappeared.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\uff5c\u767d\u732b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |url=https://colopl.co.jp/shironekoproject/character/ |website=Colopl |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> Upon their adventures towards finding the Runes, both the hero and Iris start to fill the pieces, meeting friends and enemies and discovering their true identities.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''White Cat Project'' is an [[action role-playing game]] with [[touchscreen]] controls, where the player controls the character by dragging the finger across the screen (a mechanic Colopl calls \"Punicon\") and tapping to attack. Special abilities can be activated by holding the finger on the character, which opens up a selection menu of abilities. All of these actions can be done using one finger only, which facilitates one-handed gaming.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Eugene |title=White Cat Project Is An Action RPG Played With Just Your Thumb |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/07/12/white-cat-project-action-rpg-played-just-thumb/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |accessdate=12 November 2018 |date=12 July 2014}}</ref>  \n\nThe characters also have their own classes corresponding to weapon types, for example swords, bows, and mage staffs. In general, most characters are gained via a \"Summon\" tab which works on a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system. Runes are spent on randomized characters, with some characters being common and other characters being rare.  Some characters can be gained for free by completing in-game missions. While the game is fully playable as a [[single-player]] experience, it also supports up to four-player co-operative [[multiplayer]]. There is also a [[City-building game|town-building mode]] where players can build and upgrade structures that generate in-game currencies and provide combat bonuses to their characters. Unlike many free-to-play games, ''White Cat Project'' has no stamina system.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u3010\u767d\u732b\u653b\u7565\u3011\u30b9\u30bf\u30df\u30ca\u306a\u3057\u3067\u904a\u3073\u307e\u304f\u308c\u308b\u738b\u9053RPG\u300e\u767d\u732b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u300f\u30d7\u30ec\u30a4\u30ec\u30d3\u30e5\u30fc\uff08\u7b2c1\u56de\uff09 |url=https://www.inside-games.jp/article/2014/09/28/81025.html |website=Inside Games |accessdate=11 November 2018 |language=ja |date=28 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\n\n===Video games===\n''White Cat Project'' was released in Japan on July 14, 2014 on iOS and Android platforms.

At the same time, a war between the demons and the guardians of light took place, with the demons led by the Black King of Darkness attacking the lands in the sky. The Black Prince however, despite the wishes of the Black King, defied his orders and falls in love with the White Maiden, in hopes that their union would end the war. Both were not meant to meet and love each other as the war ravaged the world around the land and the skies.\n\nSeveral millennia after the war, in a world consisting of numerous isles, a young hero from the Astora Isle encounters the adventurer Kyle and follows him on an expedition on the isle. They meet a mysterious girl named Iris and a talking white cat named Catra, and together they make their way to the isle's ruins, where they find a flying island. Kyle becomes consumed by darkness there, and the party resolves to travel to the ends of the world on the flying island in order to find the seven \"Great Runes\", following Kyle's words before he disappeared.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\uff5c\u767d\u732b\u30d7\u30ed\u30b8\u30a7\u30af\u30c8 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 |url=https://colopl.co.jp/shironekoproject/character/ |website=Colopl |accessdate=12 November 2018 |language=ja}}</ref> Upon their adventures towards finding the Runes, both the hero and Iris start to fill the pieces, meeting friends and enemies and discovering their true identities.\n\n==Gameplay==\n''White Cat Project'' is an [[action role-playing game]] with [[touchscreen]] controls, where the player controls the character by dragging the finger across the screen (a mechanic Colopl calls \"Punicon\") and tapping to attack. Special abilities can be activated by holding the finger on the character, which opens up a selection menu of abilities. All of these actions can be done using one finger only, which facilitates one-handed gaming.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Eugene |title=White Cat Project Is An Action RPG Played With Just Your Thumb |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2014/07/12/white-cat-project-action-rpg-played-just-thumb/ |website=[[Siliconera]] |accessdate=12 November 2018 |date=12 July 2014}}</ref>  \n\nThe characters also have their own classes corresponding to weapon types, for example swords, bows, and mage staffs. In general, most characters are gained via a \"Summon\" tab which works on a [[Gacha game|gacha]] system. Runes are spent on randomized characters, with some characters being common and other characters being rare.  Some characters can be gained for free by completing in-game missions. While the game is fully playable as a [[single-player]] experience, it also supports up to four-player co-operative [[multiplayer]]. There is also a [[City-building game|town-building mode]] where players can build and upgrade structures that generate in-game currencies and provide combat bonuses to their characters.
