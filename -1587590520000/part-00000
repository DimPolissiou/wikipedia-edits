The organisation was established to improve the social and economic well-being of those who had previously had negative experiences with the secondary education system. As a M\u0101ori-led organisation grounded in M\u0101ori values, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is committed to the revitalisation of M\u0101ori cultural knowledge. It is also focused on breaking inter-generational cycles of non-participation in tertiary education to reduce poverty and eliminate associated social issues.

The genesis of what would become Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa emerged as the brainchild of [http://www.teawamutucol.school.nz/ Te Awamutu College] board of governors' member [[Rongo Wetere]] and [[M\u0101ori Studies]] teacher Iwi Kohuru (Boy) Mangu. The two men wanted to provide a \u2018[[marae]] of learning' as an educational alternative for the large number of predominantly M\u0101ori students being expelled from Te Awamutu College.\n\nTheir solution was to lead a group of these students to create a [[wharenui]] on the college's grounds. The two men were joined in their endeavours by [[tohunga]] whakairo (master carvers) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110813182746/http://www.thearts.co.nz/artist_page.php%26aid%3D11 Pakariki Harrison] and [http://www.waipadc.govt.nz/Council/NewsNoticesAndEvents/Fifteen+acknowledged+at+Waipa+Heritage+Awards.htm Mac Bell]) and [[tohunga raranga]] (master weaver) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120404134248/http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/en/news/couple-share-te-waka-toi-award Hinemoa Harrison]. The resulting structure, ''O-T\u0101whao Marae'', was opened on 26 April 1985 and is still used to introduce students to ''[[M\u0101ori language|te ao M\u0101ori]]'' (the world of M\u0101ori). Although the project encountered resistance at the time, O-T\u0101whao is now recognised as an  [http://www.teawamutu.co.nz/courier/archive/2009/2009-08-04.pdf invaluable resource] for the college and [[Te Awamutu]] community.\n\nIn 1984, Mr Wetere led a project to create the ''Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre''.  The centre would provide further educational opportunities for the students who were involved in the O-T\u0101whao Marae project and engage others in the community who had no qualifications.  The aim was to provide these people with a future beyond the unemployment queues. Although some government funding was available, further fundraising and, in some cases, personal loans from founders were needed to complete the centre.  On completion of the centre, new government funding became available that enabled the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre to expand its programme portfolio.  Office administration, computer technology studies and trades training programmes in building and plumbing were added to the [[whakairo]] (carving), raranga (weaving) and [[M\u0101ori language|Te reo M\u0101ori]] programmes already running.  The centre also became involved in community projects, including renovating [[marae]] throughout the country and producing carving and weaving to adorn these buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nDuring the 1980s (a time of high unemployment in [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand), the kaupapa (philosophy) of the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre was to increase M\u0101ori participation in tertiary training by taking education to the people, particularly those without qualifications. With travel a major barrier for many, the founders began opening campuses in other areas, including [[Te Kuiti]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Manukau]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1987, Buck Nin (a leading New Zealand educationalist and artist)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://nzchinese.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=noted&action=display&thread=98 |title = Forever Buck Nin &#124; Message Board}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2016}} and Mr Wetere advanced the concept of creating a tertiary education institute, or [[w\u0101nanga]]. Dr Nin believed that, by gaining tertiary status, Aotearoa Institute would earn recognition for its qualifications throughout [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand and the world. In 1988, the pair submitted an application to the Ministry of Education and the following year the government changed the Education Act to open the way for recognition of w\u0101nanga as tertiary education institutions.  The same year (1989), Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre changed its name to Aotearoa Institute and shortly afterwards became the first registered private training establishment (under [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]]) in the country.\n\nThe Aotearoa Institute lobbied government for a further five years before being granted tertiary status in 1993. This gave the organisation statutory recognition as a w\u0101nanga and placed it alongside universities, polytechnics and teachers' training colleges. In 1994, Aotearoa Institute changed its name to Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa to reflect this change in status.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa experienced phenomenal growth during the early 2000s (growing from 3,127 students in 2000 to 66,756 students in 2004) and quickly become the largest tertiary education institution in the country; however, there was a price to pay for this rapid expansion. The organisation became mired under the weight of its own popularity; it was struggling to keep pace with the insatiable desire for learning amongst those who had previously been sidelined by an exclusive education system and its internal processes were struggling to cope.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 2005, the government appointed a group of Crown managers to help consolidate the organisation and put in place systems and processes more befitting a nationwide institution of this magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/2005/twoa/summary.htm |title=Inquiry into certain aspects of Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa  |publisher=[[Controller and Auditor-General of New Zealand|Office of the Auditor-General]] New Zealand |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> This work included a nationwide restructure, reorganisation of the executive level of the institution, and a review of the curriculum portfolio.  Since this time, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa has re-established itself as a leading provider of indigenous education in Aotearoa New Zealand and its reputation has grown as a popular destination for overseas organisations hoping to emulate its success.\n\n==W\u0101nanga in tertiary education==\nIn traditional times, where w\u0101nanga were houses of higher learning dedicated to perpetuating m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori knowledge). Attendance at whare w\u0101nanga was a great privilege, with stringent selection processes ensuring that only the most capable students were chosen to receive the knowledge that was to be shared.  In the modern context, w\u0101nanga retain their status as places of higher learning, sitting alongside universities and polytechnics as recognised tertiary institutions in Aotearoa New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is one of three w\u0101nanga that have been given statutory recognition in Aotearoa New Zealand.

Although operating within te ao M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori sphere), Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is an inclusive organisation that welcomes all New Zealanders.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Curriculum==\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa delivers programmes from certificate through to degree level. Its programme portfolio has been developed over a number of years in consultation with iwi, industry, community and students. Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa considers feedback from these groups in combination with the objectives of the Government's Tertiary Education Strategy, organisational objectives and constraints that impact on the organisation.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nA key objective is to eliminate, as much as possible, barriers that have previously prevented people from participating in tertiary education, including economic barriers, geographical barriers, barriers created by family and work commitments, and barriers created by previous negative experiences in the secondary and tertiary education systems. To eliminate these barriers, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa strives to keep fees to an absolute minimum, to maximise programme options and locations, to offer a range of flexible learning hours and to provide as much student support as possible. The resulting mix of programmes at each site represents a balance of these often competing objectives.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Student demographics and achievement==\nIn 2010, more than 35,000 students studied at Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa. Of these students, 18,020 (50.1%) indicated they had M\u0101ori [[whakapapa]] (ancestry) and 3,702 (10.3%) indicated [[Pacific Islander|Pasifika]] origins. Sixty-eight per cent of students were women and 52% were older than 40 years of age.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThirty-eight per cent of students enrolling at Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa in 2010 did not have any qualification and 30% were unemployed just prior to enrolling. Students continued to record high levels of student satisfaction during 2010. Most notably, 91% of students across the country were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their tutor and 90% of students were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their learning environment. Students also recorded high levels of satisfaction with the quality of learning resources, their programmes and the quality of facilities on their campus.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 2010, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa achieved an overall programme graduation rate of 70%, and course completion and retention rates of 78% and 81% respectively.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==''M\u0101t\u0101tahi Mataora'' \u2013 Youth Initiatives==\nDuring the 25 years since its foundation, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa has been catering for an increasingly more mature student group as the organisation's reputation for delivering inclusive and engaging adult education has spread.

The organisation was established to improve the social and economic well-being of those who had previously had negative experiences with the secondary education system. As a M\u0101ori-led organisation grounded in M\u0101ori values, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is committed to the revitalisation of M\u0101ori cultural knowledge. It is also focused on breaking inter-generational cycles of non-participation in tertiary education to reduce poverty and eliminate associated social issues. The organisation works towards \u2018[[wh\u0101nau]] transformation through education'.\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is currently one of the largest public tertiary education institutions in the nation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Performance of Tertiary Education Sector - At a Glace|url=http://publications.tec.govt.nz/Performance+of+Tertiary+Education+Sector+-+At+a+Glance|publisher=Tertiary Education Commission - Te Amorangi Matauranga Matua.}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa was founded in 1983 to provide training and education for those whose needs were not being met by the mainstream education system.  The genesis of what would become Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa emerged as the brainchild of [http://www.teawamutucol.school.nz/ Te Awamutu College] board of governors' member [[Rongo Wetere]] and [[M\u0101ori Studies]] teacher Iwi Kohuru (Boy) Mangu. The two men wanted to provide a \u2018[[marae]] of learning' as an educational alternative for the large number of predominantly M\u0101ori students being expelled from Te Awamutu College.\n\nTheir solution was to lead a group of these students to create a [[wharenui]] on the college's grounds. The two men were joined in their endeavours by [[tohunga]] whakairo (master carvers) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110813182746/http://www.thearts.co.nz/artist_page.php%26aid%3D11 Pakariki Harrison] and [http://www.waipadc.govt.nz/Council/NewsNoticesAndEvents/Fifteen+acknowledged+at+Waipa+Heritage+Awards.htm Mac Bell]) and [[tohunga raranga]] (master weaver) [https://web.archive.org/web/20120404134248/http://www.creativenz.govt.nz/en/news/couple-share-te-waka-toi-award Hinemoa Harrison]. The resulting structure, ''O-T\u0101whao Marae'', was opened on 26 April 1985 and is still used to introduce students to ''[[M\u0101ori language|te ao M\u0101ori]]'' (the world of M\u0101ori). Although the project encountered resistance at the time, O-T\u0101whao is now recognised as an  [http://www.teawamutu.co.nz/courier/archive/2009/2009-08-04.pdf invaluable resource] for the college and [[Te Awamutu]] community.\n\nIn 1984, Mr Wetere led a project to create the ''Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre''.  The centre would provide further educational opportunities for the students who were involved in the O-T\u0101whao Marae project and engage others in the community who had no qualifications.  The aim was to provide these people with a future beyond the unemployment queues. Although some government funding was available, further fundraising and, in some cases, personal loans from founders were needed to complete the centre.  On completion of the centre, new government funding became available that enabled the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre to expand its programme portfolio.  Office administration, computer technology studies and trades training programmes in building and plumbing were added to the [[whakairo]] (carving), raranga (weaving) and [[M\u0101ori language|Te reo M\u0101ori]] programmes already running.  The centre also became involved in community projects, including renovating [[marae]] throughout the country and producing carving and weaving to adorn these buildings.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nDuring the 1980s (a time of high unemployment in [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand), the kaupapa (philosophy) of the Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre was to increase M\u0101ori participation in tertiary training by taking education to the people, particularly those without qualifications. With travel a major barrier for many, the founders began opening campuses in other areas, including [[Te Kuiti]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]] and [[Manukau]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 1987, Buck Nin (a leading New Zealand educationalist and artist)<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://nzchinese.proboards.com/index.cgi?board=noted&action=display&thread=98 |title = Forever Buck Nin &#124; Message Board}}</ref>{{better source|date=November 2016}} and Mr Wetere advanced the concept of creating a tertiary education institute, or [[w\u0101nanga]]. Dr Nin believed that, by gaining tertiary status, Aotearoa Institute would earn recognition for its qualifications throughout [[Aotearoa]] New Zealand and the world. In 1988, the pair submitted an application to the Ministry of Education and the following year the government changed the Education Act to open the way for recognition of w\u0101nanga as tertiary education institutions.  The same year (1989), Waip\u0101 K\u014dkiri Arts Centre changed its name to Aotearoa Institute and shortly afterwards became the first registered private training establishment (under [[New Zealand Qualifications Authority|NZQA]]) in the country.\n\nThe Aotearoa Institute lobbied government for a further five years before being granted tertiary status in 1993. This gave the organisation statutory recognition as a w\u0101nanga and placed it alongside universities, polytechnics and teachers' training colleges. In 1994, Aotearoa Institute changed its name to Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa to reflect this change in status.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa experienced phenomenal growth during the early 2000s (growing from 3,127 students in 2000 to 66,756 students in 2004) and quickly become the largest tertiary education institution in the country; however, there was a price to pay for this rapid expansion. The organisation became mired under the weight of its own popularity; it was struggling to keep pace with the insatiable desire for learning amongst those who had previously been sidelined by an exclusive education system and its internal processes were struggling to cope.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 2005, the government appointed a group of Crown managers to help consolidate the organisation and put in place systems and processes more befitting a nationwide institution of this magnitude.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.govt.nz/2005/twoa/summary.htm |title=Inquiry into certain aspects of Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa  |publisher=[[Controller and Auditor-General of New Zealand|Office of the Auditor-General]] New Zealand |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=20 September 2012}}</ref> This work included a nationwide restructure, reorganisation of the executive level of the institution, and a review of the curriculum portfolio.  Since this time, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa has re-established itself as a leading provider of indigenous education in Aotearoa New Zealand and its reputation has grown as a popular destination for overseas organisations hoping to emulate its success.\n\n==W\u0101nanga in tertiary education==\nIn traditional times, where w\u0101nanga were houses of higher learning dedicated to perpetuating m\u0101tauranga M\u0101ori (M\u0101ori knowledge). Attendance at whare w\u0101nanga was a great privilege, with stringent selection processes ensuring that only the most capable students were chosen to receive the knowledge that was to be shared.  In the modern context, w\u0101nanga retain their status as places of higher learning, sitting alongside universities and polytechnics as recognised tertiary institutions in Aotearoa New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is one of three w\u0101nanga that have been given statutory recognition in Aotearoa New Zealand. The three w\u0101nanga are represented by the collective national association ''Te Tauihu o Ng\u0101 W\u0101nanga''.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa expresses \u0101huatanga M\u0101ori through the application of its guiding principles and through tikanga operating throughout the organisation in day-to-day activities. \u0100huatanga M\u0101ori is also expressed through the actions of its staff members and through the programmes it delivers. Although operating within te ao M\u0101ori (the M\u0101ori sphere), Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa is an inclusive organisation that welcomes all New Zealanders.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Curriculum==\nTe W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa delivers programmes from certificate through to degree level. Its programme portfolio has been developed over a number of years in consultation with iwi, industry, community and students. Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa considers feedback from these groups in combination with the objectives of the Government's Tertiary Education Strategy, organisational objectives and constraints that impact on the organisation.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nA key objective is to eliminate, as much as possible, barriers that have previously prevented people from participating in tertiary education, including economic barriers, geographical barriers, barriers created by family and work commitments, and barriers created by previous negative experiences in the secondary and tertiary education systems. To eliminate these barriers, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa strives to keep fees to an absolute minimum, to maximise programme options and locations, to offer a range of flexible learning hours and to provide as much student support as possible. The resulting mix of programmes at each site represents a balance of these often competing objectives.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==Student demographics and achievement==\nIn 2010, more than 35,000 students studied at Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa. Of these students, 18,020 (50.1%) indicated they had M\u0101ori [[whakapapa]] (ancestry) and 3,702 (10.3%) indicated [[Pacific Islander|Pasifika]] origins. Sixty-eight per cent of students were women and 52% were older than 40 years of age.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nThirty-eight per cent of students enrolling at Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa in 2010 did not have any qualification and 30% were unemployed just prior to enrolling. Students continued to record high levels of student satisfaction during 2010. Most notably, 91% of students across the country were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their tutor and 90% of students were 'very satisfied' or 'satisfied' with their learning environment. Students also recorded high levels of satisfaction with the quality of learning resources, their programmes and the quality of facilities on their campus.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\nIn 2010, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa achieved an overall programme graduation rate of 70%, and course completion and retention rates of 78% and 81% respectively.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}\n\n==''M\u0101t\u0101tahi Mataora'' - Youth Initiatives==\nDuring the 25 years since its foundation, Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa has been catering for an increasingly more mature student group as the organisation's reputation for delivering inclusive and engaging adult education has spread.

G. Quintel]]) is a 23-year-old anthropomorphic [[blue jay]] who works as a groundskeeper at The Park. He has been best friends with Rigby ever since childhood, and together they are very lazy and constantly slack off at their jobs there. Mordecai is more conscientious, intelligent, mature, and moral about his actions than Rigby is, which sometimes leads to his opposing Rigby when he is the cause of some kind of chaotic problem. However, Mordecai usually sides with his friend and the two generally stick together through their adventures. Mordecai loves to play video games and is a better player than Rigby, he also demonstrates decent strength, such as carrying large boulders, and never being hurt by Rigby's punches, able to punch Rigby across an entire room with ease. He can sometimes become caught up in his emotions, often letting them get the better of him. However, he is usually quick to apologize to others if he has hurt them and occasionally takes the lead in fixing a situation. He had a crush on Margaret Smith, a red robin who worked as a waitress at a local coffee shop. Mordecai would often hang out with her, along with Rigby and Eileen Roberts, and made many attempts to try to start a relationship with her. The two finally begin to date in the fourth season until Margaret decides to leave for college, thus ending their relationship. He decides to take a break from dating in \"Dumped at the Altar\", after his relationship with CJ didn't work out. In the episode \"Camping Can Be Cool\", it is revealed that he attended art school before being employed at The Park; however, he never finished the course due to his bad portrait skills, which were revealed in the episode \"Bad Portrait\". He is shown to have an outgoing mom, who embarrasses him around his girlfriends and also made a highlight reel of Mordecai's most embarrassing moments, as seen in \"Maxin' and Relaxin'\". In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Mordecai quits The Park, parts ways with Rigby, moves to [[New York City]], and returns to making art. He opens a successful exhibition and meets a [[bat]] woman whom he eventually marries and starts a family.<ref name=\"Main\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/shows/regularshow/characters/index.html | title=Regular Show Characters | publisher=Cartoon Network | date=14 March 2017 | accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref> Mordecai's wife was not given a name in the show.

He has been best friends with Mordecai since childhood and slacks off even more than Mordecai does. Rigby is hyperactive, immature, and extremely mischievous, which sometimes puts him at odds with Mordecai. He mostly lives for simply having a good time and relaxing, which he sometimes achieves through selfish acts like lying or cheating. He has a bad habit of getting himself and others in trouble, often causing many of the chaotic and surreal problems that arise in The Park. Nevertheless, he is shown to be a good person deep down and sticks closely to his friends. Like Mordecai, Rigby loves to play video games, but he is the worse of the two. He is also shown to be the weakest of The Park workers, although he has surprised them on a few occasions. Rigby's lack of strength was a major plot point in the episode \"One Pull Up\", in which Rigby had to pass a company physical and keep his job by performing one pull up. He has a younger brother named \"Don\", whose height and physique lead people to believe that he, not Rigby, is the older brother. Eileen Roberts, a female [[Mole (animal)|mole]] who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret Smith, has strong feelings for Rigby and makes this very obvious. He originally did not reciprocate her feelings and harshly ignored her at some points, but he quickly begins to warm up to her and implies that he likes her, as well. In \"Dumped at the Altar\", Rigby reveals to Mordecai that he and Eileen have been dating for 3 months. Rigby is allergic to eggs, as evidenced in the episode \"Eggscellent\" when Rigby tried to eat a 12-egg omelet to win a trucker hat and went into a coma due to a severe allergic reaction. Rigby has also died four times and was resurrected in the series. He was killed by Skips in an arm wrestling match, he was killed by Snowballs the Ice Monster, he was killed by Mordecai who pushed him into the Space-Time Continuum, and fell into a fatal coma in \"Eggscellent\". As of ''Rigby's Graduation Day Special'', Rigby has finally graduated from high school. In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Rigby quits The Park and moves in with Eileen. They eventually get married and start a family, but it's unknown if Rigby is working or not as he is seen teaching his children how to play video games.<ref name=\"Main\" /> It is hinted at in the episode \"'Ello Gov'nor\" that Rigby's last name may be Riggerson, however, this has neither been confirmed nor denied by J.G.

He is frequently infuriated with Mordecai and Rigby due to their constant slacking and mischief. He is very hot-tempered and prone to fits of rage, and bossy often turning red (or pink if injured) whenever he yells or is extremely angry, his [[catchphrase]]s are \"You're fired!\", \"_____ or you're fired!\", or even \"Get back to work!\". At the end of some episodes, Benson tries to fire the duo (sometimes along with their coworkers or only one of them), but they always manage to find a way to keep their jobs with some help from other characters. Even so, they may instead have to face consequences whether it is their fault or not. Despite always being at odds with them, Benson is kind-natured at heart and is ultimately friends with the duo after calming down a bit in the episode \"Benson Be Gone\" and the three gain more insight and trust with each other as the series progresses. In the episode \"Think Positive\", it is revealed that Benson's family members often yelled at each other when he was a child. His father instructed him that he would not get anything in his life if he did not yell for it. If Benson ever contained his anger for too long, the anger inside him will cause havoc and destruction unless he expresses his anger by yelling (often at Mordecai and Rigby). It has been implied that Benson was unhappy during his youth and did not enjoy his family's anger. He is skilled at [[Table hockey games|stick hockey]] and has a strong love for music, proving to be an extremely skilled drummer in the episode \"150 Piece Kit\". Benson used to date Audrey, a human woman who lives across from him in his apartment complex. It is revealed that they broke up in \"The Real Thomas\", in which Benson starts to date an undercover Russian spy named Natalia, although she is later eaten by a whale. In the episode \"Pam I Am \", Benson develops feelings for one of the dome scientists named Pam and they go on a 'date'. However, Dr. Langer witnesses the 'date' and makes a new rule that forbids the dome staff from dating anyone who works at the park. At the end of the episode, it is implied that Benson and Pam will date once the dome is gone. During the beginning of the episode \"Fries Night\", Benson contacts Pam back on earth, to which she revealed that having a \"long distance\" relationship with Benson because he is now in space is too difficult for her. She states that the reason for the break up is that she doesn't know when or if he will ever return to earth again. They both agree to become friends even though Benson later gets depressed from yet another break up with a woman he really cared for. In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Benson remains working as the manager of The Park and gets back together with Pam. They apparently adopt Apple Sauce as well as a variety of cats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== \"Pops\" Maellard===\n{{Infobox character\n|name = Pops\n|image = \n|gender = Lollipop/male \n|first_major = The Naive Man from Lolliland (2005)\n|last_major = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n|creator = J.G.

His adoptive father, Mr. Maellard, is the owner of The Park. Pops tends to be very ecstatic about everything, often exclaiming \"Good show!\" or \"Jolly good show!\" when he is happy about something. When something bad happens, he will instead say \"Bad show.\" He tends to dress and act like hes in the early 1900s and using earlier technology and slang. He carries small [[butterscotch]] lollipops in his wallet, sincerely believing that they are real money, much to everyone's confusion. He is an upright gentleman who is very kind and well-mannered to everyone. He is also very sensitive, often becoming upset or crying if his feelings are hurt. He has strong interests in poetry, wrestling, music, nature, animals, and games. Despite being an elderly man, he is very childish and is often oblivious to serious things around him. Because of this, the group is frequently looking after him, especially Benson. Pops has also been shown to have immense strength on several occasions, despite his slim build. In the episode \"Prank Callers\", it is shown that Pops was once a more serious and mature man back in the 1980s. However, when Mordecai and Rigby had been sent back to that time and accidentally hit him with a golf cart, he is shown to have turned into his zany self. Pops once owned a British doll named Percival, or Percy, who turned his back on him and tried to kill Pops in \"Terror Tales of the Park\". Pops is also one with nature, but lost it until he tries to find the answer to get it back, as shown in \"Catching the Wave\". In Season 8, Pops is revealed to be the universe's Chosen One due to being born with telekinetic abilities and ever since he is one with nature back in some previous season's episode, as well as having an evil version of himself with the ability to erase a person from existence. Pops' destiny is to kill Malum Kranus to prevent the destruction of the universe. In \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", it is revealed that his real name is Mega Kranus. Pops also realizes that the best way to defeat Malum Kranus is with kindness. Pops gives Malum Kranus a hug and the two fly into the sun, killing them both in the process, and the universe is saved. In Heaven, Pops' is heard saying his catchphrase 'Jolly Good Show' as a video tape of the show, and the show itself, ends.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Skips===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Skips\n| voice              = [[Mark Hamill]]\n| first_major        = Pilot (2009)\n| last_major         = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n| creator            = J.G.

He is the strongest and smartest of The Park workers and they almost always turn to him for help, as he usually knows how to solve the chaotic problems that arise, however, he isn't always right. Whenever he is asked for help, he generally says, \"I've seen this before\", and then presents a solution. As his name suggests, he is always skipping rather than walking, except when he is angered, in which he runs instead. He is a diligent worker and is very skilled at his job; however, he suffers from a lack of knowledge of computers and other kinds of newer technology, which was seen in the episode \"Skips vs. Technology\" where Rigby and Mordecai jam a printer and crash the computer  whilst printing a card for Skips thanking him for his efforts to save them for being fired from Benson for their antics. Aside from this, he is very experienced and knowledgeable, as he is [[immortality|immortal]] and has been alive for hundreds of years. In the episode \"Free Cake\", it is revealed that he must perform a [[ceremonial dance]] every year on his birthday in order to renew his immortality. He explains the story of how he received his immortality in the episode \"Skips' Story.\" He chose to become immortal in order to fight Klorgbane, an immortal bully who inadvertently caused the death of his girlfriend, Mona, the only woman that Skips had ever loved during a fistfight. The Guardians of Eternal Youth provided Skips with his immortality, knowing that he was the only one capable of defeating Klorgbane with the Fists of Justice. Skips' birth name was Walks, but he changed it to Skips when he received his immortality because he and Mona would always skip when they were together. This is also the reason why he always skips instead of walking; he chose to do this in order to remember the times he and Mona shared for all his life. Skips is also a skilled bassist, which is demonstrated in several episodes. In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Skips remains working at The Park while having a new part-time job as a mechanic, satisfied with his life.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Muscle Man/Mitch Sorenstein===\n{{Infobox character\n|name = Muscle Man\n|image =\n|voice = [[Sam Marin]]\n|first_major = Pilot (2009)\n|last_major = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n|creator = J.G.

He is very erratic and immature, often pulling pranks and joking around. He enjoys telling \"My mom!\" jokes, botched attempts at \"[[Yo Mama|Yo mama]]\" jokes, much to the annoyance of everyone except Hi-Five Ghost, his best friend. Although he can be rude due to his ego, he is ultimately shown to be polite and caring toward his friends. He and Fives were fired in the episodes \"Don\" and \"Under the Hood\" but were rehired at the end. At times, he can burst out on a rampage if he is greatly angered. His father, Muscle Dad, enjoyed the same attitude for pranks and jokes, but died in the episode \"Trucker Hall of Fame\". His older brother, Muscle Bro (real name John), is also seen throughout the series. Muscle Man originally shared a rivalry with Mordecai and Rigby throughout the first two seasons, but the three began to get along and treat each other as friends from the third season onward. His girlfriend, Starla, shares a similar appearance to him and the couple constantly disgust other people when they publicly kiss and show affection to each other. His real name was revealed to be Mitch Sorenstein in the episode \"Muscle Woman\". In \"Power Tower\", it is revealed that he gained the nickname \"Muscle Man\" from his early years of bodybuilding and actually being in excellent physical condition, but he found that life very boring and gave it up. In \"The End of Muscle Man\", he proposes to Starla and the two become engaged and they are now married in \"Dumped at the Altar\". In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", upon returning home Muscle Man discovers he has a three-year-old daughter.

Because of his name and appearance, he is frequently called by his nickname, \"High Fives\", and sometimes simply as \"Fives\". Hi-Five Ghost rarely speaks throughout the first three seasons of the series, but he is given more dialogue from season four onward. His father was introduced in the episode \"See You There\", as well as his older brother, Low-Five Ghost, who works as a police officer. In the episode \"The Postcard\", Hi-Five Ghost reunited with a human girl named Celia whom he had befriended at a cafe after waiting four years to receive a postcard from her.

(Ministry of Meadow Management), a KGB agency that struggled to find out what made American parks up to date and wealthy. In order to fix Russia's outdated parks, M.O.M.M. sent out Nikolai on a covert operation to obtain the park and bring it back to Russia. During his undercover mission, he changed his identity to \"Thomas\" and presented himself as an intern for credits in college in \"Exit 9B\" (in which he made his debut), working as an unpaid intern who calls his \"mom\" on a regular basis and is often reproved by his coworkers, most notably by Muscle Man. He is usually reluctant to be involved in the surreal and chaotic adventures that arise in The Park, often asking if he has to be part of the situation, to which they insist that he must. There are times when Nikolai becomes personally invested in maintaining his cover, such as using a robot to pose as his \"mom\" in \"The Thanksgiving Special\", and wearing spy attire disguised as a Halloween costume (a slice of pizza, which he had to wear until Thanksgiving Day upon losing a bet in \"Terror Tales of the Park III\").  When the other Russian spies that were deployed with him carry out the final phase of the plan to bring The Park to Russia in \"The Real Thomas\", he finally reveals his true identity to the park crew and explains why he is really there. When Nikolai learns the plan is really to destroy the Park through a loophole in Russian/American relations, he turns on his fellow spies for being lied to (along with some persuasion by the park crew to remind him of the good times they had as friends, despite the constant poor treatment he received from them for being an intern), and returns the Park to American soil before going on the run from both sides. He makes several cameos after this, usually in some sort of disguise. Eventually, he returns in \"Guys Night 2\", revealing himself to be tired of his old life as a spy and wanting to move on to a new life. He feels his only option is to go into hiding forever, but first he enjoys one final hang with the park crew. He made non-speaking cameos in later episodes. In \u201cRigby\u2019s Graduation Special\u201d, he makes a brief cameo by proposing a toast to the park dome taking off into space while in his submarine.\n\n===Margaret===\n{{Infobox character\n|name = Margaret\n|image =\n|gender = Female\n|species = [[American robin|Red Robin]]\n|first_major = Caffeinated Concert Tickets (2010)\n|last_major = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n|creator = J.G.

She was good friends with her co-worker, Eileen. Mordecai had a huge crush on Margaret and frequently found excuses to go to the coffee shop to see her. She has a cousin named John who has an artificial wooden leg. The rest of her family are all birds like her and Mordecai, except for her father Frank, a strong and stern human. Margaret returns Mordecai's feelings for her and the two begin to finally date in the fourth season. They broke up in the season finale when Margaret leaves for college. In the episode \"Eileen Flat Screen\", Margaret returns now as a news reporter, which no one notices. In \"Merry Christmas Mordecai\", Mordecai becomes nervous when he hears that Margaret will be there. After several awkward encounters (thanks to Mordecai), they finally manage to have a normal conversation with both acknowledging that they had some good times. This leads to a montage of memories, ending with a memory of a kiss on a roller coaster. Unfortunately, when the scene flashes to the present, they accidentally kiss on the lips and are shocked when they notice CJ watching them. CJ runs out of the house and leaves while Mordecai runs upstairs to find his phone; he notices that all of Margaret's stuff is there and Eileen tells him she is staying as an intern. Mordecai is frantic when he hears the news and didn't know what to say about Margaret staying with Eileen from now on.\n\nAs of \"Sad Sax\", Mordecai and Margaret are still just friends, and Mordecai makes it up to CJ by telling her the truth.\n\nIn \"1000th Chopper Flight Party\", Mordecai is still awkward with her presence and afraid to screw up, even to the point of letting Rigby constantly mess up the Party as a diversion just to keep her away from him. When he finally is declared as the lucky guest to ride Chopper 6 for its 1000th flight, he finds it hard to say no and joins. Margaret tries to talk to him, but Mordecai awkwardly resists until she scolds him for his attitude in desire for their friendship. Mordecai then lifts the tension with a joke and they finally start to have a fun chat. This however angers CJ, who misinterprets it as them rekindling their love, and she causes havoc with her storm cloud ability. Mordecai tries to save Margaret, but she calms CJ when she reveals that she is in a relationship with news anchor, Del Hanlon, which stuns Mordecai and surprises her parents.\n\nIn \"Not Great Double Date\", Mordecai seemed upset that Margaret had a boyfriend, but still said that she seemed happy with Del and that he liked him. When she confessed that Del was not her boyfriend and that she was tired of feeling like a tourist around her friends because of the tension with CJ, he felt sad about it and was pretty interested to know that she still had feelings for him.\n\nIn \"Just Friends\", Rigby and Eileen go to the presentation of martial arts Don, leading to Mordecai and Margaret spending a night that has romantic moments. A chef named Daisuke shows them their future using magical sauce. It is revealed that if, and when, Mordecai and Margaret get together, they will get married, have children, buy their own houseboat, and die peacefully after 50 happy years. Mordecai and Margaret agree that their future looks like it will be really great, but that they are still young and should take it easy on relationships. At the end of the episode, the two agree to remain just friends, with future Margaret looking down on them and inquiring how long they can be just friends, and future Mordecai stating that \"only time will tell.\"\n\nIn \"Rigby's Graduation Special\", she was very worried as she watched Mordecai and cried as the other park workers being shot into space, even saying his name in concern. However, in the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", she is only seen greeting Eileen when she returns. She does not end up with Mordecai and is not seen with the group 25 years later, though she becomes a muse for Mordecai's art.\n\nHead writer Matt Price stated on [[Reddit]] that the idea was that Mordecai and Margaret would find their own paths in life <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/regularshow/comments/5oszo6/we_are_matt_price_head_writer_and_calvin_wong/dclu2vj}}</ref> On [[Tumblr]] writer Owen Dennis stated that reality shows that many people who initially date one another end up with other people, contradicting narrative arcs of many Western entertainment media.<ref name=OwenDennisrelationshipinfo/>\n\n===Eileen===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Eileen\n| image              = \n| gender             = Female\n| species            = Mole\n| first_major        = Brain Eraser (2011)\n| last_major         = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n| creator            = Minty Lewis\n| voice              = Minty Lewis\n| full_name          = Eileen Roberts\n| occupation         = Barista\n| family             = Unnamed Father\n| spouse             = [[#Rigby|Rigby]] (Husband)\n| children           = Two Unnamed Daughters <br/> Unnamed Son\n| affiliation        = Dome Subjects\n}}\n{{Anchor|Eileen Roberts}} Eileen Roberts (voiced by Minty Lewis, a writer/storyboard artist for the series) is a shy and timid mole who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret.

At first they enjoy, but when they spot the unicorns from \"The Unicorns Have Got to Go\", they tell the No Rules Man to get rid of them. This angers him, causing him to order everyone to stop the two, but it fails, and prompts Mordecai and Rigby to leave. Later, when the No Rules Man is playing video games, a note reading \"no video games\" is dropped and lands on his lap. After reading it, he explodes. He is one of the villains revived in \"Exit 9B\", and is killed by the Baby Ducks in their giant form.\n\n=== Game Store Manager ===\nThe Game Store Manager (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]]) is the main antagonist in \"But I Have a Receipt\".

When the manager refuses to refund them even though Mordecai and Rigby have a receipt, the duo manages to sabotage his business until he does. The angry manager eventually traps them in the game and becomes the knight Darthon. When he almost defeats them, the duo realize that players control the game by using their imagination. They finally win when Mordecai stabs Darthon with an immunity sword, and the three re-appear in the real world, in which the manager was really impaled by a ruler. Although the duo enjoy the game and decline the refund, the manager gives their money back and drives away before Mordecai and Rigby could help him. He supposedly died, as his Darthon version was one of the revived villains in \"Exit 9B\". However, he later makes a cameo in \"That's My Television\".\n\n===Ybgir===\nYbgir (vocal effects provided by [[Roger Craig Smith]]) is Rigby's negative counterpart who appears in \"Dizzy\" and \"Jinx\".

Ybgir returns as a demon in \"Jinx\" after Rigby tries to break his jinx. When Rigby tries to follow Muscle Man's instructions to un-jinx himself on his own he releases Ybgir from a bathroom mirror. Rigby and Mordecai must then try to stop Ybgir from turning the entire city into zombies. They eventually un-jinx Ybgir, which sends him back to the mirror, defeating him until he returns.\n\n=== Coffee Bean and the Translator ===\nThe Coffee Bean (voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]] in the first appearance, [[Sam Marin]] in later appearances) is, as his name states, an anthrophomorphic coffee bean.

They are first seen in \"Caffinated Concert Tickets\", where they are in line to get tickets for the Fist Pump reunion concert. After over-hearing Mordecai and Rigby's plan to put more time in at work, the duo show up with a contract that Rigby immediately signs for both of them.

He had the ability to talk and spoke with a deep voice, which is very strange, considering that his appearance is that of a cherubic, really young British boy. He was the most sophisticated doll of his day, with 250 phrases stored inside. Yet the only real phrases we heard him say had to do with an obsessive desire to draw on peoples' faces. Percy not only spoke of his obsession, but it was discovered that he was also an autonomous, \"living doll\" who actually carried out his intentions and threats of drawing on peoples' faces. He drew on Pops's face after Pops tried to throw him away, and when Pops tried playing teatime with him after Mordecai and Rigby threw him away, Percy became aggressive and wanted to draw on Pops's face even more. Mordecai and Rigby tried to rescue Pops, but Percy escaped and went into the basement. When Mordecai, Rigby, and Pops went after him, Percy knocked Mordecai and Rigby unconscious with a shovel. Percy demanded Pops to bring him a marker so he could draw on Mordecai and Rigby's faces, but then Pops stood up for himself and told Percy that it's not cool for a grown man like him to play with dolls and that Percy must go away. Percy then ran towards Pops to attack him, while Pops did the same. Pops kicked him into the furnace, where he started to melt. He then climbed back out of the furnace in one last attempt to draw on their faces, but instead ended up collapsing onto the floor.\n\n====Skull Punch====\nSkull Punch is the name of a supposedly British heavy metal band that had died and returned as ghosts, living in an old looking RV in The Park. After Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost decided to crash their RV into a crash pit they had made two weeks ago, the ghosts captured them and planned to leave them inside of the RV when it exploded in the crash pit. They are one of the only people that died twice on Regular Show. They performed a rock song while the RV was going into the crash pit, but failed to jump off before it went into the hole, and they died again. The names of each band member (as revealed during the credits) are Harold (lead singer and guitarist) (voiced by [[Robin Atkin Downes]]), Nigel (bassist) (voiced by [[Sam Marin]]), and Archie (drummer) (voiced by [[Julian Holloway]]).

He lives inside of a large, supposedly haunted mansion, which was egged by Rigby due to him turning off the light and not responding when being asked by Rigby to give him candy. This led him to seek revenge on Rigby. He later lurked around Pops's House and used his dark magic to turn Rigby into a nice-looking house. Later that night when it was dark, Muscle Man was on the porch and then saw him driving his car to the front of the house and comes out invisible. Muscle Man tells him to change Rigby back and to get out of there, as well as loading his shotgun telling him not to ask twice. The Halloween Wizard then teases him and asks Muscle Man if he has any clever jokes about his mom, Muscle Man tells him not to talk about his mom so he starts firing in random directions, to no avail. Everyone else watches him shooting the gun but Muscle Man gets knocked over. The wizard then drags him across the grass, yelling and holding his gun up in the air while being dragged and fires the gun a few more times before he goes into the woods. Mordecai, shocked, asks if they saw that. Then there is a knocking on the door, which opens and reveals Muscle Man, who has had his skin ripped off, showing only muscle (inferring that the Wizard had skinned him). Muscle Man says, \"I told you I was ripped\", then falls over and dies after that and scares the others then the phone rings. Hi-Five Ghost goes to answer it, after Skips tells him not to, and answers the phone saying, \"Hello?\". The wizard then says \"Good-bye!\" and sucks him into the phone and turns him into liquid that squirts onto Mordecai and Skips. Mordecai is then knocked unconscious when the wizard throws him against the bookshelf. Benson and Pops see this and they both scream and run into different rooms. Then the wizard breaks Skips' crossbow and the wizard throws Skips into the chimney and burns him. Then he goes to the bathroom and pulls back the curtains for the shower and finds Benson and says, \"What's up Gumball?\". Benson then screams and gets flushed down the toilet. Then, Pops is on the bed terrified and the wizard comes in and Pops fires a rock at the wizard with his slingshot but misses and the wizard picks him up, drags him on the ceiling, and puts him in the closet which falls over, then disappears. Rigby is scared and asks if anyone was there. Mordecai then wakes up and tells him that he won't let anything happen to him, but the wizard decapitates him. Then, Rigby finds out that Mordecai has died and he says sorry to the wizard. Then the wizard comes and gives Rigby his punishment by throwing eggs at him. Then Rigby becomes angry because the wizard turned him into a house and killed everyone so he can egg him. The wizard then drowns him in a giant raw egg. It is then revealed that it was just a story that Rigby told. Muscle Man then makes fun of his story saying that it was weak and that his story about wrecking cars in a pit was way better. But Rigby says that \"that's not it\" and turns out to be the wizard who disguised himself as Rigby.

He was pulled out of the driver's seat by Mordecai, causing him to fly backwards and break into pieces. Mordecai then puts the bus in reverse causing them to get younger.

He then turns on the television and eventually tunes in to a live news channel where the news reporter asks a question, \"Did you buy a bed recently?\" Rigby replies by saying \"Yes\", the news reporter says this may have been a fatal mistake, he then explains during a shootout with police at a UM\u00c4K factory, Johnny Allenwrench, a potential murderer fell into a UM\u00c4K machine where he was manufactured into a bed. The reporter then goes on to say due to a clearing error, the bed was shipped out to stores, and now the company is reclaiming the KILL\u00dcRGEN beds back. Rigby then says that he feels sorry for \"the loser who brought that bed\", but after finding out his new bed was made by the same company, he claims he's also \"one of those losers\". Eventually, the news reporter receives the code for the bed that contains the murderer. He then reads the code out saying: \"If you have this bed code number you are sleeping on a murderer, 623570406 the last number is smudged he grabs his glasses and says it is an 8\". The bed then molds and captures Rigby within it. The bed then threatens Rigby with a hex key, however Benson tells him that he'll give him a job if he lets Rigby free.

He makes his debut in the episode \"Terror Tales of the Park III\". It is said that he lived in the house 200 years ago and was ahead of his time. More so than most others who are considered ahead of their time, since he acted and spoke like it was the 1980s. Since he behaved and talked oddly, the townsfolk thought that he was a wizard, and tried to murder him. Before they could, he put his soul into the house and exclaimed he would show them all and return in 200 years when everyone talked and acted like him, and he would be king of the world. When he realized everyone in his time would be long dead by then, he vowed to come back in the form of a murderous poltergeist to haunt and kill whomever is inside of the house, but before doing so, he signed his house over to Mr. Maellard. Unfortunately for Townhouse, his predicted time of return bypassed the eighties, when he would have been in style. Meaning now, instead of being far too ahead of his time, his mannerisms were considered old fashioned and out of touch. 200 years later on Halloween night, Benson told his fellow park workers the story of Jebediah as well as a scary story about him, which involved Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost trying to escape from him after taking on a dare to survive the whole night in the house but are one by one killed, afterwards proceeding to tell them that he was indeed a real person.

Before the park crew could vote him guilty, Pops decided to use the restroom first, which gave him the idea to ask the judge if he can use the restroom too, which the judge allowed him to do unsupervised. When inside the restroom, he first asked Pops for some toilet paper. He then turns into a werewolf and attacked him and then bit Pops to turn him into a werewolf so he can take his place.

After Pops escapes to the airport as a werewolf and boards a plane to London, he runs into Wolfhard again. He apologizes to Pops for mauling and Pops is willing to let it go.

When he tries to use the catapult to escape, he's too heavy to be launched further and he ends up crashing a few feet from the catapult. While the park staff laughs at his misfortune, Racki laughs at Benson because now he can't get his $500 security deposit back, result in Benson screaming \"No!\". It turns out that the entire episode was a vision for Benson who is at a Halloween store and he asked Racki on wishing to throw the best Halloween party ever. When the Halloween store worker asked how he likes it, Benson said it's terrible and he refuses to rent Racki if he can't get his security deposit back so he went to the streamer store instead.

However, the park workers walk up and as the bench is destroyed in the explosion.

His relationship with Mordecai ends up making Rigby jealous. He eventually becomes a clone of Rigby and even sounds the same. After doing multiple tests with Rigby's favorite things, Mordecai tricks Doug into revealing himself by offering a hug and he accepts (which the real Rigby would never do). Upon realizing that his cover is blown, Doug attempts to flee but is quickly apprehended by Skips and placed in custody by the local authorities for his crimes. It is also revealed that he had been pulling the same scam all over the country. He is seen in the same cell with Mr. Ross when the park is sent into space.\n\n===Vince and Tommy===\nVince and Tommy are two businessmen who only appeared in \"Party Re-Pete\" and work for the mysterious company called \"Party Starter\" which are disguised to clone party throwing people such as Party Pete.

After the park gang rescue Benson, Party Pete, and other captured party throwers, the two try to stop them from escaping, but are defeated when Benson feeds the Party Pete a large galleon of soda, causing an explosion that destroys the building. They are then arrested by the police for their crimes. \n\n===Park Avenue===\nThe Park Avenue (voiced by [[Troy Baker]]) is a living spray can who appears in \"Under the Hood\". His graffiti led to Muscle Man getting fired from his job, forcing Mordecai and Rigby to chase him down and expose his scheme to Benson to get Muscle Man rehired.

When Benson attempts to call the police, he tries to escape but fails.\n\n=== Sensai ===\nThe Sensai (voiced by [[Steve Blum]]) is white-haired man and the villain in \"Sandwich of Death\".\n\n=== Warlock ===\nThe Warlock (voiced by [[James Hong]]) is the villain in \"Fortune Cookie\".

As Carrey and his security guard Carl fight Mordecai and Rigby for the tape, the entire club gets involved in the massive brawl but Benson. When the tape gets into his hands, Carrey punches and yells at him for it. Benson then furiously smashes it into Carrey's face, knocking him unconscious and destroying the tape as well.

Posing as a health inspector, he arrives at the Park. When he takes a look inside Muscle Man's trailer (which Muscle Man won in a hot dog eating contest), he initially plans to take it to the dump, but gives Muscle Man a chance to get it \"up to code\". However, when Frank shows up again, he gets two of his henchmen to destroy some parts of his trailer, claiming that it was still not \"up to code\". After Muscle Man refuses to let him take away his trailer, Frank warns that he will return with an army and drives off. Muscle Man then calls his brother Muscle Bro, who brings his truck, as a reinforcement and forms a strategy. As the park workers (except Hi-Five Ghost) are pursued by Frank and his henchmen, they are en route to the border, where there was a cliff at the end. After the park gang and Frank's minions are all defeated during the chase, Frank scuffles with Muscle Man in Muscle Bro's truck. When Muscle Man calls him the \"most insane health inspector ever\", Frank reveals that he is not a real health inspector: he was the runner-up at the hot dog eating contest that Muscle Man won, and he wanted to take the trailer for revenge. Muscle Man gets out of the truck, telling Frank to take it, but not before tying the truck's wheel up with his shirt and removing the brake petal. Frank Jones reaches the back of the truck where the trailer was to be stored, only to find a sign that it was a prank. He is killed when the truck drives off the edge of the cliff. In the end, it is revealed that Hi-Five Ghost was secretly hiding and guarding the trailer the whole time.\n\n===Christmas Villains===\n\n====Quillgin====\nQuillgin (voiced by [[Thomas Haden Church]]) is an evil elf who resembles a human being and only appears in the \"Regular Show Christmas Special\". He made a magical present that was so powerful that it can give people anything they want and only lava could destroy it. However, as he used dark magic as a key component, it also turns people evil and he got so angry that he tried to use it to end Christmas forever and kill Santa, but it fails when Santa reveals to be wearing a bulletproof vest and steals the present from Quillgin. After Santa, the park gang, and the rival park team up, Mordecai and Rigby attempt to destroy the present by throwing it into the East Pines lava pit. Quillgin fights Mordecai and Rigby for the present while falling in the volcano and was killed after landing into the lava pit with the magical present. The Christmas Special is a parody of the [[Lord of the Rings]], so Quillgin is a parody of [[Sauron]] who was originally an elf before his transformation into the Dark Lord.\n<!-- PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE THIS CHARACTER INFORMATION, THANK YOU. -->\n\n====Celcius Snow Monsters====\nThe Celsius Snow Monsters are one of the villains from \"Regular Show: Christmas in Space\".

She disappears afterwards.\n\n===Promise Pie===\nThe Promise Pie (voiced by [[J. G. Quintel]]) is the villain in \"Pie Contest\". He first appears inside a garbage can and lies to Mordecai and Rigby when they ask him to help judge the contest without hurting anyone's feelings (although Mordecai at first refuses his help, as he didn't trust him earlier), but he actually intended on eating everybody instead, making him grew to a gargantuan size  and claiming that he was lowering the competition to make judging simpler for them. This forces the duo to tell the truth to everyone, shrinking him down to size. Mordecai ended up smashing him against a garbage truck, killing him for good.\n\n===Cash Bankis===\nCash Bankis (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) is the antagonist of \"Bank Shot\".

When Cash wins the bet, he shows Rigby the bill \u2013 $12,000 for a night of eating gold plated chicken. As Rigby is unable to pay that much, he decides to take the bet up a notch (double or nothing). He bets Cash that he can make \"the greatest bank shot of all time\" off the wall. He accepts. but only if Rigby passes off his Eggscellent hat as a side deal. When Rigby's guts \"fail\" him, he steals the hat and demands Rigby to pay up $24,000. Rigby didn't have that kind of money on him, so he threatens his friends to pay the money. This forces Rigby to demand another rematch (triple-or-nothing). Cash gives Rigby until the following day to get prepared. He tells him not only will he pay him the money, but he and his friends will be forbidden to hang out at Wing Kingdom. When Rigby is fully prepared, the two meet up at Wing Kingdom again and begin the rematch. After Cash makes his first successful shot, Rigby makes his successful shot. They go at each other with amazing bank shots, until Cash fails one. Rigby makes another shot, and wins the triple-or-nothing bet. That meant Cash had to pay for his own bill, and Rigby asked for his hat back. Cash said he won the hat fair and square on the side deal. Then, the God of Basketball appeared and told Rigby his double or nothing bet was still in play. It's revealed that Rigby's ball continued to bank after going out the window. It returns to Wing Kingdom, and bounces the hat off Cash's head before going through the hoop. Which meant Rigby truly made the greatest bank shot of all time.\n\n=== Hurl, Merle and Burl ===\nHurl Hurlbutt, Merle and Burl (voiced by [[Roger Craig Smith]], Matt Yang King and [[Troy Baker]] respectively) are a trio of brawny surfers and the main antagonists in \"Catching the Wave\".

While the groundskeepers defend him, Pops goes to ride the wave, but Hurl cranks the machine up to its highest level before the rest of the park gang stop him.

Skips and Rigby both manage to retrieve the cover from Snowballs, allowing Mordecai to write an ending to make Snowballs disappear and everything go back to normal.\n\n===Stress Monster===\nThe stress monster is a five-headed monster who appears in \"Skips Stress\". It is formed after Skips rings an ancient stress bell to remove his, along with Benson, Pops, Mordecai, and Rigby's stress, with each head resembling the five.

He made his ultimate prank by leaving Muscle Man a note after he passed, the note asked Muscle Man to spread his ashes over the Trucker Hall of Fame and said that it was his last wish.

After this, Skips suggests that Quips does his routine at a kids show and it works out great. Quips makes his appearance in a few episodes and has inspired a fan base for his famous catchphrase, \"Zingo!\"\n\n===The Cart===\nHecho En \"the Alive Golf Cart\" Mexico (voiced by [[Toby Jones (writer)|Toby Jones]]), is the golf cart Mordecai and Rigby use as their way of transportation. His most distinctive appearance was when Mordecai and Rigby accidentally bring him to life (with soda spilled over his engine) while having to replace him. After doing many activities, Cart dives into sea with fireworks firing from his trunk as a final activity to do before going to the dump. After finding out he was going to stay (due to Benson being unable to afford the new cart thanks to an accounting error), Mordecai and Rigby fished him out, repaired him, and drove him back. After these events, Cart could no longer speak or move by himself. He mistakenly believes that his name is \"Hecho En Mexico\" because that's what is written on him (\"Hecho en Mexico\" means \"Made in Mexico\" in Spanish and is actually meant to indicate where the cart was manufactured).\n\n===Suit===\nAn outfit which is simply called Suit (voiced by [[Dean Cameron]]) is a suit-like cybernetic talking exo-suit that Benson wears in \"Benson's Suit\".

The next day, the suit cleaned himself suddenly and appeared in front of Benson. He later revealed to Benson who he was and praised Benson as a worthy boss.

Eventually, Mordecai and Rigby stuff him with so much cola that he explodes to death just before Benson arrives. It is revealed that Pete (actually named \"Peter Hermanverfal\") was one of the many people to be captured by Party Planners and be cloned for parties, meaning that the Party Pete that died was only a clone.

G. Quintel]]) is a 23-year-old anthropomorphic [[blue jay]] who works as a groundskeeper at The Park. He has been best friends with Rigby ever since childhood, and together they are very lazy and constantly slack off at their jobs there. Mordecai is more conscientious, intelligent, mature, and moral about his actions than Rigby is, which sometimes leads to his opposing Rigby when he is the cause of some kind of chaotic problem. However, Mordecai usually sides with his friend and the two generally stick together through their adventures. Mordecai loves to play video games and is a better player than Rigby, he also demonstrates decent strength, such as carrying large boulders, and never being hurt by Rigby's punches, able to punch Rigby across an entire room with ease. He can sometimes become caught up in his emotions, often letting them get the better of him. However, he is usually quick to apologize to others if he has hurt them and occasionally takes the lead in fixing a situation. He had a crush on Margaret Smith, a red robin who worked as a waitress at a local coffee shop. Mordecai would often hang out with her, along with Rigby and Eileen Roberts, and made many attempts to try to start a relationship with her. The two finally begin to date in the fourth season until Margaret decides to leave for college, thus ending their relationship. He decides to take a break from dating in \"Dumped at the Altar\", after his relationship with CJ didn't work out. In the episode \"Camping Can Be Cool\", it is revealed that he attended art school before being employed at The Park; however, he never finished the course due to his bad portrait skills, which were revealed in the episode \"Bad Portrait\". He is shown to have an outgoing mom, who embarrasses him around his girlfriends and also made a highlight reel of Mordecai's most embarrassing moments, as seen in \"Maxin' and Relaxin'\". In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Mordecai quits The Park, parts ways with Rigby, moves to [[New York City]], and returns to making art. He opens a successful exhibition and meets a [[bat]] woman whom he eventually marries and starts a family.<ref name=\"Main\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/shows/regularshow/characters/index.html | title=Regular Show Characters | publisher=Cartoon Network | date=14 March 2017 | accessdate=March 14, 2017}}</ref> Mordecai's wife was not given a name in the show.

He has been best friends with Mordecai since childhood and slacks off even more than Mordecai does. Rigby is hyperactive, immature, and extremely mischievous, which sometimes puts him at odds with Mordecai. He mostly lives for simply having a good time and relaxing, which he sometimes achieves through selfish acts like lying or cheating. He has a bad habit of getting himself and others in trouble, often causing many of the chaotic and surreal problems that arise in The Park. Nevertheless, he is shown to be a good person deep down and sticks closely to his friends. Like Mordecai, Rigby loves to play video games, but he is the worse of the two. He is also shown to be the weakest of The Park workers, although he has surprised them on a few occasions. Rigby's lack of strength was a major plot point in the episode \"One Pull Up\", in which Rigby had to pass a company physical and keep his job by performing one pull up. He has a younger brother named \"Don\", whose height and physique lead people to believe that he, not Rigby, is the older brother. Eileen Roberts, a female [[Mole (animal)|mole]] who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret Smith, has strong feelings for Rigby and makes this very obvious. He originally did not reciprocate her feelings and harshly ignored her at some points, but he quickly begins to warm up to her and implies that he likes her, as well. In \"Dumped at the Altar\", Rigby reveals to Mordecai that he and Eileen have been dating for 3 months. Rigby is allergic to eggs, as evidenced in the episode \"Eggscellent\" when Rigby tried to eat a 12-egg omelet to win a trucker hat and went into a coma due to a severe allergic reaction. Rigby has also died four times and was resurrected in the series. He was killed by Skips in an arm wrestling match, he was killed by Snowballs the Ice Monster, he was killed by Mordecai who pushed him into the Space-Time Continuum, and fell into a fatal coma in \"Eggscellent\". As of ''Rigby's Graduation Day Special'', Rigby has finally graduated from high school. In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Rigby quits The Park and moves in with Eileen. They eventually get married and start a family, but it's unknown if Rigby is working or not as he is seen teaching his children how to play video games.<ref name=\"Main\" /> It is hinted at in the episode \"'Ello Gov'nor\" that Rigby's last name may be Riggerson, however, this has neither been confirmed nor denied by J.G.

He is frequently infuriated with Mordecai and Rigby due to their constant slacking and mischief. He is very hot-tempered and prone to fits of rage, and bossy often turning red (or pink if injured) whenever he yells or is extremely angry, his [[catchphrase]]s are \"You're fired!\", \"_____ or you're fired!\", or even \"Get back to work!\". At the end of some episodes, Benson tries to fire the duo (sometimes along with their coworkers or only one of them), but they always manage to find a way to keep their jobs with some help from other characters. Even so, they may instead have to face consequences whether it is their fault or not. Despite always being at odds with them, Benson is kind-natured at heart and is ultimately friends with the duo after calming down a bit in the episode \"Benson Be Gone\" and the three gain more insight and trust with each other as the series progresses. In the episode \"Think Positive\", it is revealed that Benson's family members often yelled at each other when he was a child. His father instructed him that he would not get anything in his life if he did not yell for it. If Benson ever contained his anger for too long, the anger inside him will cause havoc and destruction unless he expresses his anger by yelling (often at Mordecai and Rigby). It has been implied that Benson was unhappy during his youth and did not enjoy his family's anger. He is skilled at [[Table hockey games|stick hockey]] and has a strong love for music, proving to be an extremely skilled drummer in the episode \"150 Piece Kit\". Benson used to date Audrey, a human woman who lives across from him in his apartment complex. It is revealed that they broke up in \"The Real Thomas\", in which Benson starts to date an undercover Russian spy named Natalia, although she is later eaten by a whale. In the episode \"Pam I Am \", Benson develops feelings for one of the dome scientists named Pam and they go on a 'date'. However, Dr. Langer witnesses the 'date' and makes a new rule that forbids the dome staff from dating anyone who works at the park. At the end of the episode, it is implied that Benson and Pam will date once the dome is gone. During the beginning of the episode \"Fries Night\", Benson contacts Pam back on earth, to which she revealed that having a \"long distance\" relationship with Benson because he is now in space is too difficult for her. She states that the reason for the break up is that she doesn't know when or if he will ever return to earth again. They both agree to become friends even though Benson later gets depressed from yet another break up with a woman he really cared for. In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Benson remains working as the manager of The Park and gets back together with Pam. They apparently adopt Apple Sauce as well as a variety of cats.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== \"Pops\" Maellard===\n{{Infobox character\n|name = Pops\n|image = \n|gender = Lollipop/male \n|first_major = The Naive Man from Lolliland (2005)\n|last_major = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n|creator = J.G.

His adoptive father, Mr. Maellard, is the owner of The Park. Pops tends to be very ecstatic about everything, often exclaiming \"Good show!\" or \"Jolly good show!\" when he is happy about something. When something bad happens, he will instead say \"Bad show.\" He tends to dress and act like hes in the early 1900s and using earlier technology and slang. He carries small [[butterscotch]] lollipops in his wallet, sincerely believing that they are real money, much to everyone's confusion. He is an upright gentleman who is very kind and well-mannered to everyone. He is also very sensitive, often becoming upset or crying if his feelings are hurt. He has strong interests in poetry, wrestling, music, nature, animals, and games. Despite being an elderly man, he is very childish and is often oblivious to serious things around him. Because of this, the group is frequently looking after him, especially Benson. Pops has also been shown to have immense strength on several occasions, despite his slim build. In the episode \"Prank Callers\", it is shown that Pops was once a more serious and mature man back in the 1980s. However, when Mordecai and Rigby had been sent back to that time and accidentally hit him with a golf cart, he is shown to have turned into his zany self. Pops once owned a British doll named Percival, or Percy, who turned his back on him and tried to kill Pops in \"Terror Tales of the Park\". Pops is also one with nature, but lost it until he tries to find the answer to get it back, as shown in \"Catching the Wave\". In Season 8, Pops is revealed to be the universe's Chosen One due to being born with telekinetic abilities and ever since he is one with nature back in some previous season's episode, as well as having an evil version of himself with the ability to erase a person from existence. Pops' destiny is to kill Malum Kranus to prevent the destruction of the universe. In \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", it is revealed that his real name is Mega Kranus. Pops also realizes that the best way to defeat Malum Kranus is with kindness. Pops gives Malum Kranus a hug and the two fly into the sun, killing them both in the process, and the universe is saved. In Heaven, Pops' is heard saying his catchphrase 'Jolly Good Show' as a video tape of the show, and the show itself, ends.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Skips===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Skips\n| voice              = [[Mark Hamill]]\n| first_major        = Pilot (2009)\n| last_major         = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n| creator            = J.G.

He is the strongest and smartest of The Park workers and they almost always turn to him for help, as he usually knows how to solve the chaotic problems that arise, however, he isn't always right. Whenever he is asked for help, he generally says, \"I've seen this before\", and then presents a solution. As his name suggests, he is always skipping rather than walking, except when he is angered, in which he runs instead. He is a diligent worker and is very skilled at his job; however, he suffers from a lack of knowledge of computers and other kinds of newer technology, which was seen in the episode \"Skips vs. Technology\" where Rigby and Mordecai jam a printer and crash the computer  whilst printing a card for Skips thanking him for his efforts to save them for being fired from Benson for their antics. Aside from this, he is very experienced and knowledgeable, as he is [[immortality|immortal]] and has been alive for hundreds of years. In the episode \"Free Cake\", it is revealed that he must perform a [[ceremonial dance]] every year on his birthday in order to renew his immortality. He explains the story of how he received his immortality in the episode \"Skips' Story.\" He chose to become immortal in order to fight Klorgbane, an immortal bully who inadvertently caused the death of his girlfriend, Mona, the only woman that Skips had ever loved during a fistfight. The Guardians of Eternal Youth provided Skips with his immortality, knowing that he was the only one capable of defeating Klorgbane with the Fists of Justice. Skips' birth name was Walks, but he changed it to Skips when he received his immortality because he and Mona would always skip when they were together. This is also the reason why he always skips instead of walking; he chose to do this in order to remember the times he and Mona shared for all his life. Skips is also a skilled bassist, which is demonstrated in several episodes. In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", Skips remains working at The Park while having a new part-time job as a mechanic, satisfied with his life.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Muscle Man/Mitch Sorenstein===\n{{Infobox character\n|name = Muscle Man\n|image =\n|voice = [[Sam Marin]]\n|first_major = Pilot (2009)\n|last_major = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n|creator = J.G.

He is very erratic and immature, often pulling pranks and joking around. He enjoys telling \"My mom!\" jokes, botched attempts at \"[[Yo Mama|Yo mama]]\" jokes, much to the annoyance of everyone except Hi-Five Ghost, his best friend. Although he can be rude due to his ego, he is ultimately shown to be polite and caring toward his friends. He and Fives were fired in the episodes \"Don\" and \"Under the Hood\" but were rehired at the end. At times, he can burst out on a rampage if he is greatly angered. His father, Muscle Dad, enjoyed the same attitude for pranks and jokes, but died in the episode \"Trucker Hall of Fame\". His older brother, Muscle Bro (real name John), is also seen throughout the series. Muscle Man originally shared a rivalry with Mordecai and Rigby throughout the first two seasons, but the three began to get along and treat each other as friends from the third season onward. His girlfriend, Starla, shares a similar appearance to him and the couple constantly disgust other people when they publicly kiss and show affection to each other. His real name was revealed to be Mitch Sorenstein in the episode \"Muscle Woman\". In \"Power Tower\", it is revealed that he gained the nickname \"Muscle Man\" from his early years of bodybuilding and actually being in excellent physical condition, but he found that life very boring and gave it up. In \"The End of Muscle Man\", he proposes to Starla and the two become engaged and they are now married in \"Dumped at the Altar\". In the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", upon returning home Muscle Man discovers he has a three-year-old daughter.

Because of his name and appearance, he is frequently called by his nickname, \"High Fives\", and sometimes simply as \"Fives\". Hi-Five Ghost rarely speaks throughout the first three seasons of the series, but he is given more dialogue from season four onward. His father was introduced in the episode \"See You There\", as well as his older brother, Low-Five Ghost, who works as a police officer. In the episode \"The Postcard\", Hi-Five Ghost reunited with a human girl named Celia whom he had befriended at a cafe after waiting four years to receive a postcard from her.

(Ministry of Meadow Management), a KGB agency that struggled to find out what made American parks up to date and wealthy. In order to fix Russia's outdated parks, M.O.M.M. sent out Nikolai on a covert operation to obtain the park and bring it back to Russia. During his undercover mission, he changed his identity to \"Thomas\" and presented himself as an intern for credits in college in \"Exit 9B\" (in which he made his debut), working as an unpaid intern who calls his \"mom\" on a regular basis and is often reproved by his coworkers, most notably by Muscle Man. He is usually reluctant to be involved in the surreal and chaotic adventures that arise in The Park, often asking if he has to be part of the situation, to which they insist that he must. There are times when Nikolai becomes personally invested in maintaining his cover, such as using a robot to pose as his \"mom\" in \"The Thanksgiving Special\", and wearing spy attire disguised as a Halloween costume (a slice of pizza, which he had to wear until Thanksgiving Day upon losing a bet in \"Terror Tales of the Park III\").  When the other Russian spies that were deployed with him carry out the final phase of the plan to bring The Park to Russia in \"The Real Thomas\", he finally reveals his true identity to the park crew and explains why he is really there. When Nikolai learns the plan is really to destroy the Park through a loophole in Russian/American relations, he turns on his fellow spies for being lied to (along with some persuasion by the park crew to remind him of the good times they had as friends, despite the constant poor treatment he received from them for being an intern), and returns the Park to American soil before going on the run from both sides. He makes several cameos after this, usually in some sort of disguise. Eventually, he returns in \"Guys Night 2\", revealing himself to be tired of his old life as a spy and wanting to move on to a new life. He feels his only option is to go into hiding forever, but first he enjoys one final hang with the park crew. He made non-speaking cameos in later episodes. In \u201cRigby\u2019s Graduation Special\u201d, he makes a brief cameo by proposing a toast to the park dome taking off into space while in his submarine.\n\n===Margaret===\n{{Infobox character\n|name = Margaret\n|image =\n|gender = Female\n|species = [[American robin|Red Robin]]\n|first_major = Caffeinated Concert Tickets (2010)\n|last_major = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n|creator = J.G.

She was good friends with her co-worker, Eileen. Mordecai had a huge crush on Margaret and frequently found excuses to go to the coffee shop to see her. She has a cousin named John who has an artificial wooden leg. The rest of her family are all birds like her and Mordecai, except for her father Frank, a strong and stern human. Margaret returns Mordecai's feelings for her and the two begin to finally date in the fourth season. They broke up in the season finale when Margaret leaves for college. In the episode \"Eileen Flat Screen\", Margaret returns now as a news reporter, which no one notices. In \"Merry Christmas Mordecai\", Mordecai becomes nervous when he hears that Margaret will be there. After several awkward encounters (thanks to Mordecai), they finally manage to have a normal conversation with both acknowledging that they had some good times. This leads to a montage of memories, ending with a memory of a kiss on a roller coaster. Unfortunately, when the scene flashes to the present, they accidentally kiss on the lips and are shocked when they notice CJ watching them. CJ runs out of the house and leaves while Mordecai runs upstairs to find his phone; he notices that all of Margaret's stuff is there and Eileen tells him she is staying as an intern. Mordecai is frantic when he hears the news and didn't know what to say about Margaret staying with Eileen from now on.\n\nAs of \"Sad Sax\", Mordecai and Margaret are still just friends, and Mordecai makes it up to CJ by telling her the truth.\n\nIn \"1000th Chopper Flight Party\", Mordecai is still awkward with her presence and afraid to screw up, even to the point of letting Rigby constantly mess up the Party as a diversion just to keep her away from him. When he finally is declared as the lucky guest to ride Chopper 6 for its 1000th flight, he finds it hard to say no and joins. Margaret tries to talk to him, but Mordecai awkwardly resists until she scolds him for his attitude in desire for their friendship. Mordecai then lifts the tension with a joke and they finally start to have a fun chat. This however angers CJ, who misinterprets it as them rekindling their love, and she causes havoc with her storm cloud ability. Mordecai tries to save Margaret, but she calms CJ when she reveals that she is in a relationship with news anchor, Del Hanlon, which stuns Mordecai and surprises her parents.\n\nIn \"Not Great Double Date\", Mordecai seemed upset that Margaret had a boyfriend, but still said that she seemed happy with Del and that he liked him. When she confessed that Del was not her boyfriend and that she was tired of feeling like a tourist around her friends because of the tension with CJ, he felt sad about it and was pretty interested to know that she still had feelings for him.\n\nIn \"Just Friends\", Rigby and Eileen go to the presentation of martial arts Don, leading to Mordecai and Margaret spending a night that has romantic moments. A chef named Daisuke shows them their future using magical sauce. It is revealed that if, and when, Mordecai and Margaret get together, they will get married, have children, buy their own houseboat, and die peacefully after 50 happy years. Mordecai and Margaret agree that their future looks like it will be really great, but that they are still young and should take it easy on relationships. At the end of the episode, the two agree to remain just friends, with future Margaret looking down on them and inquiring how long they can be just friends, and future Mordecai stating that \"only time will tell.\"\n\nIn \"Rigby's Graduation Special\", she was very worried as she watched Mordecai and cried as the other park workers being shot into space, even saying his name in concern. However, in the epilogue to \"A Regular Epic Final Battle\", she is only seen greeting Eileen when she returns. She does not end up with Mordecai and is not seen with the group 25 years later, though she becomes a muse for Mordecai's art.\n\nHead writer Matt Price stated on [[Reddit]] that the idea was that Mordecai and Margaret would find their own paths in life <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/regularshow/comments/5oszo6/we_are_matt_price_head_writer_and_calvin_wong/dclu2vj}}</ref> On [[Tumblr]] writer Owen Dennis stated that reality shows that many people who initially date one another end up with other people, contradicting narrative arcs of many Western entertainment media.<ref name=OwenDennisrelationshipinfo/>\n\n===Eileen===\n{{Infobox character\n| name               = Eileen\n| image              = \n| gender             = Female\n| species            = Mole\n| first_major        = Brain Eraser (2011)\n| last_major         = A Regular Epic Final Battle (2017)\n| creator            = Minty Lewis\n| voice              = Minty Lewis\n| full_name          = Eileen Roberts\n| occupation         = Barista\n| family             = Unnamed Father\n| spouse             = [[#Rigby|Rigby]] (Husband)\n| children           = Two Unnamed Daughters <br/> Unnamed Son\n| affiliation        = Dome Subjects\n}}\n{{Anchor|Eileen Roberts}} Eileen Roberts (voiced by Minty Lewis, a writer/storyboard artist for the series) is a shy and timid mole who works at a local coffee shop, previously alongside Margaret.

She first appeared in the episode \"Brain Eraser.\" She also appears in the episode \"Do Me a Solid\", in which Rigby learns of Eileen's crush on him (even though Rigby shows no interest in Eileen), though he goes along with it for a while. Since the episode \"Camping Can Be Cool\", Rigby has warmed up to Eileen. Rigby thought very highly of her and praised her actions throughout the episode. In the episode \"Diary\", Rigby admits that he finds Eileen to be attractive when she is not wearing her glasses, but it also reveals that she also can't see without them. In the episode \"One Pull Up\", Eileen helps Rigby train for his company physical and he shows his gratitude by hugging her (and crushing her due to his enlarged physique). In the episode \"Eileen Flat Screen\", it is revealed that Eileen and Rigby have been spending more time together. In \"Dumped at the Altar\", Rigby tells Mordecai that he and Eileen have been dating for three months. In \"Rigby's Graduation Day Special\", Eileen finally graduates from college at the same time Rigby finally gets his high school diploma. As she is cooking for a graduation party for her and Rigby when the guys press the button that sends them and the park into space, Eileen is stuck with the guys.

When Mordecai broke up with her, she became extremely angry, destroying everything in her path, including a helicopter. She got back together with Muscle Man after he expressed his feelings towards her at the end of the episode. Since then, Starla has appeared with Muscle Man in various episodes, including \"Fancy Restaurant\", \"Pie Contest\" and \"Bald Spot\".

He purposely mistakes Benson's name a lot in some of the episodes in which he appears (using \"Ballbucket\", \"Beanbag\", etc.). Maellard finally got Benson's name right (and started to respect him more as well) in the episode \"Benson Be Gone\" due to Benson's coming to his rescue when he was captured by Susan (a woman whom Mr. Maellard had hired as the park manager after demoting Benson and is later revealed to be a demon) and also gave Benson his old job back.

He was the most sophisticated doll of his day, with 250 phrases stored inside. Yet the only real phrases we heard him say had to do with an obsessive desire to draw on peoples' faces. Percy not only spoke of his obsession, but it was discovered that he was also an autonomous, \"living doll\" who actually carried out his intentions and threats of drawing on peoples' faces. He drew on Pops's face after Pops tried to throw him away, and when Pops tried playing teatime with him after Mordecai and Rigby threw him away, Percy became aggressive and wanted to draw on Pops's face even more.

He lives inside of a large, supposedly haunted mansion, which was egged by Rigby due to him turning off the light and not responding when being asked by Rigby to give him candy. This led him to seek revenge on Rigby. He later lurked around Pops's House and used his dark magic to turn Rigby into a nice-looking house. Later that night when it was dark, Muscle Man was on the porch and then saw him driving his car to the front of the house and comes out invisible. Muscle Man tells him to change Rigby back and to get out of there, as well as loading his shotgun telling him not to ask twice. The Halloween Wizard then teases him and asks Muscle Man if he has any clever jokes about his mom, Muscle Man tells him not to talk about his mom so he starts firing in random directions, to no avail. Everyone else watches him shooting the gun but Muscle Man gets knocked over. The wizard then drags him across the grass, yelling and holding his gun up in the air while being dragged and fires the gun a few more times before he goes into the woods. Mordecai, shocked, asks if they saw that. Then there is a knocking on the door, which opens and reveals Muscle Man, who has had his skin ripped off, showing only muscle (inferring that the Wizard had skinned him). Muscle Man says, \"I told you I was ripped\", then falls over and dies after that and scares the others then the phone rings. Hi-Five Ghost goes to answer it, after Skips tells him not to, and answers the phone saying, \"Hello?\". The wizard then says \"Good-bye!\" and sucks him into the phone and turns him into liquid that squirts onto Mordecai and Skips. Mordecai is then knocked unconscious when the wizard throws him against the bookshelf. Benson and Pops see this and they both scream and run into different rooms. Then the wizard breaks Skips' crossbow and the wizard throws Skips into the chimney and burns him. Then he goes to the bathroom and pulls back the curtains for the shower and finds Benson and says, \"What's up Gumball?\". Benson then screams and gets flushed down the toilet. Then, Pops is on the bed terrified and the wizard comes in and Pops fires a rock at the wizard with his slingshot but misses and the wizard picks him up, drags him on the ceiling, and puts him in the closet which falls over, then disappears. Rigby is scared and asks if anyone was there. Mordecai then wakes up and tells him that he won't let anything happen to him, but the wizard decapitates him. Then, Rigby finds out that Mordecai has died and he says sorry to the wizard. Then the wizard comes and gives Rigby his punishment by throwing eggs at him. Then Rigby becomes angry because the wizard turned him into a house and killed everyone so he can egg him. The wizard then drowns him in a giant raw egg. It is then revealed that it was just a story that Rigby told. Muscle Man then makes fun of his story saying that it was weak and that his story about wrecking cars in a pit was way better.

The reporter then goes on to say due to a clearing error, the bed was shipped out to stores, and now the company is reclaiming the KILL\u00dcRGEN beds back. Rigby then says that he feels sorry for \"the loser who brought that bed\", but after finding out his new bed was made by the same company, he claims he's also \"one of those losers\". Eventually, the news reporter receives the code for the bed that contains the murderer. He then reads the code out saying: \"If you have this bed code number you are sleeping on a murderer, 623570406 the last number is smudged he grabs his glasses and says it is an 8\".

More so than most others who are considered ahead of their time, since he acted and spoke like it was the 1980s. Since he behaved and talked oddly, the townsfolk thought that he was a wizard, and tried to murder him. Before they could, he put his soul into the house and exclaimed he would show them all and return in 200 years when everyone talked and acted like him, and he would be king of the world. When he realized everyone in his time would be long dead by then, he vowed to come back in the form of a murderous poltergeist to haunt and kill whomever is inside of the house, but before doing so, he signed his house over to Mr. Maellard. Unfortunately for Townhouse, his predicted time of return bypassed the eighties, when he would have been in style. Meaning now, instead of being far too ahead of his time, his mannerisms were considered old fashioned and out of touch. 200 years later on Halloween night, Benson told his fellow park workers the story of Jebediah as well as a scary story about him, which involved Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost trying to escape from him after taking on a dare to survive the whole night in the house but are one by one killed, afterwards proceeding to tell them that he was indeed a real person.

Before the park crew could vote him guilty, Pops decided to use the restroom first, which gave him the idea to ask the judge if he can use the restroom too, which the judge allowed him to do unsupervised. When inside the restroom, he first asked Pops for some toilet paper. He then turns into a werewolf and attacked him and then bit Pops to turn him into a werewolf so he can take his place.

After Pops escapes to the airport as a werewolf and boards a plane to London, he runs into Wolfhard again. He apologizes to Pops for mauling and Pops is willing to let it go.

When he tries to use the catapult to escape, he's too heavy to be launched further and he ends up crashing a few feet from the catapult. While the park staff laughs at his misfortune, Racki laughs at Benson because now he can't get his $500 security deposit back, result in Benson screaming \"No!\". It turns out that the entire episode was a vision for Benson who is at a Halloween store and he asked Racki on wishing to throw the best Halloween party ever. When the Halloween store worker asked how he likes it, Benson said it's terrible and he refuses to rent Racki if he can't get his security deposit back so he went to the streamer store instead.

They go at each other with amazing bank shots, until Cash fails one. Rigby makes another shot, and wins the triple-or-nothing bet. That meant Cash had to pay for his own bill, and Rigby asked for his hat back. Cash said he won the hat fair and square on the side deal. Then, the God of Basketball appeared and told Rigby his double or nothing bet was still in play. It's revealed that Rigby's ball continued to bank after going out the window.

We prefer references that actually have specifications for the phone.  Specifically, we need to know the display resolution to know that the phone belongs in one of these tables. -->The following is a '''comparison of [[High-definition video|high-definition]] [[smartphone]] [[display device|displays]]''', containing information about their specific screen technology, resolution, size and pixel density. It is divided into three categories, containing smartphones with [[720p]], [[1080p]] and [[1440p]] displays.  \n\nThe \"p-display\" nomenclature used in this article refers to the number of pixels displayed across the '''width''' of a given phone's screen.  Earlier phones with lower than 720p (lower than HD ready resolution) are not included in this listing.
