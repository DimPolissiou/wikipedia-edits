Anthropologists have named various cultural regions, with fluid boundaries, that are generally agreed upon with some variation. These cultural regions are broadly based upon the locations of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]] from early European and African contact beginning in the late 15th century. When indigenous peoples have been [[Indian removal|forcibly removed]] by nation-states, they retain their original geographic classification. Some groups span multiple cultural regions.\n\n== Canada, Greenland, United States, and northern Mexico ==\nIn the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], [[Ethnography|ethnographers]] commonly classify [[indigenous peoples]] into ten geographical regions with shared [[culture|cultural]] traits, called cultural areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |title=Culture Areas Index |work=the Canadian Museum of Civilization |access-date=2009-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104204827/http://www.civilization.ca/cmc/exhibitions/tresors/ethno/etb0170e.shtml |archive-date=2013-11-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Greenland]] is part of the [[Arctic region]].

These SNPs mark the branch of a haplogroup, and indicate that all descendants of that haplogroup at one time shared a common ancestor. The Y-DNA SNP mutations were passed from father to son over thousands of years. Over time, additional SNPs occur within a haplogroup, leading to new lineages.  These new lineages are considered subclades of the haplogroup.  Each time a new mutation occurs, there is a new branch in the haplogroup, and therefore a new subclade.

These SNPs mark the branch of a haplogroup, and indicate that all descendants of that haplogroup at one time shared a common ancestor. The Y-DNA SNP mutations were passed from father to son over thousands of years. Over time, additional SNPs occur within a haplogroup, leading to new lineages.  These new lineages are considered subclades of the haplogroup.  Each time a new mutation occurs, there is a new branch in the haplogroup, and therefore a new subclade.

thousands of years.\n[[Indigenous peoples in Peru|Amerindians]] inhabited the land for over ten millennia before the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century; their cultures and influence represent the foundation of today's Peru.\n\nAs a result of European contact and conquest, the population of the area now known as Peru decreased from an estimated 9 million in the 1520s to around {{val|600000}} in 1620.<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520\u20131620'', p. 114.</ref> This happened mostly because of the unintended spread of germs and infectious diseases. In fact, the spread of [[smallpox]] greatly weakened the Inca empire, even before the Spanish arrival. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] did not have as much natural immunity to the disease as did the Europeans who had been exposed to smallpox for roughly two centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html|title=Guns Germs & Steel: Variables. Smallpox - PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref> For this reason, several Amerindian populations were decimated. Furthermore, the disease killed Inca ruler Wayna Capac, triggering a civil war in the Inca empire that preceded the conquest efforts the Spaniards. Thus, the conquest was facilitated by the weakness of the Inca empire which was recovering from both a civil war and epidemics of unknown diseases.\n[[File:AIenvaluacion.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Peruvian girls]]\nHowever, other reasons for the decrease of Amerindian population include violence during the conquest followed by the breakdown of the Inca social system and famine. The Amerindian population suffered further decrease as the Spanish exploited an Inca communal labor system called [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] for mining purposes, thus killing thousands in forced labor.\n\n[[Spaniards]] arrived in large numbers under colonial rule. After the independence, there has been a gradual [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigration from Austria, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy, Croatia and Spain.<ref>Mario V\u00e1zquez, \"Immigration and mestizaje in nineteenth-century Peru\", pp. 79\u201381.</ref> <ref> http://www.peruviantimes.com/19/scottish-independence-an-historical-view-and-a-peruvian-perspective/22915/ </ref> Polynesians also came to the country lured to work in the Guano islands during the boom years of this commodity around the 1860s. [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] arrived in the 1850s as a replacement for slave workers in the sugar plantations of the north coast and have since become a major influence in Peruvian society.<ref>Magnus M\u00f6rner, ''Race mixture in the history of Latin America'', p. 131.</ref> Other immigrant groups include [[Arabs]], [[South Asians]], Japanese and [[United States|Americans]] from the United States and Colombia (75,000).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n'''[[Mestizos]]''' compose about 60%<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> of the total population. The term traditionally denotes Amerindian (mostly [[Quechua people|Quechua]] ancestry) and European ancestry (mostly [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] ancestry). This term, was part of the caste classification during colonial times, whereby people of exclusive Spanish descent but born in the colonies were called criollos, people of mixed Amerindian and Spanish descent were called mestizos, those of African and Spanish descent were called mulatos and those of Amerindian and African descent were called Zambos. Nowadays, these terms have racist connotations.\n\nMost Peruvian mestizos are of Amerindian and European descent, but other ethnic backgrounds (such as Asian, Middle Eastern and African) are also present, in varying degrees, in some segments of the mestizo population. Most mestizos are urban dwellers and show stronger European inheritance in regions like [[Lima Region]], [[La Libertad Region]], [[Callao Region]], [[San Mart\u00edn Region]], [[Cajamarca Region]], [[Piura Region]], [[Amazonas Region]], [[Lambayeque Region]], and [[Arequipa Region]].\n\n'''[[Amerindians]]''' constitute around 26%<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> of the total population. The two major [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] or ethnic groups are the [[Quechuas]] (belonging to various cultural subgroups), followed by the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, mostly found in the extreme southern Andes. A large proportion of the indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and have vibrant cultural traditions, some of which were part of the [[Inca Empire]]. Dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the [[Andes Mountains]] in the [[Amazon basin]]. This region is rapidly becoming urbanized. Important urban centers include [[Iquitos]], [[Nauta]], [[Puerto Maldonado]], [[Pucallpa]] and [[Yurimaguas]]. This region is home to numerous [[indigenous people]]s, though they do not constitute a large proportion of the total population. Examples of indigenous peoples residing in eastern Peru include the [[Shipibo]], [[Urarina]],<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> [[Kokama people|Cocama]], and [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]], to name just a few.\n\n'''[[White Peruvians|European]]''' descendants constitute around 6%<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> of the total population. They are descendants of the Spanish colonizers and other Europeans such as [[German Peruvian|Germans]], [[Italian Peruvians|Italians]], [[British Peruvians|British]], [[French Peruvians|French]], and [[Croatian Peruvian|Croatians]] (see also [[Croats]]) who arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries. The majority of them live also in the largest cities (like mestizos), usually in the North and Center of Peru: [[Lima]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]], [[Piura]], and through all the highlands of [[North macroregion, Peru|Northwest]], like [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]], [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]] and [[San Mart\u00edn Region|San Martin]]. The only southern city with a significant white population is [[Arequipa]]. Recently, Peru has seen a migration of American retirees and businessmen come to settle in the country, due to lower cost of living and economic booms in the 1990s and 2000s, though Peru experiences busts in between. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[File:Chinatown Lima Peru.jpg|thumb|right|Chinatown in Lima]]\n\nThere is also the presence of [[Asian Peruvian]]s, primarily [[Chinese Peruvian|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Peruvian|Japanese]], that constitutes 4% of the population, which in proportion to the overall population.<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> Peru has the second largest population of people of Japanese descent in Latin America after [[Brazil]] and the largest population of Chinese descent in Latin America. Historic communities inhabited by people of Chinese descent are found throughout the Peruvian [[upper Amazon]], including cities such as [[Yurimaguas]], [[Nauta]], [[Iquitos]] and the north central coast (Lambayeque and Trujillo). In contrast to the Japanese community in Peru, the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] appear to have intermarried much more since they came to work in the [[rice fields]] during the Viceroyalty and to replace the [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, during the abolition of slavery itself. Despite the presence of Peruvians of Asian heritage being quite recent, in the past decade they have made significant advancements in business and political fields; a past president ([[Alberto Fujimori]]), several past cabinet members, and one member of the Peruvian congress are of Japanese or Chinese origin. Small numbers of [[Arab diaspora|Arab]] Peruvians, mostly of Lebanese and Syrian origin, and [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinians]] also reside, as well a small [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Hindustani]] and [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] community. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe remaining is constituted by '''[[Afro-Peruvian]]s,''' a legacy of Peru's history as an importer of slaves during the colonial period. Today also [[mulatto]]s (mixed African and European) and [[zambos]] (mixed African and Amerindian) constitute an important part of the population as well, especially in [[Piura]], [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]], [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]], Lima and [[Ica region|Ica]] regions. The Afro-Peruvian population is concentrated mostly in coastal cities south of Lima, such as that of those found in the Ica Region, in cities like [[Ca\u00f1ete Province|Ca\u00f1ete]], [[Chincha Alta District|Chincha]], [[Ica (city)|Ica]], [[Nazca]] and [[Acar\u00ed]] in the border with the [[Arequipa Region]]. Another large but poorly promoted segment of Afro-Peruvian presence is in the ''Yunga'' regions (west and just below the Andean chain of northern Peru), (i.e., [[Piura]] and [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]]), where sugarcane, lemon, and mango production are still of importance. Important communities are found all over the [[Morrop\u00f3n Province]], such as in the city of [[Chulucanas]]. One of them is [[Yapatera]], a community in the same city, as well as smaller farming communities like [[Pabur]] or [[La Matanza District|La Matanza]] and even in the mountainous region near [[Canchaque]]. Further south, the colonial city of [[Za\u00f1a]] or farming towns like [[Help:Disambiguation|Capote]] and [[Tuman River|Tuman]] in [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]] are also important regions with Afro-Peruvian presence.\n\nSocioeconomic and cultural indicators are increasingly important as identifiers. For example, Peruvians of Amerindian descent who have adopted aspects of Hispanic culture also are beginning to consider themselves \"[[mestizo]]\". With economic development, access to education, intermarriage, and large-scale migration from rural to urban areas, a more homogeneous national culture''' is developing, mainly along the relatively more prosperous coast. \n\nMost of Peru's population (about 50% percent) lives in the ''Costa'' (coastal area), while 36% live in the [[Geography of Peru#Andean Mountain Ranges|Sierra]] (the Andes) and only 12% in the [[Selva]] or [[Amazon rain forest]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Almost one-third of the nation's population lives in the [[Lima and Callao Metropolitan Area]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Lima is home to over 8 million Peruvians, one of South America's largest urban areas, it includes the neighboring community of [[Callao, Peru|Callao]] that has grown fast and expanded since the 1960s.\n\n== Language ==\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages of Per\u00fa <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Per\u00fa: Perfil Sociodemogr\u00e1fico |page = 197 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica e Inform\u00e1tica}}</ref> \n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Languages\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|Blue|82.6}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechua language|Quechua]] |Orange|13.9}}\n{{bar percent|[[Aymara language|Aymara]]|Yellow|1.7}}\n{{bar percent|Other indigenous language|Blue|0.8}}\n}}\n\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n{{main|Languages of Peru}}\n[[File:MANTEQUILLA and ROY MASON 236x272.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peruvian Paso]]]]\nAccording to the [[Peruvian Constitution]] of 1993, Peru's official languages are Spanish and, Amerindian languages such as Quechua, Aymara and other such indigenous languages in areas where they predominate. Today, Spanish is spoken by some 83.9% of the population.  Spanish is used by the government and the media and in education and commerce. Amerindians who live in the Andean highlands speak Quechua and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and are ethnically distinct from the diverse indigenous groups who live on the eastern side of the Andes and in the tropical lowlands adjacent to the Amazon basin.\n\nPeru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a socioeconomic divide between the coast's mestizo-Hispanic culture and the more diverse, traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional customs, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the mestizo-Hispanic culture.\n[[File:Baby got Back.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Amerindian woman with child]]\n\nAccording to official sources, the use of Spanish has increased while the knowledge and use of indigenous languages have decreased considerably during the last four decades (1960\u20132000). At the beginning of the 1960s some 39% of the total Peruvian population were registered as speakers of indigenous languages, but by the 1990s the figures show a considerable decline in the use of Quechua, Aymara and other indigenous languages, when only 28% is registered as Quechua-speaking (16% of whom are reported to be bilingual in Spanish) and Spanish-speakers increased to 72%.\n\nFor 2017, government figures place Spanish as being spoken by 82.6% of the population, but among Amerindian languages, another decrease is registered. Of the indigenous languages, Quechua remains the most spoken, and even today is used by some 13.9% of the total Peruvian population or a third of Peru's total indigenous population. The number of Aymara-speakers and other indigenous languages is placed at 2.5%, and foreign languages 0.2%.\n\nThe drastic decline in use and knowledge of indigenous languages is largely attributed to the recent demographic factors. The urbanization and assimilation of Peru's Amerindian plurality into the Hispanic-mestizo culture, as well as the new socioeconomic factors associated with class structure, have given privilege to the use of Spanish at the expense of the Amerindian languages which were spoken by the majority of the population less than a century ago.\n\nThe major obstacle to a more widespread use of the Quechua language is the fact that multiple dialects of this language exist. Quechua, along with Aymara and the minor indigenous languages, was originally and remains essentially an oral language. Therefore, there is a lack of modern media which use it: for example books, newspapers, software, magazines, technical journals, etc. However, non-governmental organizations, as well as state sponsored groups, are involved in projects to edit and translate major works into the Quechua language; for instance, in late 2005 a version of [[Don Quixote]] was presented in Quechua. There has also been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken.\n\nThe percentage of native speakers of Quechua who are illiterate has been decreasing lately<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3tAqIU0dPsC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=Peru+Quechua+literacy+rate&source=bl&ots=M9oWEVd0Li&sig=EjUEmGRk54AqG_oREbYLh8Ck2Uk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz_on7vqvZAhVR2GMKHQPRCbwQ6AEIZjAG#v=onepage&q=Peru%20Quechua%20literacy%20rate&f=false|title=One Thousand Languages: Living, Endangered, and Lost|last=Austin|first=Peter|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520255609|location=|pages=202|language=en}}</ref>, as 86.87% of the Peruvian population is literate.

The system is highly centralized, with the Ministry of Education appointing all public school teachers. Although 83% of Peru's students attend public schools at all levels, over 15% percent (usually the upper-classes and upper middle-class) attend private.\n\nSchool enrollment has been rising sharply for years, due to a widening educational effort by the government and a growing school-age population. The [[illiteracy]] (2008) rate is estimated at 7.1% (10.6% for women), 19.0% in rural areas and 3.7% in urban areas [http://www.andina.com.pe/Espanol/Noticia.aspx?id=NiBnWpBzahw=].\n[[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is mostly an oral language, so in some cases, in rural areas, people do not speak Spanish and therefore do not know how to read or write.

thousands of years.\n[[Indigenous peoples in Peru|Amerindians]] inhabited the land for over ten millennia before the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]] in the 16th century; their cultures and influence represent the foundation of today's Peru.\n\nAs a result of European contact and conquest, the population of the area now known as Peru decreased from an estimated 9 million in the 1520s to around {{val|600000}} in 1620.<ref>Noble David Cook, ''Demographic collapse: Indian Peru, 1520\u20131620'', p. 114.</ref> This happened mostly because of the unintended spread of germs and infectious diseases. In fact, the spread of [[smallpox]] greatly weakened the Inca empire, even before the Spanish arrival. The [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]] did not have as much natural immunity to the disease as did the Europeans who had been exposed to smallpox for roughly two centuries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html|title=Guns Germs & Steel: Variables. Smallpox - PBS|website=Pbs.org|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref> For this reason, several Amerindian populations were decimated. Furthermore, the disease killed Inca ruler Wayna Capac, triggering a civil war in the Inca empire that preceded the conquest efforts the Spaniards. Thus, the conquest was facilitated by the weakness of the Inca empire which was recovering from both a civil war and epidemics of unknown diseases.\n[[File:AIenvaluacion.jpg|thumb|300 px|right|Peruvian girls]]\nHowever, other reasons for the decrease of Amerindian population include violence during the conquest followed by the breakdown of the Inca social system and famine. The Amerindian population suffered further decrease as the Spanish exploited an Inca communal labor system called [[Mita (Inca)|mita]] for mining purposes, thus killing thousands in forced labor.\n\n[[Spaniards]] arrived in large numbers under colonial rule. After the independence, there has been a gradual [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigration from Austria, England, Scotland, France, Germany, Italy, Croatia and Spain.<ref>Mario V\u00e1zquez, \"Immigration and mestizaje in nineteenth-century Peru\", pp. 79\u201381.</ref> <ref> http://www.peruviantimes.com/19/scottish-independence-an-historical-view-and-a-peruvian-perspective/22915/ </ref> Polynesians also came to the country lured to work in the Guano islands during the boom years of this commodity around the 1860s. [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] arrived in the 1850s as a replacement for slave workers in the sugar plantations of the north coast and have since become a major influence in Peruvian society.<ref>Magnus M\u00f6rner, ''Race mixture in the history of Latin America'', p. 131.</ref> Other immigrant groups include [[Arabs]], [[South Asians]], Japanese and [[United States|Americans]] from the United States and Colombia (75,000).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n'''[[Mestizos]]''' compose about 60%<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> of the total population. The term traditionally denotes Amerindian (mostly [[Quechua people|Quechua]] ancestry) and European ancestry (mostly [[Spanish people|Spaniard]] ancestry). This term, was part of the caste classification during colonial times, whereby people of exclusive Spanish descent but born in the colonies were called criollos, people of mixed Amerindian and Spanish descent were called mestizos, those of African and Spanish descent were called mulatos and those of Amerindian and African descent were called Zambos. Nowadays, these terms have racist connotations.\n\nMost Peruvian mestizos are of Amerindian and European descent, but other ethnic backgrounds (such as Asian, Middle Eastern and African) are also present, in varying degrees, in some segments of the mestizo population. Most mestizos are urban dwellers and show stronger European inheritance in regions like [[Lima Region]], [[La Libertad Region]], [[Callao Region]], [[San Mart\u00edn Region]], [[Cajamarca Region]], [[Piura Region]], [[Amazonas Region]], [[Lambayeque Region]], and [[Arequipa Region]].\n\n'''[[Amerindians]]''' constitute around 26%<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> of the total population. The two major [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] or ethnic groups are the [[Quechuas]] (belonging to various cultural subgroups), followed by the [[Aymara people|Aymara]]s, mostly found in the extreme southern Andes. A large proportion of the indigenous population who live in the Andean highlands still speak [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] and have vibrant cultural traditions, some of which were part of the [[Inca Empire]]. Dozens of indigenous cultures are also dispersed throughout the country beyond the [[Andes Mountains]] in the [[Amazon basin]]. This region is rapidly becoming urbanized. Important urban centers include [[Iquitos]], [[Nauta]], [[Puerto Maldonado]], [[Pucallpa]] and [[Yurimaguas]]. This region is home to numerous [[indigenous people]]s, though they do not constitute a large proportion of the total population. Examples of indigenous peoples residing in eastern Peru include the [[Shipibo]], [[Urarina]],<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> [[Cocama]], and [[Aguaruna people|Aguaruna]], to name just a few.\n\n'''[[White Peruvians|European]]''' descendants constitute around 6%<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> of the total population. They are descendants of the Spanish colonizers and other Europeans such as [[German Peruvian|Germans]], [[Italian Peruvians|Italians]], [[British Peruvians|British]], [[French Peruvians|French]], and [[Croatian Peruvian|Croatians]] (see also [[Croats]]) who arrived in the 19th and 20th centuries. The majority of them live also in the largest cities (like mestizos), usually in the North and Center of Peru: [[Lima]], [[Trujillo, Peru|Trujillo]], [[Chiclayo]], [[Piura]], and through all the highlands of [[North macroregion, Peru|Northwest]], like [[Amazonas Region|Amazonas]], [[Cajamarca Region|Cajamarca]] and [[San Mart\u00edn Region|San Martin]]. The only southern city with a significant white population is [[Arequipa]]. Recently, Peru has seen a migration of American retirees and businessmen come to settle in the country, due to lower cost of living and economic booms in the 1990s and 2000s, though Peru experiences busts in between. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\n[[File:Chinatown Lima Peru.jpg|thumb|right|Chinatown in Lima]]\n\nThere is also the presence of [[Asian Peruvian]]s, primarily [[Chinese Peruvian|Chinese]] and [[Japanese Peruvian|Japanese]], that constitutes 4% of the population, which in proportion to the overall population.<ref name=\"ethnicity2017\"/> Peru has the second largest population of people of Japanese descent in Latin America after [[Brazil]] and the largest population of Chinese descent in Latin America. Historic communities inhabited by people of Chinese descent are found throughout the Peruvian [[upper Amazon]], including cities such as [[Yurimaguas]], [[Nauta]], [[Iquitos]] and the north central coast (Lambayeque and Trujillo). In contrast to the Japanese community in Peru, the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] appear to have intermarried much more since they came to work in the [[rice fields]] during the Viceroyalty and to replace the [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, during the abolition of slavery itself. Despite the presence of Peruvians of Asian heritage being quite recent, in the past decade they have made significant advancements in business and political fields; a past president ([[Alberto Fujimori]]), several past cabinet members, and one member of the Peruvian congress are of Japanese or Chinese origin. Small numbers of [[Arab diaspora|Arab]] Peruvians, mostly of Lebanese and Syrian origin, and [[Palestinian diaspora|Palestinians]] also reside, as well a small [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Hindustani]] and [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] community. {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe remaining is constituted by '''[[Afro-Peruvian]]s,''' a legacy of Peru's history as an importer of slaves during the colonial period. Today also [[mulatto]]s (mixed African and European) and [[zambos]] (mixed African and Amerindian) constitute an important part of the population as well, especially in [[Piura]], [[Tumbes (city)|Tumbes]], [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]], Lima and [[Ica region|Ica]] regions. The Afro-Peruvian population is concentrated mostly in coastal cities south of Lima, such as that of those found in the Ica Region, in cities like [[Ca\u00f1ete Province|Ca\u00f1ete]], [[Chincha Alta District|Chincha]], [[Ica (city)|Ica]], [[Nazca]] and [[Acar\u00ed]] in the border with the [[Arequipa Region]]. Another large but poorly promoted segment of Afro-Peruvian presence is in the ''Yunga'' regions (west and just below the Andean chain of northern Peru), (i.e., [[Piura]] and [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]]), where sugarcane, lemon, and mango production are still of importance. Important communities are found all over the [[Morrop\u00f3n Province]], such as in the city of [[Chulucanas]]. One of them is [[Yapatera]], a community in the same city, as well as smaller farming communities like [[Pabur]] or [[La Matanza District|La Matanza]] and even in the mountainous region near [[Canchaque]]. Further south, the colonial city of [[Za\u00f1a]] or farming towns like [[Help:Disambiguation|Capote]] and [[Tuman River|Tuman]] in [[Lambayeque, Peru|Lambayeque]] are also important regions with Afro-Peruvian presence.\n\nSocioeconomic and cultural indicators are increasingly important as identifiers. For example, Peruvians of Amerindian descent who have adopted aspects of Hispanic culture also are beginning to consider themselves \"[[mestizo]]\". With economic development, access to education, intermarriage, and large-scale migration from rural to urban areas, a more homogeneous national culture''' is developing, mainly along the relatively more prosperous coast. \n\nMost of Peru's population (about 50% percent) lives in the ''Costa'' (coastal area), while 36% live in the [[Geography of Peru#Andean Mountain Ranges|Sierra]] (the Andes) and only 12% in the [[Selva]] or [[Amazon rain forest]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Almost one-third of the nation's population lives in the [[Lima and Callao Metropolitan Area]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}. Lima is home to over 8 million Peruvians, one of South America's largest urban areas, it includes the neighboring community of [[Callao, Peru|Callao]] that has grown fast and expanded since the 1960s.\n\n== Language ==\n{{bar box\n|title=Languages of Per\u00fa <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inei.gob.pe/media/MenuRecursivo/publicaciones_digitales/Est/Lib1539/libro.pdf |title=Per\u00fa: Perfil Sociodemogr\u00e1fico |page = 197 |website = Instituto Nacional de Estad\u00edstica e Inform\u00e1tica}}</ref> \n|titlebar=#ddd\n|left1=Languages\n|right1=percent\n|float=left\n|bars=\n{{bar percent|[[Spanish language|Spanish]]|Blue|82.6}}\n{{bar percent|[[Quechua language|Quechua]] |Orange|13.9}}\n{{bar percent|[[Aymara language|Aymara]]|Yellow|1.7}}\n{{bar percent|Other indigenous language|Blue|0.8}}\n}}\n\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n{{main|Languages of Peru}}\n[[File:MANTEQUILLA and ROY MASON 236x272.jpg|thumb|left|[[Peruvian Paso]]]]\nAccording to the [[Peruvian Constitution]] of 1993, Peru's official languages are Spanish and, Amerindian languages such as Quechua, Aymara and other such indigenous languages in areas where they predominate. Today, Spanish is spoken by some 83.9% of the population.  Spanish is used by the government and the media and in education and commerce. Amerindians who live in the Andean highlands speak Quechua and [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and are ethnically distinct from the diverse indigenous groups who live on the eastern side of the Andes and in the tropical lowlands adjacent to the Amazon basin.\n\nPeru's distinct geographical regions are mirrored in a socioeconomic divide between the coast's mestizo-Hispanic culture and the more diverse, traditional Andean cultures of the mountains and highlands. The indigenous populations east of the Andes speak various languages and dialects. Some of these groups still adhere to traditional customs, while others have been almost completely assimilated into the mestizo-Hispanic culture.\n[[File:Baby got Back.jpg|thumb|250 px|right|Amerindian woman with child]]\n\nAccording to official sources, the use of Spanish has increased while the knowledge and use of indigenous languages have decreased considerably during the last four decades (1960\u20132000). At the beginning of the 1960s some 39% of the total Peruvian population were registered as speakers of indigenous languages, but by the 1990s the figures show a considerable decline in the use of Quechua, Aymara and other indigenous languages, when only 28% is registered as Quechua-speaking (16% of whom are reported to be bilingual in Spanish) and Spanish-speakers increased to 72%.\n\nFor 2017, government figures place Spanish as being spoken by 82.6% of the population, but among Amerindian languages, another decrease is registered. Of the indigenous languages, Quechua remains the most spoken, and even today is used by some 13.9% of the total Peruvian population or a third of Peru's total indigenous population. The number of Aymara-speakers and other indigenous languages is placed at 2.5%, and foreign languages 0.2%.\n\nThe drastic decline in use and knowledge of indigenous languages is largely attributed to the recent demographic factors. The urbanization and assimilation of Peru's Amerindian plurality into the Hispanic-mestizo culture, as well as the new socioeconomic factors associated with class structure, have given privilege to the use of Spanish at the expense of the Amerindian languages which were spoken by the majority of the population less than a century ago.\n\nThe major obstacle to a more widespread use of the Quechua language is the fact that multiple dialects of this language exist. Quechua, along with Aymara and the minor indigenous languages, was originally and remains essentially an oral language. Therefore, there is a lack of modern media which use it: for example books, newspapers, software, magazines, technical journals, etc. However, non-governmental organizations, as well as state sponsored groups, are involved in projects to edit and translate major works into the Quechua language; for instance, in late 2005 a version of [[Don Quixote]] was presented in Quechua. There has also been an increasing and organized effort to teach Quechua in public schools in the areas where Quechua is spoken.\n\nThe percentage of native speakers of Quechua who are illiterate has been decreasing lately<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q3tAqIU0dPsC&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=Peru+Quechua+literacy+rate&source=bl&ots=M9oWEVd0Li&sig=EjUEmGRk54AqG_oREbYLh8Ck2Uk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz_on7vqvZAhVR2GMKHQPRCbwQ6AEIZjAG#v=onepage&q=Peru%20Quechua%20literacy%20rate&f=false|title=One Thousand Languages: Living, Endangered, and Lost|last=Austin|first=Peter|date=2008|publisher=University of California Press|year=|isbn=9780520255609|location=|pages=202|language=en}}</ref>, as 86.87% of the Peruvian population is literate.

The system is highly centralized, with the Ministry of Education appointing all public school teachers. Although 83% of Peru's students attend public schools at all levels, over 15% percent (usually the upper-classes and upper middle-class) attend private.\n\nSchool enrollment has been rising sharply for years, due to a widening educational effort by the government and a growing school-age population. The [[illiteracy]] (2008) rate is estimated at 7.1% (10.6% for women), 19.0% in rural areas and 3.7% in urban areas [http://www.andina.com.pe/Espanol/Noticia.aspx?id=NiBnWpBzahw=].\n[[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is mostly an oral language, so in some cases, in rural areas, people do not speak Spanish and therefore do not know how to read or write.

Any kind of object can thus be animated, but puppets with movable joints (puppet animation) or [[plasticine]] figures ([[clay animation]] or claymation) are most commonly used. Puppets, models or clay figures built around an [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] are used in [[model animation]]. Stop motion with live actors is often referred to as [[pixilation]]. Stop motion of flat materials such as paper, fabrics or photographs is usually called [[cutout animation]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"stop motion,\" relating to the animation technique, is often spelled with a [[hyphen]] as \"stop-motion.\" Both orthographical variants, with and without the hyphen, are correct, but the hyphenated one has a second meaning that is unrelated to animation or cinema: \"a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong\" (''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1993 edition).<ref>'''stop''', combinations section (''Comb.''), '''stop-motion''' a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong (''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, Vol. 2 N-Z, 1993 edition, see page 3,074)</ref>\n\nStop motion should not be confused with the [[time lapse|time-lapse]] technique in which still photographs of a live scene are taken at regular intervals and then combined to make a continuous film in which time appears to be moving faster.\n\n== History ==\n===1849 to 1895: Before film===\nBefore the advent of [[chronophotography]] in 1878, a scarce amount of picture sequences were photographed with subjects in separate poses. These can now be regarded as a form of stop motion or pixilation, but very few results were meant to be animated.\n\nIn 1849, Joseph Plateau published a note about improvements for his Fantascope (a.k.a. [[Phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]]). A new translucent variation had improved picture quality and could be viewed with both eyes, by several people at the same time. Plateau stated that the illusion could be further advanced even further with an idea communicated to him by [[Charles Wheatstone]]: a combination of the fantascope and Wheatstone's [[stereoscope]]. Plateau thought the construction of a sequential set of stereoscopic image pairs would be the more difficult part of the plan than adapting two copies of his improved fantascope to fit be fitted with a stereoscope. Wheatstone had suggested using photographs on paper of a solid object, for instance a statuette. Plateau concluded that for this purpose 16 plaster models could be made with 16 regular modifications. He believed such a project would take much time and careful effort, but would be well worth it because of the expected marvelous results.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9fZUAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA254&ots=ciVL2_BZaf&dq=%22persistance%20des%20impressions%20de%20la%20retine%E2%80%9D%20bulletin%20academie%20royale%22&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Bulletins de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique|last=Belgique|first=Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de|date=1849|publisher=Hayez|language=fr}}</ref> Unfortunately, the plan was never executed, possibly because Plateau was almost completely blind by this time. \n\nIn 1852 [[Jules Duboscq]] patented a \"St\u00e9r\u00e9oscope-fantascope, st\u00e9r\u00e9ofantscope ou B\u00efoscope\" [[phenakistiscope|stroboscopic disc]]. The only known extant disc contains stereoscopic photograph pairs of different phases of the motion of a machine. Due to the long exposure times necessary to capture an image with the photographic emulsions of the period, the sequence could not be recorded live and must have been assembled from separate photographs of the various positions of the machinery.\n\nIn 1855, [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak]]'s published an article about his Stereophoroskop and other experiments aimed at stereoscopic moving images. He mentioned a method of sticking needles in a [[phenakistiscope|stroboscopic disc]] so that it looked like one needle was being pushed in and out of the cardboard when animated. He realized that this method provided basically endless possibilities to make different 3D animations. He then introduced two methods to animate stereoscopic pairs of images, one was basically a stereo viewer using two stroboscopic discs and the other was more or less similar to the later [[zoetrope]]. Czermak explained how suitable stereoscopic photographs could be made by recording a series of models, for instance to animate a growing pyramid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/vlp/lit15017/index.meta&viewMode=auto&pn=1|last=Czermak|title=Das Stereophoroskop|year=1855|language=German}}</ref> \n\nOn 27 February 1860 Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices (much like the later zoetrope).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UXTAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA30&ots=K-mYh9tD-4&dq=peter+hubert+desvignes+patent&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838-1952|first=Ray|last=Zone|date=3 February 2014|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|via=Google Books}}</ref> Desvignes' ''Mimoscope'', received an Honourable Mention \"for ingenuity of construction\" at the 1862 International Exhibition in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/medalsandhonour00goog|title=Medals and Honourable Mentions Awarded by the International Juries: With a ...|first=1862|last=International exhibition|date=10 April 1862|publisher=Her Majesty's Commissioners|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Desvignes \"employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5GFAAAAAYAAJ&dq=mimoscope&pg=PA777#v=onepage&q=mimoscope&f=false|title=Chambers's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People|date=10 April 1868|publisher=W. and R.

In the resulting film the change will be sudden and a logical cause of the change will be mysteriously absent or replaced with a fake cause that is suggested in the scene. The oldest known example is used for the beheading in [[Edison Manufacturing Company]]'s 1895 film ''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]''. The technique of stop motion can be interpreted as repeatedly applying the stop trick. In 1917 clay animation pioneer [[Helena Smith-Dayton]] referred to the principle behind her work as \"stop action\",<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2012-06-15|title=Romeo and Juliet|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781580819015.01|journal=Romeo and Juliet|doi=10.5040/9781580819015.01}}</ref> a synonym of \"stop motion\".\n\nFrench trick film pioneer [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] claimed to have invented the stop-trick and popularized it by using it in many of his short films.

Based on later reports by Melbourne-Cooper and by his daughter Audrey Wadowska, some believe that Cooper's ''Matches: an Appeal'' was produced in 1899 and therefore the very first stop-motion animation. The extant black-and-white film shows a matchstick figure writing an appeal to donate a [[Guinea (coin)|Guinea]] for which [[Bryant and May]] would supply soldiers with sufficient matches. No archival records are known that could proof that the film was indeed created in 1899 during the beginning of the [[Second Boer War]]. Others place it at 1914, during the beginning of [[World War I]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eafa.org.uk/catalogue/215258|title=East Anglian Film Archive: Matches Appeal, 1899|website=www.eafa.org.uk|access-date=2019-07-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nWBD_raPKoC&pg=PA281|title=\"They Thought it was a Marvel\": Arthur Melbourne-Cooper (1874-1961) : Pioneer of Puppet Animation|last=Vries|first=Tjitte de|last2=Mul|first2=Ati|date=2009|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|isbn=9789085550167|language=en}}</ref> Cooper created more ''Animated Matches'' scenes in the same setting.

He wanted to document [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]]ting [[stag beetles]], but the creatures wouldn't cooperate or would even die under the bright lamps needed for filming. He solved the problem by using wire for the limbs of dried beetles and then animating them in stop motion. The resulting short film, presumably 1 minute long,<ref>{{Citation|title=Lucanus Cervus (1910) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0140341/reference|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> was probably titled by the Latin name for the species: ''[[Lucanus Cervus (film)|\u0416\u0443\u043a-\u043e\u043b\u0435\u043d\u044c (Lucanus Cervus)]]'' (1910, considered lost). \n[[File:1912. \u041f\u0440\u0435\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041b\u044e\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0434\u0430, \u0438\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u043d\u0430 \u0440\u043e\u0433\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439 \u0438 \u0443\u0441\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0439.webm|thumb|Starewicz' ''The Beautiful Leukanida'' (1912)]]\nAfter moving to Moscow, Starewicz continued animating dead insects, but now as characters in imaginative stories with much dramatic complexity.

Reportedly many viewers were impressed with how much could be achieved with trained insects, or at least wondered what tricks could have been used, since few people were familiar with the secrets of stop motion animation.

Dawley to direct, create effects, co-write and co-star with him for ''[[The Ghost of Slumber Mountain]]'' (1918). The collaborative film combined live-action with animated dinosaur models in a 45-minute film, but after the premiere it was cut down to circa 12 minutes. Dawley did not give O'Brien credits for the visual effects, and instead claimed the animation process as his own invention and even applied for patents.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Webber|first=Roy P.|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=le9QoR0JyEYC&lpg=PA10&dq=%22The%20Dinosaur%20and%20the%20Missing%20Link%22%20clay&pg=PA10#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=The Dinosaur Films of Ray Harryhausen: Features, Early 16mm Experiments and Unrealized Projects|date=2004|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-1666-0|language=en}}</ref> O'Brien's stop motion work was recognized as a technique to create lifelike creatures for adventure films.

Some of her first resulting short films were screened on 25 March 1917. She released an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' circa half a year later. Although the films and her technique received much attention of the press, it seems she did not continue making films after she returned to New York from managing a YMCA in Paris around 1918. None of her films have yet surfaced, but the extant magazine articles have provided several stills and circa 20 poorly printed frames from two film strips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://journal.animationstudies.org/jason-douglass-artist-author-and-pioneering-motion-picture-animator-the-career-of-helena-smith-dayton-runner-up/|title=Jason Douglass \u2013 Artist, Author, and Pioneering Motion Picture Animator: The Career of Helena Smith Dayton (runner-up) \u2013 Animation Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n====Starewicz in Paris====\nBy 1920 Starewicz had settled in Paris, and started making new stop motion films. ''Dans les Griffes de L'araign\u00e9e'' (finished 1920, released 1924) featured detailed hand-made insect puppets that could convey facial expressions with moving lips and eyelids. \n\n\n====Other silent stop motion====\n\nOne of the earliest clay animation films was ''Modelling Extraordinary'', which impressed audiences in 1912.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} \n\nThe early Italian feature film ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914) featured some stop motion techniques.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===1930s and 1940s===\nStarewicz finished the first feature stop motion film ''[[The Tale of the Fox|Le Roman de Renard (The Tale of the Fox)]]'' in 1930, but problems with its soundtrack delayed its release. In 1937 it was released with a German soundtrack and in 1941 with its French soundtrack.\n\nHungarian-American filmmaker [[George Pal]] developed his own stop motion technique of replacing wooden dolls (or parts of them) with similar figures displaying changed poses and/or expressions. He called it Pal-Doll and used it for his [[Puppetoons]] films since 1932. The particular replacement animation method itself also became better known as [[puppetoon]]. In Europe he mainly worked on promotional films for companies such as [[Philips]]. Later Pal gained much success in Hollywood with a string of [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]s, including ''Rhythm in the Ranks'' (1941), ''[[Tulips Shall Grow]]'' (1942), ''[[Jasper and the Haunted House]]'' (1942), the [[Dr. Seuss]] penned ''[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]'' (1943) and ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]'' (1944), ''Jasper and the Beanstalk'' (1945), ''[[John Henry and the Inky-Poo]]'' (1946), ''[[Jasper in a Jam]]'' (1946), and ''[[Tubby the Tuba (1947 film)|Tubby the Tuba]]'' (1947). Many of his puppetoon films were selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. \n\nWillis O' Brien's expressive and emotionally convincing animation of the big ape in ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933) is widely regarded as a milestone in stop-motion animation and a highlight of Hollywood cinema in general.\n\nA 1940 promotional film for [[Autolite]], an automotive parts supplier, featured stop-motion animation of its products marching past Autolite factories to the tune of [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Three Marches Militaires (Schubert)|Military March]]''. An abbreviated version of this sequence was later used in television ads for Autolite, especially those on the 1950s CBS program ''[[Suspense (U.S. TV series)|Suspense]]'', which Autolite sponsored.\n\nThe first British animated feature was the stop motion instruction film ''[[Handling Ships]]'' (1945) by [[Halas and Batchelor]] for the British [[Admiralty]]. It was not meant for general cinemas, but did become part of the official selection of the 1946 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe first Belgian animated feature was an [[The Crab with the Golden Claws (film)|adaptation of the Tintin comic ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'']] (1947) with animated puppets.\n\nThe first Czech animated feature was the package film ''[[The Czech Year]]'' (1947) with animated puppets by [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]]. The film won several awards at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and other international fetivals. Trnka would make several more stop motion features and short films, and experimented with other forms of animation.\n\n===1950s===\n[[Ray Harryhausen]] learned under O'Brien on the film ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949). Harryhausen would go on to create many memorable stop motion effects for a string of successful fantasy films over the next three decades.  These included ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (1955),  ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963), ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1973) and ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981).\n\nIt wasn't until 1954 before a feature animated film with a technique other than cel animation was produced in the US. The first was the stop motion adaptation of 19th century composer [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s opera ''[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]'' as ''[[Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy]]''.\n\n[[Art Clokey]] started his adventures in clay with a freeform clay short film called ''Gumbasia'' (1955), which shortly thereafter propelled him into the production of his more structured TV series ''[[Gumby]]'' (1955\u20131989), with the iconic titular character. In partnership with the [[United Lutheran Church in America]], he also produced ''[[Davey and Goliath]]'' (1960\u20132004). The theatrical feature ''[[Gumby: The Movie]]'' (1992) was a [[box office bomb]].  \n\nOn 22 November 1959, the first episode of ''[[Sandm\u00e4nnchen|Unser Sandm\u00e4nchen (Our Little Sandman)]]'' was broadcast on [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk|DFF (East German television)]]. The 10-minute daily bedtime show for young children features the title character as an animated puppet, and other puppets in different segments. A very similar ''Sandm\u00e4nchen'' series, possibly conceived earlier, ran on West German television from 1 December 1959 until the [[German reunification]] in 1989. The East German show was continued on other German networks when DFF ended in 1991, and is one of the longest running animated series in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The theatrical feature ''Das Sandm\u00e4nnchen \u2013 Abenteuer im Traumland'' (2010) was fully animated with stop motion puppets.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nJapanese puppet animator [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] started out as assistant animator in short anime (propaganda) films ''Arichan'' (1941) and ''[[Momotar\u014d no Umiwashi]]'' (1943). He fled to [[Manchukuo]] during the war and stayed in China afterwards. Due to the scarcity of paint and film stock shortly after the war, he decided to work with puppets and stop motion. His work helped popularize puppet animation in China, before he returned to Japan around 1953 where he continued working as animation director. In the 1960s he supervised the \"Animagic\" puppet animation for productions by Videocraft International, Ltd. (later called [[Rankin/Bass Productions]]) and [[Dentsu]], starting with the TV series ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' (1960-1961). The TV special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' has been telecasted annually since 1964 and has become one of the most beloved holiday films in the USA. They made three theatrical feature films ''[[Willy McBean and His Magic Machine]]'' (1965), ''[[The Daydreamer (film)|The Daydreamer]]'' (1966, stop motion / live-action) and ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' (1967) before the collaboration ended. \nRankin/Bass worked with other animators for more TV specials, with titles such as ''[[The Little Drummer Boy (film)|The Little Drummer Boy]]'' (1968), ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)|Santa Claus is Comin' to Town]]'' (1970) and ''[[Here Comes Peter Cottontail]]'' (1971).\n\nBritish television has shown many stop motion series for young children since the 1960s. An early example is ''[[Snip and Snap]]'' (1960-1961) by [[John Halas]] in collaboration with Danish paper sculptor Thok S\u00f8ndergaard (Thoki Yenn) featured dog Snap, cut from a sheet of paper by pair of scissors Snip.\n\nApart from their cutout animation series, British studio [[Smallfilms]] ([[Peter Firmin]] and [[Oliver Postgate]]) produced several stop motion series with puppets, beginning with ''[[Pingwings]]'' (1961-1965) featuring penguin-like birds knitted by Peter's wife Joan and filmed on their farm (where most of their productions were filmed in an unused barn). It was followed by ''[[Pogles' Wood]]'' (1965-1967), ''[[Clangers]]'' (1969-1972, 1974, revived in 2015), ''[[Bagpuss]]'' (1974) and ''[[Tottie: The Story of a Doll's House]]'' (1984).\n\nFrench animator [[Serge Danot]] created ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'' (1965) which played for many years on the [[BBC]].\n\nPolish studio [[Se-ma-for]] produced popular TV series with animated puppets in adaptations of ''[[Colargol]]'' (''Barnaby the Bear'' in the UK, ''Jeremy'' in Canada) (1967-1974) and ''[[The Moomins (TV series)|The Moomins]]'' (1977-1982).\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, independent clay animator [[Eli Noyes|Eliot Noyes Jr.]] refined the technique of \"free-form\" clay animation with his Oscar-nominated 1965 film ''Clay (or the Origin of Species)''. Noyes also used stop motion to animate sand lying on glass for his musical animated film ''Sandman'' (1975).\n\nItalian director Francesco Misseri created the clay animation TV series ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (1970-1976, 2002-2007), ''[[The Red and the Blue (series)|Il Rosso e il Blu (The Red and the Blue)]]'' (1976), and a TV series with an animated [[origami]] duck ''[[Quaq Quao]]'' (1978-1979).\n\nThe British artists Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall ([[Cosgrove Hall Films]]) produced two stop-motion animated adaptions of [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''Noddy'' book series, including the original series of the same name (1975\u20131982) and ''[[Noddy's Toyland Adventures]]'' (1992\u20132001), a full-length film ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1983 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'' (1983) and later a [[The Wind in the Willows (TV-series)|multi-season TV series]], both based on [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s [[The Wind in the Willows|classic children's book]] of the same title. They also produced a documentary of their production techniques, ''[[Making Frog and Toad]]''.\n\nIn 1975, filmmaker and clay animation experimenter [[Will Vinton]] joined with sculptor [[Bob Gardiner (animator)|Bob Gardiner]] to create an experimental film called ''Closed Mondays'' which became the first stop-motion film to win an Oscar. Will Vinton followed with several other successful short film experiments including ''The Great Cognito'', ''Creation'', and ''Rip Van Winkle'' which were each nominated for Academy Awards.  In 1977, Vinton made a documentary about this process and his style of animation which he dubbed \"claymation\"; he titled the documentary ''Claymation''.  Soon after this documentary, the term was trademarked by Vinton to differentiate his team's work from others who had been, or were beginning to do, \"clay animation\".  While the word has stuck and is often used to describe clay animation and stop motion, it remains a trademark owned currently by Laika Entertainment, Inc. Twenty clay-animation episodes featuring the clown [[Mr. Bill]] were a feature of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', starting from a first appearance in February 1976.\n\nAt very much the same time in the UK, [[Peter Lord]] and [[David Sproxton]] formed [[Aardman Animations]] that would produce many commercials, TV series, short films and eventually also feature films. In 1976 they created the character [[Morph (animation)|Morph]] who appeared as an animated side-kick to the TV presenter [[Tony Hart]] on his [[BBC TV]] programme [[Take Hart]]. The five-inch-high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called [[Plasticine]]. In 1977 they started on a series of animated films, again using modelling clay, but this time made for a more adult audience. The soundtrack for [[Down and Out (1977 film)|Down and Out]] was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue. A second film, also for the BBC followed in 1978. A TV series [[The Amazing Adventures of Morph]] was aired in 1980. They also produced a notable [[music video]] for \"[[Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel song)#Music video|Sledgehammer]]\", a song by [[Peter Gabriel]].\n\nSand-coated puppet animation was used in the Oscar-winning 1977 film ''[[The Sand Castle (film)|The Sand Castle]]'', produced by Dutch-Canadian animator [[Co Hoedeman]]. Hoedeman was one of dozens of animators sheltered by the [[National Film Board of Canada]], a Canadian government film arts agency that had supported animators for decades. A pioneer of refined multiple stop-motion films under the NFB banner was [[Norman McLaren]], who brought in many other animators to create their own creatively controlled films. Notable among these are the [[pinscreen animation]] films of Jacques Drouin, made with the original pinscreen donated by [[Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker]].\n\nCzechoslovak filmmakers [[Lubom\u00edr Bene\u0161]] and [[Vladim\u00edr Jir\u00e1nek]] debuted their animated puppet characters ''[[Pat & Mat]]'', two inventive but clumsy neighbors, in the 7-minute short ''Kutaci'' in 1976. Since 1979, over 100 episodes have been broadcast irregularly.<ref>{{Citation|title=Pat & Mat (TV Series 1976\u20132018) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841929/episodes|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Since 2014, new episodes were presented in theatrically released package films. The series became very popular in several countries, especially in The Netherlands, the only country where the characters are voiced. \n\nOne of the main British animation teams, John Hardwick and Bob Bura, were the main animators in many early British TV shows, and are famous for their work on the ''[[Trumptonshire]]'' trilogy.\n\nDisney experimented with several stop-motion techniques by hiring independent animator-director [[Mike Jittlov]] to make the first stop-motion animation of [[Mickey Mouse]] toys ever produced, in a short sequence called ''Mouse Mania'', part of a TV special, ''Mickey's 50'', which commemorated Mickey's 50th anniversary in 1978. Jittlov again produced some impressive multi-technique stop-motion animation a year later for a 1979 Disney special promoting their release of the feature film ''[[The Black Hole]]''. Titled ''Major Effects'', Jittlov's work stood out as the best part of the special. Jittlov released his footage the following year to 16mm film collectors as a short film titled ''[[The Wizard of Speed and Time]]'', along with four of his other short multi-technique animated films, most of which eventually evolved into his own feature-length film of the same title. Effectively demonstrating almost all animation techniques, as well as how he produced them, the film was released to theaters in 1987 and to video in 1989.\n\n===1980s to present===\n[[File:Stefano Bessoni Canti 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Stefano Bessoni]], Italian filmmaker, illustrator and stop-motion animator working on ''Gallows Songs'' (2014)]]\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] often used stop-motion model animation in such films as the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy: the chess sequence in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the Tauntauns and AT-AT walkers in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and the AT-ST walkers in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' were all filmed using stop-motion animation, with the latter two films utilising [[go motion]]: an invention from renowned visual effects veteran [[Phil Tippett]]. The many shots including the ghosts in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and the first two feature films in the ''[[RoboCop]]'' series use Tippett's go motion.\n\nIn the UK, Aardman Animations continued to grow. [[Channel 4]] funded a new series of clay animated films, ''[[Conversation Pieces]]'', using recorded soundtracks of real people talking. A further series in 1986, called ''Lip Sync'', premiered the work of [[Richard Goleszowski]] (''Ident''), [[Barry Purves]] (''Next''), and [[Nick Park]] (''[[Creature Comforts]]''), as well as further films by Sproxton and Lord. ''Creature Comforts'' won the Oscar for Best Animated Short in 1990.\n\nIn 1980, [[Marc Paul Chinoy]] directed the 1st feature-length clay animated film, based on the famous ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' comic strip. Titled ''I go Pogo''. It was aired a few times on American cable channels but has yet to be commercially released. Primarily clay, some characters required armatures, and walk cycles used pre-sculpted hard bases legs. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Priebe|first=Ken A.|title=The Advanced Art of Stop-Motion Animation|publisher=Course Technology|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4354-5613-6|location=Boston|pages=25}}</ref>\n\nStop motion was also used for some shots of the final sequence of ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' movie, also for the scenes of the small alien ships in [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]'s ''[[Batteries Not Included (film)|Batteries Not Included]]'' in 1987, animated by [[David W. Allen]]. Allen's stop-motion work can also be seen in such feature films as ''[[The Crater Lake Monster]]'' (1977), ''[[Q (1982 film)|Q - The Winged Serpent]]'' (1982), ''[[The Gate (1987 film)|The Gate]]'' (1987) and ''Freaked'' (1993). Allen's King Kong [[Volkswagen]] commercial from the 1970s is now legendary among model animation enthusiasts.\n\nIn 1985, [[Will Vinton]] and his team released an ambitious feature film in stop motion called \"The Adventures Of Mark Twain\" based on the life and works of the famous American author.  While the film may have been a little sophisticated for young audiences at the time, it got rave reviews from critics and adults in general.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Vinton's team also created the Nomes and the Nome King for Disney's \"Return to Oz\" feature, for which they received an Academy Award Nomination for Special Visual Effects.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, Will Vinton became very well known for his commercial work as well with stop-motion campaigns including [[The California Raisins]].\n\nFrom 1986 to 1991, [[Churchill Films]] produced ''[[The Mouse and the Motorcycle]]'', ''[[Runaway Ralph]]'', and ''[[Ralph S. Mouse]]'' for ABC television. The shows featured stop-motion characters combined with live action, based on the books of Beverly Cleary. John Clark Matthews was the animation director, with Justin Kohn, Joel Fletcher, and Gail Van Der Merwe providing character animation.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196767/, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094541/, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196895/</ref> The company also produced other films based on children's books.\n\nOf note are the films of Czech filmmaker [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]], which mix stop motion and live actors. These include ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]'', an adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', and ''[[Faust (1994 film)|Faust]]'', a rendition of [[Faust|the legend of the German scholar]]. \n\nFrom 1986 to 2000, [[List of Pingu episodes|over 150 five-minute episodes]] of ''[[Pingu]]'', a Swiss [[children's television program|children's]] [[animated comedy|comedy]] were produced by [[Trickfilmstudio]].\n\n''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', directed by [[Henry Selick]] and produced by [[Tim Burton]], was one of the more widely released stop-motion features and become  the highest grossing stop-motion animated movie of its time, grossing over $50 million domestic. Henry Selick also went on to direct ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' and ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', and Tim Burton went on to direct ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' and ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]''.\n\nIn the 1990s [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] made two shorts and the pilot of ''[[South Park]]'' almost entirely out of [[construction paper]].\n\nIn 1999, Will Vinton launched the first prime-time stop-motion television series called ''[[The PJs]]'', co-created by actor-comedian [[Eddie Murphy]].  The Emmy-winning sitcom aired on Fox for two seasons, then moved to the WB for an additional season. Vinton launched another series, ''[[Gary & Mike]]'', for UPN in 2001.\n\nIn 1999, [[Tsuneo G\u014dda]] directed official 30-second sketches of the character [[Domo (NHK)|Domo]]. With the shorts animated by stop-motion studio [[Dwarf (animation)|dwarf]] is still currently produced in [[Japan]] and has then received universal critical acclaim from fans and critics. G\u014dda also directed the stop-motion movie series ''Komaneko'' in 2004.\n\nAnother individual who found fame in clay animation is [[Nick Park]], who created the characters [[Wallace and Gromit]]. In addition to a series of award-winning shorts and featurettes, he won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] for the feature-length outing ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]''. ''[[Chicken Run]]'', to date, is the highest grossing stop motion animated movie ever grossing nearly $225 million worldwide.\n\nThe BBC commissioned thirteen episodes of stop frame animated ''[[Summerton Mill]]'' in 2004 as inserts into their flagship pre-school program, ''[[Tikkabilla]]''. Created and produced by Pete Bryden and Ed Cookson, the series was then given its own slot on BBC1 and BBC2 and has been broadcast extensively around the world.\n\nOther notable stop-motion feature films released since 1990 include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' (1993), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' and ''[[$9.99]]'', both released in 2009, and ''[[Anomalisa]]'' (2015). As of 2019, stop motion is thriving even in a filmmaking world dominated by [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] despite the efforts needed by the animators.<ref>https://www.fandom.com/articles/breaking-the-mold-stop-motion</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the pilot film for the series ''[[Curucuru and Friends]]'', produced by Korean studio Ffango Entertoyment is greenlighted into a [[children's television program|children's]] animated series in 2004 after an approval with the Gyeonggi Digital Contents Agency. It was aired in [[KBS1]] on November 24, 2006 and won the 13th Korean Animation Awards in 2007 for Best Animation. Ffango Entertoyment also worked with [[Frontier Works]] in [[Japan]] to produce the 2010 film remake of ''[[Cheburashka]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hancinema.net/the-future-looks-bright-for-companies-that-moved-into-the-gyeonggi-digital-content-agency-9527.html|title=The future looks bright for companies that moved into the Gyeonggi Digital Content Agency|author=|date=|website=hancinema.net}}</ref>\n\nSince 2005, ''[[Robot Chicken]]'' has mostly utilized stop-motion animation, using custom made [[action figure]]s and other toys as principal characters.\n\nSince 2009, [[Laika (company)|Laika]], the stop-motion successor to [[Will Vinton Studios]], has released five [[feature film]]s, which have collectively grossed over $400 million.\n\n==List of stop motion artists==\n{{Main| List of stop motion artists}}\n\n==List of stop motion films==\n{{Main| List of stop motion films}}\n\n==Variations of stop motion==\n\n===Stereoscopic stop motion===\nStop motion has very rarely been shot in [[stereoscopic]] [[three-dimensional space|3D]] throughout film history. The first 3D stop-motion short was ''In Tune With Tomorrow'' (also known as ''Motor Rhythm''), made in 1939 by John Norling. The second stereoscopic stop-motion release was ''The Adventures of Sam Space'' in 1955 by Paul Sprunck. The third and latest stop motion short in stereo 3D was ''The Incredible Invasion of the 20,000 Giant Robots from Outer Space'' in 2000 by Elmer Kaan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmerkaan.com|title=Elmer Kaan |publisher=Elmer Kaan |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> and Alexander Lentjes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moonridge5.com/credits_alexander_lentjes.html |title=Alexander Lentjes |publisher=Moonridge5.com |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=3-D Revolution Productions |url=http://www.the3drevolution.com/animation.html |title=Animation |publisher=The3drevolution.com |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> This is also the first ever 3D stereoscopic stop motion and CGI short in the history of film. The first all stop-motion 3D feature is ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (2009), based on [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Coraline|best-selling novel]] and directed by Henry Selick.\nAnother recent example is the [[Nintendo 3DS]] video software which comes with the option for Stop Motion videos. This has been released December 8, 2011 as a 3DS system update. Also, the movie ParaNorman is in 3D stop motion.\n\n===Go motion===\n{{Main| Go motion}}\n\nAnother more complicated variation on stop motion is [[go motion]], co-developed by [[Phil Tippett]] and first used on the films ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981), and the ''[[RoboCop]]'' films. Go motion involved programming a computer to move parts of a model slightly during each exposure of each frame of film, combined with traditional hand manipulation of the model in between frames, to produce a more realistic [[motion blur]]ring effect. Tippett also used the process extensively in his 1984 short film ''[[Prehistoric Beast]]'', a 10 minutes long sequence depicting a herbivorous dinosaur (''[[Monoclonius]]''), being chased by a carnivorous one (''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''). With new footage ''Prehistoric Beast'' became ''[[Dinosaur!]]'' in 1985, a full-length dinosaurs documentary hosted by [[Christopher Reeve]]. Those Phil Tippett's go motion tests acted as motion models for his first photo-realistic use of computers to depict dinosaurs in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' in 1993. A low-tech, manual version of this blurring technique was originally pioneered by [[Ladislas Starevich|Wladyslaw Starewicz]] in the silent era, and was used in his feature film ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (1931).\n\n==Comparison to computer-generated imagery==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}\nReasons for using stop motion instead of the more advanced [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) include the low entry price and the appeal of its distinct look. It is now mostly used in children's programming, in commercials and some comic shows such as ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. Another merit of stop motion is that it legitimately displays actual real-life textures, as CGI texturing is more artificial, therefore not quite as close to realism. This is appreciated by a number of animation directors, such as [[Tim Burton]], [[Henry Selick]], [[Wes Anderson]], and [[Travis Knight (animator)|Travis Knight]].\n\n==Stop motion in other media==\nMany young people begin their experiments in movie making with stop motion, thanks to the ease of modern stop-motion software and online video publishing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claynation.co.uk/about/ |title=About ClayNation stop motion animation |publisher=ClayNation.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> Many new stop-motion shorts use clay animation into a new form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-tack.co.uk/filmmaker |title=Blu-Tack - Make Our Next Advert |publisher=Blu-tack.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211035210/http://www.blu-tack.co.uk/filmmaker |archivedate=2010-02-11 }}</ref>\n\nSinger-songwriter [[Oren Lavie]]'s music video for the song [[Her Morning Elegance]] was posted on YouTube on January 19, 2009.  The video, directed by Lavie and Yuval and Merav Nathan, uses stop motion and has achieved great success with over 25.4 million views, also earning a 2010 Grammy Award nomination for \"Best Short Form Music Video\".\n\nStop motion has occasionally been used to create the characters for computer games, as an alternative to CGI. The [[Virgin Interactive Entertainment]] [[Mythos Games|Mythos]] game [[Magic and Mayhem]] (1998) featured creatures built by stop-motion specialist Alan Friswell, who made the miniature figures from modelling clay and latex rubber, over armatures of wire and ball-and-socket joints. The models were then animated one frame at a time, and incorporated into the CGI elements of the game through digital photography. \"[[ClayFighter]]\" for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[The Neverhood]] for the [[Personal computer|PC]] are other examples.\n\nScientists at IBM used a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] to single out and move individual atoms which were used to make characters in ''[[A Boy and His Atom]]''. This was the tiniest scale stop-motion video made at that time.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation}}\n* [[Still motion]]\n* [[Brickfilm]]\n* [[Time-lapse photography]]\n\n== References ==\n; Sources\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lord |first=Peter |title=Creating 3-D animation: The Aardman Book of Filmmaking |year=1998 |publisher=Harry N.

Any kind of object can thus be animated, but puppets with movable joints (puppet animation) or [[plasticine]] figures ([[clay animation]] or claymation) are most commonly used. Puppets, models or clay figures built around an [[Armature (sculpture)|armature]] are used in [[model animation]]. Stop motion with live actors is often referred to as [[pixilation]]. Stop motion of flat materials such as paper, fabrics or photographs is usually called [[cutout animation]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe term \"stop motion,\" relating to the animation technique, is often spelled with a [[hyphen]] as \"stop-motion.\" Both orthographical variants, with and without the hyphen, are correct, but the hyphenated one has a second meaning that is unrelated to animation or cinema: \"a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong\" (''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 1993 edition).<ref>'''stop''', combinations section (''Comb.''), '''stop-motion''' a device for automatically stopping a machine or engine when something has gone wrong (''The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary'', Clarendon Press, Oxford, Vol. 2 N-Z, 1993 edition, see page 3,074)</ref>\n\nStop motion should not be confused with the [[time lapse|time-lapse]] technique in which still photographs of a live scene are taken at regular intervals and then combined to make a continuous film in which time appears to be moving faster.\n\n== History ==\n===1849 to 1895: Before film===\nBefore the advent of [[chronophotography]] in 1878, a scarce amount of picture sequences were photographed with subjects in separate poses. These can now be regarded as a form of stop motion or pixilation, but very few results were meant to be animated.\n\nIn 1849, Joseph Plateau published a note about improvements for his Fantascope (a.k.a. [[Phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]]). A new translucent variation had improved picture quality and could be viewed with both eyes, by several people at the same time. Plateau stated that the illusion could be further advanced even further with an idea communicated to him by [[Charles Wheatstone]]: a combination of the fantascope and Wheatstone's [[stereoscope]]. Plateau thought the construction of a sequential set of stereoscopic image pairs would be the more difficult part of the plan than adapting two copies of his improved fantascope to fit be fitted with a stereoscope. Wheatstone had suggested using photographs on paper of a solid object, for instance a statuette. Plateau concluded that for this purpose 16 plaster models could be made with 16 regular modifications. He believed such a project would take much time and careful effort, but would be well worth it because of the expected marvelous results.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=9fZUAAAAcAAJ&lpg=PA254&ots=ciVL2_BZaf&dq=%22persistance%20des%20impressions%20de%20la%20retine%E2%80%9D%20bulletin%20academie%20royale%22&pg=PA30#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Bulletins de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de Belgique|last=Belgique|first=Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences, des Lettres et des Beaux-Arts de|date=1849|publisher=Hayez|language=fr}}</ref> Unfortunately, the plan was never executed, possibly because Plateau was almost completely blind by this time. \n\nIn 1852 [[Jules Duboscq]] patented a \"St\u00e9r\u00e9oscope-fantascope, st\u00e9r\u00e9ofantscope ou B\u00efoscope\" [[phenakistiscope|stroboscopic disc]]. The only known extant disc contains stereoscopic photograph pairs of different phases of the motion of a machine. Due to the long exposure times necessary to capture an image with the photographic emulsions of the period, the sequence could not be recorded live and must have been assembled from separate photographs of the various positions of the machinery.\n\nIn 1855, [[Johann Nepomuk Czermak]]'s published an article about his Stereophoroskop and other experiments aimed at stereoscopic moving images. He mentioned a method of sticking needles in a [[phenakistiscope|stroboscopic disc]] so that it looked like one needle was being pushed in and out of the cardboard when animated. He realized that this method provided basically endless possibilities to make different 3D animations. He then introduced two methods to animate stereoscopic pairs of images, one was basically a stereo viewer using two stroboscopic discs and the other was more or less similar to the later [[zoetrope]]. Czermak explained how suitable stereoscopic photographs could be made by recording a series of models, for instance to animate a growing pyramid.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://echo.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/ECHOdocuView?url=/permanent/vlp/lit15017/index.meta&viewMode=auto&pn=1|last=Czermak|title=Das Stereophoroskop|year=1855|language=German}}</ref> \n\nOn 27 February 1860 Peter Hubert Desvignes received British patent no. 537 for 28 monocular and stereoscopic variations of cylindrical stroboscopic devices (much like the later zoetrope).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=UXTAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA30&ots=K-mYh9tD-4&dq=peter+hubert+desvignes+patent&pg=PA31#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Stereoscopic Cinema and the Origins of 3-D Film, 1838-1952|first=Ray|last=Zone|date=3 February 2014|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|via=Google Books}}</ref> Desvignes' ''Mimoscope'', received an Honourable Mention \"for ingenuity of construction\" at the 1862 International Exhibition in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/medalsandhonour00goog|title=Medals and Honourable Mentions Awarded by the International Juries: With a ...|first=1862|last=International exhibition|date=10 April 1862|publisher=Her Majesty's Commissioners|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Desvignes \"employed models, insects and other objects, instead of pictures, with perfect success.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5GFAAAAAYAAJ&dq=mimoscope&pg=PA777#v=onepage&q=mimoscope&f=false|title=Chambers's Encyclopaedia: A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People|date=10 April 1868|publisher=W. and R.

In the resulting film the change will be sudden and a logical cause of the change will be mysteriously absent or replaced with a fake cause that is suggested in the scene. The oldest known example is used for the beheading in [[Edison Manufacturing Company]]'s 1895 film ''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]''. The technique of stop motion can be interpreted as repeatedly applying the stop trick. In 1917 clay animation pioneer [[Helena Smith-Dayton]] referred to the principle behind her work as \"stop action\",<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2012-06-15|title=Romeo and Juliet|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5040/9781580819015.01|journal=Romeo and Juliet|doi=10.5040/9781580819015.01}}</ref> a synonym of \"stop motion\".\n\nFrench trick film pioneer [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] claimed to have invented the stop-trick and popularized it by using it in many of his short films.

He wanted to document [[rut (mammalian reproduction)|rut]]ting [[stag beetles]], but the creatures wouldn't cooperate or would even die under the bright lamps needed for filming. He solved the problem by using wire for the limbs of dried beetles and then animating them in stop motion.

O' Brien further pioneered the technique with animated dinosaur sequences for the live-action feature ''[[The Lost World (1925 film)|The Lost World]]'' (1925).\n\n====Helena Smith Dayton====\n[[File:Stills from Helena Smith-Dayton films (1917-02 Popular Science Monthly V 90 p. 257).jpg|thumb|stills from ''Battle of the Suds'' and other Helena Smith-Dayton films (1917)]]\nNew York artist [[Helena Smith Dayton]], possibly the first female animator, had much success with her \"Caricatypes\" clay statuettes before she began experimenting with clay animation. Some of her first resulting short films were screened on 25 March 1917. She released an adaptation of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' circa half a year later. Although the films and her technique received much attention of the press, it seems she did not continue making films after she returned to New York from managing a YMCA in Paris around 1918. None of her films have yet surfaced, but the extant magazine articles have provided several stills and circa 20 poorly printed frames from two film strips.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://journal.animationstudies.org/jason-douglass-artist-author-and-pioneering-motion-picture-animator-the-career-of-helena-smith-dayton-runner-up/|title=Jason Douglass \u2013 Artist, Author, and Pioneering Motion Picture Animator: The Career of Helena Smith Dayton (runner-up) \u2013 Animation Studies|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n====Starewicz in Paris====\nBy 1920 Starewicz had settled in Paris, and started making new stop motion films. ''Dans les Griffes de L'araign\u00e9e'' (finished 1920, released 1924) featured detailed hand-made insect puppets that could convey facial expressions with moving lips and eyelids. \n\n\n====Other silent stop motion====\n\nOne of the earliest clay animation films was ''Modelling Extraordinary'', which impressed audiences in 1912.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} \n\nThe early Italian feature film ''[[Cabiria]]'' (1914) featured some stop motion techniques.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n===1930s and 1940s===\nStarewicz finished the first feature stop motion film ''[[The Tale of the Fox|Le Roman de Renard (The Tale of the Fox)]]'' in 1930, but problems with its soundtrack delayed its release. In 1937 it was released with a German soundtrack and in 1941 with its French soundtrack.\n\nHungarian-American filmmaker [[George Pal]] developed his own stop motion technique of replacing wooden dolls (or parts of them) with similar figures displaying changed poses and/or expressions. He called it Pal-Doll and used it for his [[Puppetoons]] films since 1932. The particular replacement animation method itself also became better known as [[puppetoon]]. In Europe he mainly worked on promotional films for companies such as [[Philips]]. Later Pal gained much success in Hollywood with a string of [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]]s, including ''Rhythm in the Ranks'' (1941), ''[[Tulips Shall Grow]]'' (1942), ''[[Jasper and the Haunted House]]'' (1942), the [[Dr. Seuss]] penned ''[[The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins]]'' (1943) and ''[[And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street]]'' (1944), ''Jasper and the Beanstalk'' (1945), ''[[John Henry and the Inky-Poo]]'' (1946), ''[[Jasper in a Jam]]'' (1946), and ''[[Tubby the Tuba (1947 film)|Tubby the Tuba]]'' (1947). Many of his puppetoon films were selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]]. \n\nWillis O' Brien's expressive and emotionally convincing animation of the big ape in ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' (1933) is widely regarded as a milestone in stop-motion animation and a highlight of Hollywood cinema in general.\n\nA 1940 promotional film for [[Autolite]], an automotive parts supplier, featured stop-motion animation of its products marching past Autolite factories to the tune of [[Franz Schubert]]'s ''[[Three Marches Militaires (Schubert)|Military March]]''. An abbreviated version of this sequence was later used in television ads for Autolite, especially those on the 1950s CBS program ''[[Suspense (U.S. TV series)|Suspense]]'', which Autolite sponsored.\n\nThe first British animated feature was the stop motion instruction film ''[[Handling Ships]]'' (1945) by [[Halas and Batchelor]] for the British [[Admiralty]]. It was not meant for general cinemas, but did become part of the official selection of the 1946 [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nThe first Belgian animated feature was an [[The Crab with the Golden Claws (film)|adaptation of the Tintin comic ''The Crab with the Golden Claws'']] (1947) with animated puppets.\n\nThe first Czech animated feature was the package film ''[[The Czech Year]]'' (1947) with animated puppets by [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Trnka]]. The film won several awards at the [[Venice Film Festival]] and other international fetivals. Trnka would make several more stop motion features and short films, and experimented with other forms of animation.\n\n===1950s===\n[[Ray Harryhausen]] learned under O'Brien on the film ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' (1949). Harryhausen would go on to create many memorable stop motion effects for a string of successful fantasy films over the next three decades.  These included ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953), ''[[It Came from Beneath the Sea]]'' (1955),  ''[[Jason and the Argonauts (1963 film)|Jason and the Argonauts]]'' (1963), ''[[The Golden Voyage of Sinbad]]'' (1973) and ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' (1981).\n\nIt wasn't until 1954 before a feature animated film with a technique other than cel animation was produced in the US. The first was the stop motion adaptation of 19th century composer [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s opera ''[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|H\u00e4nsel und Gretel]]'' as ''[[Hansel and Gretel: An Opera Fantasy]]''.\n\n[[Art Clokey]] started his adventures in clay with a freeform clay short film called ''Gumbasia'' (1955), which shortly thereafter propelled him into the production of his more structured TV series ''[[Gumby]]'' (1955\u20131989), with the iconic titular character. In partnership with the [[United Lutheran Church in America]], he also produced ''[[Davey and Goliath]]'' (1960\u20132004). The theatrical feature ''[[Gumby: The Movie]]'' (1992) was a [[box office bomb]].  \n\nOn 22 November 1959, the first episode of ''[[Sandm\u00e4nnchen|Unser Sandm\u00e4nchen (Our Little Sandman)]]'' was broadcast on [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk|DFF (East German television)]]. The 10-minute daily bedtime show for young children features the title character as an animated puppet, and other puppets in different segments. A very similar ''Sandm\u00e4nchen'' series, possibly conceived earlier, ran on West German television from 1 December 1959 until the [[German reunification]] in 1989. The East German show was continued on other German networks when DFF ended in 1991, and is one of the longest running animated series in the world.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The theatrical feature ''Das Sandm\u00e4nnchen \u2013 Abenteuer im Traumland'' (2010) was fully animated with stop motion puppets.\n\n===1960s and 1970s===\nJapanese puppet animator [[Tadahito Mochinaga]] started out as assistant animator in short anime (propaganda) films ''Arichan'' (1941) and ''[[Momotar\u014d no Umiwashi]]'' (1943). He fled to [[Manchukuo]] during the war and stayed in China afterwards. Due to the scarcity of paint and film stock shortly after the war, he decided to work with puppets and stop motion. His work helped popularize puppet animation in China, before he returned to Japan around 1953 where he continued working as animation director. In the 1960s he supervised the \"Animagic\" puppet animation for productions by Videocraft International, Ltd. (later called [[Rankin/Bass Productions]]) and [[Dentsu]], starting with the TV series ''[[The New Adventures of Pinocchio (TV series)|The New Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' (1960-1961). The TV special ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' has been telecasted annually since 1964 and has become one of the most beloved holiday films in the USA. They made three theatrical feature films ''[[Willy McBean and His Magic Machine]]'' (1965), ''[[The Daydreamer (film)|The Daydreamer]]'' (1966, stop motion / live-action) and ''[[Mad Monster Party?]]'' (1967) before the collaboration ended. \nRankin/Bass worked with other animators for more TV specials, with titles such as ''[[The Little Drummer Boy (film)|The Little Drummer Boy]]'' (1968), ''[[Santa Claus Is Comin' to Town (film)|Santa Claus is Comin' to Town]]'' (1970) and ''[[Here Comes Peter Cottontail]]'' (1971).\n\nBritish television has shown many stop motion series for young children since the 1960s. An early example is ''[[Snip and Snap]]'' (1960-1961) by [[John Halas]] in collaboration with Danish paper sculptor Thok S\u00f8ndergaard (Thoki Yenn) featured dog Snap, cut from a sheet of paper by pair of scissors Snip.\n\nApart from their cutout animation series, British studio [[Smallfilms]] ([[Peter Firmin]] and [[Oliver Postgate]]) produced several stop motion series with puppets, beginning with ''[[Pingwings]]'' (1961-1965) featuring penguin-like birds knitted by Peter's wife Joan and filmed on their farm (where most of their productions were filmed in an unused barn). It was followed by ''[[Pogles' Wood]]'' (1965-1967), ''[[Clangers]]'' (1969-1972, 1974, revived in 2015), ''[[Bagpuss]]'' (1974) and ''[[Tottie: The Story of a Doll's House]]'' (1984).\n\nFrench animator [[Serge Danot]] created ''[[The Magic Roundabout]]'' (1965) which played for many years on the [[BBC]].\n\nPolish studio [[Se-ma-for]] produced popular TV series with animated puppets in adaptations of ''[[Colargol]]'' (''Barnaby the Bear'' in the UK, ''Jeremy'' in Canada) (1967-1974) and ''[[The Moomins (TV series)|The Moomins]]'' (1977-1982).\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, independent clay animator [[Eli Noyes|Eliot Noyes Jr.]] refined the technique of \"free-form\" clay animation with his Oscar-nominated 1965 film ''Clay (or the Origin of Species)''. Noyes also used stop motion to animate sand lying on glass for his musical animated film ''Sandman'' (1975).\n\nItalian director Francesco Misseri created the clay animation TV series ''[[Mio Mao]]'' (1970-1976, 2002-2007), ''[[The Red and the Blue (series)|Il Rosso e il Blu (The Red and the Blue)]]'' (1976), and a TV series with an animated [[origami]] duck ''[[Quaq Quao]]'' (1978-1979).\n\nThe British artists Brian Cosgrove and Mark Hall ([[Cosgrove Hall Films]]) produced two stop-motion animated adaptions of [[Enid Blyton]]'s ''Noddy'' book series, including the original series of the same name (1975\u20131982) and ''[[Noddy's Toyland Adventures]]'' (1992\u20132001), a full-length film ''[[The Wind in the Willows (1983 film)|The Wind in the Willows]]'' (1983) and later a [[The Wind in the Willows (TV-series)|multi-season TV series]], both based on [[Kenneth Grahame]]'s [[The Wind in the Willows|classic children's book]] of the same title. They also produced a documentary of their production techniques, ''[[Making Frog and Toad]]''.\n\nIn 1975, filmmaker and clay animation experimenter [[Will Vinton]] joined with sculptor [[Bob Gardiner (animator)|Bob Gardiner]] to create an experimental film called ''Closed Mondays'' which became the first stop-motion film to win an Oscar. Will Vinton followed with several other successful short film experiments including ''The Great Cognito'', ''Creation'', and ''Rip Van Winkle'' which were each nominated for Academy Awards.  In 1977, Vinton made a documentary about this process and his style of animation which he dubbed \"claymation\"; he titled the documentary ''Claymation''.  Soon after this documentary, the term was trademarked by Vinton to differentiate his team's work from others who had been, or were beginning to do, \"clay animation\".  While the word has stuck and is often used to describe clay animation and stop motion, it remains a trademark owned currently by Laika Entertainment, Inc. Twenty clay-animation episodes featuring the clown [[Mr. Bill]] were a feature of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', starting from a first appearance in February 1976.\n\nAt very much the same time in the UK, [[Peter Lord]] and [[David Sproxton]] formed [[Aardman Animations]] that would produce many commercials, TV series, short films and eventually also feature films. In 1976 they created the character [[Morph (animation)|Morph]] who appeared as an animated side-kick to the TV presenter [[Tony Hart]] on his [[BBC TV]] programme [[Take Hart]]. The five-inch-high presenter was made from a traditional British modelling clay called [[Plasticine]]. In 1977 they started on a series of animated films, again using modelling clay, but this time made for a more adult audience. The soundtrack for [[Down and Out (1977 film)|Down and Out]] was recorded in a Salvation Army Hostel and Plasticine puppets were animated to dramatise the dialogue. A second film, also for the BBC followed in 1978. A TV series [[The Amazing Adventures of Morph]] was aired in 1980. They also produced a notable [[music video]] for \"[[Sledgehammer (Peter Gabriel song)#Music video|Sledgehammer]]\", a song by [[Peter Gabriel]].\n\nSand-coated puppet animation was used in the Oscar-winning 1977 film ''[[The Sand Castle (film)|The Sand Castle]]'', produced by Dutch-Canadian animator [[Co Hoedeman]]. Hoedeman was one of dozens of animators sheltered by the [[National Film Board of Canada]], a Canadian government film arts agency that had supported animators for decades. A pioneer of refined multiple stop-motion films under the NFB banner was [[Norman McLaren]], who brought in many other animators to create their own creatively controlled films. Notable among these are the [[pinscreen animation]] films of Jacques Drouin, made with the original pinscreen donated by [[Alexandre Alexeieff and Claire Parker]].\n\nCzechoslovak filmmakers [[Lubom\u00edr Bene\u0161]] and [[Vladim\u00edr Jir\u00e1nek]] debuted their animated puppet characters ''[[Pat & Mat]]'', two inventive but clumsy neighbors, in the 7-minute short ''Kutaci'' in 1976. Since 1979, over 100 episodes have been broadcast irregularly.<ref>{{Citation|title=Pat & Mat (TV Series 1976\u20132018) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0841929/episodes|access-date=2020-01-23}}</ref> Since 2014, new episodes were presented in theatrically released package films. The series became very popular in several countries, especially in The Netherlands, the only country where the characters are voiced. \n\nOne of the main British animation teams, John Hardwick and Bob Bura, were the main animators in many early British TV shows, and are famous for their work on the ''[[Trumptonshire]]'' trilogy.\n\nDisney experimented with several stop-motion techniques by hiring independent animator-director [[Mike Jittlov]] to make the first stop-motion animation of [[Mickey Mouse]] toys ever produced, in a short sequence called ''Mouse Mania'', part of a TV special, ''Mickey's 50'', which commemorated Mickey's 50th anniversary in 1978. Jittlov again produced some impressive multi-technique stop-motion animation a year later for a 1979 Disney special promoting their release of the feature film ''[[The Black Hole]]''. Titled ''Major Effects'', Jittlov's work stood out as the best part of the special. Jittlov released his footage the following year to 16mm film collectors as a short film titled ''[[The Wizard of Speed and Time]]'', along with four of his other short multi-technique animated films, most of which eventually evolved into his own feature-length film of the same title. Effectively demonstrating almost all animation techniques, as well as how he produced them, the film was released to theaters in 1987 and to video in 1989.\n\n===1980s to present===\n[[File:Stefano Bessoni Canti 2014.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Stefano Bessoni]], Italian filmmaker, illustrator and stop-motion animator working on ''Gallows Songs'' (2014)]]\n/0-In the 1970s and 1980s, [[Industrial Light & Magic]] often used stop-motion model animation in such films as the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' trilogy: the chess sequence in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the Tauntauns and AT-AT walkers in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', and the AT-ST walkers in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' were all filmed using stop-motion animation, with the latter two films utilising [[go motion]]: an invention from renowned visual effects veteran [[Phil Tippett]]. The many shots including the ghosts in ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' and the first two feature films in the ''[[RoboCop]]'' series use Tippett's go motion.\n\nIn the UK, Aardman Animations continued to grow. [[Channel 4]] funded a new series of clay animated films, ''[[Conversation Pieces]]'', using recorded soundtracks of real people talking. A further series in 1986, called ''Lip Sync'', premiered the work of [[Richard Goleszowski]] (''Ident''), [[Barry Purves]] (''Next''), and [[Nick Park]] (''[[Creature Comforts]]''), as well as further films by Sproxton and Lord. ''Creature Comforts'' won the Oscar for Best Animated Short in 1990.\n\nIn 1980, [[Marc Paul Chinoy]] directed the 1st feature-length clay animated film, based on the famous ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' comic strip. Titled ''I go Pogo''. It was aired a few times on American cable channels but has yet to be commercially released. Primarily clay, some characters required armatures, and walk cycles used pre-sculpted hard bases legs. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Priebe|first=Ken A.|title=The Advanced Art of Stop-Motion Animation|publisher=Course Technology|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4354-5613-6|location=Boston|pages=25}}</ref>\n\nStop motion was also used for some shots of the final sequence of ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' movie, also for the scenes of the small alien ships in [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]'s ''[[Batteries Not Included (film)|Batteries Not Included]]'' in 1987, animated by [[David W. Allen]]. Allen's stop-motion work can also be seen in such feature films as ''[[The Crater Lake Monster]]'' (1977), ''[[Q (1982 film)|Q - The Winged Serpent]]'' (1982), ''[[The Gate (1987 film)|The Gate]]'' (1987) and ''Freaked'' (1993). Allen's King Kong [[Volkswagen]] commercial from the 1970s is now legendary among model animation enthusiasts.\n\nIn 1985, [[Will Vinton]] and his team released an ambitious feature film in stop motion called \"The Adventures Of Mark Twain\" based on the life and works of the famous American author.  While the film may have been a little sophisticated for young audiences at the time, it got rave reviews from critics and adults in general.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}  Vinton's team also created the Nomes and the Nome King for Disney's \"Return to Oz\" feature, for which they received an Academy Award Nomination for Special Visual Effects.  In the 1980s and early 1990s, Will Vinton became very well known for his commercial work as well with stop-motion campaigns including [[The California Raisins]].\n\nFrom 1986 to 1991, [[Churchill Films]] produced ''[[The Mouse and the Motorcycle]]'', ''[[Runaway Ralph]]'', and ''[[Ralph S. Mouse]]'' for ABC television. The shows featured stop-motion characters combined with live action, based on the books of Beverly Cleary. John Clark Matthews was the animation director, with Justin Kohn, Joel Fletcher, and Gail Van Der Merwe providing character animation.<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196767/, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094541/, https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0196895/</ref> The company also produced other films based on children's books.\n\nOf note are the films of Czech filmmaker [[Jan \u0160vankmajer]], which mix stop motion and live actors. These include ''[[Alice (1988 film)|Alice]]'', an adaptation of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'', and ''[[Faust (1994 film)|Faust]]'', a rendition of [[Faust|the legend of the German scholar]]. \n\nFrom 1986 to 2000, [[List of Pingu episodes|over 150 five-minute episodes]] of ''[[Pingu]]'', a Swiss [[children's television program|children's]] [[animated comedy|comedy]] were produced by [[Trickfilmstudio]].\n\n''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', directed by [[Henry Selick]] and produced by [[Tim Burton]], was one of the more widely released stop-motion features and become  the highest grossing stop-motion animated movie of its time, grossing over $50 million domestic. Henry Selick also went on to direct ''[[James and the Giant Peach (film)|James and the Giant Peach]]'' and ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'', and Tim Burton went on to direct ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' and ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]''.\n\nIn the 1990s [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] made two shorts and the pilot of ''[[South Park]]'' almost entirely out of [[construction paper]].\n\nIn 1999, Will Vinton launched the first prime-time stop-motion television series called ''[[The PJs]]'', co-created by actor-comedian [[Eddie Murphy]].  The Emmy-winning sitcom aired on Fox for two seasons, then moved to the WB for an additional season. Vinton launched another series, ''[[Gary & Mike]]'', for UPN in 2001.\n\nIn 1999, [[Tsuneo G\u014dda]] directed official 30-second sketches of the character [[Domo (NHK)|Domo]]. With the shorts animated by stop-motion studio [[Dwarf (animation)|dwarf]] is still currently produced in [[Japan]] and has then received universal critical acclaim from fans and critics. G\u014dda also directed the stop-motion movie series ''Komaneko'' in 2004.\n\nAnother individual who found fame in clay animation is [[Nick Park]], who created the characters [[Wallace and Gromit]]. In addition to a series of award-winning shorts and featurettes, he won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] for the feature-length outing ''[[Wallace & Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit]]''. ''[[Chicken Run]]'', to date, is the highest grossing stop motion animated movie ever grossing nearly $225 million worldwide.\n\nThe BBC commissioned thirteen episodes of stop frame animated ''[[Summerton Mill]]'' in 2004 as inserts into their flagship pre-school program, ''[[Tikkabilla]]''. Created and produced by Pete Bryden and Ed Cookson, the series was then given its own slot on BBC1 and BBC2 and has been broadcast extensively around the world.\n\nOther notable stop-motion feature films released since 1990 include ''[[The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb]]'' (1993), ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' and ''[[$9.99]]'', both released in 2009, and ''[[Anomalisa]]'' (2015). As of 2019, stop motion is thriving even in a filmmaking world dominated by [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] despite the efforts needed by the animators.<ref>https://www.fandom.com/articles/breaking-the-mold-stop-motion</ref>\n\nIn 2003, the pilot film for the series ''[[Curucuru and Friends]]'', produced by Korean studio Ffango Entertoyment is greenlighted into a [[children's television program|children's]] animated series in 2004 after an approval with the Gyeonggi Digital Contents Agency. It was aired in [[KBS1]] on November 24, 2006 and won the 13th Korean Animation Awards in 2007 for Best Animation.

The first 3D stop-motion short was ''In Tune With Tomorrow'' (also known as ''Motor Rhythm''), made in 1939 by John Norling. The second stereoscopic stop-motion release was ''The Adventures of Sam Space'' in 1955 by Paul Sprunck. The third and latest stop motion short in stereo 3D was ''The Incredible Invasion of the 20,000 Giant Robots from Outer Space'' in 2000 by Elmer Kaan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmerkaan.com|title=Elmer Kaan |publisher=Elmer Kaan |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> and Alexander Lentjes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moonridge5.com/credits_alexander_lentjes.html |title=Alexander Lentjes |publisher=Moonridge5.com |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=3-D Revolution Productions |url=http://www.the3drevolution.com/animation.html |title=Animation |publisher=The3drevolution.com |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref> This is also the first ever 3D stereoscopic stop motion and CGI short in the history of film. The first all stop-motion 3D feature is ''[[Coraline (film)|Coraline]]'' (2009), based on [[Neil Gaiman]]'s [[Coraline|best-selling novel]] and directed by Henry Selick.\nAnother recent example is the [[Nintendo 3DS]] video software which comes with the option for Stop Motion videos. This has been released December 8, 2011 as a 3DS system update. Also, the movie ParaNorman is in 3D stop motion.\n\n===Go motion===\n{{Main| Go motion}}\n\nAnother more complicated variation on stop motion is [[go motion]], co-developed by [[Phil Tippett]] and first used on the films ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), ''[[Dragonslayer (1981 film)|Dragonslayer]]'' (1981), and the ''[[RoboCop]]'' films. Go motion involved programming a computer to move parts of a model slightly during each exposure of each frame of film, combined with traditional hand manipulation of the model in between frames, to produce a more realistic [[motion blur]]ring effect. Tippett also used the process extensively in his 1984 short film ''[[Prehistoric Beast]]'', a 10 minutes long sequence depicting a herbivorous dinosaur (''[[Monoclonius]]''), being chased by a carnivorous one (''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''). With new footage ''Prehistoric Beast'' became ''[[Dinosaur!]]'' in 1985, a full-length dinosaurs documentary hosted by [[Christopher Reeve]]. Those Phil Tippett's go motion tests acted as motion models for his first photo-realistic use of computers to depict dinosaurs in ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' in 1993. A low-tech, manual version of this blurring technique was originally pioneered by [[Ladislas Starevich|Wladyslaw Starewicz]] in the silent era, and was used in his feature film ''[[The Tale of the Fox]]'' (1931).\n\n==Comparison to computer-generated imagery==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2015}}\nReasons for using stop motion instead of the more advanced [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) include the low entry price and the appeal of its distinct look. It is now mostly used in children's programming, in commercials and some comic shows such as ''[[Robot Chicken]]''. Another merit of stop motion is that it legitimately displays actual real-life textures, as CGI texturing is more artificial, therefore not quite as close to realism. This is appreciated by a number of animation directors, such as [[Tim Burton]], [[Henry Selick]], [[Wes Anderson]], and [[Travis Knight (animator)|Travis Knight]].\n\n==Stop motion in other media==\nMany young people begin their experiments in movie making with stop motion, thanks to the ease of modern stop-motion software and online video publishing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claynation.co.uk/about/ |title=About ClayNation stop motion animation |publisher=ClayNation.co.uk |accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref> Many new stop-motion shorts use clay animation into a new form.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blu-tack.co.uk/filmmaker |title=Blu-Tack - Make Our Next Advert |publisher=Blu-tack.co.uk |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211035210/http://www.blu-tack.co.uk/filmmaker |archivedate=2010-02-11 }}</ref>\n\nSinger-songwriter [[Oren Lavie]]'s music video for the song [[Her Morning Elegance]] was posted on YouTube on January 19, 2009.  The video, directed by Lavie and Yuval and Merav Nathan, uses stop motion and has achieved great success with over 25.4 million views, also earning a 2010 Grammy Award nomination for \"Best Short Form Music Video\".\n\nStop motion has occasionally been used to create the characters for computer games, as an alternative to CGI. The [[Virgin Interactive Entertainment]] [[Mythos Games|Mythos]] game [[Magic and Mayhem]] (1998) featured creatures built by stop-motion specialist Alan Friswell, who made the miniature figures from modelling clay and latex rubber, over armatures of wire and ball-and-socket joints. The models were then animated one frame at a time, and incorporated into the CGI elements of the game through digital photography. \"[[ClayFighter]]\" for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[The Neverhood]] for the [[Personal computer|PC]] are other examples.\n\nScientists at IBM used a [[scanning tunneling microscope]] to single out and move individual atoms which were used to make characters in ''[[A Boy and His Atom]]''. This was the tiniest scale stop-motion video made at that time.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation}}\n* [[Still motion]]\n* [[Brickfilm]]\n* [[Time-lapse photography]]\n\n== References ==\n; Sources\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lord |first=Peter |title=Creating 3-D animation: The Aardman Book of Filmmaking |year=1998 |publisher=Harry N.

[[NASA]] began work on a [[Grand Tour program|Grand Tour]], which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival through the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two Mariner-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open.<ref name=ESBS/>{{rp|263}} As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.<ref>[https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html Planetary Voyage] [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] \u2013 California Institute of Technology. March 23, 2004. Retrieved April 8, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe primary mission of Voyager 1 was to explore Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Voyager 2 was also to explore Jupiter and Saturn, but on a trajectory that would have the option of continuing on to Uranus and Neptune, or being redirected to Titan as a backup for Voyager 1. Upon successful completion of Voyager 1<nowiki>'</nowiki>s objectives, Voyager 2 would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards Uranus and Neptune.<ref name=ESBS>{{cite book |last1=Butrica |first1=Andrew |title=From Engineering Science to Big Science |page=267 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter11.html |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |quote=Despite the name change, Voyager remained in many ways the Grand Tour concept, though certainly not the Grand Tour (TOPS) spacecraft. Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977, followed by Voyager 1 on September 5, 1977. The decision to reverse the order of launch had to do with keeping open the possibility of carrying out the Grand Tour mission to Uranus, Neptune, and beyond. Voyager 2, if boosted by the maximum performance from the Titan-Centaur, could just barely catch the old Grand Tour trajectory and encounter Uranus. Two weeks later, Voyager 1 would leave on an easier and much faster trajectory, visiting Jupiter and Saturn only. Voyager 1 would arrive at Jupiter four months ahead of Voyager 2, then arrive at Saturn nine months earlier. Hence, the second spacecraft launched was Voyager 1, not Voyager 2. The two Voyagers would arrive at Saturn nine months apart, so that if Voyager 1 failed to achieve its Saturn objectives, for whatever reason, Voyager 2 still could be retargeted to achieve them, though at the expense of any subsequent Uranus or Neptune encounter.}}</ref>\n\n===Spacecraft design===\nConstructed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), Voyager 2 included 16 [[hydrazine]] thrusters, [[three-axis stabilization]], [[gyroscopes]] and celestial referencing instruments (Sun sensor/[[Canopus]] Star Tracker) to maintain pointing of the [[high-gain antenna]] toward Earth.

The backup receiver was functional, but a failed capacitor in the receiver meant that it could only receive transmissions that were sent at a precise frequency, and this frequency would be affected by the Earth's rotation (due to the [[Doppler effect]]) and the onboard receiver's temperature, among other things.<ref name=\"New-Scientist_January-31-1985\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System |last=Littmann |first=Mark |year=2004 |publisher=[[Courier Corporation]] |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoJMadct4TQC&pg=PA106 |isbn=978-0-486-43602-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Voyage to the tilted planet |last=Davies |first=John |date=January 23, 1986 |page=42 |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYIJJP7audkC&pg=PA42}}</ref> For each subsequent transmission to Voyager 2, it was necessary for engineers to calculate the specific frequency for the signal so that it could be received by the spacecraft.\n<!--too editorial, complete rewrite necessary\n\n===Complications===\nSome weeks later, the ground controllers for the Voyager program became engrossed in an early post-launch problem with Voyager 1, and they forgot to send an important updating code to Voyager 2. (These space probes had been programmed to expect a radio message of some kind from the [[Deep Space Network]] at least once per week to verify that their radio systems were still working.) This failure to receive a radio message caused Voyager 2 to shut down its primary radio receiver, and to switch over to its identical back-up receiver, which had a subtle defect in it. In the process of switching back and forth between the receivers a few times, a fuse in the DC power supply of the primary receiver blew, permanently disabling it. Thus the back-up receiver had to be relied upon for the entire mission.\n\nFortunately, after waiting one more week, Voyager 2 automatically switched to its back-up radio receiver once more, and the Deep Space Network radio engineers were able to re-establish contact through the spacecraft's back-up radio receiver. This radio receiver has remained somewhat \"finicky\" ever since then, but it has been \"nursemaided\" along technically, and it has never failed. Also, periodically, files of procedures for Voyager 2 to follow in the future have been uploaded via the Deep Space Network to give Voyager 2' a sketchy plan of what to do for many months, in case the radio receiver ever did permanently fail, cutting off all messages from the Earth to Voyager 2.\n\nHowever, the back-up radio receiver for Voyager 2 has not failed, and it remains in operation as of November 28, 2009. There has never been a problem with the two radio receivers for Voyager 1, or any problem with the X-band [[traveling wave tube]] transmitters for either Voyager 1 or Voyager 2.\n\nVoyager 2's gyroscopes and its computer were operational during its Titan/Centaur launch phase, monitoring the sequence of events, in order for those systems to take over the space probe's [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]] and other functions upon separation from the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage. But at that point, the unexpected happened: Voyager 2's computer experienced robotic \"vertigo\". In its confusion, it helplessly switched to backup sensors, presuming its \"senses\" to be defective.\n\nVoyager 2's disoriented flight-control computer remained disconnected from Voyager's powerful thrusters at this point, so it did not cause damage to the launch during the launching itself. The Centaur's attitude-control system stayed in charge, suffering no \"vertigo\" and, as planned, it electronically corrected the disequilibrium of the Voyager's computer just before separation.\n\nFrom the spacecraft's control center, engineers and technicians helplessly watched the antics of Voyager 2's disoriented computer. One hour and 11 minutes after lift-off, Voyager 2's own dedicated solid rocket fired for 45 seconds, to supply the final increment of [[momentum]] that it needed to get to Jupiter.\n\nOne-and-one-half minutes after Voyager 2's key rocket burn ended, the three-meter-long articulating arm holding the television camera and other remote-sensing instruments unlatched and deployed as planned. After this, Voyager 2's computer once again sensed an emergency for some reason. This time it switched to a different set of thrusters and activated valves to control the tiny bursts of gas that stabilized its attitude in space. Voyager 2's robotic \"alter ego\" (its executive program) then challenged portions of its own computer in a frantic attempt to correct the orientation failure that it sensed.\n\nAt this point, Voyager 2 followed the normal procedures that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers had installed in the computer to cope with the most dreaded emergency for a robot spacecraft in deep space\u2014attitude-control disorientation. Voyager 2 shut down most communications with the Earth in order to begin its reorientation.\n\nSeventy-nine minutes passed while Voyager 2 struggled alone and unaided to find the Sun with a light sensor and to establish a known orientation point. Finally, Voyager 2 radioed back to the Earth that it was operating normally. It was unknown at this point if the redundant sensors were malfunctioning, or if its on-board digital computer was defective.\n\nThe fault protection in Voyager 2's computer was operating at this point on the now-painful assumption that it would be triggered only by a hardware failure hundreds of millions of miles from Earth. In that event, Voyager 2 would be unable to establish even emergency communications with its human flight controllers, who could not help it much at that distance, in any case.\n\nVoyager 2 had been programmed to virtually shut off communications with the Earth during such deep-space emergencies and to attempt to fix itself. Somehow, these procedures had been triggered right after the launching, when they should not have been. There had been no hardware problems in the computer\u2014just a slight but serious mis-setting of attitude-control parameters in the on-board computer.\n-->\n\n===Encounter with Jupiter===\n{{main|Exploration of Jupiter}}\n[[File:Voyager-2 Jupiter-flyby July-10-1979.png|thumb|The trajectory of Voyager 2 through the Jovian system]]\nVoyager 2{{'}}s closest approach to Jupiter occurred at 22:29 UT on July 9, 1979.<ref name=NASAVoyager2/> It came within {{convert|570,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the planet's cloud tops.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/history/70s/Voyager2_1979.htm |title=History |website=www.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> \nJupiter's [[Great Red Spot]] was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction.

[[NASA]] began work on a [[Grand Tour program|Grand Tour]], which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with redundant systems to ensure survival through the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two Mariner-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open.<ref name=ESBS/>{{rp|263}} As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.<ref>[https://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov/science/planetary.html Planetary Voyage] [[NASA]] [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] \u2013 California Institute of Technology. March 23, 2004. Retrieved April 8, 2007.</ref>\n\nThe primary mission of Voyager 1 was to explore Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. Voyager 2 was also to explore Jupiter and Saturn, but on a trajectory that would have the option of continuing on to Uranus and Neptune, or being redirected to Titan as a backup for Voyager 1. Upon successful completion of Voyager 1<nowiki>'</nowiki>s objectives, Voyager 2 would get a mission extension to send the probe on towards Uranus and Neptune.<ref name=ESBS>{{cite book |last1=Butrica |first1=Andrew |title=From Engineering Science to Big Science |page=267 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4219/Chapter11.html |accessdate=September 4, 2015 |quote=Despite the name change, Voyager remained in many ways the Grand Tour concept, though certainly not the Grand Tour (TOPS) spacecraft. Voyager 2 was launched on August 20, 1977, followed by Voyager 1 on September 5, 1977. The decision to reverse the order of launch had to do with keeping open the possibility of carrying out the Grand Tour mission to Uranus, Neptune, and beyond. Voyager 2, if boosted by the maximum performance from the Titan-Centaur, could just barely catch the old Grand Tour trajectory and encounter Uranus. Two weeks later, Voyager 1 would leave on an easier and much faster trajectory, visiting Jupiter and Saturn only. Voyager 1 would arrive at Jupiter four months ahead of Voyager 2, then arrive at Saturn nine months earlier. Hence, the second spacecraft launched was Voyager 1, not Voyager 2. The two Voyagers would arrive at Saturn nine months apart, so that if Voyager 1 failed to achieve its Saturn objectives, for whatever reason, Voyager 2 still could be retargeted to achieve them, though at the expense of any subsequent Uranus or Neptune encounter.}}</ref>\n\n===Spacecraft design===\nConstructed by the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), Voyager 2 included 16 [[hydrazine]] thrusters, [[three-axis stabilization]], [[gyroscopes]] and celestial referencing instruments (Sun sensor/[[Canopus]] Star Tracker) to maintain pointing of the [[high-gain antenna]] toward Earth. Collectively these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS) along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects as it traveled through space.<ref name=\"PDS-Host\">{{cite web |url=https://starbrite.jpl.nasa.gov/ds-view/pds/viewHostProfile.jsp?INSTRUMENT_HOST_ID=VG2 |title=VOYAGER 2:Host Information |date=1989 |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Communications====\nBuilt with the intent for eventual interstellar travel, Voyager 2 included a large, {{convert|3.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} parabolic, [[high-gain antenna]] ([[:File:Voyager Program - High-gain antenna diagram.png|see diagram]]) to transceive data via the [[Deep Space Network]] on [[the Earth]].

The backup receiver was functional, but a failed capacitor in the receiver meant that it could only receive transmissions that were sent at a precise frequency, and this frequency would be affected by the Earth's rotation (due to the [[Doppler effect]]) and the onboard receiver's temperature, among other things.<ref name=\"New-Scientist_January-31-1985\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Planets Beyond: Discovering the Outer Solar System |last=Littmann |first=Mark |year=2004 |publisher=[[Courier Corporation]] |page=106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RoJMadct4TQC&pg=PA106 |isbn=978-0-486-43602-9}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Voyage to the tilted planet |last=Davies |first=John |date=January 23, 1986 |page=42 |magazine=New Scientist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYIJJP7audkC&pg=PA42}}</ref> For each subsequent transmission to Voyager 2, it was necessary for engineers to calculate the specific frequency for the signal so that it could be received by the spacecraft.\n<!--too editorial, complete rewrite necessary\n\n===Complications===\nSome weeks later, the ground controllers for the Voyager program became engrossed in an early post-launch problem with Voyager 1, and they forgot to send an important updating code to Voyager 2. (These space probes had been programmed to expect a radio message of some kind from the [[Deep Space Network]] at least once per week to verify that their radio systems were still working.) This failure to receive a radio message caused Voyager 2 to shut down its primary radio receiver, and to switch over to its identical back-up receiver, which had a subtle defect in it. In the process of switching back and forth between the receivers a few times, a fuse in the DC power supply of the primary receiver blew, permanently disabling it. Thus the back-up receiver had to be relied upon for the entire mission.\n\nFortunately, after waiting one more week, Voyager 2 automatically switched to its back-up radio receiver once more, and the Deep Space Network radio engineers were able to re-establish contact through the spacecraft's back-up radio receiver. This radio receiver has remained somewhat \"finicky\" ever since then, but it has been \"nursemaided\" along technically, and it has never failed. Also, periodically, files of procedures for Voyager 2 to follow in the future have been uploaded via the Deep Space Network to give Voyager 2' a sketchy plan of what to do for many months, in case the radio receiver ever did permanently fail, cutting off all messages from the Earth to Voyager 2.\n\nHowever, the back-up radio receiver for Voyager 2 has not failed, and it remains in operation as of November 28, 2009. There has never been a problem with the two radio receivers for Voyager 1, or any problem with the X-band [[traveling wave tube]] transmitters for either Voyager 1 or Voyager 2.\n\nVoyager 2's gyroscopes and its computer were operational during its Titan/Centaur launch phase, monitoring the sequence of events, in order for those systems to take over the space probe's [[Attitude dynamics and control|attitude control]] and other functions upon separation from the [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]] upper stage. But at that point, the unexpected happened: Voyager 2's computer experienced robotic \"vertigo\". In its confusion, it helplessly switched to backup sensors, presuming its \"senses\" to be defective.\n\nVoyager 2's disoriented flight-control computer remained disconnected from Voyager's powerful thrusters at this point, so it did not cause damage to the launch during the launching itself. The Centaur's attitude-control system stayed in charge, suffering no \"vertigo\" and, as planned, it electronically corrected the disequilibrium of the Voyager's computer just before separation.\n\nFrom the spacecraft's control center, engineers and technicians helplessly watched the antics of Voyager 2's disoriented computer. One hour and 11 minutes after lift-off, Voyager 2's own dedicated solid rocket fired for 45 seconds, to supply the final increment of [[momentum]] that it needed to get to Jupiter.\n\nOne-and-one-half minutes after Voyager 2's key rocket burn ended, the three-meter-long articulating arm holding the television camera and other remote-sensing instruments unlatched and deployed as planned. After this, Voyager 2's computer once again sensed an emergency for some reason. This time it switched to a different set of thrusters and activated valves to control the tiny bursts of gas that stabilized its attitude in space. Voyager 2's robotic \"alter ego\" (its executive program) then challenged portions of its own computer in a frantic attempt to correct the orientation failure that it sensed.\n\nAt this point, Voyager 2 followed the normal procedures that the Jet Propulsion Laboratory engineers had installed in the computer to cope with the most dreaded emergency for a robot spacecraft in deep space\u2014attitude-control disorientation. Voyager 2 shut down most communications with the Earth in order to begin its reorientation.\n\nSeventy-nine minutes passed while Voyager 2 struggled alone and unaided to find the Sun with a light sensor and to establish a known orientation point. Finally, Voyager 2 radioed back to the Earth that it was operating normally. It was unknown at this point if the redundant sensors were malfunctioning, or if its on-board digital computer was defective.\n\nThe fault protection in Voyager 2's computer was operating at this point on the now-painful assumption that it would be triggered only by a hardware failure hundreds of millions of miles from Earth. In that event, Voyager 2 would be unable to establish even emergency communications with its human flight controllers, who could not help it much at that distance, in any case.\n\nVoyager 2 had been programmed to virtually shut off communications with the Earth during such deep-space emergencies and to attempt to fix itself. Somehow, these procedures had been triggered right after the launching, when they should not have been. There had been no hardware problems in the computer\u2014just a slight but serious mis-setting of attitude-control parameters in the on-board computer.\n-->\n\n===Encounter with Jupiter===\n{{main|Exploration of Jupiter}}\n[[File:Voyager-2 Jupiter-flyby July-10-1979.png|thumb|The trajectory of Voyager 2 through the Jovian system]]\nVoyager 2{{'}}s closest approach to Jupiter occurred at 22:29 UT on July 9, 1979.<ref name=NASAVoyager2/> It came within {{convert|570,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the planet's cloud tops.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/history/70s/Voyager2_1979.htm |title=History |website=www.jpl.nasa.gov}}</ref> \nJupiter's [[Great Red Spot]] was revealed as a complex storm moving in a counterclockwise direction.

Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.

One critic noted Dal\u00ed's precise draftsmanship and attention to detail, describing him as a \"paranoiac of geometrical temperament\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 314-15</ref> Dal\u00ed's first New York exhibition was held at Julien Levy's gallery in November-December 1933. The exhibition featured twenty-six works and was a commercial and critical success. The ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' critic praised the precision and lack of sentimentality in the works, calling them \"frozen nightmares.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p316</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed and Gala, having lived together since 1929, were civilly married on 30 January 1934 in Paris.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 323</ref> They later remarried in a Church ceremony on 8 August 1958 at [[Sant Mart\u00ed Vell]].<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p. 492</ref> In addition to inspiring many artworks throughout her life, Gala would act as Dal\u00ed's [[business manager]], supporting their extravagant lifestyle while adeptly steering clear of insolvency. Gala, who herself engaged in extra-marital affairs,<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 421-22, 508-10, 620-21</ref> seemed to tolerate Dal\u00ed's dalliances with younger muses, secure in her own position as his primary relationship. Dal\u00ed continued to paint her as they both aged, producing sympathetic and adoring images of her. The \"tense, complex and ambiguous relationship\" lasting over 50 years would later become the subject of an opera, ''Jo, Dal\u00ed'' (''I, Dal\u00ed'') by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] composer Xavier Benguerel.<ref name=\"Opera\">{{cite web|last=Amengual|first=Margalida|title=An opera on the relationship between Salvador Dal\u00ed and Gala arrives at Barcelona's Liceu|url=http://www.catalannewsagency.com/culture/item/an-opera-on-the-relationship-between-salvador-dali-and-gala-arrives-at-barcelonas-liceu|work=Catalan News Agency (CNA)|publisher=Intracatal\u00f2nia, SA|accessdate=27 May 2012|date=14 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nDal\u00ed's first visit to the United States in November 1934 attracted widespread press coverage.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will.

While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career.

Dal\u00ed was angered by passages which he considered derogatory towards his wife Gala and broke off relations with his family. When Dal\u00ed's father died in September 1950 Dal\u00ed learned that he had been virtually disinherited in his will.

Other designs Dal\u00ed made for her include a shoe-shaped hat, and a pink belt with lips for a buckle. He was also involved in creating textile designs and perfume bottles.

The Comte de Grandsailles and Solange de Cl\u00e9da pursue a love affair, but interwar political turmoil and other vicissitudes drive them apart. It is variously set in [[Paris]], rural France, [[Casablanca]] in North Africa and [[Palm Springs]] in the United States. Secondary characters include aging widow Barbara Rogers, her bisexual daughter Veronica, Veronica's sometime female lover Betka, and Baba, a disfigured US fighter pilot.<ref>Salvador Dal\u00ed: ''Hidden faces'': London: Owen: 1973</ref> The novel was written in New York, and translated by [[Haakon Chevalier]].\n\nHis other, nonfictional literary works include ''[[The Secret Life of Salvador Dal\u00ed]]'' (1942), ''Diary of a Genius'' (1966), and ''Oui: The Paranoid-Critical Revolution'' (1971). Dal\u00ed also published poetry, essays, art criticism and a technical manual on art.\n\n=== Graphic arts ===\nThe artist worked extensively in the [[graphic arts]], producing many etchings and [[lithograph]]s. While his early work in printmaking is equal in quality to his important paintings, as he grew older he would sell the rights to images but not be involved in the print production itself. In addition, a large number of fakes were produced in the 1980s and 1990s, thus further confusing the Dal\u00ed print market.<ref name=\"Forde_170\">Forde, Kevin (2011).

In 1931 he became involved in the [[Workers and Peasants' Bloc|Wokers' and Peasants' Front]], delivering lectures at meetings and contributing to their party journal.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 287-89</ref> However, as political divisions within the Surrealist movement grew, Dal\u00ed soon developed a more apolitical stance, refusing to publicly denounce fascism. In 1934 Andre Breton accused him of being sympathetic to Hitler, and Dal\u00ed narrowly avoided being expelled from the movement.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 320-25</ref> After the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 Dal\u00ed avoided taking a public stand for or against the Republic.<ref name=\":4\" /> However, immediately after Franco's victory in 1939 Dal\u00ed praised Catholicism and the Falange and was expelled from the Surrealist movement.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nAfter Dal\u00ed's return to his native Catalonia in 1948 he publicly supported Franco's regime and announced his return to the Catholic faith.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 448, 465-66</ref> Dal\u00ed was granted an audience with Pope Pius XII in 1949 and with Pope John XXIII in 1959.

He stated that as a child he saw a book with graphic illustrations of venereal diseases and this provoked a lifelong disgust of female genitalia and a fear of impotence and sexual intimacy. Dal\u00ed frequently stated that his main sexual activity involved voyeurism and masturbation and his preferred sexual orifice was the anus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 71-74,166, 232, 280-81</ref> Dal\u00ed said that his wife Gala was the only person with whom he had achieved complete coitus.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997), p 231</ref> From 1927 Dal\u00ed's work featured graphic and symbolic sexual images usually associated with other images evoking shame and disgust. Images of anality and excrement also abound in his work from this time. Some of the most notable works reflecting these themes include ''The First Days of Spring'' (1929), ''The Great Masturbator'' (1929) and ''The Lugubrious Game'' (1929). Several of Dal\u00ed's intimates in the 1960s and 1970s have stated that he would arrange for selected guests to perform choreographed sexual activities to aid his voyeurism and masturbation.<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 534</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=http://living.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=869862007|title=Scotsman review of Dirty Dal\u00ed|work=The Scotsman|location=UK|accessdate=22 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sewell|first=Brian|date=1 January 2007|title=The Dal\u00ed I knew|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/exhibitions/the-dali-i-knew-6587130.html|journal=[[This Is London (website)|This is London]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707184041/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/arts/article-23398918-details/The+Dali+I+knew/article.do|archive-date=7 July 2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Personality ===\nDal\u00ed was renowned for his eccentric and ostentatious behaviour throughout his career. In 1941 the Director of Exhibitions and Publications at MoMA wrote: \"The fame of Salvador Dal\u00ed has been an issue of particular controversy for more than a decade...Dal\u00ed's conduct may have been undignified, but the greater part of his art is a matter of dead earnest.\"<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) pp 413-14</ref> When Dal\u00ed was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts|French Academy of Fine Arts]] in 1979 one of his fellow academicians stated that he hoped Dal\u00ed would now abandon his \"clowneries\".<ref>Gibson, Ian (1997) p 569</ref>\n\nIn 1936, at the premiere screening of [[Joseph Cornell]]'s film ''[[Rose Hobart (film)|Rose Hobart]]'' at Julien Levy's gallery in New York City, Dal\u00ed knocked over the projector in a rage and is said to have shouted:  \"He stole it [the film] from my subconscious!
