During her early career, she appeared in six films for [[Walt Disney]], including her [[dual role]] as twins Susan and Sharon in the Disney film ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' (1961). Her performance in ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (film)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'' (a 1961 adaptation of the novel written by her mother) saw Mills nominated for [[15th British Academy Film Awards#Best British Actress|BAFTA Award for Best British Actress]].\n\nDuring the late 1960s Mills began performing in theatrical plays, and played in more mature roles. The age of contracts with studios soon passed. For her success with Disney she received the [[Disney Legend]] Award. Although she has not maintained the box office success or the [[Hollywood A-list]] she experienced as a [[child actress]], she has continued to make films and TV appearances, including a starring role in the UK television mini-series ''[[The Flame Trees of Thika (TV series)|The Flame Trees of Thika]]'' in 1981, the title role in Disney's television series ''[[Good Morning, Miss Bliss]]'' in 1988, and as Caroline, a main character in ''[[Wild at Heart (UK TV series)|Wild at Heart]]''  (2007\u20132012) on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in the UK.\n\n==Early life and career==\nMills was born in [[Marylebone]], [[London]].<ref name=\"bell\" /> She was 12 when she was discovered by [[J.

She then returned to America and made two appearances on ''[[The Love Boat]]''.\n\nAlways welcomed at Disney, Mills narrated an episode of ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', sparking renewed interest in her Disney work. In 1985, Mills was originally considered to voice [[Princess Eilonwy]] in Disney's 25th animated feature film ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' but was later replaced by the veteran British voice actress [[Susan Sheridan]]. Later, Mills reprised her roles as twins Sharon and Susan for a trio of ''Parent Trap'' television films: ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'', ''[[Parent Trap III]]'', and ''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon]]''. Mills also starred as the title character in the [[Disney Channel]]-produced television series ''[[Good Morning, Miss Bliss]]'' in 1987. The show was cancelled after 13 episodes and the rights were acquired by [[NBC]], which reformatted ''Good Morning, Miss Bliss'' into ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' without any further involvement from Mills. In recognition of her work with [[The Walt Disney Company]], Mills was awarded the [[Disney Legends]] award in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/hayley-mills/|title=Hayley Mills|publisher=D23|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nMills recalled her childhood in the 2000 documentary film ''[[Sir John Mills' Moving Memories]]'' which was directed by [[Marcus Dillistone]] and produced by her brother Jonathan.

During her early career, she appeared in six films for [[Walt Disney]], including her [[dual role]] as twins Susan and Sharon in the Disney film ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' (1961).

Back at Disney she was in a film about jewel thieves, ''[[The Moon-Spinners]]'' (1964), getting her first on screen kiss from [[Peter McEnery]].<ref>[http://www.seedship.com/hayley/gallery/imgnews1/6408ph1h.html \"The Day Hayley got in a Hearse\"], ''Photoplay'', August 1964</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51975305 |title=WORK AND FUN ON A LOVELY ISLAND |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=31 |issue=32 |date=8 January 1964 |accessdate=15 September 2017 |page=9 (Teenagers' Weekly) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nMills had a change of pace with ''[[Sky West and Crooked]]'' (1965), set in the world of gypsies, written by her mother and directed by her father.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47591138 |title=AS ENGLISH AS MARMALADE |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=34 |issue=52 |date=24 May 1967 |accessdate=15 September 2017 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> It was not very popular.

Critics noted that America's favourite child star was, in fact, quite British and very ladylike. The success of \"Let's Get Together\" (which hit No. 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart, No. 17 in Britain and No. 1 in Mexico) also led to the release of a record album on Disney's Buena Vista label, ''Let's Get Together with Hayley Mills'', which also included her only other hit song, \"Johnny Jingo\" (Billboard No. 21, 1962). In 1962 British exhibitors voted her the most popular film actress in the country.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article47509182 |title=THE AUSTRALIAN WOMEN'S WEEKLY Presents Teenagers WEEKLY. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=20 February 1963 |accessdate=10 July 2012 |page=65 Supplement: Teenagers' Weekly |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Post-Disney film career==\nFor Universal, Mills made another movie with her father, ''[[The Truth About Spring]]'' (1965), co-starring Disney regular James MacArthur as her love interest. It was mildly popular. However ''[[The Trouble with Angels (film)|The Trouble with Angels]]'' (1966), was a huge hit; Mills played as a prankish Catholic boarding school girl with \"scathingly brilliant\" schemes, opposite screen veteran [[Rosalind Russell]], and directed by another Hollywood veteran, [[Ida Lupino]].  She then provided a voice for ''[[The Daydreamer (film)|The Daydreamer]]'' (1966).\n\n===Roy Boulting===\nShortly thereafter, Mills appeared alongside her father and [[Hywel Bennett]] in director Roy Boulting's critically acclaimed film ''[[The Family Way]]'' (1966), a comedy about a couple having difficulty consummating their marriage, featuring a score by [[Paul McCartney]] and arrangements by [[Beatles]] producer [[George Martin]]. She began a romantic relationship with [[Roy Boulting]], and they eventually married in 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article46458082 |title=He's just like a big, warm peach |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] |volume=40 |issue=37 |date=14 February 1973 |accessdate=15 September 2017 |page=4 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nShe then starred as the protagonist of ''[[Pretty Polly (film)|Pretty Polly]]'' (1967), opposite famous Indian film actor [[Shashi Kapoor]] in Singapore.\n\nMills made another movie for Boulting, the controversial horror thriller ''[[Twisted Nerve]]'' in 1968, along with her ''Family Way'' co-star Hywel Bennett. She made a comedy, ''[[Take a Girl Like You (film)|Take a Girl Like You]]'' (1970) with [[Oliver Reed]], and made her West End debut in ''[[The Wild Duck]]'' in 1970.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110438108 |title=Hayley on stage |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=45 |issue=12,746 |date=12 November 1970 |accessdate=15 September 2017 |page=40 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> She worked for Boulting again on ''[[Mr. Forbush and the Penguins]]'' (1971), replacing the original female lead.<ref>Bryan Forbes, ''A Divided Life'', Mandarin Paperbacks, 1993 p 221-222</ref>\n\nIn 1972 Mills again acted opposite Hywel Bennett in ''[[Endless Night (1972 film)|Endless Night]]'' along with [[Britt Ekland]], [[Per Oscarsson]] and [[George Sanders]]. It is based on the novel ''[[Endless Night (novel)|Endless Night]]'' by [[Agatha Christie]]. She made two films for [[Sidney Hayers]], ''[[What Changed Charley Farthing?]]'' (1974) and ''[[Deadly Strangers]]'' (1975). After ''[[The Kingfisher Caper]]'' in 1975, co-written by Boulting, Mills dropped out of the film industry for a few years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/hayleymills.html|title=infoplease.com/biography|publisher=Infoplease.com |date=18 April 1946 |accessdate=29 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Television resurgence and reception==\nIn 1981 Mills returned to acting with a starring role in the UK television mini-series ''[[The Flame Trees of Thika]]'', based on [[Elspeth Huxley]]'s memoir of her childhood in East Africa. The series was well received, prompting Mills to accept more acting roles. She then returned to America and made two appearances on ''[[The Love Boat]]''.\n\nAlways welcomed at Disney, Mills narrated an episode of ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', sparking renewed interest in her Disney work. In 1985, Mills was originally considered to voice [[Princess Eilonwy]] in Disney's 25th animated feature film ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' but was later replaced by the veteran British voice actress [[Susan Sheridan]]. Later, Mills reprised her roles as twins Sharon and Susan for a trio of ''Parent Trap'' television films: ''[[The Parent Trap II]]'', ''[[Parent Trap III]]'', and ''[[Parent Trap: Hawaiian Honeymoon]]''. Mills also starred as the title character in the [[Disney Channel]]-produced television series ''[[Good Morning, Miss Bliss]]'' in 1987. The show was cancelled after 13 episodes and the rights were acquired by [[NBC]], which reformatted ''Good Morning, Miss Bliss'' into ''[[Saved by the Bell]]'' without any further involvement from Mills. In recognition of her work with [[The Walt Disney Company]], Mills was awarded the [[Disney Legends]] award in 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/hayley-mills/|title=Hayley Mills|publisher=D23|url-access=subscription }}</ref>\n\nMills recalled her childhood in the 2000 documentary film ''[[Sir John Mills' Moving Memories]]'' which was directed by [[Marcus Dillistone]] and produced by her brother Jonathan. In 2005 Mills appeared in the acclaimed short film, ''Stricken'', written and directed by Jayce Bartok. In 2007 she began appearing as Caroline in the [[ITV1]] African vet drama, ''[[Wild at Heart (UK TV series)|Wild at Heart]]''; her sister [[Juliet Mills]] was a guest star in series 4 of the drama.\n\nIn 2010 Mills appeared in ''Mandie and the Cherokee Treasure'', based on one of the popular ''Mandie'' novels of [[Lois Gladys Leppard]].\n\n==Stage career==\nMills made her stage debut in a 1966 West End revival of ''[[Peter Pan]]''. In 2000 she made her [[Off-Broadway]] debut in Sir [[No\u00ebl Coward]]'s ''Suite in Two Keys'', opposite American actress [[Judith Ivey]], for which she won a [[Theatre World Award]]. In 1991 she appeared as [[Anna Leonowens]] in the Australian production of ''[[The King and I]]''. In December 2007, for their annual birthday celebration of \"The Master\", ''[[The No\u00ebl Coward Society]]'' invited Mills as the guest celebrity to lay flowers in front of Coward's statue at New York's ''[[Gershwin Theatre]]'', thereby commemorating the 108th birthday of Sir Noel.\n\nIn 1997, Mills starred in the U.S. national tour of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''[[The King and I]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19970527&slug=2541306|title=Entertainment & the Arts {{!}} Hayley Mills, Adult At Last, In 'King And I' {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2019-07-06}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012 Mills starred as Ursula Widdington in the stage production of ''[[Ladies in Lavender]]'' at the [[Royal & Derngate Theatre]], before embarking on a national UK tour.\n\nIn 2015, Mills toured Australia with sister [[Juliet Mills]] and Juliet\u2019s husband, [[Maxwell Caulfield]], in the comedy ''[[Legends!]]'' by [[James Kirkwood, Jr.|James Kirkwood]].\n\nMills starred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/party-face-starring-oscar-winner-hayley-mills-begins-off-broadway|title=Party Face, Starring Oscar Winner Hayley Mills, Opens Off-Broadway - Playbill|website=Playbill|date=2018-01-22}}</ref> in the 2018 Off-Broadway run of Isobel Mahon's ''Party Face'' at [[New York City Center|City Center]].\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Hayley Mills and Firdous Bamji at the Kennedy Center, Washington D.jpg|thumb|Mills and Firdous Bamji in 1997]]\nIn 1966 while filming ''[[The Family Way]],'' 20-year-old Mills met 53-year-old director [[Roy Boulting]].

She wrote the preface to the book, ''The Hare Krishna Book of Vegetarian Cooking'', published in 1984.

January 1978) is a Slovenian former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[midfielder]].\n\n==Club career==\n\u010ceh started his career with his hometown club [[NK Drava Ptuj|Drava Ptuj]]. By the age of 17 he was playing in the first team in the [[Slovenian Second League|2. SNL]]. In the 1996\u201397 season he moved from Drava to [[NK Maribor|Maribor]], later spending one season at [[NK Olimpija Ljubljana (1911\u20132004)|Olimpija]] before returning to Maribor.\n\n\u010ceh then moved on to [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]]. His first season at the club brought success in the [[Belgian Cup]], and the following season he helped the club win their 12th league title. In August 2002 he scored a late equalising goal in the second-leg of Brugge's [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2002\u201303 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|third round qualifying tie]] against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]]. Brugge then went on to qualify through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]].\n\nIn 2005 \u010ceh was sold to [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]]. [[Belgian First Division A|Jupiler League]] team [[R. Charleroi S.C.|Charleroi]] tried to buy \u010ceh in late August 2006 but in 2007 he instead signed for Russian Premier Liga side [[FC Khimki]], where he was given the number 10 shirt.\n\nOn 5 January 2009, he left Khimki and moved to Greek club [[Panserraikos F.C.|Panserraikos]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Panserraikos sign Ceh |url=http://www.transfermarketweb.com/?action=read&idsel=29688 |publisher=Football press |date=5 January 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2009}}</ref> After a short spell in Greece, he signed for [[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]],<ref>{{Cite news |title=Nastja \u010ceh potpisao |url=http://www.nk-rijeka.hr/content.asp?statID=845 |publisher=HNK Rijeka |date=26 August 2009 |language=Croatian |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090830191624/http://www.nk-rijeka.hr/content.asp?statID=845 |archivedate=30 August 2009}}</ref> spending a season there before moving on yet again to play in Israel.\n\nIn April 2012 \u010ceh signed for [[PSMS Medan|PSMS Medan (ISL)]] of the [[Indonesia Super League]]. His debut match was on 9 April, where he came on in the 53rd minute replacing Muhammad Antoni; he also received his first yellow card on that match.<ref>http://liga-indonesia.co.id/bli/index.php?go=news.matchreview&matchID=120408610&home=PSPS{{Dead link|date=April 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n==International career==\n\u010ceh was capped 46 times for [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] and scored 6 goals.

police that investigators had been tapping the phones of the four persons currently in custody and have recorded a conversation between \u0160ukalo and the leader of the illegal organization Kosta

The temporary Fore River Bridge can be seen in the background.]]\nAs part of [[Greater Boston|Metro Boston]], Quincy has easy access to transportation facilities. State highways and the Interstate system connect the [[Greater Boston]] area to the airport, port, and intermodal facilities of [[Boston]]. Due to its proximity to Boston proper, Quincy is connected not only by these modes of transportation but also to the regional [[Rapid transit|subway]] system, operated by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA), known locally as \"The T\". The four subway or \"T\" stops in Quincy, which are on the MBTA's [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]], are [[North Quincy (MBTA station)|North Quincy Station]], [[Wollaston (MBTA station)|Wollaston Station]], [[Quincy Center (MBTA station)|Quincy Center Station]], and [[Quincy Adams (MBTA station)|Quincy Adams Station]].\n\n===Highways and roads===\n[[Interstate 93]] and [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] travel south to north concurrently through Quincy beginning in the southwest, where the Quincy\u2013Randolph border bisects the median between the northern and southern halves of the Exit 5 cloverleaf at Massachusetts Route 28. Following a route around the southern extent of the [[Blue Hills Reservation]], this I-93 and US 1 alignment is along the former southern section of [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]. The highway travels along a wooded wetland region of the Reservation, entering Quincy completely just beyond Exit 5 and then crossing into Braintree as it approaches the [[Braintree Split]], the junction with [[Massachusetts Route 3]]. Weekday traffic volume averages 250,000 to 275,000 vehicles per day at this intersection, the gateway from Boston and its inner core to the [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|South Shore]] and [[Cape Cod]].<ref name=\"MPO\">[http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/4_resources/1_reports/1_studies/2_highway/braintree_split/braintree_split_p1.pdf \"I-93/Southeast Expressway/Route 3 (Braintree Split): ''Operational Assessment and Potential Improvements''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919034303/http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/4_resources/1_reports/1_studies/2_highway/braintree_split/braintree_split_p1.pdf |date=2010-09-19 }} Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization, March 2006, p. 3.</ref>\n\nAs Route 3 joins I-93 and US 1 at the Braintree Split, the three travel north together toward Boston around the eastern extent of the Blue Hills Reservation, entering [[West Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|West Quincy]] as the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]]. The expressway provides access to West Quincy at Exit 8\u2014[[Furnace Brook Parkway]] and Exit 9\u2014Bryant Avenue/Adams Street before entering Milton. The Furnace Brook Parkway exit also provides access to Ricciuti Drive and the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation]] as well as the eastern entrance to the [[Blue Hills Reservation Parkways]].\n\nPrincipal numbered state highways traveling within Quincy include: [[Massachusetts Route 3A|Route 3A]] south to north from Weymouth via Washington Street, [[Southern Artery]], Merrymount Parkway and Hancock Street to the Neponset River Bridge and the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section of Boston; [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]], which travels south to north from Randolph to Milton along Randolph Avenue in Quincy through a remote section of the Blue Hills Reservation; and [[Massachusetts Route 53|Route 53]], which enters traveling south to north from Braintree as Quincy Avenue, turning right to form the beginning of Southern Artery in [[Quincy Point (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Quincy Point]] before ending at the intersection with Washington Street/Route 3A.\n\n[[Image:Quincycenter.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Quincy Center as seen from the intersection of Adams Street and Hancock Street]]\nIn addition to the Blue Hills [[parkway]]s, Quincy includes two other [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]] parkways. [[Furnace Brook Parkway]] travels east from I-93 through the center of the city from West Quincy to [[Quincy Center (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Quincy Center]] and [[Merrymount (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Merrymount]] at [[Quincy Bay]]. There the parkway meets [[Quincy Shore Drive]] at the mouth of Blacks Creek. Quincy Shore Drive travels in a northerly direction along the shore of Quincy Bay through [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston]] and into [[North Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|North Quincy]], with much of its length abutting [[Wollaston Beach]], then turns in a westerly direction upon intersecting with East Squantum Street and continues to meet Hancock Street at the Neponset River Bridge.\n\nAs for Quincy's other important city streets, Hancock Street begins at the southern extent of Quincy Center and travels north to Dorchester as a main commercial thoroughfare of Quincy Center, Wollaston and North Quincy. Washington Street enters the city at Fore River Rotary after crossing [[Weymouth Fore River]] and continues to Quincy Center, ending at Hancock Street. Along with Quincy Avenue and Southern Artery, other heavily traveled streets include Newport Avenue, which parallels Hancock Street to the west on the opposite side of the MBTA railway, Adams Street heading west from Quincy Center to Milton, and West and East Squantum Streets in the [[Montclair (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Montclair]] and North Quincy neighborhoods. Other streets are discussed in several of the neighborhood articles listed above.\n\n===Airport===\nBoston's [[Logan International Airport]] is accessible via MBTA Red Line connections at [[South Station]], directly on the MBTA commuter boat (see below) or by motor vehicle using [[Interstate 93]] or surface roads to the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]].\n\n===MBTA rail and other commuter services===\nSubway service is available on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] of the MBTA from four stations in Quincy: [[North Quincy station|North Quincy]], [[Wollaston station|Wollaston]], [[Quincy Center station|Quincy Center]], and [[Quincy Adams station|Quincy Adams]]. Commuter rail service operates out of Quincy Center. Both services serve [[South Station]] in Boston with connections to [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] and [[Amtrak]] intercity lines. Buses are also available for transportation in Quincy, including private bus lines and several lines provided by the MBTA. Most of the MBTA routes funnel through the Quincy Center station, which is the principal hub south of Boston for all MBTA bus lines. The southern bus garage for the MBTA system is adjacent to the Quincy Armory on Hancock Street.\n\nQuincy was a major terminal for the [[MBTA boat|commuter boat]] system that crosses [[Boston Harbor]] to [[Long Wharf (Boston)|Long Wharf]], [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]], [[Rowe's Wharf]], [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], and [[Logan Airport]]. The commuter boats, which were operated by Harbor Express under license by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]], docked at the [[Fore River Shipyard]] in [[Quincy Point]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.harborexpress.com/ |title=Harbor Express website |access-date=2020-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19980630011246/http://www.harborexpress.com/ |archive-date=1998-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Service ended in October 2013 after a water main break damaged the sea wall and wharf. Temporary repairs would have cost $15 million; permanent repairs $50 million.

The Quincy Chiefs of the minor league Eastern Basketball Association (the predecessor to the defunct [[Continental Basketball Association]]) played a single season in 1977\u201378, and was coached and managed by former [[Boston Celtics]] executive [[Leo Papile]]. The Chiefs finished 12\u201319 in third place, and lost in the playoffs to eventual league champion [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]]. Quincy's professional baseball team, the Shipbuilders, competed in the [[New England League]] in 1933, recording a 12\u20136 record before moving to [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] midseason; a revival of the team played in the NEL from 1941 through to 1944. The final season of the [[Boston Minutemen]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] was played at [[Veterans Memorial Stadium (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Veterans Memorial Stadium]] in Quincy, in 1976, finishing 7\u201317.\n\nThe [[Boston Rams|Real Boston Rams]] of the [[Association football|soccer]] 4th division [[USL League Two|Premier Development League]], an affiliate club of the [[New England Revolution]], has played in Veterans Memorial Stadium since 2014.\n\nIn 2019, the [[Boston Cannons]] moved their home stadium to the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Quincy.\n\nQuincy has had several [[American football|football]] teams in the semi-pro Eastern Football League over the years. The current club, the Quincy Militia, played its inaugural season in the EFL in 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.patriotledger.com/sports/x387871853/Semi-pro-Quincy-football-team-is-not-playing-like-an-EFL-expansion-team|title=Semi-pro Quincy football team is not playing like an EFL expansion team|last=McHugh|first=Patrick|date=August 20, 2009|newspaper=The Patriot Ledger|accessdate=28 November 2009|location=Quincy, Massachusetts}}</ref> Founded in 2009 by long-time Quincy resident Vaughn Driscoll, new owners came into the team picture in 2013. Militia games are played July to October with home games at Veterans Memorial Stadium on Saturday nights. An earlier team, the Quincy Giants, played in the minor league [[Atlantic Coast Football League]] between 1969 and 1971.\n\nQuincy's only college sports program is the \"Lions\" of [[Eastern Nazarene College]], in the [[NCAA Division III|D-III]] [[Commonwealth Coast Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Eastern College Athletic Conference]] (ECAC). Games are played at Bradley Field and the Lahue Physical Education Center on-campus, or at Adams and Veterans Memorial Fields in Quincy.\n\nQuincy's high school sports programs are in the Patriot League:<ref>[http://nqrr.tripod.com/index.html North Quincy High School Red Raiders webpage]</ref> the D-III Fisher Division \"Red Raiders\" of [[North Quincy High School]] and the DIIA Keenan Division \"Presidents\" of [[Quincy High School (Massachusetts)|Quincy High School]], who are rivals. Quincy also hosted the youth baseball [[Babe Ruth League]] World Series in 2003, 2005 and 2008. High school baseball and Babe Ruth League games are played at Adams Field. High school football is played at Veterans Memorial Field.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{See also|Category:People from Quincy, Massachusetts}}\n<!-- NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * * * * * * * * * *NOTICE * * * NOTICE * * * NOTICE\nOnly those who already have a Wikipedia article may be included in this section.

The temporary Fore River Bridge can be seen in the background.]]\nAs part of [[Greater Boston|Metro Boston]], Quincy has easy access to transportation facilities. State highways and the Interstate system connect the [[Greater Boston]] area to the airport, port, and intermodal facilities of [[Boston]]. Due to its proximity to Boston proper, Quincy is connected not only by these modes of transportation but also to the regional [[Rapid transit|subway]] system, operated by the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority]] (MBTA), known locally as \"The T\". The four subway or \"T\" stops in Quincy, which are on the MBTA's [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]], are [[North Quincy (MBTA station)|North Quincy Station]], [[Wollaston (MBTA station)|Wollaston Station]], [[Quincy Center (MBTA station)|Quincy Center Station]], and [[Quincy Adams (MBTA station)|Quincy Adams Station]].\n\n===Highways and roads===\n[[Interstate 93]] and [[U.S. Route 1 in Massachusetts|U.S. Route 1]] travel south to north concurrently through Quincy beginning in the southwest, where the Quincy\u2013Randolph border bisects the median between the northern and southern halves of the Exit 5 cloverleaf at Massachusetts Route 28. Following a route around the southern extent of the [[Blue Hills Reservation]], this I-93 and US 1 alignment is along the former southern section of [[Massachusetts Route 128|Route 128]]. The highway travels along a wooded wetland region of the Reservation, entering Quincy completely just beyond Exit 5 and then crossing into Braintree as it approaches the [[Braintree Split]], the junction with [[Massachusetts Route 3]]. Weekday traffic volume averages 250,000 to 275,000 vehicles per day at this intersection, the gateway from Boston and its inner core to the [[South Shore (Massachusetts)|South Shore]] and [[Cape Cod]].<ref name=\"MPO\">[http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/4_resources/1_reports/1_studies/2_highway/braintree_split/braintree_split_p1.pdf \"I-93/Southeast Expressway/Route 3 (Braintree Split): ''Operational Assessment and Potential Improvements''\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919034303/http://www.bostonmpo.org/bostonmpo/4_resources/1_reports/1_studies/2_highway/braintree_split/braintree_split_p1.pdf |date=2010-09-19 }} Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization, March 2006, p. 3.</ref>\n\nAs Route 3 joins I-93 and US 1 at the Braintree Split, the three travel north together toward Boston around the eastern extent of the Blue Hills Reservation, entering [[West Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|West Quincy]] as the [[Southeast Expressway (Boston)|Southeast Expressway]]. The expressway provides access to West Quincy at Exit 8\u2014[[Furnace Brook Parkway]] and Exit 9\u2014Bryant Avenue/Adams Street before entering Milton. The Furnace Brook Parkway exit also provides access to Ricciuti Drive and the [[Quincy Quarries Reservation]] as well as the eastern entrance to the [[Blue Hills Reservation Parkways]].\n\nPrincipal numbered state highways traveling within Quincy include: [[Massachusetts Route 3A|Route 3A]] south to north from Weymouth via Washington Street, [[Southern Artery]], Merrymount Parkway and Hancock Street to the Neponset River Bridge and the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section of Boston; [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]], which travels south to north from Randolph to Milton along Randolph Avenue in Quincy through a remote section of the Blue Hills Reservation; and [[Massachusetts Route 53|Route 53]], which enters traveling south to north from Braintree as Quincy Avenue, turning right to form the beginning of Southern Artery in [[Quincy Point (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Quincy Point]] before ending at the intersection with Washington Street/Route 3A.\n\n[[Image:Quincycenter.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Quincy Center as seen from the intersection of Adams Street and Hancock Street]]\nIn addition to the Blue Hills [[parkway]]s, Quincy includes two other [[Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation]] parkways. [[Furnace Brook Parkway]] travels east from I-93 through the center of the city from West Quincy to [[Quincy Center (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Quincy Center]] and [[Merrymount (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Merrymount]] at [[Quincy Bay]]. There the parkway meets [[Quincy Shore Drive]] at the mouth of Blacks Creek. Quincy Shore Drive travels in a northerly direction along the shore of Quincy Bay through [[Wollaston (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Wollaston]] and into [[North Quincy (Quincy, Massachusetts)|North Quincy]], with much of its length abutting [[Wollaston Beach]], then turns in a westerly direction upon intersecting with East Squantum Street and continues to meet Hancock Street at the Neponset River Bridge.\n\nAs for Quincy's other important city streets, Hancock Street begins at the southern extent of Quincy Center and travels north to Dorchester as a main commercial thoroughfare of Quincy Center, Wollaston and North Quincy. Washington Street enters the city at Fore River Rotary after crossing [[Weymouth Fore River]] and continues to Quincy Center, ending at Hancock Street. Along with Quincy Avenue and Southern Artery, other heavily traveled streets include Newport Avenue, which parallels Hancock Street to the west on the opposite side of the MBTA railway, Adams Street heading west from Quincy Center to Milton, and West and East Squantum Streets in the [[Montclair (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Montclair]] and North Quincy neighborhoods. Other streets are discussed in several of the neighborhood articles listed above.\n\n===Airport===\nBoston's [[Logan International Airport]] is accessible via MBTA Red Line connections at [[South Station]], directly on the MBTA commuter boat (see below) or by motor vehicle using [[Interstate 93]] or surface roads to the [[Ted Williams Tunnel]].\n\n===MBTA rail and other commuter services===\nSubway service is available on the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] of the MBTA from four stations in Quincy: [[North Quincy station|North Quincy]], [[Wollaston station|Wollaston]], [[Quincy Center station|Quincy Center]], and [[Quincy Adams station|Quincy Adams]]. Commuter rail service operates out of Quincy Center. Both services serve [[South Station]] in Boston with connections to [[MBTA Commuter Rail]] and [[Amtrak]] intercity lines. Buses are also available for transportation in Quincy, including private bus lines and several lines provided by the MBTA. Most of the MBTA routes funnel through the Quincy Center station, which is the principal hub south of Boston for all MBTA bus lines. The southern bus garage for the MBTA system is adjacent to the Quincy Armory on Hancock Street.\n\nQuincy was a major terminal for the [[MBTA boat|commuter boat]] system that crosses [[Boston Harbor]] to [[Long Wharf (Boston)|Long Wharf]], [[Hull, Massachusetts|Hull]], [[Rowe's Wharf]], [[Hingham, Massachusetts|Hingham]], and [[Logan Airport]].

The Quincy Chiefs of the minor league Eastern Basketball Association (the predecessor to the defunct [[Continental Basketball Association]]) played a single season in 1977\u201378, and was coached and managed by former [[Boston Celtics]] executive [[Leo Papile]]. The Chiefs finished 12\u201319 in third place, and lost in the playoffs to eventual league champion [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]]. Quincy's professional baseball team, the Shipbuilders, competed in the [[New England League]] in 1933, recording a 12\u20136 record before moving to [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] midseason; a revival of the team played in the NEL from 1941 through to 1944. The final season of the [[Boston Minutemen]] of the [[North American Soccer League (1968\u201384)|North American Soccer League]] was played at [[Veterans Memorial Stadium (Quincy, Massachusetts)|Veterans Memorial Stadium]] in Quincy, in 1976, finishing 7\u201317.\n\nThe [[Boston Rams|Real Boston Rams]] of the [[Association football|soccer]] 4th division [[USL League Two|Premier Development League]], an affiliate club of the [[New England Revolution]], has played in Veterans Memorial Stadium since 2014.\n\nIn 2019, the [[Boston Cannons]] moved their home stadium to the Veterans Memorial Stadium in Quincy.\n\nQuincy has had several [[American football|football]] teams in the semi-pro Eastern Football League over the years.
