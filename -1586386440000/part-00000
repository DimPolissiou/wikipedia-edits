It was fought between the [[Clan Macdonald of Sleat]] and [[Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg]] against the [[Clan Maclean]]. In 1585, the Macleans slaughtered a party of the MacDonalds of Sleat when they were mistakenly accused of stealing cattle and the MacDonalds of Sleat and Dunnyveg retaliated. [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] intervened but the conflicts continued into 1586. After further intervention an  [[Act of Parliament of Scotland|Act of Parliament]] was passed which would levy fines on any clan chiefs who did not maintain peace and good order among their [[vassal]]s.\n\n==The conflict on Jura==\n\nIn the summer of 1585, Donald Gorm Mor of Sleat, chief of the [[Clan Macdonald of Sleat]], along with a large following of men, left the [[Isle of Skye]] to pay a vist to [[Angus MacDonald of Islay]], chief of the [[Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg]]. However, because of a severe storm he was forced to seek shelter on the north of the [[Jura, Scotland|Isle of Jura]], which part belonged to [[Lachlan Mor Maclean]], chief of [[Clan Maclean]], who was seated at [[Duart Castle]] on the [[Isle of Mull]]. Another party, which included Hugh, son of Archibald the Clerk and a Macdonald descendant of Donald Herrach, were also driven by the same storm to Jura. These two men collected a large amount of cattle belonging to the Macleans who lived near to the place that Donald Gorm Mor had landed, and carried them off in their galleys. Their objective was to get Donald Gorm Mor into trouble. They knew that the Macleans would believe that the theft was committed by Donald Gorm Mor and hoped that the Macleans would attack him and put him to death. The men whose cattle had been stolen went straight to Lachlan Mor Maclean to make their complaint. Lachlan Mor Maclean sailed to Jura with a number of men and made a sudden attack on Donald Gorm Mor, who had no idea what had taken place. In the battle he killed sixty of the MacDonalds, but the rest of them, including Donald Gorm Mor, made their escape.

He dispatched messengers to the chieftains of the various branches of the [[Clan Donald]], calling upon them to assist him in the attack. Lachlan Mor Maclean having killed a number of innocent men created feelings of indignation and vengeance among all the MacDonalds who committed acts of depredation on his lands in various quarters and threatened to invade the Isle of Mull. They did find out that the cattle had actually been stolen by two MacDonalds but still felt so indignant over the slaughter of their clansmen that they were unwilling to come to terms with Lachlan Mor Maclean.<ref name=\"Sinclair\"/><ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\n==The King's intervention==\n[[File:Mull Duart Castle alt.jpg|thumb|left|[[Duart Castle]] on the [[Isle of Mull]], seat of the chief of the Clan Maclean since the 14th century]]\nIn September, 1585, [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland]] wrote to the [[Chiefs of Clan MacLeod|Chief of the Clan MacLeod]], seated at [[Dunvegan Castle]], requesting him to assist the Macleans against the MacDonalds and he also urged the MacDonalds at the same time to cease their hostilities.

On his return he called at Duart Castle to try to come to an amicable settlement with Lachlan Mor Maclean. The following day, Maclean seized both Angus and his attendants and threw them into prison until Angus agreed to renounce his claim to the [[Rinns of Islay]]. Angus also had to give his son James, and his brother, Ranald, as hostages to Lachalan until he received the lands as promised. The harsh treatment that Angus received from Maclean meant that he went back to Islay as a bitter enemy.<ref name=\"Sinclair\"/><ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\n==The conflict on Islay, Mull, Tiree and Kintyre==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | header = \n | image1 = Dunscaith Castle - geograph.org.uk - 218475.jpg\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = The ruins of [[Dunscaith Castle]], historic seat of the chief of the Clan MacDonald of Sleat, located in the parish of [[Sleat]], [[Isle of Skye]]\n | image2 = Dunyvaig Castle 20120411 from northwest across Lagavulin Bay.jpg\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = The ruins of [[Dunyvaig Castle]], historic seat of the chief of the Clan MacDonald of Dunnyveg, located on [[Islay]]\n}}\nIn July, 1586, Lachlan Mor Maclean went to [[Islay]] to receive possession of the Rinns and took up his quarters at the fort of Lochgorm. He remained there for three days and received repeated invitations from Angus of Islay to visit him at Mullintrea. Maclean yielded and went to spend a night with him. He was accompanied by seventy followers, or according to another account eighty-six. Maclean was received in a friendly manner and was entertained in grand style. However, he refused to stay the night with Angus and instead went to sleep in one of the buildings which his followers were lodged in, and took with him, James, the son of Angus who was still a hostage. At midnight, Angus of Islay, with 400 armed followers went to the door of the building where Lachlan Mor Maclean was sleeping and asked him to get up and have a drink with him. Maclean went to the door with the hostage James in one hand and a sword in the other, but saw that it was impossible for him to escape. Angus saw that if a fight took place then his son would certainly be killed. Angus solemnly promised that if they gave up his son and surrendered as prisoners that their lives would be spared. Maclean accepted and so did all but two of his men. These two were John Dubh of Morvern and MacDonald Herrach who was one of the men who had caused the slaughter of the MacDoanlds for having stolen Maclean's cattle. These two men refused to leave the building and so the MacDonalds set fire to it and they perished in the flames. The prisoners were all put to death with the exception of Lachlan Mor Maclean himself.<ref name=\"Sinclair\"/><ref name=\"MacDonald\"/>\n\nIn the history of these events published by Alexander Maclean Sinclair in 1899, he disputes the account given in the book ''Conflicts of the Clans'' which was published by the [[Foulis press]] in 1764 and which says that Angus executed all of the prisoners in one day. Sinclair states that this happened over a number of days and quotes the ''Ardgour MS'' (manuscript) as his source.<ref name=\"Sinclair\"/>\n\nThese atrocities came to the attention of the King who employed the chiefs of the [[Clan Campbell]] who governed [[Argyll]] during the minority of [[Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll]], to mediate between the contending clans. Angus MacDonald agreed on the condition that he would be pardoned for his crimes as well as for eight hostages to be placed in his hands by Maclean who in turn was forced to subscribe.  After this MacDonald went over to [[Ireland]] but while he was away, Maclean, disregarding the hostages, invaded Islay with his clan and laid waste with ''fire and sword''. When MacDonald returned he did not punish the hostages but collected a large force and invaded the isles of Mull and [[Tiree]], putting to death all the inhabitants that came into their hands.

James had nominated the Earl of Huntly to command his army on the borders, consisting of 10,000 men; and his lieutenant was Sir Walter Lindsay of Torphichen, who had seen a great deal of foreign service, and was esteemed an' excellent-of\ufb01cer. Huntly acquitted himself admirably Well in his commission, and was so well served by his spies, as to have certain intelligence that the English intended to surprise and burn Jedburgh and Kelso. The English army, under Bowes and the Doug lases, continued still on the borders; and the Scottish nobility and gentry had resolved \u2019not to attack them on their own ground, nor to act offensively, unless their enemies invaded Scotland. Huntly being informed that the English had ad advanced, on the 24th of August, to a place called Haddonrig, and that they had destroyed a great part of\u201c the Scottish and debatable lands, resolved to engage them; and the English Were astonished when they saw the Scottish drawn up in order of battle about day-break. Neither party could now retreat without \ufb01ghting; and Torphichen, who led the van. consisting of 2000 of the best troops of Scotland, charged the enemy so furiously, that Huntly gained a complete and easy victory.
