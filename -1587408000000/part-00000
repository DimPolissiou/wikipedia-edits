{"title_page": "Occupation of Araucan\u00eda", "text_new": "[[File:Fuerte_de_Pur\u00e9n_Chile.jpg|thumb|300px|View of a modern reconstruction of the [[Pur\u00e9n|Fort of Pur\u00e9n]] built during the occupation.]]\nThe '''Occupation of Araucan\u00eda''' or '''Pacification of Araucan\u00eda''' (1861\u20131883) was a series of [[military campaign]]s, [[Diplomacy|agreements]] and penetrations by the [[Chilean army]] and [[settler]]s into [[Mapuche]] territory which led to the incorporation of [[Araucan\u00eda (historic region)|Araucan\u00eda]] into Chilean national territory.  ''Pacification of Araucan\u00eda'' was the expression used by the Chilean authorities for this process. The conflict was concurrent with [[Conquest of the Desert|Argentine campaigns against the Mapuche]] (1878\u20131885) and Chile's wars [[Chincha Islands War|with Spain]] (1865\u20131866) and [[War of the Pacific|with Peru and Bolivia]] (1879\u20131883).\n\nThe Mapuche people had a history of [[Arauco War|resistance to Spanish conquest]] with the area known as Araucan\u00eda remaining ''de facto'' independent through the [[Colonial Chile|colonial era]]. Following an [[Chilean Independence War|independence from Spain]] relations between the nascent republic and the Mapuches of Araucan\u00eda remained mostly amicable. However [[History of agriculture in Chile|economical]] and [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] reasons together with [[Mapuche#Mapuche,_Chileans_and_the_Chilean_state|increasingly negative attitudes]] towards the Mapuche made Chilean authorities decide to seek an incorporation of Araucan\u00eda, by arms if necessary. Mapuche chiefdoms responded in different ways, some aligned with Chile, other declared themselves neutral while a substantial group led by the Arribanos sought to violently oppose the advance of Chilean settlers and military. In the first ten years (1861\u22121871) Mapuches could not prevent Chile from advancing its positions but managed to [[defeat in detail]] small detachments avoiding large battles. Following ten years with few hostilities the Mapuches were unable to physically oppose a large Chilean army that in 1881 penetrated from the north to [[Caut\u00edn River]], efectively putting most of the territory under Chilean rule. On November the same year Mapuches made a last-ditch effort launching [[Mapuche uprising of 1881|coordinated attacks against Chilean settlements]]. With most of these attacks repelled within a matters of days Chile went on the next years to consolidate its conquests. \n\nThe conflict led to the deaths of thousands of Mapuche by warfare and [[smallpox]]. Many Mapuches faced hardship as result of not being able to cultivate and the due widespread pillaging by Chilean army and [[Banditry in Chile|bandits]], indeed many came to brink of starvation. Disruption of the Mapuche economy caused first by war and later by having their lands reduced plunged many into [[poverty]] that has persisted for generations.           \n\n== Background ==\n{{see also|Mapuche history}}\n[[File:Grupos Mapuches.JPG|thumb|300px|Mapuche groups in Araucan\u00eda around 1850. ''[[De facto]]'' Chilean territory in blue.]]\nBeginning in the second half of the 18th century Mapuche-Spanish and later Mapuche-Chilean trade increased and hostilities decreased.<ref name=Bengoa45-46>Bengoa 2000, pp. 45\u201346.</ref> Mapuches obtained [[Good (economics)|goods]] from Chile and some dressed in \"Spanish\" clothing.<ref name=Bengoa154>Bengoa 2000, p. 154.</ref> Despite close contacts Chileans and Mapuches remained socially, politically and economically distinct.<ref name=Bengoa154/> During Chile's first fifty years of independence (1810\u20131860) the government's relationship with the Araucan\u00eda territory was not a priority and the Chilean government prioritized the development of [[Zona Central, Chile|Central Chile]] over its relationship with indigenous groups.<ref name=Bengoa162>Bengoa 2000, p. 162.</ref><ref name=Bengoa151>Bengoa 2000, p. 151.</ref>\n\n[[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] stated:\n<blockquote>Between two Chilean provinces ([[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]] and [[Valdivia]]) there is a piece of land that is not a province, its language is different, it is inhabited by other people and it can still be said that it is not part of Chile.

affected by the [[Chilean War of Independence]].<ref name=Bengoa155>Bengoa 2000, p. 155.</ref> Following the [[Chilean silver rush]] that began in 1832, agriculture expanded in the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]].<ref name=Bengoa155/> The next major expansion of agricultural activity occurred from 1848 onwards as a result of wheat demand during the colonization of [[Australia]] and the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref name=Bengoa155/> Despite the vanishing of the Californian and Australian markets, wheat cultivation remained highly profitable.<ref name=Bengoa155/> In the 1850s, with the [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue]] and the [[Patagonian sheep farming boom|onset of sheep farming]] in the Chilean territory at the [[Strait of Magellan]], Araucan\u00eda remained the sole place for agriculture to expand.<ref name=Bengoa156>Bengoa 2000, p. 156.</ref>\n\nMapuche lands around the south of the [[B\u00edo-B\u00edo River]] began to be bought by non-Mapuches in the late 18th century, and by 1860 land between B\u00edo-B\u00edo and [[Malleco River]] was mostly under control of Chileans.<ref name=Bengoa156/><ref name=Bengoa157>Bengoa 2000, p. 157.</ref> The [[Chilean wheat cycle|Chilean wheat boom]] increased pressure to acquire lands in Araucan\u00eda by Chileans and led to numerous scams and frauds against Mapuches.<ref name=MemCHL>{{Citation\n| url

the Chilean economy had a booming agricultural sector, a large part of the Mapuche economy revolved around livestock operations in one of the largest territories any indigenous group had ever possessed in South America.<ref name=Bengoa45-46/>\n\n=== Shipwreck of ''Joven Daniel'' ===\n[[File:Monvoisin, Raymond - Naufragio del Joven Daniel -f02 det.jpg|200px|thumb|Painting showing Elisa Bravo Jaramillo who was said to have survived the wreck of ''[[Joven Daniel]]'' to be then kidnapped by Mapuches.]]\nIn 1849 a ship travelling between [[Valdivia]] and [[Valpara\u00edso]], ''[[Joven

was looted by a local Mapuche tribe and some of the survivors were killed.<ref name=Ferrando386-396/> These events became first known in Valdivia and later in Santiago where they fueled a strong anti-Mapuche sentiment and reaffirmed prejudiced views that the Mapuches were brutal barbarians.<ref name=Ferrando386-396/><ref name=Bengoa163-165/> President [[Manuel Bulnes]]'s opposition called for a [[punitive expedition]] and Mapuches prepared for a confrontation with the Chilean Army.<ref name=Ferrando386-396/> Bulnes however dismissed the calls for a punitive expedition in view of its irrelevance to the eventual conquest of Araucan\u00eda.<ref name=Ferrando386-396/>\n\n=== 1851 revolution ===\n{{Further|1851 Chilean Revolution}}\nWhen Chilean liberals began the [[1851 Chilean Revolution|1851 Revolution]] Mapuche chief [[Ma\u00f1il]] joined the rebel army and fought with [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Cruz]]'s army against the troops of [[Manuel Bulnes]] at the [[Battle of Loncomilla]].<ref name=Bengoa163-165>Bengoa 2000, pp. 163\u2013165.</ref> After defeat at Loncomilla Ma\u00f1il returned south.<ref name=Bengoa163-165/> According to historian [[Jos\u00e9 Bengoa]] Mapuches saw the government in Santiago as their main enemy, explaining thus the participation of Mapuches on the side of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de la Cruz [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]]-based revolt.<ref name=Bengoa163-165/>\n\n=== 1859 uprising ===\n{{further|Revolution of 1859}}\nThe encroachment over time of settlers advancing from the north across B\u00edo B\u00edo River into Mapuche territory and the appearance of [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German settlers]] in the south of the Mapuche territory led chief Ma\u00f1il in 1859 to call for an uprising to assert control over the territory.<ref name=Bengoa166-170>Bengoa 2000, pp. 166\u2013170.</ref> Most Mapuches responded to the call, except the communities at [[Pur\u00e9n]], [[Chol Chol River|Choll Choll]], and the southern coastal Mapuches who had strong links with [[Valdivia]].<ref name=Bengoa166-170/> The towns of [[Angol]], [[Negrete]] and [[Nacimiento, Chile|Nacimiento]] were attacked.<ref name=Bengoa166-170/> A peace proposal made by settlers was accepted in 1860 during a meeting of several Mapuche chiefs.<ref name=Bengoa166-170/> The agreement established that land transfers could only be made with the approval of the chiefs.<ref name=Bengoa166-170/>\n\nThe 1859 uprising reinforced the Chilean view of Mapuches as a dangerous threat to the emerging settlements in Araucan\u00eda and influenced public opinion in Chile to push for the complete incorporation of Araucan\u00eda into Chile.<ref name=Ferrando398-402>Ferrando 1986,

the occupation until 1871.]]\nIn 1823, Chilean minister [[Mariano Ega\u00f1a]] had a project approved by Congress to colonize the territory between [[Imperial River (Chile)|Imperial River]] and [[B\u00edo B\u00edo River]], establishing a series of forts on the northern shores of Imperial and [[Caut\u00edn Rivers]] in the middle of Araucan\u00eda.<ref name=Ferrando386-387>Ferrando 1986, pp. 386-387</ref> Chilean president [[Ram\u00f3n Freire]] adopted the project initially but was later convinced to focus instead on the expulsion of the Spanish from [[Chilo\u00e9 Archipelago]], leaving the Araucan\u00eda issue pending.<ref name=Ferrando386-387/>\n\nIn 1849, Chilean minister [[Antonio Varas]] delivered a report to the Chilean congress analyzing the situation in Araucan\u00eda.<ref name=Bengoa162/><ref name=Ferrando389-391>Ferrando 1986, pp. 389-391</ref> In his report, Varas recommended  that a government regime distinct from the rest of the country should be designed for an eventual incorporation of Araucan\u00eda.<ref name=Ferrando389-391/> Varas expressed the view that the eventual mission was to be to [[Civilizing mission|civilize]] the indigenous inhabitants by increasing their material standard of living and \"raise their spirit to the moral and religious truths\".<ref name=Ferrando389-391/>\n\n[[Manuel Montt]], as [[President of Chile]], passed a law on December 7 of 1852 that created the Province of Arauco, a territory intended to administer all territories south of the B\u00edo-B\u00edo River and north of Valdivia Province.<ref

the developments of the  [[American frontier|United States frontier]] in sharp contrast to the old private enterprise-led Spanish colonization of Chile.<ref name=Bengoa170-174/>\nThe plan included the following points:<ref name=Ferrando405-419>Saavedra, Cornelio (1861) quoted in Ferrando 1986, pp. 405-419</ref><ref name=Bengoa170-174/>\n#The advancement of the Chilean Army to [[Malleco River]] and

Mapuche response and Chilean coastal advance (1863\u201368) ===\nSaavedra retired from the army in January 1864 after political pressures from the ministers of President [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn P\u00e9rez]].<ref name=Ferrando437>Ferrando 1986, p. 437</ref> The [[Chincha Islands War]] between Spain and an alliance between Chile and Peru made the government call Saavedra into the army again in 1866 in order to defend the coast of Araucan\u00eda against possible Spanish attacks.<ref name=Ferrando441>Ferrando 1986, p. 441</ref> Saavedra ordered a fort to be constructed in the coast between

[[Arribanos]] decided to go to war while the [[Lafquenche]]s of [[Budi Lake]], [[Tolt\u00e9n]] and [[Queule]] had a meeting where they declared themselves neutral in the conflict but still loyal to the Chilean government.<ref name=\"Bengoa189-192\"/> The [[Pehuenches]] did also declare themselves neutral.<ref name=Bengoa189-192/> The Pehuenche chief Pichi\u00f1\u00e1n is reported to have spoken against the [[Moluche]]s, who wanted war, claiming that they engaged in robbery and received for that just punishments by Chileans.<ref name=Bengoa189-192/> Historian [[Jos\u00e9 Bengoa]] claims Pehuenche neutrality was indebted to the fact that their lands in the Andes were not subject to colonization.<ref name=Bengoa189-192/>\n\nIn 1867 Saavedra called the Mapuches to a \"parliament\" where he informed them of the Chilean decision of fortifying the Malleco River line.<ref name=Bengoa197>Bengoa 2000, p. 197.</ref> The parliament was attended by around thousand [[Abajinos]].<ref name=GuevaraT>Guevara, Tom\u00e1s quoted in Bengoa 2000, p. 197-198.</ref> The Arribanos gathered around 2000 men near the parliament but refused to attend unless the Chileans sent some men as

''Pacification of Araucan\u00eda'' was the expression used by the Chilean authorities for this process. The conflict was concurrent with [[Conquest of the Desert|Argentine campaigns against the Mapuche]] (1878\u20131885) and Chile's wars [[Chincha Islands War|with Spain]] (1865\u20131866) and [[War of the Pacific|with Peru and Bolivia]] (1879\u20131883).\n\nThe Mapuche people had a history of [[Arauco War|resistance to Spanish conquest]] with the area known as Araucan\u00eda remaining ''de facto'' independent through the [[Colonial Chile|colonial era]]. Following an [[Chilean Independence War|independence from Spain]] relations between the nascent republic and the Mapuches of Araucan\u00eda remained mostly amicable. However [[History of agriculture in Chile|economical]] and [[geopolitics|geopolitical]] reasons together with [[Mapuche#Mapuche,_Chileans_and_the_Chilean_state|increasingly negative attitudes]] towards the Mapuche made Chilean authorities decide too seek an incorporation of Araucan\u00eda, by arms if necessary. Mapuche chiefdoms responded in different ways, some aligned with Chile, other declared themselves neutral while a substantial group led by the Arribanos sought to violently oppose the advance of Chilean settlers and military. In the first ten years (1861\u22121871) Mapuches could not prevent Chile from advancing its positions but managed to [[defeat in detail]] small detachments avoiding large battles. Following ten years with few hostilities the Mapuches were unable to physically oppose a large Chilean army that in 1881 penetrated from the north to [[Caut\u00edn River]], efectively putting most of the territory under Chilean rule. On November the same year Mapuches made a last-ditch effort launching [[Mapuche uprising of 1881|coordinated attacks against Chilean settlements]]. With most of these attacks repelled within a matters of days Chile went on the next years to consolidate its conquests. \n\nThe conflict led to the deaths of thousands of Mapuche by warfare and [[smallpox]]. Many Mapuches faced hardship as result of not being able to cultivate and the due widespread pillaging by Chilean army and [[Banditry in Chile|bandits]], indeed many came to brink of starvation.

B\u00edo River into Mapuche territory and the appearance of [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German settlers]] in the south of the Mapuche territory led chief Ma\u00f1il in 1859 to call for an uprising to assert control over the territory.<ref name=Bengoa166-170>Bengoa 2000, pp. 166\u2013170.</ref> Most Mapuches responded to the call, except the communities at

Corral]] and was known for his opposition to the [[Earp family|Earps]]. Behan was sheriff of [[Yavapai County]] from 1871 to 1873. He was married and had two children, but his wife divorced him, accusing him of consorting with prostitutes. He was elected to the [[7th Arizona Territorial Legislature|Seventh Arizona Legislative Assembly]], representing [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]]. In 1881, [[Wyatt Earp]] served for about five months as undersheriff of the eastern half of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]]. When Wyatt resigned, Behan was appointed to fill his place, which included the mining [[boomtown]] [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. When Cochise County was formed in February 1881, Behan was appointed as its first sheriff. Tombstone became the new [[county seat]] and Behan's headquarters. [[Josephine Earp|Sadie Marcus]] was his mistress, possibly as early as 1875 in [[Tip Top, Arizona]], and certainly from 1880 until she found him in bed with another woman and kicked him out in mid-1881.\n\nAfter the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Behan testified at length against the Earps. He supported the  [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]' statements that they had raised their hands and offered no resistance, and that the Earps and Doc Holliday had murdered three cowboys. After the Earps were exonerated, Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] was maimed in an ambush on December 28, 1881, and assistant deputy [[Morgan Earp]] was killed by assassins on March 18, 1882. The [[outlaw]] Cowboys named as suspects in both shootings were either let go on a technicality or were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys. Wyatt Earp killed one of the suspects, [[Frank Stilwell]], in Tucson. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt and his federal posse set out [[Earp Vendetta Ride|after other suspects]], pursued by Behan and his county posse composed mostly of Cowboys.\n\nBehan's posse never caught up with the much smaller federal posse. The Earps left Tombstone under a cloud of suspicion. Sadie left Tombstone for San Francisco in early 1882, and Wyatt Earp followed her to San Francisco, where they began a lifelong relationship that lasted 46 years. Behan was arrested for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and later failed to win re-election as sheriff. He later was appointed as the warden of the [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] and had various other government jobs until his death in 1912.\n\n== Early life ==\nBehan was born in October 24, 1844,<ref name=riggs/><ref name=birthdate>{{cite census |title=Twelfth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Washington, D.C. |roll=ED 81 |page=3 |line=18}}</ref><ref name=birthdate2>{{cite census |title=Thirteenth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Tucson, Pima County, Territory of Arizona |roll=ED 103 |page=13A |line=31}}</ref><ref group=notes>John H.

However, the same certificate lists his age of death as 67, not 66, which it would have been for a birth year of 1844.

During the American Civil War, Behan was a 19-year-old civilian employee of [[California Column|Carleton's Column of Union Volunteers]] in California. He fought in the [[Battle of Apache Pass]] on July 14\u201315, 1862<ref name=riggs /> and in 1863 settled in Tucson, where he found work delivering freight to military installations.<ref name=metz /> In 1864, he served as a clerk to the First Arizona Legislative Assembly in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], the territorial seat.

Behan took office in the new position in April, with his offices in the county seat, Tombstone, but reneged on the deal with Earp, appointing prominent Democrat Harry Woods instead.\n\nLater that year, Behan gave a contrived explanation of his actions during the hearings after the gunfight at the O.K.

Searching for a stolen horse belonging to him, Wyatt learned in late 1880 that the horse was in nearby Charleston. Wyatt spotted Billy Clanton attempting to leave town with the horse and, hand on his gun, persuaded Billy to release it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clantongang.com/oldwest/billy_history.html |accessdate=11 March 2011 |title=The Life and Times of Billy Clanton 1862\u20131881}}</ref> Behan was in Charleston to serve a subpoena on Ike Clanton.

But after being appointed, Behan appointed another man, [[Southern Democrat]] Harry Woods, to the position that Wyatt thought would go to him.\n\nAt the preliminary hearing into Ike's murder charges against the Earps after the gunfight at the O.K.

This happened sometime after Behan had been appointed undersheriff in November 1880, and his move to Cochise County sheriff the next spring. At the time, Wyatt was not a law officer, but had used the threat of Behan riding out to the Clantons' ranch as a bluff to get Clanton to turn over the horse. As it happened, Behan was riding to the ranch to serve a subpoena related to the ballot-box stuffing incident, not to recover the horse, and the incident embarrassed the [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] and also Behan, who for a time had been made to look like he was supporting Earp against the Cowboys.\n\n=== Split from Sadie ===\n\nSometime during early 1881, Sadie arrived home to find Behan in bed with the wife of a friend of theirs, and she kicked Behan out<ref name=rasmussen>{{cite news|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|title=LA Then and Now: Mrs. Wyatt Earp Packed Her Own Punch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/04/local/me-37325|accessdate=29 June 2011 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 4, 2000}}</ref> of the home they had built with her father's money.<ref name=heritagebarra /> One version of the story is that Sadie had taken Albert, who had a hearing impairment, to San Francisco for treatment.

Corral]] and was known for his opposition to the [[Earp family|Earps]]. Behan was sheriff of [[Yavapai County]] from 1871 to 1873. He was married and had two children, but his wife divorced him, accusing him of consorting with prostitutes. He was elected to the [[7th Arizona Territorial Legislature|Seventh Arizona Legislative Assembly]], representing [[Yavapai County, Arizona|Yavapai County]]. In 1881, [[Wyatt Earp]] served for about five months as undersheriff of the eastern half of [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima County]]. When Wyatt resigned, Behan was appointed to fill his place, which included the mining [[boomtown]] [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. When Cochise County was formed in February 1881, Behan was appointed as its first sheriff. Tombstone became the new [[county seat]] and Behan's headquarters. [[Josephine Earp|Sadie Marcus]] was his mistress, possibly as early as 1875 in [[Tip Top, Arizona]], and certainly from 1880 until she found him in bed with another woman and kicked him out in mid-1881.\n\nAfter the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Behan testified at length against the Earps. He supported the  [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]]' statements that they had raised their hands and offered no resistance, and that the Earps and Doc Holliday had murdered three cowboys. After the Earps were exonerated, Deputy U.S. Marshal [[Virgil Earp]] was maimed in an ambush on December 28, 1881, and assistant deputy [[Morgan Earp]] was killed by assassins on March 18, 1882. The [[outlaw]] Cowboys named as suspects in both shootings were either let go on a technicality or were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys. Wyatt Earp killed one of the suspects, [[Frank Stilwell]], in Tucson. Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt and his federal posse set out [[Earp Vendetta Ride|after other suspects]], pursued by Behan and his county posse composed mostly of Cowboys.\n\nBehan's posse never caught up with the much smaller federal posse. The Earps left Tombstone under a cloud of suspicion. Sadie left Tombstone for San Francisco in early 1882, and Wyatt Earp followed her to San Francisco, where they began a lifelong relationship that lasted 46 years. Behan was arrested for [[Graft (politics)|graft]] and later failed to win re-election as sheriff. He later was appointed as the warden of the [[Yuma Territorial Prison]] and had various other government jobs until his death in 1912.\n\n== Early life ==\nBehan was born in October 24, 1844,<ref name=riggs/><ref name=birthdate>{{cite census |title=Twelfth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Washington, D.C. |roll=ED 81 |page=3 |line=18}}</ref><ref name=birthdate2>{{cite census |title=Thirteenth Census of the United States |year=1900 |location=Tucson, Pima County, Territory of Arizona |roll=ED 103 |page=13A |line=31}}</ref><ref group=notes>John H.

Corral. He said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident shortly before his appointment. Searching for a stolen horse belonging to him, Wyatt learned in late 1880 that the horse was in nearby Charleston.

But after being appointed, Behan appointed another man, [[Southern Democrat]] Harry Woods, to the position that Wyatt thought would go to him.\n\nAt the preliminary hearing into Ike's murder charges against the Earps after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Behan explained that he appointed Woods rather than Earp due to an incident involving a stolen horse of Virgil Earp's, which was recovered by Wyatt from Billy Clanton. This happened sometime after Behan had been appointed undersheriff in November 1880, and his move to Cochise County sheriff the next spring. At the time, Wyatt was not a law officer, but had used the threat of Behan riding out to the Clantons' ranch as a bluff to get Clanton to turn over the horse. As it happened, Behan was riding to the ranch to serve a subpoena related to the ballot-box stuffing incident, not to recover the horse, and the incident embarrassed the [[The Cowboys (Cochise County)|Cowboys]] and also Behan, who for a time had been made to look like he was supporting Earp against the Cowboys.\n\n=== Split from Sadie ===\n\nSometime during early 1881, Sadie arrived home to find Behan in bed with the wife of a friend of theirs, and she kicked Behan out<ref name=rasmussen>{{cite news|last=Rasmussen|first=Cecilia|title=LA Then and Now: Mrs. Wyatt Earp Packed Her Own Punch|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/04/local/me-37325|accessdate=29 June 2011 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=June 4, 2000}}</ref> of the home they had built with her father's money.<ref name=heritagebarra /> One version of the story is that Sadie had taken Albert, who had a hearing impairment, to San Francisco for treatment.

Wyatt felt he had no choice but to take the law into his own hands.<ref name=wgbh>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/wyatt-transcript/ |title=WGBH American Experience: Wyatt Earp, Complete Program Transcript, season 22, episode 2 |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=13 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn March 20, while escorting Virgil and his wife Addie through Tucson to catch a train, new Deputy U.S. Marshal Wyatt Earp and [[Warren Earp]], Doc Holliday, Johnson and Sherman McMaster shot [[Frank Stilwell]] as he was lying in wait in the train yard. [[Justice of the Peace]] Charles Meyer issued [[arrest warrant]]s for the Earp posse. He sent a telegram to Tombstone telling Behan they were wanted in Tucson for killing Stilwell. The telegraph office manager was a friend to the Earps and delayed delivery long enough to allow the Earps and their associates to get ready to leave town Tuesday evening. Behan got the telegram in the early evening.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wyattearp.net/wefs.html|title=Grand Jury Indictment for the Killing of Frank Stilwell|date=March 25, 1882|accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref> He found the men in the lobby of the Cosmopolitan Hotel, heavily armed.

An investigation found that Behan had somehow set aside $5,000 in funds while he was sheriff from unknown sources.<ref name=weiser /> Due to public and legislative unhappiness with Behan's performance, he was last on the Democratic Party's list of nominees for sheriff, an unusual result for a seated sheriff. Behan failed to gain the nomination and thus left office at the end of his term, in November 1882.\n\n== Later life ==\n\nBehan lived primarily in Tombstone through 1886. In 1887, he moved to Yuma, where he became the assistant superintendent of the [[Yuma Territorial Prison|Yuma Penitentiary]]. He killed one of several prisoners who died during a large escape attempt, saving a guard's life.<ref name=metz /> On April 7, 1888, he was promoted to prison superintendent, serving until July 1890.<ref name=metz /> His management of the prison was marked by prison disorder and mismanagement of public funds, generating complaints by the press. The ''Arizona Republic'' noted that $50,000 had passed through prison official's hands without any accounting. He faced censure for misuse of public funds and for running the prison in a \"coarse and brutal manner\" in 1890.<ref name=butler />{{rp|79\u201380}} The complaint against him specifically cited the prison conditions afforded Manuela Fimbres, a woman incarcerated in the Yuma Prison. She was allowed to roam free within the prison, and she became pregnant, delivered a child, and got pregnant again while he was warden.<ref name=butler />{{rp|80}} Former Tombstone resident and writer [[George W. Parsons]] commented that he thought Behan was \"on the wrong side of the bars\".<ref name=weiser>{{cite web|last=Weiser|first=Kathy|title=Johnny Harris Behan \u2013 1st Sheriff of Cochise County|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/law-johnbehan.html|publisher=LegendsofAmerica.com|accessdate=29 May 2011}}</ref>\n\nAfter twenty-seven years in Arizona, Behan moved east, and in 1891 was in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and by 1892 was in a commission business in [[Washington, D.C.]] He worked in various government and commissary capacities to the end of his life.<ref>{{cite book|author=Roy B. Young |title=Cochise County Cowboy War |publisher=Young and Sons Enterprises, Apache O.K. |year=1999 |asin= B0006R64NY }}</ref>\n\nOn July 3, 1893, he became an Inspector at Port of Customs at [[El Paso, Texas]]. On March 12, 1894, he received a 50 percent pay increase and was elevated to the position of Chinese Exclusion Inspector. (Behan had been a founding member of the \"Anti Chinese League\" in Tombstone).{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} For the next several years he traveled throughout the southwest arresting illegal Chinese immigrants. In 1897 he worked in the U.S. Patent Office, until at the outbreak of the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], Behan volunteered for and became corral-master or quartermaster at Tampa, Florida. When this conflict ended, trouble in the Far East began, and in 1900 he served overseas during the [[Boxer Rebellion]].<ref name=metz />\n\nIn 1901, he was living in Willard's Hotel at 1400 Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington D.C.. The census gave his occupation as \"Promoter\".<ref name=biggs2 />\n\nAfter the war ended, he returned to Tucson in 1901, where he became the business manager for the ''Tucson Citizen''. He then moved to El Paso, Texas, where he worked as a purchasing agent for Texas Bitulithic, a paving company. While in El Paso during 1908, he campaigned for sheriff but lost. On December 14, 1910, the acting governor of Arizona Territory gave him a commission as a railroad policeman in Arizona. He followed that with work supervising survey parties repairing levee breaks on the lower Colorado River. During 1911\u201312, he was head of the commissary for the Arizona Eastern Railroad.<ref name=metz />\n\n== Tombstone legacy ==\n\nLong after the gunfight, Behan continued to spread rumors about the Earps. On December 7, 1897, he was quoted in a story in the ''Washington Post'' which reported that he was staying at the Riggs House, a local hotel. The story was reprinted by the ''San Francisco Call'', which quoted Behan describing the Earp's lawbreaking behavior in Tombstone.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=San Francisco Call |volume= 83 |number=7 |date= 7 December 1897 |title=Pioneer Days in Tombstone |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=SFC18971207.2.62&srpos=14&e=-------en--20--1--txt-txIN-%22virgil+earp%22------# |access-date=2 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\"The Clanton brothers and the McLowrys<!-- sic --> were a tough lot of rustlers who were the main perpetrators of the rascailly<!-- sic --> rife in that region. Between them and Earps rose a bitter feud over the division of the proceeds of the looting. The Earp boys believed they had failed to get a fair divide of the booty and swore vengeance. They caught their former allies in Tombstone unarmed and shot three of them dead while their hands were uplifted.\" Behan went on to say, \"They were hauled up before a Justice of the Peace... Warrants were issued for their arrest, and, summoning a posse, I went out to bring the Earps in. They were chased entirely out of the country and Tombstone knew them no more.\"}}\n\n== Death and burial ==\n\nBehan died at St. Mary's Catholic Hospital in [[Tucson, Arizona]], on June 7, 1912. His funeral was conducted by the Arizona Pioneers Historical Society, and their eulogy declared, \"he held positions of public trust, and in all was active, faithful, and honest.\"<ref name=butler/>{{rp|94}} The cause of death was [[arterial sclerosis]], and secondarily [[syphilis]], which he had contracted thirty years earlier (in 1882, while sheriff in Tombstone).

In the 1967 film, ''[[Hour of the Gun]]'', a character obviously inspired by Behan{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} is portrayed as a corrupt county sheriff named \"Jimmy Bryan\".\n\nIn 1959 and 1960, the actor [[Lash LaRue]] played Behan in five episodes of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]/[[Desilu]] western [[television series]], ''[[The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp]]'', starring [[Hugh O'Brian]] in the starring role.
