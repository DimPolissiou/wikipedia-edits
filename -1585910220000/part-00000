He was most famous for his [[verse drama]]s, which often convey his devout [[Catholicism]]. Claudel was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in six different years.<ref>Nobel Prize.org: \"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1831 Paul Claudel (Nomination Database)]\".</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Villeneuve-sur-F\u00e8re]] ([[Aisne]]), into a family of farmers and government officials. His father, Louis-Prosper, dealt in mortgages and bank transactions. His mother, the former Louise Cerveaux, came from a Champagne family of Catholic farmers and priests. Having spent his first years in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], he studied at the ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' of [[Bar-le-Duc]] and at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]] in 1881, when his parents moved to Paris. An unbeliever in his teenage years, he experienced a sudden conversion at the age of eighteen on Christmas Day 1886 while listening to a choir sing [[Vespers]] in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]: \"In an instant, my heart was touched, and I believed.\" He would remain an active Catholic for the rest of his life. He studied at the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]] (better known as [[Use of Sciences Po|Sciences Po]]).\n[[File:Augustins - Paul Claudel \u00e0 seize ans - Camille Claudel RA 941.jpg|thumb|left|140px|''Paul Claudel, age sixteen'', by his sister, [[Camille Claudel]], modeled in 1884 and cast in 1893]]\nThe young Claudel seriously considered entering a Benedictine monastery, but in the end began a career in the French diplomatic corps, in which he would serve from 1893 to 1936. He was first vice-consul in New York (April 1893), and later in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] (December 1893). He was French [[Consulate general|consul]] in China (1895&ndash;1909), including consul in Shanghai (June 1895), and vice-consul in [[Fuzhou]] (October 1900), consul in [[Tianjin]] (''Tientsin'') (1906\u20131909), in [[Prague]] (December 1909), [[Frankfurt am Main]] (October 1911), [[Hamburg]] (October 1913), [[Rome]] (1915-1916), ''ministre pl\u00e9nipotentiaire'' in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (1917-1918), [[Copenhagen]] (1920), ambassador in Tokyo (1922&ndash;1928), [[Washington, D.C.]] (1928&ndash;1933, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in 1933<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Deans of the Diplomatic Corps | date= 2013-03-01 | publisher= | url =https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/93591.htm | work = [[Bureau of Public Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of State]] | pages = | accessdate = 2018-09-24 | language = }}</ref>) and [[Brussels]] (1933\u20131936). While he served in Brazil during the First World War he supervised the continued provision of food supplies from South America to France. (His secretaries during the Brazil mission included [[Darius Milhaud]], later world-famous as a composer, who wrote [[incidental music]] to a number of Claudel's plays.)\n\nIn 1936 he retired to his [[ch\u00e2teau]] in [[Brangues]] ([[Is\u00e8re]]).\n\nAfter a long affair with Rosalie Vetch, a married woman with four children and pregnant with Claudel's child, ended in February 1905 (Vetch left him for another man), Claudel married [[Reine Sainte-Marie-Perrin]] on 15 March 1906.<ref>Ayral-Clause, Odile, ''Camille Claudel, A Life'', pp. 167-168</ref>\n\n==Work==\n{{Main|List of works by Paul Claudel}}\n{{French literature sidebar}}\nIn his youth Claudel was heavily influenced by the poetry of [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Symbolists]]. Like them, he was horrified by modern materialist views of life. Unlike most of them {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, his response was to embrace [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]]. All his writings are passionate rejections of the idea of a mechanical or random universe, instead proclaiming the deep [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[meaning of life|meaning of human life]] founded on God's all-governing grace and love.\n\nClaudel wrote in a unique verse style. He rejected traditional metrics in favour of long, luxuriant, unrhymed lines of free verse, the so-called ''verset claudelien'', influenced by the Latin psalms of the [[Vulgate]]. His language and imagery was often lush, mystical, exhilarating, consciously 'poetical'; the settings of his plays tended to be romantically distant, medieval France or sixteenth-century Spanish South America, yet spiritually all-encompassing, transcending the level of material realism. He used scenes of passionate, obsessive human love to convey with great power God's infinite love for humanity. His plays were often extraordinarily long, sometimes stretching to eleven hours, and pressed the realities of material staging to their limits. Yet they were physically staged, at least in part, to rapturous acclaim, and are not merely [[closet dramas]]. The most famous of his plays are ''Le Partage de Midi'' (\"The Break of Noon\", 1906), ''L'Annonce faite \u00e0 Marie'' (\"The Tidings Brought to Mary\", 1910) focusing on the themes of sacrifice, oblation and sanctification through the tale of a young medieval French peasant woman who contracts [[leprosy]], and ''Le Soulier de Satin'' (\"[[The Satin Slipper]]\",  1931), his deepest exploration of human and divine love and longing set in the Spanish empire of the [[siglo de oro]], which was staged at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] in 1943. In later years he wrote texts to be set to music, most notably ''[[Jeanne d'Arc au B\u00fbcher]]'' (\"Joan of Arc at the Stake\", 1939), an \"[[opera]]-[[oratorio]]\" with music by [[Arthur Honegger]].\n\nAs well as his verse dramas, Claudel also wrote much lyric poetry, for example the ''Cinq Grandes Odes'' (Five Great Odes, 1907).\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Paul Claudel on TIME Magazine, March 21, 1927.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Time Magazine'' (March 21, 1927)]]\n[[File:Camille Claudel.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Claudel]]]]\nClaudel was always a controversial figure during his lifetime, and remains so today. His devout Catholicism and his right-wing political views, both slightly unusual stances among his intellectual peers, made him, and continue to make him, unpopular in many circles. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nHis address of a poem (\"Paroles au Mar\u00e9chal,\" \"Words to the Marshal\") to Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] after the defeat of France in 1940, commending Petain for picking up and salvaging France's broken, wounded body, has been unflatteringly remembered, though it is less a paean to P\u00e9tain than a patriotic lament over the condition of France. As a Catholic, he could not avoid a sense of  satisfaction at the fall of the [[anti-clerical]] [[French Third Republic]]. However, accusations that he was a collaborationist based on the 1941 poem ignore the fact that support for Marshal P\u00e9tain and the surrender was, in the catastrophic atmosphere of defeat, emotional collapse and exhaustion in 1941, widespread throughout the French populace (witness the large majority vote in favour of P\u00e9tain and the dissolution of the Third Republic in the French Parliament in 1940, with support stretching across the political spectrum). Claudel's diaries make clear his consistent contempt for Nazism (condemning it as early as 1930 as \"demonic\" and \"wedded to Satan,\" and referring to [[communism]] and [[Nazism]] as \"[[Gog and Magog]]\"), and his attitude to the Vichy regime quickly hardened into opposition.  {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nHe also committed his sister [[Camille Claudel]] to a psychiatric hospital in March 1913, where she remained for the last 30 years of her life, visiting her seven times in those 30 years.<ref>Ayral-Clause, Odile, p. 217, 222, 225, 242, 245, 250</ref>  Records show that while she did have mental lapses, she was clear-headed while working on her art. An exhibition of her bronzes in the Swiss Foundation Gianadda from 16 November 1990 until February 1991 shows clearly what can be considered only a small proof of the timeless beauty of her sculptures, inspired by a genuine talent. Doctors tried to convince the family that she need not be in the institution, but still they kept her there. (The story forms the subject of a novel by [[Mich\u00e8le Desbordes]], ''La Robe bleue'', ''The Blue Dress''.)\n\nDespite in his earlier years sharing the old-fashioned antisemitism of conservative France, Claudel's response to the radical racialist Nazi kind was unequivocal, writing an open letter to the World Jewish Conference in 1935 condemning the Nuremberg Laws as \"abominable and stupid.\" His daughter-in-law's sister married a Jew, Paul-Louis Weiller, who was arrested by the Vichy government in October 1940. Claudel went to Vichy to intercede for him, to no avail; luckily Weiller managed to escape (with Claudel's assistance, the authorities suspected) and flee to New York. Claudel made known his anger at the Vichy government's anti-Jewish legislation, courageously writing a published letter to the Chief Rabbi, Israel Schwartz, in 1941 to express \"the disgust, horror, and indignation that all decent Frenchmen and especially Catholics feel in respect of the injustices, the despoiling, all the ill treatment of which our Jewish compatriots are now the victims... Israel is always the eldest son of the promise [of God], as it is today the eldest son of suffering.\" The Vichy authorities responded by having Claudel's house searched and keeping him under observation. His support for [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the Free French forces culminated in his victory ode addressed to de Gaulle when Paris was liberated in 1944.\n\nClaudel, a [[Conservatism|conservative]] of the old school, was clearly not a fascist. The French writers who were attracted by, and collaborated with, the Nazi \"New Order\" in Europe, much younger men like [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]] and [[Pierre Drieu la Rochelle]], tended to come from a very different background to Claudel's: they were [[nihilists]], ex-[[dadaists]], and [[futurists]] rather than old-fashioned Catholics (neither of the other two major French Catholic writers, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]] and [[Georges Bernanos]], were supporters of the Nazi occupation or the Vichy regime).\n\nAn interesting parallel to Claudel, for Anglophones, is [[T. S. Eliot]], whose later political and religious views were similar to Claudel's. As with Eliot, even those who dislike Claudel's religious and political beliefs, have generally admitted his genius as a writer. The British poet [[W. H. Auden]], at that time a left-leaning agnostic, acknowledged the importance of Paul Claudel in his famous poem \"In Memory of W. B. Yeats\" (1939). Writing about Yeats, Auden says in lines 52\u201355:\n{{quote|Time that with this strange excuse/Pardoned Kipling and his views,/And will pardon Paul Claudel,/Pardons him for writing well. (These lines are from the originally published version; they were excised by Auden in a later revision.)}}\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac wrote a song \"La soeur de Paul\" pour Mareva Galanter/2010.\nGeorge Steiner, in ''The Death of Tragedy'', calls him one of the three \"masters of drama\" in the twentieth century.\n\nPaul Claudel was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] on 4 April 1946.\n\nThe chapter of the [[National Honor Society|French National Honors Society]] at Syosset High School is named after Paul Claudel.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[L'Histoire de Tobie et de Sara]]''\n* ''[[L'Annonce faite \u00e0 Marie]]'', film adaptation\n* [[Lyc\u00e9e Claudel]], a [[French language]] high school in [[Ottawa]], Canada, named after him\n* [[Camille Claudel (film)|''Camille Claudel'']], 1988 film\n* ''[[Camille Claudel 1915]]'', 2013 film\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Sources==\n* Thody, P.M.W. \"Paul Claudel\", in ''The Fontana Biographical Companion to Modern Thought'', eds.

He was most famous for his [[verse drama]]s, which often convey his devout [[Catholicism]]. Claudel was nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in six different years.<ref>Nobel Prize.org: \"[https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=1831 Paul Claudel (Nomination Database)]\".</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Villeneuve-sur-F\u00e8re]] ([[Aisne]]), into a family of farmers and government officials. His father, Louis-Prosper, dealt in mortgages and bank transactions. His mother, the former Louise Cerveaux, came from a Champagne family of Catholic farmers and priests. Having spent his first years in [[Champagne (province)|Champagne]], he studied at the ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'' of [[Bar-le-Duc]] and at the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand]] in 1881, when his parents moved to Paris. An unbeliever in his teenage years, he experienced a sudden conversion at the age of eighteen on Christmas Day 1886 while listening to a choir sing [[Vespers]] in the cathedral of [[Notre Dame de Paris]]: \"In an instant, my heart was touched, and I believed.\" He would remain an active Catholic for the rest of his life. He studied at the [[Paris Institute of Political Studies]] (better known as [[Use of Sciences Po|Sciences Po]]).\n[[File:Augustins - Paul Claudel \u00e0 seize ans - Camille Claudel RA 941.jpg|thumb|left|140px|''Paul Claudel, age sixteen'', by his sister, [[Camille Claudel]], modeled in 1884 and cast in 1893]]\nThe young Claudel seriously considered entering a Benedictine monastery, but in the end began a career in the French diplomatic corps, in which he would serve from 1893 to 1936. He was first vice-consul in New York (April 1893), and later in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] (December 1893). He was French [[Consulate general|consul]] in China (1895&ndash;1909), including consul in Shanghai (June 1895), and vice-consul in [[Fuzhou]] (October 1900), consul in [[Tianjin]] (''Tientsin'') (1906\u20131909), in [[Prague]] (December 1909), [[Frankfurt am Main]] (October 1911), [[Hamburg]] (October 1913), [[Rome]] (1915-1916), ''ministre pl\u00e9nipotentiaire'' in [[Rio de Janeiro]] (1917-1918), [[Copenhagen]] (1920), ambassador in Tokyo (1922&ndash;1928), [[Washington, D.C.]] (1928&ndash;1933, Dean of the Diplomatic Corps in 1933<ref>{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Deans of the Diplomatic Corps | date= 2013-03-01 | publisher= | url =https://2009-2017.state.gov/s/cpr/rls/93591.htm | work = [[Bureau of Public Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of State]] | pages = | accessdate = 2018-09-24 | language = }}</ref>) and [[Brussels]] (1933\u20131936). While he served in Brazil during the First World War he supervised the continued provision of food supplies from South America to France. (His secretaries during the Brazil mission included [[Darius Milhaud]], later world-famous as a composer, who wrote [[incidental music]] to a number of Claudel's plays.)\n\nIn 1936 he retired to his [[ch\u00e2teau]] in [[Brangues]] ([[Is\u00e8re]]).\n\nAfter a long affair with Rosalie Vetch, a married woman with four children and pregnant with Claudel's child, ended in February 1905 (Vetch left him for another man), Claudel married [[Reine Sainte-Marie-Perrin]] on 15 March 1906.<ref>Ayral-Clause, Odile, ''Camille Claudel, A Life'', pp. 167-168</ref>\n\n==Work==\n{{Main|List of works by Paul Claudel}}\n{{French literature sidebar}}\nIn his youth Claudel was heavily influenced by the poetry of [[Arthur Rimbaud]] and the [[Symbolists]]. Like them, he was horrified by modern materialist views of life. Unlike most of them {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, his response was to embrace [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]]. All his writings are passionate rejections of the idea of a mechanical or random universe, instead proclaiming the deep [[spirituality|spiritual]] [[meaning of life|meaning of human life]] founded on God's all-governing grace and love.\n\nClaudel wrote in a unique verse style. He rejected traditional metrics in favour of long, luxuriant, unrhymed lines of free verse, the so-called ''verset claudelien'', influenced by the Latin psalms of the [[Vulgate]]. His language and imagery was often lush, mystical, exhilarating, consciously 'poetical'; the settings of his plays tended to be romantically distant, medieval France or sixteenth-century Spanish South America, yet spiritually all-encompassing, transcending the level of material realism. He used scenes of passionate, obsessive human love to convey with great power God's infinite love for humanity. His plays were often extraordinarily long, sometimes stretching to eleven hours, and pressed the realities of material staging to their limits. Yet they were physically staged, at least in part, to rapturous acclaim, and are not merely [[closet dramas]]. The most famous of his plays are ''Le Partage de Midi'' (\"The Break of Noon\", 1906), ''L'Annonce faite \u00e0 Marie'' (\"The Tidings Brought to Mary\", 1910) focusing on the themes of sacrifice, oblation and sanctification through the tale of a young medieval French peasant woman who contracts [[leprosy]], and ''Le Soulier de Satin'' (\"[[The Satin Slipper]]\",  1931), his deepest exploration of human and divine love and longing set in the Spanish empire of the [[siglo de oro]], which was staged at the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]] in 1943. In later years he wrote texts to be set to music, most notably ''[[Jeanne d'Arc au B\u00fbcher]]'' (\"Joan of Arc at the Stake\", 1939), an \"[[opera]]-[[oratorio]]\" with music by [[Arthur Honegger]].\n\nAs well as his verse dramas, Claudel also wrote much lyric poetry, for example the ''Cinq Grandes Odes'' (Five Great Odes, 1907).\n\n==Reputation==\n[[File:Paul Claudel on TIME Magazine, March 21, 1927.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Time Magazine'' (March 21, 1927)]]\n[[File:Camille Claudel.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Claudel]]]]\nClaudel was always a controversial figure during his lifetime, and remains so today. His devout Catholicism and his right-wing political views, both slightly unusual stances among his intellectual peers, made him, and continue to make him, unpopular in many circles. {{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nHis address of a poem (\"Paroles au Mar\u00e9chal,\" \"Words to the Marshal\") to Marshal [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]] after the defeat of France in 1940, commending Petain for picking up and salvaging France's broken, wounded body, has been unflatteringly remembered, though it is less a paean to Petain than a patriotic lament over the condition of France. As a Catholic, he could not avoid a sense of  satisfaction at the fall of the [[anti-clerical]] [[French Third Republic]]. However, accusations that he was a collaborationist based on the 1941 poem ignore the fact that support for Marshal Petain and the surrender was, in the catastrophic atmosphere of defeat, emotional collapse and exhaustion in 1941, widespread throughout the French populace (witness the large majority vote in favour of Petain and the dissolution of the Third Republic in the French Parliament in 1940, with support stretching across the political spectrum). Claudel's diaries make clear his consistent contempt for Nazism (condemning it as early as 1930 as \"demonic\" and \"wedded to Satan,\" and referring to [[communism]] and [[Nazism]] as \"[[Gog and Magog]]\"), and his attitude to the Vichy regime quickly hardened into opposition.  {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nHe also committed his sister [[Camille Claudel]] to a psychiatric hospital in March 1913, where she remained for the last 30 years of her life, visiting her seven times in those 30 years.<ref>Ayral-Clause, Odile, p. 217, 222, 225, 242, 245, 250</ref>  Records show that while she did have mental lapses, she was clear-headed while working on her art. An exhibition of her bronzes in the Swiss Foundation Gianadda from 16 November 1990 until February 1991 shows clearly what can be considered only a small proof of the timeless beauty of her sculptures, inspired by a genuine talent. Doctors tried to convince the family that she need not be in the institution, but still they kept her there. (The story forms the subject of a novel by [[Mich\u00e8le Desbordes]], ''La Robe bleue'', ''The Blue Dress''.)\n\nDespite in his earlier years sharing the old-fashioned antisemitism of conservative France, Claudel's response to the radical racialist Nazi kind was unequivocal, writing an open letter to the World Jewish Conference in 1935 condemning the Nuremberg Laws as \"abominable and stupid.\" His daughter-in-law's sister married a Jew, Paul-Louis Weiller, who was arrested by the Vichy government in October 1940. Claudel went to Vichy to intercede for him, to no avail; luckily Weiller managed to escape (with Claudel's assistance, the authorities suspected) and flee to New York. Claudel made known his anger at the Vichy government's anti-Jewish legislation, courageously writing a published letter to the Chief Rabbi, Israel Schwartz, in 1941 to express \"the disgust, horror, and indignation that all decent Frenchmen and especially Catholics feel in respect of the injustices, the despoiling, all the ill treatment of which our Jewish compatriots are now the victims... Israel is always the eldest son of the promise [of God], as it is today the eldest son of suffering.\" The Vichy authorities responded by having Claudel's house searched and keeping him under observation. His support for [[Charles de Gaulle]] and the Free French forces culminated in his victory ode addressed to de Gaulle when Paris was liberated in 1944.\n\nClaudel, a [[Conservatism|conservative]] of the old school, was clearly not a fascist. The French writers who were attracted by, and collaborated with, the Nazi \"New Order\" in Europe, much younger men like [[Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line]] and [[Pierre Drieu la Rochelle]], tended to come from a very different background to Claudel's: they were [[nihilists]], ex-[[dadaists]], and [[futurists]] rather than old-fashioned Catholics (neither of the other two major French Catholic writers, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mauriac]] and [[Georges Bernanos]], were supporters of the Nazi occupation or the Vichy regime).\n\nAn interesting parallel to Claudel, for Anglophones, is [[T. S. Eliot]], whose later political and religious views were similar to Claudel's. As with Eliot, even those who dislike Claudel's religious and political beliefs, have generally admitted his genius as a writer. The British poet [[W. H. Auden]], at that time a left-leaning agnostic, acknowledged the importance of Paul Claudel in his famous poem \"In Memory of W. B. Yeats\" (1939). Writing about Yeats, Auden says in lines 52\u201355:\n{{quote|Time that with this strange excuse/Pardoned Kipling and his views,/And will pardon Paul Claudel,/Pardons him for writing well. (These lines are from the originally published version; they were excised by Auden in a later revision.)}}\nJean-Charles de Castelbajac wrote a song \"La soeur de Paul\" pour Mareva Galanter/2010.\nGeorge Steiner, in ''The Death of Tragedy'', calls him one of the three \"masters of drama\" in the twentieth century.\n\nPaul Claudel was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] on 4 April 1946.\n\nThe chapter of the [[National Honor Society|French National Honors Society]] at Syosset High School is named after Paul Claudel.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[L'Histoire de Tobie et de Sara]]''\n* ''[[L'Annonce faite \u00e0 Marie]]'', film adaptation\n* [[Lyc\u00e9e Claudel]], a [[French language]] high school in [[Ottawa]], Canada, named after him\n* [[Camille Claudel (film)|''Camille Claudel'']], 1988 film\n* ''[[Camille Claudel 1915]]'', 2013 film\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==Sources==\n* Thody, P.M.W. \"Paul Claudel\", in ''The Fontana Biographical Companion to Modern Thought'', eds.

First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]]. In their first season there - 2001/2002 - the team achieved the bronze medal in the Polish Men's Volleyball Championship, defeating [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]] after three matches. In 2002/2003 ''Skra'' took 6th place in the league and lost in the second round of the [[CEV Cup]] in a match against Russian club Lokomotiv Yekaterinburg. The team had a new head coach - Ireneusz Mazur. In 2003/2004 the club was close to achieving its next medal. ''Skra'' lost against [[AZS Cz\u0119stochowa]] after five matches. The team was also defeated in the final match of the Polish Cup by KP Polska Energia Sosnowiec.\nIn 2004/2005 players of ''Skra'' began their masterful passe. They won first title of Polish Champion after three matches with [[Indykpol AZS Olsztyn|AZS Olsztyn]] and achieved their first Polish Cup also after a final match with the club from [[Olsztyn]] (3-1). The team repeated this success in the next season, when they won second title of Polish Champion in four final matches with [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]], and Polish Cup for the second year in a row (winning final match with [[AZS Cz\u0119stochowa]] (3-0)). They lost two matches against Greek [[Iraklis Thessaloniki V.C.]] in play-off 6 of [[2005\u201306 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2005/2006]].\n\nIn 2006, the new coach was [[Daniel Castellani]], who was the first coach of the club from outside Poland. He spent three seasons in [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. During his work ''PGE Skra'' won next three title of Polish Champion (2006/2007, 2007/2008, 2008/2009) and two Polish Cups (2007, 2009).

Next day, ''PGE Skra'' players won bronze medal in match with Italian [[Sisley Treviso]] (3-2).\n\nIn 2009 a new coach was hired. It was [[Jacek Nawrocki]]. The first success under the guidance of the new coach was the silver medal in the [[2009 FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|FIVB Club World Championship 2009]]. At this tournament after promoting from Pool B, ''PGE Skra'' won their semi final against [[VC Zenit-Kazan]] (3-1), but on November 8, 2009 the Polish club lost the final against [[Trentino Volley]] (0-3). 2 of 7 individual awards were received by ''PGE Skra'' players - [[Bartosz Kurek]] as the ''Best Scorer'', [[Marcin Mo\u017cd\u017conek]] as the ''Best Blocker''.\nIn 2010 the Polish team was the host of the Final Four [[2009\u201310 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2009/2010]] again.

First, it was a football club. In 1957, a volleyball section was created. In 1977 the football section was separated from the club and incorporated into [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Coal Mine|KWB Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]]. In 1991 [[Be\u0142chat\u00f3w Power Station]] became the sponsor of the club, and the club changed its name to Energetyczny Klub Sportowy (Energetic Sports Club) ''Skra''. In 1994, the club advanced to Polish league II, and in 1997 to league I \"B\" series. In 1999, it was promoted to series \"A\", but after a year it fell back down to series \"B\" again.\n\nIn 2001, the club led by [[Wies\u0142aw Czaja]] was promoted to [[PlusLiga]]. In their first season there - 2001/2002 - the team achieved the bronze medal in the Polish Men's Volleyball Championship, defeating [[Jastrz\u0119bski W\u0119giel]] after three matches. In 2002/2003 ''Skra'' took 6th place in the league and lost in the second round of the [[CEV Cup]] in a match against Russian club Lokomotiv Yekaterinburg. The team had a new head coach - Ireneusz Mazur. In 2003/2004 the club was close to achieving its next medal. ''Skra'' lost against [[AZS Cz\u0119stochowa]] after five matches. The team was also defeated in the final match of the Polish Cup by KP Polska Energia Sosnowiec.\nIn 2004/2005 players of ''Skra'' began their masterful passe.

A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other key and reports all key presses to the controlling software.

It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts.\n\nAs early as the 1870s, teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit [[stock market]] text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to [[stock ticker machine]]s to be immediately copied and displayed onto [[ticker tape]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Essay on Technology Advancements in Computer Interfaces\n|url=https://www.123helpme.com/technology-advancements-in-computer-interfaces-preview.asp?id=364629}}</ref> The teleprinter, in its more contemporary form, was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer [[Charles Krum]] and his son [[Howard Krum|Howard]], with early contributions by electrical engineer [[Frank Pearne]]. Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as [[Royal Earl House]] and [[Frederick G. Creed]].\n\nEarlier, [[Herman Hollerith]] developed the first keypunch devices, which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/pictures/gallery-ibm-100-years-of-thinking-big/|title=Gallery: IBM: 100 Years of THINKing Big|author=Smith, Andy|work=[[ZDNet]]|date=15 June 2011|accessdate=20 October 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210153020/http://www.zdnet.com/pictures/gallery-ibm-100-years-of-thinking-big/|archivedate=10 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe keyboard on the teleprinter played a strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication for most of the 20th century, while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long. The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards: the development of the [[ENIAC]] computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device, while the [[BINAC]] computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape (instead of paper) and data output.<ref>{{cite web  |website=ComputerWorld.com  |date=2 November 2012\n|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2493059/computer-peripherals/past-is-prototype--the-evolution-of-the-computer-keyboard.html\n|title=Past is prototype: The evolution of the computer keyboard}}</ref>\n\nThe keyboard remained the primary, most integrated computer peripheral well into the era of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as a consumer device in 1984. By this time, text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to [[Graphical user interface|comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Linear interface for graphical interface of touch-screen\n|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2494439\n|author=D Kocielinski |date=2013}}</ref> However, keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present, even as mobile personal computing devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] adapt the keyboard as an optional virtual, touchscreen-based means of data entry.\n\n==Types==\nThere are different types of keyboards available right now and each of them is designed with a focus on specific features that suit special needs.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=Master your keyboard - The ULTIMATE guide\n|url=https://mainform.net/master-your-keyboard-the-ultimate-guide/\n|date=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nOne factor determining the size of a keyboard is the presence of duplicate keys, such as a separate numeric keyboard or two each of Shift, ALT and CTL  \nfor convenience.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=Why does a keyboard have two Ctrl keys?\n|url=https://superuser.com/questions/466796/why-does-a-keyboard-have-two-ctrl-keys\n|date=27 August 2012\n|quote=The ctrl, alt, and shift keys .. one of the keys with one hand, your other hand is free to press another}}</ref>\n\nFurther, the keyboard size depends on the extent to which a system is used where a single action is produced by a combination of subsequent or simultaneous keystrokes (with modifier keys), or multiple pressing of a single key. A keyboard with few keys is called a [[keypad]].\n\nAnother factor determining the size of a keyboard is the size and spacing of the keys. The reduction is limited by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. Alternatively, a tool is used for pressing small keys.\n\n=== Standard ===\n[[File:LenovoKeyboard.jpg|thumb|right|A standard wired computer keyboard by Lenovo]]\n\nStandard alphanumeric keyboards have keys that are on three-quarter inch centers (0.750&nbsp;inches, 19.05&nbsp;mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150&nbsp;inches (3.81&nbsp;mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, [[punctuation]] symbols, numbers and a variety of [[Function Keys|function keys]]. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the [[enter key]] is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacturers imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboards: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.\n\n=== Laptop-size ===\n[[File:QWERTY keyboard.jpg|thumb|Keyboards on laptops usually have a shorter travel distance and a reduced set of keys.]]\n\nKeyboards on [[laptops]] and [[notebook computers]] usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke, shorter over travel distance, and a reduced set of keys. They may not have a numeric keypad, and the function keys may be placed in locations that differ from their placement on a standard, full-sized keyboard. The switch mechanism for a laptop keyboard is more likely to be a scissor switch than a rubber dome; this is opposite the trend for full-size keyboards.\n\n=== Flexible keyboards ===\nFlexible keyboards are a junction between normal type and laptop type keyboards: normal from the full arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows the user to fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface.

Small keyboards are also useful where there is a limited workspace.<ref>{{cite journal\n|title=Tablet Keyboard Configuration Affects Performance, Discomfort\n|author=MB Trudeau |journal=PLOS One |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages=e67525 |date=2013|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0067525|pmid = 23840730|pmc=3694062 }}</ref>\n\nA [[thumb keyboard]] (thumb board) is used in some personal digital assistants such as the [[Palm Treo]] and [[BlackBerry]] and some [[Ultra-Mobile PC]]s such as the [[OQO]].\n\nNumeric keyboards contain only numbers, mathematical symbols for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, a decimal point, and several function keys.

Try One Of These Four Alternatives}}</ref> These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|Arithmetic operators]], [[Numerical digit|numbers]], [[arrow keys]], [[Navigation key]]s, [[Num Lock]] and [[Enter key]].\n\n=== Multifunctional ===\n[[File:Ascom BEG 100.jpg|thumb|Multifunction keyboard with LCD function keys]]\n\nMultifunctional keyboards provide additional function beyond the standard keyboard. Many are programmable, configurable computer keyboards and some control multiple PCs, workstations (incl. [[Sun Microsystems|SUN]]) and other information sources (incl. Thomson Reuters FXT/[[Eikon]], [[Bloomberg Terminal|Bloomberg]], [[Electronic Broking Services|EBS]], etc.) usually in multi-screen work environments. Users have additional key functions as well as the standard functions and can typically use a single keyboard and mouse to access multiple sources. \n[[File:WEY Smart Touch.png|alt=WEY Smart Touch|thumb|Multifunction keyboard with touch]]\nMultifunctional keyboards may feature customised keypads, fully programmable function or soft keys for macros/pre-sets, biometric or [[smart card]] readers, [[trackball]]s, etc. New generation multifunctional keyboards feature a [[touchscreen]] display to stream video, control audio visual media and alarms, execute application inputs, configure individual desktop environments, etc. Multifunctional keyboards may also permit users to share access to PCs and other information sources. Multiple interfaces (serial, USB, audio, Ethernet, etc.) are used to integrate external devices. Some multifunctional keyboards are also used to directly and intuitively control video walls.\n\nCommon environments for multifunctional keyboards are complex, high-performance workplaces for [[Trading room|financial traders]] and [[control room]] operators (emergency services, security, air traffic management; industry, utilities management, etc.).\n\n== Non-standard layout and special-use types ==\n\n=== Chorded ===\n{{Main|Chorded keyboard}}\nWhile other keyboards generally associate one action with each key, chorded keyboards associate actions with combinations of key presses. Since there are many combinations available, chorded keyboards can effectively produce more actions on a board with fewer keys. Court reporters' [[stenotype]] machines use chorded keyboards to enable them to enter text much faster by typing a syllable with each stroke instead of one letter at a time. The fastest typists (as of 2007) use a stenograph, a kind of chorded keyboard used by most court reporters and closed-caption reporters. Some chorded keyboards are also made for use in situations where fewer keys are preferable, such as on devices that can be used with only one hand, and on small mobile devices that don't have room for larger keyboards. Chorded keyboards are less desirable in many cases because it usually takes practice and memorization of the combinations to become proficient.\n\n=== Software ===\n[[Virtual Keyboard|Software keyboards]] or on-screen keyboards often take the form of computer programs that display an image of a keyboard on the screen. Another input device such as a mouse or a touchscreen can be used to operate each virtual key to enter text. Software keyboards have become very popular in touchscreen enabled cell phones, due to the additional cost and space requirements of other types of hardware keyboards. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and some varieties of Linux include on-screen keyboards that can be controlled with the mouse. In software keyboards, the mouse has to be maneuvered onto the on-screen letters given by the software. On the click of a letter, the software writes the respective letter on the respective spot.\n\n=== Projection ===\n[[Projection keyboard]]s project an image of keys, usually with a laser, onto a flat surface. The device then uses a camera or infrared sensor to \"watch\" where the user's fingers move, and will count a key as being pressed when it \"sees\" the user's finger touch the projected image. Projection keyboards can simulate a full size keyboard from a very small projector. Because the \"keys\" are simply projected images, they cannot be felt when pressed. Users of projected keyboards often experience increased discomfort in their fingertips because of the lack of \"give\" when typing. A flat, non-reflective surface is also required for the keys to be projected. Most projection keyboards are made for use with [[PDA]]s and smartphones due to their small form factor.\n\n=== Optical keyboard technology ===\n{{Further|Keyboard technology}}\nAlso known as photo-optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard, photo-electric keyboard and optical key actuation detection technology.\n\nAn optical keyboard technology<ref>{{cite web |title=What is an Optical Keyboard? |url=https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-optical-keyboard.htm}}</ref> utilizes [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] and [[Photoelectric sensor|photo sensors]] to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located in the perimeter, mounted on a small [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]. The [[light]] is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Best Optical Keyboards\n   |url=https://www.gamingfactors.com/best-optical-keyboard}}</ref> require at least 2 beams (most commonly vertical beam and horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly horizontal beam).\n\n== Layout ==\n\n=== Alphabetic ===\n{{Main|Keyboard layout}}\n\n[[File:Qwerty.svg|thumb|The 104-key PC US English [[QWERTY]] keyboard layout evolved from the standard [[typewriter]] keyboard, with extra keys for computing.]]\n[[File:KB United States Dvorak.svg|right|thumb|The [[Dvorak keyboard layout]] arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.]]\n\nThere are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different [[keyboard layout]]s arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting, [[computer programming]], or other purposes. The [[US keyboard|United States keyboard layout]] is used as default in the currently most popular operating systems: Windows,<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/906693/en-us The default keyboard layout changes when you use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to a Windows XP-based computer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002238/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/906693/en-us |date=11 September 2014 }} (Microsoft)</ref> [[Mac OS X]]<ref>[http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1274 Mac OS X: Changing or resetting an account password] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205182058/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1274 |date=5 December 2010 }} (Apple)</ref> and [[Linux]].<ref>[http://www.mepislovers.org/forums/user_manual8.5/ MEPIS 8.5 user's manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207032244/http://www.mepislovers.org/forums/user_manual8.5/ |date=7 December 2010 }} (MEPISlovers.org)</ref><ref>[http://www.liberiangeek.net/2009/12/introduction-linux-mint-8-main-edition-helena/ An introduction to Linux Mint 8 \u2013 Main Edition (Helena)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225110203/http://www.liberiangeek.net/2009/12/introduction-linux-mint-8-main-edition-helena/ |date=25 December 2010 }} (Liberian Geek )</ref> The common QWERTY-based layout was designed early in the era of mechanical typewriters, so its ergonomics were compromised to allow for the mechanical limitations of the typewriter.\n\nAs the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor [[Christopher Sholes]] developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as [[Dvorak keyboard layout|Dvorak]] are not in widespread use.\n\nThe QWERTZ layout is widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters.\n\nAnother situation takes place with \"national\" layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for \u00d1 \u00f1; similarly, those for Portuguese, French and other European languages may have a special key for the character \u00c7 \u00e7. The [[AZERTY]] layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.\n\nIn bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Qu\u00e9bec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as \"\u00e9\" or \"\u00e0\" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).\n\nKeyboards in many parts of [[Asia]] may have special keys to switch between the Latin character set and a completely different typing system. Japanese layout keyboards can be switched between various Japanese input methods and the Latin alphabet by signaling the operating system's input interpreter of the change, and some operating systems (namely the Windows family) interpret the character \"\\\" as \"\u00a5\" for display purposes without changing the bytecode which has led some keyboard makers to mark \"\\\" as \"\u00a5\" or both.\n\nKeyboards for other alphabets supported include:\n* [[Arabic keyboard]] \u2013 In the Arab world, keyboards can often be switched between Arabic and Latin characters. \n[[File:KB Arabic.svg|thumb|right|Arabic keyboard]]\n* [[Russian alphabet|Russian keyboard]], which uses [[Cyrillic script]]\n\n[[File:KB Russian.svg|alt=|thumb|Russian keyboard]]\n\n* [[Hebrew keyboard]]\n[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|A [[Hebrew keyboard]] lets the user type in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the [[Latin alphabet]].]]\n\nIn Microsoft word, ALT+Shift allows shifting between languages.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=How to Change the Keyboard Input Language in Windows 7\n|url=https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-change-keyboard-input-language}}</ref>\n\n=== Key types ===\n\n==== Alphanumeric ====\n[[File:Greek Keyboard (Macbook Pro).jpg|thumb|A Greek keyboard lets the user type in both [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Latin alphabet]] ([[MacBook Pro]]).]]\n[[File:CtrlWindowsAlt.jpg|thumb|The [[Control key|Control]], [[Windows key|Windows]], and [[Alt key|Alt]] keys are important modifier keys.]]\n[[File:Space-cadet.jpg|thumb|A [[Space-cadet keyboard]] has many modifier keys.]]\nAlphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.\nThe [[Space bar]] is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.\n\n==== Modifier keys ====\n[[Modifier key]]s are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, {{keypress|Alt|F4}} in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an [[active window]]. In contrast, pressing just {{keypress|F4}} will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing.\nThe most widely used modifier keys include the [[Control key]], [[Shift key]] and the [[Alt key]]. The [[AltGr key]] is used to access additional symbols for keys that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the [[Option key]] and [[Command key]], respectively. On [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Lisp machine]] keyboards, the [[Meta key]] is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a [[Windows key]]. Compact keyboard layouts often use a [[Fn key]]. \"[[Dead key]]s\" allow placement of a [[diacritic]] mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the [[Compose key]]).\nThe Enter/Return key typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an \"entry\" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.\n\n==== Cursor keys ====\nNavigation keys or cursor keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dedicated Cursor Control and Navigation Keys \n|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/kb/groupNav-c.html}}</ref> [[Arrow keys]] are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the [[Page Up and Page Down keys]], scroll the page up and down. The [[Home key]] is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the [[End key]] puts the cursor at the end of the line. The [[Tab key]] advances the cursor to the next tab stop.\nThe [[Insert key]] is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The [[Delete key]] discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position \"back\" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The [[Backspace]] key deletes the preceding character.\n[[Lock key]]s lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The lock keys include [[Scroll lock]], [[Num lock]] (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and [[Caps lock]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Keyboard, num lock and caps lock key LED's not working\n|url=https://social.technet.microsoft.com}}</ref>\n\n====System commands====\n[[File:4800-52-mainframe-dumb-terminal-keyboard.jpg|thumb|4800-52 mainframe / dumb terminal keyboard, circa mid 1980s. Note the obscure configuration of modifier and arrow keys, line feed key, break key, blank keys, and repeat key.]]\nThe [[System request|SysRq]] and [[Print screen]] commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a \"panic\" button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the [[Linux kernel]]; see [[Magic SysRq key]]). The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but in the present it usually puts a screenshot in the [[Clipboard_(computing)|clipboard]].\n\n=====Break key=====\nThe [[Break key]]/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.\nIn programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.\n\n=====Escape key=====\n{{Main|Esc key}} \n<!-- some keyboards said \"ESCAPE\" - NYTimes agrees -->\nThe '''[[Esc key|escape key]]''' (often abbreviated Esc) \"nearly all of the time\"<ref name=SF>{{cite web\n|title=The Qodem Homepage |website=SourceForge |url=http://qodem.sourceforge.net\n|date=18 June 2017 |quote=Nearly all of the time pressing the ESCAPE key ... will work to get out of dialogs}}</ref> signals ''Stop'' -<ref>{{cite web |website=NYTimes.com \n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/who-made-that-escape-key.html\n|title=Who Made That Escape Key?\n|author=Pagan Kennedy |date=5 October 2012}}</ref> ''QUIT'' -<ref>{{cite web |title=Kermit Manual |url=http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftp/bbcmicro/bbckerdoc.txt |quote=ESCAPE key to quit and input another command.}}</ref> let me \"get out of a dialog\"<ref name=SF/> (or pop-up window):<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Escape key |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/escape-key}}</ref> LET ME ESCAPE.\n\nAnother common application today of the Esc key is to trigger the Stop button in many web browsers.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n======ESC origins======\n'''ESC''' was part of the standard keyboard of the [[Teletype Model 33]] (introduced in 1964 and used with many early minicomputers).<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Gesswein |date=n.d. |url=https://www.pdp8.net/asr33/asr33.shtml |title=ASR 33 Information}}<br/>https://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/kbd_top.shtml?large</ref> The [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT50]], introduced July 1974, also had an Esc key. The [[TECO (text editor)|TECO]] text editor (ca 1963) and its descendant [[GNU Emacs|Emacs]] (ca 1985) use the Esc key extensively.\n\n<!-- The NYTimes Obit (June 25, 2004, by Steve Lohr) got it right: the 2012 humor piece was wrong -->\nHistorically it also served as a type of shift key, such that one or more following characters were interpreted differently, hence the term [[escape sequence]], which refers to a series of characters, usually preceded by the [[escape character]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ASCII Table \u2013 ANSI Escape sequences\n|url=http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.itsmarc.com/crs/mergedprojects/marcspec/marcspec/accessing_alternate_graphic_character_sets_character_sets_marc_8.htm\n|title=Accessing Alternate Graphic Character Sets}}</ref>\n\nOn machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the \"start\" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Keyboard shortcuts in Windows  |website=microsoft.com\n|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts}}</ref>\n\n=====Enter key=====\nThe Enter key is located: One in the alphanumeric keys and the other one is in the numeric keys. When one worked something on their computer and wanted to do something with their work, pressing the enter key would do the command they ordered. Another function is to create a space for next paragraph. When one typed and finished typing a paragraph and they wanted to have a second paragraph, they could press enter and it would do spacing.\n\n=====Shift key=====\nShift key: when one presses shift and a letter, it will capitalize the letter pressed with the shift key. Another use is to type more symbols than appear to be available, for instance the apostrophe key is accompanied with a quotation mark on the top. If one wants to type the quotation mark but pressed that key alone, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe. The quotation mark will only appear if both the required key and the Shift key are pressed.\n\n=====Menu key=====\nThe [[Menu key]] or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only.  This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 [[keyboard shortcut]]).\n\n==== Miscellaneous ====\n[[File:Multimediakb.jpg|thumb|Multimedia buttons on some keyboards give quick access to the Internet or control the volume of the speakers.]]\nMany, but not all, computer keyboards have a [[numeric keypad]] to the right of the alphabetic keyboard, often separated from the other groups of keys such as the function keys and system command keys, which contains numbers, basic mathematical symbols (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.), and a few function keys. On [[Keyboard layout#East Asian languages|Japanese/Korean keyboards]], there may be [[Language input keys]] for changing the language to use. Some keyboards have power management keys (e.g., power key, sleep key and wake key); Internet keys to access a web browser or [[E-mail]]; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls; or keys that can be programmed by the user to launch a specified application or a command like minimizing all windows.\n\n=== Numeric keys ===\nWhen we calculate, we use these numeric keys to type numbers. Symbols concerned with calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division symbols are located in this group of keys. The enter key in this keys indicate the equal sign.\n\n==== Multiple layouts ====\nIt is possible to install multiple keyboard layouts within an operating system and switch between them, either through features implemented within the OS, or through an external application.

A key press generates a [[scancode]] which is interpreted as an alphanumeric character or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.\n\nThe arrangement of symbols of specific language can be customized. An existing keyboard layout can be edited, and a new layout can be created using this type of software.\n\nFor example, {{sic|Ukelele|nolink=y}} for Mac,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brownie|first1=John|title={{sic|Ukelele|nolink=y}}|url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele|website=NRSI: Computers & Writing Systems|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=8 December 2014|date=8 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206054653/http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele|archivedate=6 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator<ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx | title = The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator | work = msdn.microsoft.com | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100119042027/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx | archivedate = 19 January 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> and open-source [[Avro Keyboard]] for Windows provide the ability to customize the keyboard layout as desired.\n\n== Illumination ==\nKeyboards and keypads may be illuminated from inside, especially on equipment for mobile use.

These keyboards cost from 80 to 120&nbsp;[[USD]] and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were [[reed switch]]es (contacts enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the switch plunger).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, lower-cost direct-contact key switches were introduced, but their life in switch cycles was much shorter (rated ten million cycles) because they were open to the environment. This became more acceptable, however, for use in computer terminals at the time, which began to see increasingly shorter model lifespans as they advanced.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Keyboard Switches \u2013 How Computer Keyboards Work\n|url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/keyboard3.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies not to use self-contained switches.<ref>{{cite book  |page=159\n|title=Complete Computer Hardware Only\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSYjdR425p4C}}</ref> There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other \"solid-state switch\" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved, and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer.\n\nMeanwhile, [[IBM]] made their own keyboards, using their own patented technology: Keys on older IBM keyboards<ref>{{cite web |website=SlashDot.org\n|title=Why I Use the IBM Model M Keyboard That's Older Than I Am\n|url=https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/18/07/07/0121214/why-i-use-the-ibm-model-m-keyboard-thats-older-than-i-am |date=7 July 2018}}</ref> were made with a [[Buckling-spring keyboard|\"buckling spring\"]] mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, triggering a hammer that presses two plastic sheets (membranes) with conductive traces together, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound and gives physical feedback for the typist, indicating that the key has been depressed.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119578337324301744 A Passion for the Keys: Particular About What You Type On?

Over time, less key travel was accepted in the market, finally landing on 0.110&nbsp;inches (2.79&nbsp;mm). Coincident with this, Key Tronic was the first company to introduce a keyboard that was only about one inch thick. And now keyboards measure only about a half-inch thick.\n\nKeytops are an important element of keyboards. In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a \"dish shape\" on top, like typewriters before them. Keyboard key legends must be extremely durable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme mechanical wear from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by [[Injection molding#Design|two-shot (or double-shot, or two-color) molding]], where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to save cost, other methods were explored, such as [[Dye-sublimation printer|sublimation printing]] and [[laser engraving]], both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time.\n\nInitially, sublimation printing, where a special ink is printed onto the keycap surface and the application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or \"[[keycap]]s\", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material.\n\nThree final mechanical technologies brought keyboards to where they are today, driving the cost well under $10:\n# \"Monoblock\" keyboard designs were developed where individual switch housings were eliminated and a one-piece \"monoblock\" housing used instead. This was possible because of molding techniques that could provide very tight tolerances for the switch-plunger holes and guides across the width of the keyboard so that the key plunger-to-housing clearances were not too tight or too loose, either of which could cause the keys to bind.\n# The use of contact-switch membrane sheets under the monoblock. This technology came from [[Membrane switch|flat-panel switch membranes]], where the switch contacts are printed inside of a top and bottom layer, with a spacer layer in between, so that when pressure is applied to the area above, a direct electrical contact is made.  The membrane layers can be printed by very-high volume, low-cost \"reel-to-reel\" printing machines, with each keyboard membrane cut and punched out afterwards.\n\nPlastic materials played a very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until \"monoblocks\" came along, GE's \"self-lubricating\" [[Polyoxymethylene plastic|Delrin]] was the only plastic material for keyboard switch plungers that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling switch plungers was undesirable because it would attract [[dirt]] over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key plungers and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But Delrin was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic.  However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75&nbsp;mm to 2.79&nbsp;mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monoblocks also made of ABS.\n\nIn common use, the term \"mechanical keyboard\" refers to a keyboard with individual mechanical key switches, each of which contains a fully encased plunger with a spring below it and metallic electrical contacts on a side. The plunger sits on the spring and the key will often close the contacts when the plunger is pressed half-way. Other switches require the plunger to be fully pressed down. The depth at which the plunger must be pressed for the contacts to close is known as the activation distance. Analog keyboards with key switches whose activation distance can be reconfigured through software, optical switches that work by blocking laser beams, and Hall Effect keyboards that use key switches that use a magnet to activate a hall sensor, are also available.\n\n=== Control processor ===\n[[File:FunctionalCircuitDiagramOfKeyboardNumPadScanningProcedure-small.gif|thumb|Scanning procedure]]\nComputer keyboards include [[Keyboard controller (computing)|control circuitry]] to convert key presses into key codes<ref>{{cite web   |website=IOPscience.org\n|title=Electrical commutation matrixer keyboards for computers\n|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/book/978-0-7503-1350-6/chapter/bk978-0-7503-1350-6ch16}}</ref> (usually [[scancodes]]) that the computer's electronics can understand. The key switches are connected via the printed circuit board in an electrical X-Y matrix where a voltage is provided sequentially to the Y lines and, when a key is depressed, detected sequentially by scanning the X lines.\n\nThe first computer keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor was introduced in 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip [[Intel 8048|8048]] [[microcontroller]] variant since it became available in 1978.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Complete Computer Hardware Only |page=161\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSYjdR425p4C}}</ref> The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional to the extent that the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.\n\nOne test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the caps lock key. The keyboard sends the key code to the [[Device driver|keyboard driver]] running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the Shift, alt and control state of the keyboard.\n\nSome lower-quality keyboards have multiple or false key entries due to inadequate electrical designs.  These are caused by inadequate keyswitch \"debouncing\" or inadequate keyswitch matrix layout that don't allow multiple keys to be depressed at the same time, both circumstances which are explained below:\n\nWhen pressing a keyboard key, the key contacts may \"bounce\" against each other for several milliseconds before they settle into firm contact. When released, they bounce some more until they revert to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) \"[[Switch|debounces]]\" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one \"confirmed\" keystroke.\n\nSome low-quality keyboards also suffer problems with ''[[Rollover (key)|rollover]]'' (that is, when multiple keys pressed at the same time, or when keys are pressed so fast that multiple keys are down within the same milliseconds). Early \"solid-state\" keyswitch keyboards did not have this problem because the keyswitches are electrically isolated from each other, and early \"direct-contact\" keyswitch keyboards avoided this problem by having isolation diodes for every keyswitch. These early keyboards had \"n-key\" rollover, which means any number of keys can be depressed and the keyboard will still recognize the next key depressed. But when three keys are pressed (electrically closed) at the same time in a \"direct contact\" keyswitch matrix that doesn't have isolation diodes, the keyboard electronics can see a fourth \"phantom\" key which is the intersection of the X and Y lines of the three keys. Some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. \"Three-key\" rollover, also called \"phantom key blocking\" or \"phantom key lockout\", will only register three keys and ignore all others until one of the three keys is lifted. This is undesirable, especially for fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys), and [[game]]s (designed for multiple key presses).\n\nAs direct-contact membrane keyboards became popular, the available rollover of keys was optimized by analyzing the most common key sequences and placing these keys so that they do not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.\n\n=== Connection types ===\nThere are several ways of connecting a keyboard to a [[system unit]] (more precisely, to its [[keyboard controller (computing)|keyboard controller]]) using cables, including the standard [[AT keyboard|AT connector]] commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] and the [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary [[Apple Desktop Bus]] for its keyboard connector.\n\n[[Wireless keyboard]]s have become popular. A wireless keyboard must have a transmitter built in, and a receiver connected to the computer's keyboard port; it communicates either by [[radio frequency]] (RF) or [[infrared]] (IR) signals. A wireless keyboard may use industry standard [[Bluetooth]] radio communication,  in which case the receiver may be built into the computer. Wireless keyboards need batteries for power, and may be at risk of data [[eavesdropping]]. Wireless [[solar keyboard]]s charge their batteries from small [[solar panel]]s using natural or artificial light. The 1984 [[Apricot Portable]] is an early example of an IR keyboard.\n\n== Alternative text-entering methods ==\n[[File:OnBoardKeyboard.png|thumb|On-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility]]\n[[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]]-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, [[Google Book Search]]) and promises more for the future.\n\n[[Speech recognition]] converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). This technology has also reached an advanced state and is implemented in [[List of speech recognition software|various software products]]. For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) speech recognition is starting to replace the keyboard.  However, the lack of privacy when issuing voice commands and dictation makes this kind of input unsuitable for many environments.\n\n[[Pointing device]]s can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]], [[Dasher (software)|Dasher]] and on-screen [[virtual keyboard]]s.\n\n== Other issues ==\n\n=== Keystroke logging ===\nUnencrypted wireless [[Bluetooth]] keyboards are known to be vulnerable to signal theft by placing a covert listening device in the same room as the keyboard to sniff and record ''Bluetooth'' packets for the purpose of logging keys typed by the user. [[Microsoft]] wireless keyboards 2011 and earlier are documented to have this vulnerability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/this-fake-phone-charger-is-actually-recording-every-key-you-type/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000591|title=This Fake Phone Charger Is Actually Recording Every Key You Type|date=14 January 2015|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810130517/https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/this-fake-phone-charger-is-actually-recording-every-key-you-type/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000591|archivedate=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Keystroke logging]] (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legally to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] for various illegal or malicious acts. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypass other security measures.\n\nKeystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.\n\n[[Spyware|Anti-spyware]] applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by anti-spyware programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured. [[Network monitoring|Network monitors]] (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from \"[[phoning home]]\" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/herley-poster_abstract.pdf |title=How To Login From an Internet Cafe Without Worrying About Keyloggers |author=Herley, Cormac and Florencio, Dinei |publisher=Microsoft Research, Redmond |date=2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808070236/http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/herley-poster_abstract.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKeyboards are also known to emit electromagnetic signatures that can be detected using special spying equipment to reconstruct the keys pressed on the keyboard. Neal O'Farrell, executive director of the Identity Theft Council, revealed to InformationWeek that \"More than 25 years ago, a couple of former spooks showed me how they could capture a user's ATM PIN, from a van parked across the street, simply by capturing and decoding the electromagnetic signals generated by every keystroke,\" O'Farrell said. \"They could even capture keystrokes from computers in nearby offices, but the technology wasn't sophisticated enough to focus in on any specific computer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities-and-threats/6-tips-to-secure-webcams-stop-keyloggers/d/d-id/1113012|title=6 Tips To Secure Webcams, Stop Keyloggers|work=Dark Reading|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233248/http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities-and-threats/6-tips-to-secure-webcams-stop-keyloggers/d/d-id/1113012|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical injury ===\n[[File:Computer Workstation Variables.jpg|thumb|Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability.<ref>Berkeley Lab.

It was through such devices that modern computer keyboards inherited their layouts.\n\nAs early as the 1870s, teleprinter-like devices were used to simultaneously type and transmit [[stock market]] text data from the keyboard across telegraph lines to [[stock ticker machine]]s to be immediately copied and displayed onto [[ticker tape]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Essay on Technology Advancements in Computer Interfaces\n|url=https://www.123helpme.com/technology-advancements-in-computer-interfaces-preview.asp?id=364629}}</ref> The teleprinter, in its more contemporary form, was developed from 1907 to 1910 by American mechanical engineer [[Charles Krum]] and his son [[Howard Krum|Howard]], with early contributions by electrical engineer [[Frank Pearne]]. Earlier models were developed separately by individuals such as [[Royal Earl House]] and [[Frederick G. Creed]].\n\nEarlier, [[Herman Hollerith]] developed the first keypunch devices, which soon evolved to include keys for text and number entry akin to normal typewriters by the 1930s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/pictures/gallery-ibm-100-years-of-thinking-big/|title=Gallery: IBM: 100 Years of THINKing Big|author=Smith, Andy|work=[[ZDNet]]|date=15 June 2011|accessdate=20 October 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210153020/http://www.zdnet.com/pictures/gallery-ibm-100-years-of-thinking-big/|archivedate=10 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe keyboard on the teleprinter played a strong role in point-to-point and point-to-multipoint communication for most of the 20th century, while the keyboard on the keypunch device played a strong role in data entry and storage for just as long. The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards: the development of the [[ENIAC]] computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device, while the [[BINAC]] computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both data entry onto magnetic tape (instead of paper) and data output.<ref>{{cite web  |website=ComputerWorld.com  |date=2 November 2012\n|url=https://www.computerworld.com/article/2493059/computer-peripherals/past-is-prototype--the-evolution-of-the-computer-keyboard.html\n|title=Past is prototype: The evolution of the computer keyboard}}</ref>\n\nThe keyboard remained the primary, most integrated computer peripheral well into the era of personal computing until the introduction of the mouse as a consumer device in 1984. By this time, text-only user interfaces with sparse graphics gave way to [[Graphical user interface|comparatively graphics-rich icons on screen]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Linear interface for graphical interface of touch-screen\n|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2494439\n|author=D Kocielinski |date=2013}}</ref> However, keyboards remain central to human-computer interaction to the present, even as mobile personal computing devices such as [[smartphone]]s and [[Tablet computer|tablets]] adapt the keyboard as an optional virtual, touchscreen-based means of data entry.\n\n==Types==\nThere are different types of keyboards available right now and each of them is designed with a focus on specific features that suit special needs.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=Master your keyboard - The ULTIMATE guide\n|url=https://mainform.net/master-your-keyboard-the-ultimate-guide/\n|date=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n\nOne factor determining the size of a keyboard is the presence of duplicate keys, such as a separate numeric keyboard or two each of Shift, ALT and CTL  \nfor convenience.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=Why does a keyboard have two Ctrl keys?\n|url=https://superuser.com/questions/466796/why-does-a-keyboard-have-two-ctrl-keys\n|date=27 August 2012\n|quote=The ctrl, alt, and shift keys .. one of the keys with one hand, your other hand is free to press another}}</ref>\n\nFurther, the keyboard size depends on the extent to which a system is used where a single action is produced by a combination of subsequent or simultaneous keystrokes (with modifier keys), or multiple pressing of a single key. A keyboard with few keys is called a [[keypad]].\n\nAnother factor determining the size of a keyboard is the size and spacing of the keys. The reduction is limited by the practical consideration that the keys must be large enough to be easily pressed by fingers. Alternatively, a tool is used for pressing small keys.\n\n=== Standard ===\n[[File:LenovoKeyboard.jpg|thumb|right|A standard wired computer keyboard by Lenovo]]\n\nStandard alphanumeric keyboards have keys that are on three-quarter inch centers (0.750&nbsp;inches, 19.05&nbsp;mm), and have a key travel of at least 0.150&nbsp;inches (3.81&nbsp;mm). Desktop computer keyboards, such as the 101-key US traditional keyboards or the 104-key Windows keyboards, include alphabetic characters, [[punctuation]] symbols, numbers and a variety of [[Function Keys|function keys]]. The internationally common 102/104 key keyboards have a smaller left shift key and an additional key with some more symbols between that and the letter to its right (usually Z or Y). Also the [[enter key]] is usually shaped differently. Computer keyboards are similar to electric-typewriter keyboards but contain additional keys, such as the command or Windows keys. There is no standard computer keyboard, although many manufacturers imitate the keyboard of PCs. There are actually three different PC keyboards: the original PC keyboard with 84 keys, the AT keyboard also with 84 keys and the enhanced keyboard with 101 keys. The three differ somewhat in the placement of function keys, the control keys, the return key, and the shift key.\n\n=== Laptop-size ===\n[[File:QWERTY keyboard.jpg|thumb|Keyboards on laptops usually have a shorter travel distance and a reduced set of keys.]]\n\nKeyboards on [[laptops]] and [[notebook computers]] usually have a shorter travel distance for the keystroke, shorter over travel distance, and a reduced set of keys. They may not have a numeric keypad, and the function keys may be placed in locations that differ from their placement on a standard, full-sized keyboard. The switch mechanism for a laptop keyboard is more likely to be a scissor switch than a rubber dome; this is opposite the trend for full-size keyboards.\n\n=== Flexible keyboards ===\nFlexible keyboards are a junction between normal type and laptop type keyboards: normal from the full arrangement of keys, and laptop from the short key distance. Additionally, the flexibility allows the user to fold/roll the keyboard for better storage and transfer. However, for typing the keyboard must be resting on a hard surface. The vast majority<ref>{{cite web  |date=31 August 2017\n|title=What is a Flexible Keyboard?   |website=Nelson-Miller.com\n|url=http://www.nelson-miller.com/what-is-a-flexible-keyboard\n|quote=flexible keyboards ..The most common material .. silicone}}</ref> of flexible keyboards in the market are made from silicone; this material makes them water- and dust-proof.

Try One Of These Four Alternatives}}</ref> These keys are collectively known as a numeric pad, numeric keys, or a numeric keypad, and it can consist of the following types of keys: [[Arithmetic#Arithmetic operations|Arithmetic operators]], [[Numerical digit|numbers]], [[arrow keys]], [[Navigation key]]s, [[Num Lock]] and [[Enter key]].\n\n=== Multifunctional ===\n[[File:Ascom BEG 100.jpg|thumb|Multifunction keyboard with LCD function keys]]\n\nMultifunctional keyboards provide additional function beyond the standard keyboard. Many are programmable, configurable computer keyboards and some control multiple PCs, workstations (incl. [[Sun Microsystems|SUN]]) and other information sources (incl. Thomson Reuters FXT/[[Eikon]], [[Bloomberg Terminal|Bloomberg]], [[Electronic Broking Services|EBS]], etc.) usually in multi-screen work environments. Users have additional key functions as well as the standard functions and can typically use a single keyboard and mouse to access multiple sources. \n[[File:WEY Smart Touch.png|alt=WEY Smart Touch|thumb|Multifunction keyboard with touch]]\nMultifunctional keyboards may feature customised keypads, fully programmable function or soft keys for macros/pre-sets, biometric or [[smart card]] readers, [[trackball]]s, etc. New generation multifunctional keyboards feature a [[touchscreen]] display to stream video, control audio visual media and alarms, execute application inputs, configure individual desktop environments, etc. Multifunctional keyboards may also permit users to share access to PCs and other information sources. Multiple interfaces (serial, USB, audio, Ethernet, etc.) are used to integrate external devices. Some multifunctional keyboards are also used to directly and intuitively control video walls.\n\nCommon environments for multifunctional keyboards are complex, high-performance workplaces for [[Trading room|financial traders]] and [[control room]] operators (emergency services, security, air traffic management; industry, utilities management, etc.).\n\n== Non-standard layout and special-use types ==\n\n=== Chorded ===\n{{Main|Chorded keyboard}}\nWhile other keyboards generally associate one action with each key, chorded keyboards associate actions with combinations of key presses. Since there are many combinations available, chorded keyboards can effectively produce more actions on a board with fewer keys. Court reporters' [[stenotype]] machines use chorded keyboards to enable them to enter text much faster by typing a syllable with each stroke instead of one letter at a time. The fastest typists (as of 2007) use a stenograph, a kind of chorded keyboard used by most court reporters and closed-caption reporters. Some chorded keyboards are also made for use in situations where fewer keys are preferable, such as on devices that can be used with only one hand, and on small mobile devices that don't have room for larger keyboards. Chorded keyboards are less desirable in many cases because it usually takes practice and memorization of the combinations to become proficient.\n\n=== Software ===\n[[Virtual Keyboard|Software keyboards]] or on-screen keyboards often take the form of computer programs that display an image of a keyboard on the screen. Another input device such as a mouse or a touchscreen can be used to operate each virtual key to enter text. Software keyboards have become very popular in touchscreen enabled cell phones, due to the additional cost and space requirements of other types of hardware keyboards. Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and some varieties of Linux include on-screen keyboards that can be controlled with the mouse. In software keyboards, the mouse has to be maneuvered onto the on-screen letters given by the software. On the click of a letter, the software writes the respective letter on the respective spot.\n\n=== Projection ===\n[[Projection keyboard]]s project an image of keys, usually with a laser, onto a flat surface. The device then uses a camera or infrared sensor to \"watch\" where the user's fingers move, and will count a key as being pressed when it \"sees\" the user's finger touch the projected image. Projection keyboards can simulate a full size keyboard from a very small projector. Because the \"keys\" are simply projected images, they cannot be felt when pressed. Users of projected keyboards often experience increased discomfort in their fingertips because of the lack of \"give\" when typing. A flat, non-reflective surface is also required for the keys to be projected. Most projection keyboards are made for use with [[PDA]]s and smartphones due to their small form factor.\n\n=== Optical keyboard technology ===\n{{Further|Keyboard technology}}\nAlso known as photo-optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard, photo-electric keyboard and optical key actuation detection technology.\n\nAn optical keyboard technology<ref>{{cite web |title=What is an Optical Keyboard? |url=https://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-optical-keyboard.htm}}</ref> utilizes [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] and [[Photoelectric sensor|photo sensors]] to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located in the perimeter, mounted on a small [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]. The [[light]] is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards<ref>{{cite web\n   |title=Best Optical Keyboards\n   |url=https://www.gamingfactors.com/best-optical-keyboard}}</ref> require at least 2 beams (most commonly vertical beam and horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly horizontal beam).\n\n== Layout ==\n\n=== Alphabetic ===\n{{Main|Keyboard layout}}\n\n[[File:Qwerty.svg|thumb|The 104-key PC US English [[QWERTY]] keyboard layout evolved from the standard [[typewriter]] keyboard, with extra keys for computing.]]\n[[File:KB United States Dvorak.svg|right|thumb|The [[Dvorak keyboard layout]] arranges keys so that frequently used keys are easiest to press, which reduces muscle fatigue when typing common English.]]\n\nThere are a number of different arrangements of alphabetic, numeric, and punctuation symbols on keys. These different [[keyboard layout]]s arise mainly because different people need easy access to different symbols, either because they are inputting text in different languages, or because they need a specialized layout for mathematics, accounting, [[computer programming]], or other purposes. The [[US keyboard|United States keyboard layout]] is used as default in the currently most popular operating systems: Windows,<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/906693/en-us The default keyboard layout changes when you use Remote Desktop Connection to connect to a Windows XP-based computer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911002238/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/906693/en-us |date=11 September 2014 }} (Microsoft)</ref> [[Mac OS X]]<ref>[http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1274 Mac OS X: Changing or resetting an account password] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205182058/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1274 |date=5 December 2010 }} (Apple)</ref> and [[Linux]].<ref>[http://www.mepislovers.org/forums/user_manual8.5/ MEPIS 8.5 user's manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101207032244/http://www.mepislovers.org/forums/user_manual8.5/ |date=7 December 2010 }} (MEPISlovers.org)</ref><ref>[http://www.liberiangeek.net/2009/12/introduction-linux-mint-8-main-edition-helena/ An introduction to Linux Mint 8 \u2013 Main Edition (Helena)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225110203/http://www.liberiangeek.net/2009/12/introduction-linux-mint-8-main-edition-helena/ |date=25 December 2010 }} (Liberian Geek )</ref> The common QWERTY-based layout was designed early in the era of mechanical typewriters, so its ergonomics were compromised to allow for the mechanical limitations of the typewriter.\n\nAs the letter-keys were attached to levers that needed to move freely, inventor [[Christopher Sholes]] developed the QWERTY layout to reduce the likelihood of jamming. With the advent of computers, lever jams are no longer an issue, but nevertheless, QWERTY layouts were adopted for electronic keyboards because they were widely used. Alternative layouts such as [[Dvorak keyboard layout|Dvorak]] are not in widespread use.\n\nThe QWERTZ layout is widely used in Germany and much of Central Europe. The main difference between it and QWERTY is that Y and Z are swapped, and most special characters such as brackets are replaced by diacritical characters.\n\nAnother situation takes place with \"national\" layouts. Keyboards designed for typing in Spanish have some characters shifted, to release the space for \u00d1 \u00f1; similarly, those for Portuguese, French and other European languages may have a special key for the character \u00c7 \u00e7. The [[AZERTY]] layout is used in France, Belgium and some neighbouring countries. It differs from the QWERTY layout in that the A and Q are swapped, the Z and W are swapped, and the M is moved from the right of N to the right of L (where colon/semicolon is on a US keyboard). The digits 0 to 9 are on the same keys, but to be typed the shift key must be pressed. The unshifted positions are used for accented characters.\n\nIn bilingual regions of Canada and in the French-speaking province of Qu\u00e9bec, keyboards can often be switched between an English and a French-language keyboard; while both keyboards share the same QWERTY alphabetic layout, the French-language keyboard enables the user to type accented vowels such as \"\u00e9\" or \"\u00e0\" with a single keystroke. Using keyboards for other languages leads to a conflict: the image on the key does not correspond to the character. In such cases, each new language may require an additional label on the keys, because the standard keyboard layouts do not share even similar characters of different languages (see the example in the figure above).\n\nKeyboards in many parts of [[Asia]] may have special keys to switch between the Latin character set and a completely different typing system. Japanese layout keyboards can be switched between various Japanese input methods and the Latin alphabet by signaling the operating system's input interpreter of the change, and some operating systems (namely the Windows family) interpret the character \"\\\" as \"\u00a5\" for display purposes without changing the bytecode which has led some keyboard makers to mark \"\\\" as \"\u00a5\" or both.\n\nKeyboards for other alphabets supported include:\n* [[Arabic keyboard]] \u2013 In the Arab world, keyboards can often be switched between Arabic and Latin characters. \n[[File:KB Arabic.svg|thumb|right|Arabic keyboard]]\n* [[Russian alphabet|Russian keyboard]], which uses [[Cyrillic script]]\n\n[[File:KB Russian.svg|alt=|thumb|Russian keyboard]]\n\n* [[Hebrew keyboard]]\n[[File:Hebkeyboard.JPG|thumb|A [[Hebrew keyboard]] lets the user type in both [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and the [[Latin alphabet]].]]\n\nIn Microsoft word, ALT+Shift allows shifting between languages.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=How to Change the Keyboard Input Language in Windows 7\n|url=https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-change-keyboard-input-language}}</ref>\n\n=== Key types ===\n\n==== Alphanumeric ====\n[[File:Greek Keyboard (Macbook Pro).jpg|thumb|A Greek keyboard lets the user type in both [[Greek language|Greek]] and the [[Latin alphabet]] ([[MacBook Pro]]).]]\n[[File:CtrlWindowsAlt.jpg|thumb|The [[Control key|Control]], [[Windows key|Windows]], and [[Alt key|Alt]] keys are important modifier keys.]]\n[[File:Space-cadet.jpg|thumb|A [[Space-cadet keyboard]] has many modifier keys.]]\nAlphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys are used in the same fashion as a typewriter keyboard to enter their respective symbol into a word processing program, text editor, data spreadsheet, or other program. Many of these keys will produce different symbols when modifier keys or shift keys are pressed. The alphabetic characters become uppercase when the shift key or Caps Lock key is depressed. The numeric characters become symbols or punctuation marks when the shift key is depressed. The alphabetical, numeric, and punctuation keys can also have other functions when they are pressed at the same time as some modifier keys.\nThe [[Space bar]] is a horizontal bar in the lowermost row, which is significantly wider than other keys. Like the alphanumeric characters, it is also descended from the mechanical typewriter. Its main purpose is to enter the space between words during typing. It is large enough so that a thumb from either hand can use it easily. Depending on the operating system, when the space bar is used with a modifier key such as the control key, it may have functions such as resizing or closing the current window, half-spacing, or backspacing. In computer games and other applications the key has myriad uses in addition to its normal purpose in typing, such as jumping and adding marks to check boxes. In certain programs for playback of digital video, the space bar is used for pausing and resuming the playback.\n\n==== Modifier keys ====\n[[Modifier key]]s are special keys that modify the normal action of another key, when the two are pressed in combination. For example, {{keypress|Alt|F4}} in Microsoft Windows will close the program in an [[active window]]. In contrast, pressing just {{keypress|F4}} will probably do nothing, unless assigned a specific function in a particular program. By themselves, modifier keys usually do nothing.\nThe most widely used modifier keys include the [[Control key]], [[Shift key]] and the [[Alt key]]. The [[AltGr key]] is used to access additional symbols for keys that have three symbols printed on them. On the Macintosh and Apple keyboards, the modifier keys are the [[Option key]] and [[Command key]], respectively. On [[Sun Microsystems]] and [[Lisp machine]] keyboards, the [[Meta key]] is used as a modifier and for Windows keyboards, there is a [[Windows key]]. Compact keyboard layouts often use a [[Fn key]]. \"[[Dead key]]s\" allow placement of a [[diacritic]] mark, such as an accent, on the following letter (e.g., the [[Compose key]]).\nThe Enter/Return key typically causes a command line, window form or dialog box to operate its default function, which is typically to finish an \"entry\" and begin the desired process. In word processing applications, pressing the enter key ends a paragraph and starts a new one.\n\n==== Cursor keys ====\nNavigation keys or cursor keys include a variety of keys which move the cursor to different positions on the screen.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dedicated Cursor Control and Navigation Keys \n|url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/kb/groupNav-c.html}}</ref> [[Arrow keys]] are programmed to move the cursor in a specified direction; page scroll keys, such as the [[Page Up and Page Down keys]], scroll the page up and down. The [[Home key]] is used to return the cursor to the beginning of the line where the cursor is located; the [[End key]] puts the cursor at the end of the line. The [[Tab key]] advances the cursor to the next tab stop.\nThe [[Insert key]] is mainly used to switch between overtype mode, in which the cursor overwrites any text that is present on and after its current location, and insert mode, where the cursor inserts a character at its current position, forcing all characters past it one position further. The [[Delete key]] discards the character ahead of the cursor's position, moving all following characters one position \"back\" towards the freed place. On many notebook computer keyboards the key labeled Delete (sometimes Delete and Backspace are printed on the same key) serves the same purpose as a Backspace key. The [[Backspace]] key deletes the preceding character.\n[[Lock key]]s lock part of a keyboard, depending on the settings selected. The lock keys are scattered around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numeric pad. The lock keys include [[Scroll lock]], [[Num lock]] (which allows the use of the numeric keypad), and [[Caps lock]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Keyboard, num lock and caps lock key LED's not working\n|url=https://social.technet.microsoft.com}}</ref>\n\n====System commands====\n[[File:4800-52-mainframe-dumb-terminal-keyboard.jpg|thumb|4800-52 mainframe / dumb terminal keyboard, circa mid 1980s. Note the obscure configuration of modifier and arrow keys, line feed key, break key, blank keys, and repeat key.]]\nThe [[System request|SysRq]] and [[Print screen]] commands often share the same key. SysRq was used in earlier computers as a \"panic\" button to recover from crashes (and it is still used in this sense to some extent by the [[Linux kernel]]; see [[Magic SysRq key]]). The Print screen command used to capture the entire screen and send it to the printer, but in the present it usually puts a screenshot in the [[Clipboard_(computing)|clipboard]].\n\n=====Break key=====\nThe [[Break key]]/Pause key no longer has a well-defined purpose. Its origins go back to teleprinter users, who wanted a key that would temporarily interrupt the communications line. The Break key can be used by software in several different ways, such as to switch between multiple login sessions, to terminate a program, or to interrupt a modem connection.\nIn programming, especially old DOS-style BASIC, Pascal and C, Break is used (in conjunction with Ctrl) to stop program execution. In addition to this, Linux and variants, as well as many DOS programs, treat this combination the same as Ctrl+C. On modern keyboards, the break key is usually labeled Pause/Break. In most Windows environments, the key combination Windows key+Pause brings up the system properties.\n\n=====Escape key=====\n{{Main|Esc key}} \n<!-- some keyboards said \"ESCAPE\" - NYTimes agrees -->\nThe '''[[Esc key|escape key]]''' (often abbreviated Esc) \"nearly all of the time\"<ref name=SF>{{cite web\n|title=The Qodem Homepage |website=SourceForge |url=http://qodem.sourceforge.net\n|date=18 June 2017 |quote=Nearly all of the time pressing the ESCAPE key ... will work to get out of dialogs}}</ref> signals ''Stop'' -<ref>{{cite web |website=NYTimes.com \n|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/magazine/who-made-that-escape-key.html\n|title=Who Made That Escape Key?\n|author=Pagan Kennedy |date=5 October 2012}}</ref> ''QUIT'' -<ref>{{cite web |title=Kermit Manual |url=http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/ftp/bbcmicro/bbckerdoc.txt |quote=ESCAPE key to quit and input another command.}}</ref> let me \"get out of a dialog\"<ref name=SF/> (or pop-up window):<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Escape key |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/escape-key}}</ref> LET ME ESCAPE.\n\nAnother common application today of the Esc key is to trigger the Stop button in many web browsers.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n======ESC origins======\n'''ESC''' was part of the standard keyboard of the [[Teletype Model 33]] (introduced in 1964 and used with many early minicomputers).<ref>{{cite web |first=David |last=Gesswein |date=n.d. |url=https://www.pdp8.net/asr33/asr33.shtml |title=ASR 33 Information}}<br/>https://www.pdp8.net/asr33/pics/kbd_top.shtml?large</ref> The [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[VT50]], introduced July 1974, also had an Esc key. The [[TECO (text editor)|TECO]] text editor (ca 1963) and its descendant [[GNU Emacs|Emacs]] (ca 1985) use the Esc key extensively.\n\n<!-- The NYTimes Obit (June 25, 2004, by Steve Lohr) got it right: the 2012 humor piece was wrong -->\nHistorically it also served as a type of shift key, such that one or more following characters were interpreted differently, hence the term [[escape sequence]], which refers to a series of characters, usually preceded by the [[escape character]].<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ASCII Table \u2013 ANSI Escape sequences\n|url=http://ascii-table.com/ansi-escape-sequences-vt-100.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.itsmarc.com/crs/mergedprojects/marcspec/marcspec/accessing_alternate_graphic_character_sets_character_sets_marc_8.htm\n|title=Accessing Alternate Graphic Character Sets}}</ref>\n\nOn machines running Microsoft Windows, prior to the implementation of the Windows key on keyboards, the typical practice for invoking the \"start\" button was to hold down the control key and press escape. This process still works in Windows 95, 98, Me, NT 4, 2000, XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Keyboard shortcuts in Windows  |website=microsoft.com\n|url=https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts}}</ref>\n\n=====Enter key=====\nThe Enter key is located: One in the alphanumeric keys and the other one is in the numeric keys. When one worked something on their computer and wanted to do something with their work, pressing the enter key would do the command they ordered. Another function is to create a space for next paragraph. When one typed and finished typing a paragraph and they wanted to have a second paragraph, they could press enter and it would do spacing.\n\n=====Shift key=====\nShift key: when one presses shift and a letter, it will capitalize the letter pressed with the shift key. Another use is to type more symbols than appear to be available, for instance the apostrophe key is accompanied with a quotation mark on the top. If one wants to type the quotation mark but pressed that key alone, the symbol that would appear would be the apostrophe. The quotation mark will only appear if both the required key and the Shift key are pressed.\n\n=====Menu key=====\nThe [[Menu key]] or Application key is a key found on Windows-oriented computer keyboards. It is used to launch a context menu with the keyboard rather than with the usual right mouse button. The key's symbol is usually a small icon depicting a cursor hovering above a menu. On some Samsung keyboards the cursor in the icon is not present, showing the menu only.  This key was created at the same time as the Windows key. This key is normally used when the right mouse button is not present on the mouse. Some Windows public terminals do not have a Menu key on their keyboard to prevent users from right-clicking (however, in many Windows applications, a similar functionality can be invoked with the Shift+F10 [[keyboard shortcut]]).\n\n==== Miscellaneous ====\n[[File:Multimediakb.jpg|thumb|Multimedia buttons on some keyboards give quick access to the Internet or control the volume of the speakers.]]\nMany, but not all, computer keyboards have a [[numeric keypad]] to the right of the alphabetic keyboard, often separated from the other groups of keys such as the function keys and system command keys, which contains numbers, basic mathematical symbols (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.), and a few function keys. On [[Keyboard layout#East Asian languages|Japanese/Korean keyboards]], there may be [[Language input keys]] for changing the language to use. Some keyboards have power management keys (e.g., power key, sleep key and wake key); Internet keys to access a web browser or [[E-mail]]; and/or multimedia keys, such as volume controls; or keys that can be programmed by the user to launch a specified application or a command like minimizing all windows.\n\n=== Numeric keys ===\nWhen we calculate, we use these numeric keys to type numbers. Symbols concerned with calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division symbols are located in this group of keys. The enter key in this keys indicate the equal sign.\n\n==== Multiple layouts ====\nIt is possible to install multiple keyboard layouts within an operating system and switch between them, either through features implemented within the OS, or through an external application.

A key press generates a [[scancode]] which is interpreted as an alphanumeric character or control function. Depending on operating systems, various application programs are available to create, add and switch among keyboard layouts. Many programs are available, some of which are language specific.\n\nThe arrangement of symbols of specific language can be customized. An existing keyboard layout can be edited, and a new layout can be created using this type of software.\n\nFor example, {{sic|Ukelele|nolink=y}} for Mac,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brownie|first1=John|title={{sic|Ukelele|nolink=y}}|url=http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele|website=NRSI: Computers & Writing Systems|publisher=[[SIL International]]|accessdate=8 December 2014|date=8 March 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206054653/http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele|archivedate=6 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator<ref>{{cite web | url = http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx | title = The Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator | work = msdn.microsoft.com | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100119042027/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb964665.aspx | archivedate = 19 January 2010 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> and open-source [[Avro Keyboard]] for Windows provide the ability to customize the keyboard layout as desired.\n\n== Illumination ==\nKeyboards and keypads may be illuminated from inside, especially on equipment for mobile use. Both keyboards built into computers and external ones may support backlighting; external backlit keyboards may have a wired USB connection, or be connected wirelessly and powered by batteries. Illumination facilitates the use of the keyboard or keypad in dark environments. \n\nFor general productivity, only the keys may be uniformly backlit, without distracting light around the keys. \n\n[[File:Keyboard keys with light.jpg|thumb|Keys with integrated LED indicator lights]]\nMany gaming keyboards are designed to have an aesthetic as well as functional appeal, with multiple colours, and colour-coded keys to make it easier for gamers to find command keys while playing in a dark room.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://windowsreport.com/best-backlit-keyboards/ |title=10 best backlit keyboards to buy |website=Windows Report|date=2 September 2018 |author=Kenneth Kimari  |accessdate= 19 March 2019}}</ref> Many keyboards not otherwise illuminated may have small LED indicator lights in a few important function keys, or elsewhere on the housing, if their function is activated (see photo).\n\n{{see also|ThinkLight}}\n\n== Technology ==\n{{Main|Keyboard technology}}\n\n=== Key switches ===\n<!-- 3 googles on 3 phrases in the first 3 paragraphs found hits for each: OR? so far, not true -->\n<!-- also: very suspicious, since KeyTronic/Key Tronic is in para 3... an old-days company -->\nIn the first electronic keyboards in the early 1970s, the key switches were individual switches inserted into holes in metal frames. These keyboards cost from 80 to 120&nbsp;[[USD]] and were used in mainframe data terminals. The most popular switch types were [[reed switch]]es (contacts enclosed in a vacuum in a glass capsule, affected by a magnet mounted on the switch plunger).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn the mid-1970s, lower-cost direct-contact key switches were introduced, but their life in switch cycles was much shorter (rated ten million cycles) because they were open to the environment. This became more acceptable, however, for use in computer terminals at the time, which began to see increasingly shorter model lifespans as they advanced.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Keyboard Switches \u2013 How Computer Keyboards Work\n|url=https://computer.howstuffworks.com/keyboard3.htm}}</ref>\n\nIn 1978, Key Tronic Corporation introduced keyboards with capacitive-based switches, one of the first keyboard technologies not to use self-contained switches.<ref>{{cite book  |page=159\n|title=Complete Computer Hardware Only\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSYjdR425p4C}}</ref> There was simply a sponge pad with a conductive-coated Mylar plastic sheet on the switch plunger, and two half-moon trace patterns on the printed circuit board below. As the key was depressed, the capacitance between the plunger pad and the patterns on the PCB below changed, which was detected by integrated circuits (IC). These keyboards were claimed to have the same reliability as the other \"solid-state switch\" keyboards such as inductive and Hall-effect, but competitive with direct-contact keyboards. Prices of $60 for keyboards were achieved, and Key Tronic rapidly became the largest independent keyboard manufacturer.\n\nMeanwhile, [[IBM]] made their own keyboards, using their own patented technology: Keys on older IBM keyboards<ref>{{cite web |website=SlashDot.org\n|title=Why I Use the IBM Model M Keyboard That's Older Than I Am\n|url=https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/18/07/07/0121214/why-i-use-the-ibm-model-m-keyboard-thats-older-than-i-am |date=7 July 2018}}</ref> were made with a [[Buckling-spring keyboard|\"buckling spring\"]] mechanism, in which a coil spring under the key buckles under pressure from the user's finger, triggering a hammer that presses two plastic sheets (membranes) with conductive traces together, completing a circuit. This produces a clicking sound and gives physical feedback for the typist, indicating that the key has been depressed.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119578337324301744 A Passion for the Keys: Particular About What You Type On?

Over time, less key travel was accepted in the market, finally landing on 0.110&nbsp;inches (2.79&nbsp;mm). Coincident with this, Key Tronic was the first company to introduce a keyboard that was only about one inch thick. And now keyboards measure only about a half-inch thick.\n\nKeytops are an important element of keyboards. In the beginning, keyboard keytops had a \"dish shape\" on top, like typewriters before them. Keyboard key legends must be extremely durable over tens of millions of depressions, since they are subjected to extreme mechanical wear from fingers and fingernails, and subject to hand oils and creams, so engraving and filling key legends with paint, as was done previously for individual switches, was never acceptable. So, for the first electronic keyboards, the key legends were produced by [[Injection molding#Design|two-shot (or double-shot, or two-color) molding]], where either the key shell or the inside of the key with the key legend was molded first, and then the other color molded second. But, to save cost, other methods were explored, such as [[Dye-sublimation printer|sublimation printing]] and [[laser engraving]], both methods which could be used to print a whole keyboard at the same time.\n\nInitially, sublimation printing, where a special ink is printed onto the keycap surface and the application of heat causes the ink molecules to penetrate and commingle with the plastic modules, had a problem because finger oils caused the molecules to disperse, but then a necessarily very hard clear coating was applied to prevent this. Coincident with sublimation printing, which was first used in high volume by IBM on their keyboards, was the introduction by IBM of single-curved-dish keycaps to facilitate quality printing of key legends by having a consistently curved surface instead of a dish. But one problem with sublimation or laser printing was that the processes took too long and only dark legends could be printed on light-colored keys. On another note, IBM was unique in using separate shells, or \"[[keycap]]s\", on keytop bases. This might have made their manufacturing of different keyboard layouts more flexible, but the reason for doing this was that the plastic material that needed to be used for sublimation printing was different from standard ABS keytop plastic material.\n\nThree final mechanical technologies brought keyboards to where they are today, driving the cost well under $10:\n# \"Monoblock\" keyboard designs were developed where individual switch housings were eliminated and a one-piece \"monoblock\" housing used instead. This was possible because of molding techniques that could provide very tight tolerances for the switch-plunger holes and guides across the width of the keyboard so that the key plunger-to-housing clearances were not too tight or too loose, either of which could cause the keys to bind.\n# The use of contact-switch membrane sheets under the monoblock. This technology came from [[Membrane switch|flat-panel switch membranes]], where the switch contacts are printed inside of a top and bottom layer, with a spacer layer in between, so that when pressure is applied to the area above, a direct electrical contact is made.  The membrane layers can be printed by very-high volume, low-cost \"reel-to-reel\" printing machines, with each keyboard membrane cut and punched out afterwards.\n\nPlastic materials played a very important part in the development and progress of electronic keyboards. Until \"monoblocks\" came along, GE's \"self-lubricating\" [[Polyoxymethylene plastic|Delrin]] was the only plastic material for keyboard switch plungers that could withstand the beating over tens of millions of cycles of lifetime use. Greasing or oiling switch plungers was undesirable because it would attract [[dirt]] over time which would eventually affect the feel and even bind the key switches (although keyboard manufacturers would sometimes sneak this into their keyboards, especially if they could not control the tolerances of the key plungers and housings well enough to have a smooth key depression feel or prevent binding). But Delrin was only available in black and white, and was not suitable for keytops (too soft), so keytops use [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastic.  However, as plastic molding advanced in maintaining tight tolerances, and as key travel length reduced from 0.187-inch to 0.110-inch (4.75&nbsp;mm to 2.79&nbsp;mm), single-part keytop/plungers could be made of ABS, with the keyboard monoblocks also made of ABS.\n\nIn common use, the term \"mechanical keyboard\" refers to a keyboard with individual mechanical key switches, each of which contains a fully encased plunger with a spring below it and metallic electrical contacts on a side. The plunger sits on the spring and the key will often close the contacts when the plunger is pressed half-way. Other switches require the plunger to be fully pressed down. The depth at which the plunger must be pressed for the contacts to close is known as the activation distance. Analog keyboards with key switches whose activation distance can be reconfigured through software, optical switches that work by blocking laser beams, and Hall Effect keyboards that use key switches that use a magnet to activate a hall sensor, are also available.\n\n=== Control processor ===\n[[File:FunctionalCircuitDiagramOfKeyboardNumPadScanningProcedure-small.gif|thumb|Scanning procedure]]\nComputer keyboards include [[Keyboard controller (computing)|control circuitry]] to convert key presses into key codes<ref>{{cite web   |website=IOPscience.org\n|title=Electrical commutation matrixer keyboards for computers\n|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/book/978-0-7503-1350-6/chapter/bk978-0-7503-1350-6ch16}}</ref> (usually [[scancodes]]) that the computer's electronics can understand. The key switches are connected via the printed circuit board in an electrical X-Y matrix where a voltage is provided sequentially to the Y lines and, when a key is depressed, detected sequentially by scanning the X lines.\n\nThe first computer keyboards were for mainframe computer data terminals and used discrete electronic parts. The first keyboard microprocessor was introduced in 1972 by General Instruments, but keyboards have been using the single-chip [[Intel 8048|8048]] [[microcontroller]] variant since it became available in 1978.<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Complete Computer Hardware Only |page=161\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WSYjdR425p4C}}</ref> The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs, it converts the keystrokes to key codes, and, for a detached keyboard, sends the codes down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to the main processor on the computer motherboard. This serial keyboard cable communication is only bi-directional to the extent that the computer's electronics controls the illumination of the caps lock, num lock and scroll lock lights.\n\nOne test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the caps lock key. The keyboard sends the key code to the [[Device driver|keyboard driver]] running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the Shift, alt and control state of the keyboard.\n\nSome lower-quality keyboards have multiple or false key entries due to inadequate electrical designs.  These are caused by inadequate keyswitch \"debouncing\" or inadequate keyswitch matrix layout that don't allow multiple keys to be depressed at the same time, both circumstances which are explained below:\n\nWhen pressing a keyboard key, the key contacts may \"bounce\" against each other for several milliseconds before they settle into firm contact. When released, they bounce some more until they revert to the uncontacted state. If the computer were watching for each pulse, it would see many keystrokes for what the user thought was just one. To resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard (or computer) \"[[Switch|debounces]]\" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one \"confirmed\" keystroke.\n\nSome low-quality keyboards also suffer problems with ''[[Rollover (key)|rollover]]'' (that is, when multiple keys pressed at the same time, or when keys are pressed so fast that multiple keys are down within the same milliseconds). Early \"solid-state\" keyswitch keyboards did not have this problem because the keyswitches are electrically isolated from each other, and early \"direct-contact\" keyswitch keyboards avoided this problem by having isolation diodes for every keyswitch. These early keyboards had \"n-key\" rollover, which means any number of keys can be depressed and the keyboard will still recognize the next key depressed. But when three keys are pressed (electrically closed) at the same time in a \"direct contact\" keyswitch matrix that doesn't have isolation diodes, the keyboard electronics can see a fourth \"phantom\" key which is the intersection of the X and Y lines of the three keys. Some types of keyboard circuitry will register a maximum number of keys at one time. \"Three-key\" rollover, also called \"phantom key blocking\" or \"phantom key lockout\", will only register three keys and ignore all others until one of the three keys is lifted. This is undesirable, especially for fast typing (hitting new keys before the fingers can release previous keys), and [[game]]s (designed for multiple key presses).\n\nAs direct-contact membrane keyboards became popular, the available rollover of keys was optimized by analyzing the most common key sequences and placing these keys so that they do not potentially produce phantom keys in the electrical key matrix (for example, simply placing three or four keys that might be depressed simultaneously on the same X or same Y line, so that a phantom key intersection/short cannot happen), so that blocking a third key usually isn't a problem. But lower-quality keyboard designs and unknowledgeable engineers may not know these tricks, and it can still be a problem in games due to wildly different or configurable layouts in different games.\n\n=== Connection types ===\nThere are several ways of connecting a keyboard to a [[system unit]] (more precisely, to its [[keyboard controller (computing)|keyboard controller]]) using cables, including the standard [[AT keyboard|AT connector]] commonly found on motherboards, which was eventually replaced by the [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] and the [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connection. Prior to the iMac line of systems, Apple used the proprietary [[Apple Desktop Bus]] for its keyboard connector.\n\n[[Wireless keyboard]]s have become popular. A wireless keyboard must have a transmitter built in, and a receiver connected to the computer's keyboard port; it communicates either by [[radio frequency]] (RF) or [[infrared]] (IR) signals. A wireless keyboard may use industry standard [[Bluetooth]] radio communication,  in which case the receiver may be built into the computer. Wireless keyboards need batteries for power, and may be at risk of data [[eavesdropping]]. Wireless [[solar keyboard]]s charge their batteries from small [[solar panel]]s using natural or artificial light. The 1984 [[Apricot Portable]] is an early example of an IR keyboard.\n\n== Alternative text-entering methods ==\n[[File:OnBoardKeyboard.png|thumb|On-screen keyboard controlled with the mouse can be used by users with limited mobility]]\n[[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) is preferable to rekeying for converting existing text that is already written down but not in machine-readable format (for example, a [[Linotype machine|Linotype]]-composed book from the 1940s). In other words, to convert the text from an image to editable text (that is, a string of character codes), a person could re-type it, or a computer could look at the image and deduce what each character is. OCR technology has already reached an impressive state (for example, [[Google Book Search]]) and promises more for the future.\n\n[[Speech recognition]] converts speech into machine-readable text (that is, a string of character codes). This technology has also reached an advanced state and is implemented in [[List of speech recognition software|various software products]]. For certain uses (e.g., transcription of medical or legal dictation; journalism; writing essays or novels) speech recognition is starting to replace the keyboard.  However, the lack of privacy when issuing voice commands and dictation makes this kind of input unsuitable for many environments.\n\n[[Pointing device]]s can be used to enter text or characters in contexts where using a physical keyboard would be inappropriate or impossible. These accessories typically present characters on a display, in a layout that provides fast access to the more frequently used characters or character combinations. Popular examples of this kind of input are [[Graffiti (Palm OS)|Graffiti]], [[Dasher (software)|Dasher]] and on-screen [[virtual keyboard]]s.\n\n== Other issues ==\n\n=== Keystroke logging ===\nUnencrypted wireless [[Bluetooth]] keyboards are known to be vulnerable to signal theft by placing a covert listening device in the same room as the keyboard to sniff and record ''Bluetooth'' packets for the purpose of logging keys typed by the user. [[Microsoft]] wireless keyboards 2011 and earlier are documented to have this vulnerability.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/this-fake-phone-charger-is-actually-recording-every-key-you-type/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000591|title=This Fake Phone Charger Is Actually Recording Every Key You Type|date=14 January 2015|publisher=AOL|work=TechCrunch|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810130517/https://techcrunch.com/2015/01/14/this-fake-phone-charger-is-actually-recording-every-key-you-type/?ncid=txtlnkusaolp00000591|archivedate=10 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n[[Keystroke logging]] (often called keylogging) is a method of capturing and recording user keystrokes. While it is used legally to measure employee productivity on certain clerical tasks, or by law enforcement agencies to find out about illegal activities, it is also used by [[Hacker (computer security)|hackers]] for various illegal or malicious acts. Hackers use keyloggers as a means to obtain passwords or encryption keys and thus bypass other security measures.\n\nKeystroke logging can be achieved by both hardware and software means. Hardware key loggers are attached to the keyboard cable or installed inside standard keyboards. Software keyloggers work on the target computer's operating system and gain unauthorized access to the hardware, hook into the keyboard with functions provided by the OS, or use remote access software to transmit recorded data out of the target computer to a remote location. Some hackers also use wireless keylogger sniffers to collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver, and then they crack the encryption key being used to secure wireless communications between the two devices.\n\n[[Spyware|Anti-spyware]] applications are able to detect many keyloggers and cleanse them. Responsible vendors of monitoring software support detection by anti-spyware programs, thus preventing abuse of the software. Enabling a [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]] does not stop keyloggers per se, but can possibly prevent transmission of the logged material over the net if properly configured. [[Network monitoring|Network monitors]] (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from \"[[phoning home]]\" with his or her typed information. Automatic form-filling programs can prevent keylogging entirely by not using the keyboard at all. Most keyloggers can be fooled by alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/herley-poster_abstract.pdf |title=How To Login From an Internet Cafe Without Worrying About Keyloggers |author=Herley, Cormac and Florencio, Dinei |publisher=Microsoft Research, Redmond |date=2006 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808070236/http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/herley-poster_abstract.pdf |archivedate=8 August 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKeyboards are also known to emit electromagnetic signatures that can be detected using special spying equipment to reconstruct the keys pressed on the keyboard. Neal O'Farrell, executive director of the Identity Theft Council, revealed to InformationWeek that \"More than 25 years ago, a couple of former spooks showed me how they could capture a user's ATM PIN, from a van parked across the street, simply by capturing and decoding the electromagnetic signals generated by every keystroke,\" O'Farrell said. \"They could even capture keystrokes from computers in nearby offices, but the technology wasn't sophisticated enough to focus in on any specific computer.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities-and-threats/6-tips-to-secure-webcams-stop-keyloggers/d/d-id/1113012|title=6 Tips To Secure Webcams, Stop Keyloggers|work=Dark Reading|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233248/http://www.informationweek.com/security/vulnerabilities-and-threats/6-tips-to-secure-webcams-stop-keyloggers/d/d-id/1113012|archivedate=30 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical injury ===\n[[File:Computer Workstation Variables.jpg|thumb|Proper ergonomic design of computer keyboard desks is necessary to prevent repetitive strain injuries, which can develop over time and can lead to long-term disability.<ref>Berkeley Lab.

As well, users should vary tasks throughout the day, to avoid overuse of the hands and wrists. When inputting at the keyboard, a person should keep the shoulders relaxed with the elbows at the side, with the keyboard and mouse positioned so that reaching is not necessary. The chair height and keyboard tray should be adjusted so that the wrists are straight, and the wrists should not be rested on sharp table edges.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2471321\n|title=Sharp Edges on Mac Book Pro}}</ref> Wrist or palm rests should not be used while typing.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Wrist Rests : OSH Answers\n|url=https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/wrist.html}}</ref>\n\nSome [[adaptive technology]] ranging from special keyboards, mouse replacements and pen tablet interfaces to speech recognition software can reduce the risk of injury.

The A3070 sensor suffered from an issue known as pixel jitter compensation; one units worth (a single pixel in the context of a GUI desktop with a 1:1 mouse input/output ratio) of accurate movement was lost immediately after reversing the physical direction of travel of the Diamondback, resulting in the 'skipping' of the mouse pointer. This issue only occurred at high sensitivity settings, and could be largely negated with the use of a software fix (programmed by a helpful Razer user going by the name of \"Atalan\"), made available as a patch and in Razers drivers. Later runs of the Diamondback used the A3080 sensor which did not suffer from this issue.</ref>\n| 1600\n| \n| \n| USB\n| 125\n| 90\n| 129 \u00d7 63 \u00d7 38.5\n| 3/4\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| Ambidextrous\n| {{Yes|Blue}}\n|-\n!

Viper\n| 2004 April\n| Optical\n| Agilent A2051<ref group=lower-alpha>Razer used a lens with a magnification factor greater than that recommended by Agilent to obtain an effective 1000 DPI resolution from the 800 DPI A2051 sensor, giving a lower maximum tracking speed. As a result, users who preferred a lower sensitivity setting (requiring greater/faster physical movement of the mouse) found the Viper unusable.</ref>\n| 1000\n| \n|\n| USB\n| 125\n| 78\n| 118 \u00d7 55 \u00d7 36\n| 3\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| Ambidextrous\n| {{Yes|Red}}\n|-\n! Diamondback\n| 2004 Late\n| Optical\n| Agilent A3070/A3080<ref group=lower-alpha>Depending on date of manufacture. The A3070 sensor suffered from an issue known as pixel jitter compensation; one units worth (a single pixel in the context of a GUI desktop with a 1:1 mouse input/output ratio) of accurate movement was lost immediately after reversing the physical direction of travel of the Diamondback, resulting in the 'skipping' of the mouse pointer. This issue only occurred at high sensitivity settings, and could be largely negated with the use of a software fix (programmed by a helpful Razer user going by the name of \"Atalan\"), made available as a patch and in Razers drivers. Later runs of the Diamondback used the A3080 sensor which did not suffer from this issue.</ref>\n| 1600\n| \n| \n| USB\n| 125\n| 90\n| 129 \u00d7 63 \u00d7 38.5\n| 3/4\n| {{No}}\n| {{No}}\n| Ambidextrous\n| {{Yes|Blue}}\n|-\n!

It was discovered on 9 January 1992 by American astronomer [[David Rabinowitz]] (uncredited) of [[University of Arizona|UA]]'s [[Spacewatch]] survey at the [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] in Arizona, United States. The very [[Distant object spectral type|reddish object]] has an elongated shape and a [[rotation period]] of 9.98 hours.<ref name=\"lcdb\" /> It was named after the creature [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] from Greek mythology.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" />\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n[[File:5145 Pholus.tiff|thumb|200px|left|Orbital diagram of ''5145 Pholus'']]\n\n''Pholus'' was the second [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur]] to be discovered.<ref name=\"Wilson-1994\" /> Centaurs are objects in between the [[asteroid]] and [[trans-Neptunian]] populations of the Solar System{{Snd}} that is, beyond Jupiter's and within Neptune's orbit{{Snd}} which behave with characteristics of both asteroids and [[comet]]s.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 8.8\u201332.0&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 92 years and 1 month (33,637 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 20.39&nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.57 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 25[[Degree (angle)|\u00b0]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].<ref name=\"jpldata\" /> It is a [[List of Saturn-crossing minor planets|Saturn-]], [[List of Uranus-crossing minor planets|Uranus-]] and [[Neptune-crosser]], crossing the orbits of these [[giant planet]]s at a mean-distance of 9.6, 11.9 and 30.1&nbsp;AU from the Sun, respectively. ''Pholus'' has not come within one [[astronomical unit]] of a planet since 764&nbsp;BC, and will not until 5290.<ref name=\"Pholus5290\" /> It is believed that it originated in the [[Kuiper belt]].\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\n\n''Pholus'' was discovered by [[David Rabinowitz]] (not officially credited), working with the [[Spacewatch]] program, at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] on 9 January 1992.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" /> Rabinowitz'es discovery was confirmed by [[Eugene Shoemaker|Eugene]] and [[Carolyn Shoemaker]] who identified the object on images they previously took on 1 January 1992. The discovery was announced by [[James Scotti]] on 23 January 1992 in an ''[[IAU Circular]]'' (IAUC 5434) of the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]].<ref name=\"IAUC\" /> A first [[precovery]] was taken at the Australian [[Siding Spring Observatory]] in 1977, extending the centaur's [[observation arc]] by 15 years prior to its discovery.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" /> It was the second discovery of a centaur after [[2060&nbsp;Chiron]] discovered by [[Charles Kowal]] in 1977. In 1993,  while with the Spacewatch program, David Rabinowitz went on to discover another centaur, [[7066&nbsp;Nessus]].\n\nThis [[minor planet]] was named by the ''Minor Planet Names Committee'' for [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]], a [[centaur]] from [[Greek mythology]]. As with 2060&nbsp;Chiron, named after his brother [[Chiron]], the tradition is to name this class of outer planet-crossing objects after the half-human, half-horse mythological creatures. In the mythological account, Pholus died by a self-inflicted wound from a poisoned arrow used by [[Heracles]] ''(see [[5143 Heracles]])'', who buried Pholus on the mountain Pholoe.<ref name=\"springer\" /> The official {{MoMP|5145|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 14 July 1992 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 20523}}).<ref name=\"MPC-Circulars-Archive\" />\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n=== Spectral type and color ===\n\nAfter its discovery, ''Pholus'' was quickly found to be very red in color, for which it has been occasionally nicknamed \"Big Red\".{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The color has been speculated to be due to organic compounds on its surface.<ref name=\"Wilson-1994\" /> It is classified as a Z class object on the [[Tholen classification|Tholen]] taxonomic scheme.<ref name=\"jpldata\" />\n\nThe object has been classified by astronomers as [[Trans-Neptunian object#Colours|RR]] and [[Trans-Neptunian object#Colours|RR-U]] type, respectively.<ref name=\"Perna-2010\" /><ref name=\"Belskaya-2015\" /> Polarimetric observations with ESO's [[Very Large Telescope]] in 2007 and 2008, revealed noticeable negative polarization at certain phase angles, distinctly different from that of trans-Neptunian objects. ''Pholus'' appears to have a rather homogeneous surface with small amount of water frost on its darker parts.<ref name=\"Belskaya-2015\" />\n\nThe surface composition of ''Pholus'' has been estimated from its reflectance spectrum using two spatially segregated components:<ref name=\"Cruikshank-1998\" /> dark [[amorphous carbon]] and an intimate mixture of [[water]] ice, [[methanol]] ice, [[olivine]] grains, and complex organic compounds ([[tholin]]s).

The very [[Distant object spectral type|reddish object]] has an elongated shape and a [[rotation period]] of 9.98 hours.<ref name=\"lcdb\" /> It was named after the creature [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]] from Greek mythology.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" />\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n[[File:5145 Pholus.tiff|thumb|200px|left|Orbital diagram of ''5145 Pholus'']]\n\n''Pholus'' was the second [[Centaur (minor planet)|centaur]] to be discovered.<ref name=\"Wilson-1994\" /> Centaurs are objects in between the [[asteroid]] and [[trans-Neptunian]] populations of the Solar System \u2013 that is, beyond Jupiter's and within Neptune's orbit \u2013 which behave with characteristics of both asteroids and [[comet]]s.\n\nIt orbits the Sun at a distance of 8.8\u201332.0&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 92 years and 1 month (33,637 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 20.39&nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.57 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 25[[Degree (angle)|\u00b0]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].<ref name=\"jpldata\" /> It is a [[List of Saturn-crossing minor planets|Saturn-]], [[List of Uranus-crossing minor planets|Uranus-]] and [[Neptune-crosser]], crossing the orbits of these [[giant planet]]s at a mean-distance of 9.6, 11.9 and 30.1&nbsp;AU from the Sun, respectively. ''Pholus'' has not come within one [[astronomical unit]] of a planet since 764&nbsp;BC, and will not until 5290.<ref name=\"Pholus5290\" /> It is believed that it originated in the [[Kuiper belt]].\n\n== Discovery and naming ==\n\n''Pholus'' was discovered by [[David Rabinowitz]] (not officially credited), working with the [[Spacewatch]] program, at [[Kitt Peak National Observatory]] on 9 January 1992.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" /> Rabinowitz'es discovery was confirmed by [[Eugene Shoemaker|Eugene]] and [[Carolyn Shoemaker]] who identified the object on images they previously took on 1 January 1992. The discovery was announced by [[James Scotti]] on 23 January 1992 in an ''[[IAU Circular]]'' (IAUC 5434) of the [[Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams]].<ref name=\"IAUC\" /> A first [[precovery]] was taken at the Australian [[Siding Spring Observatory]] in 1977, extending the centaur's [[observation arc]] by 15 years prior to its discovery.<ref name=\"MPC-object\" /> It was the second discovery of a centaur after [[2060&nbsp;Chiron]] discovered by [[Charles Kowal]] in 1977. In 1993,  while with the Spacewatch program, David Rabinowitz went on to discover another centaur, [[7066&nbsp;Nessus]].\n\nThis [[minor planet]] was named by the ''Minor Planet Names Committee'' for [[Pholus (mythology)|Pholus]], a [[centaur]] from [[Greek mythology]]. As with 2060&nbsp;Chiron, named after his brother [[Chiron]], the tradition is to name this class of outer planet-crossing objects after the half-human, half-horse mythological creatures. In the mythological account, Pholus died by a self-inflicted wound from a poisoned arrow used by [[Heracles]] ''(see [[5143 Heracles]])'', who buried Pholus on the mountain Pholoe.<ref name=\"springer\" /> The official {{MoMP|5145|naming citation}} was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 14 July 1992 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 20523}}).<ref name=\"MPC-Circulars-Archive\" />\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n=== Spectral type and color ===\n\nAfter its discovery, ''Pholus'' was quickly found to be very red in color, for which it has been occasionally nicknamed \"Big Red\".{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The color has been speculated to be due to organic compounds on its surface.<ref name=\"Wilson-1994\" /> It is classified as a Z class object on the [[Tholen classification|Tholen]] taxonomic scheme.<ref name=\"jpldata\" />\n\nThe object has been classified by astronomers as [[Trans-Neptunian object#Colours|RR]] and [[Trans-Neptunian object#Colours|RR-U]] type, respectively.<ref name=\"Perna-2010\" /><ref name=\"Belskaya-2015\" /> Polarimetric observations with ESO's [[Very Large Telescope]] in 2007 and 2008, revealed noticeable negative polarization at certain phase angles, distinctly different from that of trans-Neptunian objects. ''Pholus'' appears to have a rather homogeneous surface with small amount of water frost on its darker parts.<ref name=\"Belskaya-2015\" />\n\nThe surface composition of ''Pholus'' has been estimated from its reflectance spectrum using two spatially segregated components:<ref name=\"Cruikshank-1998\" /> dark [[amorphous carbon]] and an intimate mixture of [[water]] ice, [[methanol]] ice, [[olivine]] grains, and complex organic compounds ([[tholin]]s). The [[carbon black]] component was used to match the low [[albedo]] of the object. Unlike [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]], ''Pholus'' has shown no signs of [[comet]]ary activity.\n\n=== Diameter and albedo ===\n\nDiameter calculations range from 99 to 190 kilometers with a corresponding [[Geometric albedo|albedo]] between 0.155 and 0.04.<ref name=\"johnstonsarchive-TNO-list\" /><ref name=\"Tegler-2005\" /><ref name=\"Duffard-2014\" /><ref name=\"lcdb\" /><ref name=\"Davies-1995\" />\n\nAccording to the [[Herschel Space Observatory]] with its [[Herschel Space Observatory#PACS|PACS]] instrument, ''Nessus'' measures 99 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.155,<ref name=\"Duffard-2014\" /> while a study from 1996 derived a diameter of 185&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Davies-1995\" /> During 2003\u20132004, observations with the 1.8-meter [[Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope]] (VATT) on [[Mount Graham Observatory]], Arizona, determined an elongated shape, {{val|310|x|160|x|150|u=km}}, with a mean-diameter of 190 kilometers, based on a low albedo of 0.04.<ref name=\"Tegler-2005\" /> Johnston's archive lists a diameter of 107&nbsp;km with an albedo of 0.126,<ref name=\"johnstonsarchive-TNO-list\" /> and ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo of a [[C-type asteroid|carbonaceous]] body of 0.057 and derives a diameter of 165&nbsp;km based on an [[absolute magnitude]] of 7.64.<ref name=\"lcdb\" />\n\n=== Rotation period ===\n\nIn March 2005, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Pholus'' was obtained from [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric]] observations by Tegler using the VATT at Mount Graham.
