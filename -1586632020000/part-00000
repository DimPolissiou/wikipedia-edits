It was originally classified as the '''4800 Class''' when introduced in 1932, and renumbered in 1946.\n\nAlthough credited to [[Charles Collett|Collett]], the design dated back to 1868 with the introduction of the [[George Armstrong (engineer)|George Armstrong]] [[GWR 517 Class|517 class]].\n\n==Precursors==\nLike the 48xx/14xx, the 517 Class was a lightweight loco for branchline work; it was built at [[Wolverhampton railway works|Wolverhampton Works]] between 1868 and 1885.\n\nIn this period evolutionary changes included:\n<!--This lot needs converting into a table-->\n* 517-570 \u2013 with {{convert|13|ft|7|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase, inside bearings to trailing wheels, and saddle tanks built 1868-1869.\n* 571-576 \u2013 with {{convert|13|ft|7|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase, outside bearings and side tanks built 1869-1870\n* 826-836, 838-849, 1154\u20131165, 202-05, 215-222, 1421\u20131432, 1433\u20131444, 1465-1482 \u2013 all with {{convert|15|ft|0|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase with side tanks built 1873-1883\n* 1483-1488 \u2013 with {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}} wheelbase and side tanks built 1884-1885\n\nLater gradual changes included: [[Belpaire firebox]]es, boilers rated at {{convert|165|psi|MPa|abbr=on}} as opposed to {{convert|150|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, full cabs, extended bunkers and the progressive conversion of short wheelbase locos to {{convert|15|ft|0|in|m|2|abbr=on}} or {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}}.  From 1924 onwards, several were converted to run with an [[GWR Autocoach|autocoach]], and in this configuration were the direct ancestors of the 48xx class.\n\nIn this form, the updated 517's were but a small step away from the 48xx.  The wheelbase was still {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|2|abbr=on}}, the boiler still rated at only {{convert|165|psi|MPa|abbr=on}}, and the wheels {{convert|5|ft|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|3|ft|8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.  New was the Collett-style cab and bunker and the boiler nominally to a new design.  A three bar [[crosshead]] was added to the motion.  This was a 1924 innovation introduced with the [[GWR 5600 Class]] and also seen in the 1930s-built 5400, 6400 and 7400 classes of pannier tanks.\n\n==Into service==\n[[File:Haresfield railway geograph-2590798-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|left|1409 with an [[autotrain]].]]\nThe 4800 Class was designed as a more modern version of the 517 Class, which were by then beginning to show their relative age. The first locomotive, No 4800, was built by Swindon Works and entered service in 1932, with a further seventy-four engines of this type following up to 1936. During this period, Swindon also built twenty [[GWR 5800 Class|5800 Class]] engines, which were broadly similar but which were not fitted with [[push-pull train|autotrain]] equipment or the Swindon top feed as later fitted to a number of 4800 class engines.\n\nThe 4800 Class locomotives retained their original numbers until the GWR decided to experimentally convert twelve [[GWR 2800 Class|2800 Class]] 2-8-0s for oil-firing. It was decided that the converted engines would be reclassified as the 4800 Class and so the 75 tank locomotives already carrying this designation were reclassified as the 1400 Class with running numbers 1400-1474. The engines did not revert to their original classification after the experiment ended in 1948.\n\nThe 1400 Class was designed to work with the GWR design of [[GWR Autocoach|autocoach]], a specialist coach designed for push-pull working and which could also be used with engines of other classes such as the 517's, the [[GWR 5400 Class]], the [[GWR 6400 Class]] and the older [[GWR 2021 Class]].  This lack of auto gear was the cause of earlier scrapping of the 5800 Class as there was no work for them.  The last, no. 5815, was withdrawn from Swindon shed in April 1961.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rowledge |first=J.W.P. |title=GWR Locomotive Allocations: First and Last Sheds 1922-1967 |year=1986 |publisher=[[David & Charles]] |location=Newton Abbot |isbn=0-7153-8820-7 |page=135 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\nThe auto-fitted locos fared little better; scrapping commenced in 1956 and all were withdrawn by early 1965.

While trying to find a way out, the demon Belphegor possesses Jack's corpse and offers his help, blasting the souls out of the reanimated corpses. With an infestation of ghosts on the loose, the three reluctantly form an alliance with the demon. With the nearby town of [[Harlan, Kansas]] in danger, the Winchesters and Castiel begin an evacuation while facing off with many ghosts, including former enemies Constance Welch, Mary Worthington and [[John Wayne Gacy]]. The group manages to safely evacuate most of the town and Belphegor casts a spell that traps the ghosts inside the abandoned town. However, he reveals that there were two to three billion souls in Hell who were all released when Chuck opened the doors. Additionally, this opened Lucifer's Cage, potentially releasing Michael to wreak havoc as well. Castiel proves unable to heal Sam's gunshot wound from when he tried to kill Chuck and discovers a strange energy he has never felt before blocking Castiel's powers. With only a day or two to sort things out before the real authorities show up, Sam suggests that if they stop the end of the world this time, they will truly be free as Chuck has abandoned their world as he did other worlds in the past such as Apocalypse World.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 309\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Raising Hell\n| DirectedBy      = [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robaert Singer]]\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Buckner & Eugenie Ross-Leming\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21753\n| Viewers         = 1.16<ref name=\"15.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' and 'Legacies' adjust up, 'How to Get Away with Murder' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018220901/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|archive-date=October 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Still in Harlan, Kansas, the Winchesters and their hunter allies struggle to contain both the ghosts and the restless citizens as the barrier begins to weaken.

The Winchesters are joined by Rowena, who works on a spell to more permanently contain the ghosts and Arthur Ketch who reveals he was hired by a demon named Ardat to assassinate Belphegor. To their surprise, Sam and Dean also receive help from the ghost of Kevin Tran who had been cast into Hell instead of Heaven as Chuck claimed. The Winchesters succeed in containing the ghosts in a crystal, but more rise from Hell. Having learned that he cannot go to Heaven, Kevin decides to wander the Earth as a ghost rather than risk returning to Hell. At the same time, Chuck seeks the help of Amara in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Chuck is revealed to have been severely weakened and diminished when Sam shot him and Amara, seeing that her brother hasn't changed from the petulant narcissistic being he always was, refuses to help and abandons her brother who is trapped on Earth and has developed a link with Sam.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 310\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Rupture\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Berens\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21754\n| Viewers         = 1.24<ref name=\"15.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|title='Law & Order: SVU' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025205529/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Rowena attempts to use a spell from the ''Book of the Damned'' to strengthen the barrier, but discovers that the barrier is too weak and will inevitably fall.

At the same time, the demon Ardat brutally murders Arthur Ketch while seeking out Belphegor who travels into Hell with Castiel. After they retrieve the crook, Ardat attacks, revealing that Belphegor is using the Winchesters to gain power in Hell for himself. Belphegor kills Ardat and attempts to draw all of the souls and demons inside of himself to gain unlimited power, but is smote by Castiel, destroying the crook. With no other way, Rowena decides to use a spell that requires the sacrifice of her own life to draw the souls and demons inside of herself and then travel into Hell. At Rowena's request, Sam reluctantly fatally stabs Rowena who casts the souls and demons back into Hell. Sam and Dean are left devastated by the losses of Arthur and Rowena and Dean accuses Castiel of being responsible for everything going wrong.

Still reeling from the death of Rowena, Sam reluctantly joins Dean on a hunt in Beaverdale, Iowa where the head cheerleader, Suzie, was apparently killed by a vampire and another cheerleader, Tory, was abducted. Using security footage of the abduction, the Winchesters identify Suzie's boyfriend Billy's family as the culprits and rescue Tory. Billy was recently turned into a vampire and accidentally killed Suzie when he lost control of his bloodlust. Though his parents have been trying to protect him, a guilt-ridden Billy recognizes that he has become a monster and has his parents blame the murder and kidnapping on him while the Winchesters take Billy out into the woods to kill him. While Dean wants to continue fighting monsters for the sake of the people who have believed in them, Sam displays a more cynical and depressed view. At the same time, God visits Becky Rosen, having lost his sense of purpose. Becky convinces him to start writing again, but is horrified by the dark ending God has in mind for the Winchesters.

Eileen's soul was dragged to Hell by the hellhound that killed her, but she managed to escape when God opened Hell. As Eileen fears returning to Hell or going insane, Dean suggests using Rowena's journals to create a Soul Catcher to contain her.

After enjoying catching up with Lee, Dean manages to locate Angela's body and discovers that Lee is the culprit, having kidnapped and fed people to a creature called a [[marid]] in exchange for riches and health. Lee explains that after a particularly bad hunt, he developed a view that the world is broken and he is owed to enjoy himself. Dean is able to kill the marid and reluctantly kills Lee, feeling that Lee is a monster and it is his duty as a hunter. At the same time, Castiel suggests exploring Sam's link with God to learn more, but it backfires and makes Sam unconscious.

Rowena's demons discover that Michael is no longer in Hell and she urges Dean and Castiel to mend their relationship.

God attempts to use Eileen to cut out the thing that is festering in Sam that is blocking God's ability to heal the wound, only to realize that it is hope. In response, God shows Sam the future if they win, where monsters run increasingly rampant upon the Earth, both innocent people and their friends die, and Castiel had to be locked in the Ma'lak Box after going crazy from taking the Mark of Cain. Sam and Dean are eventually turned into vampires and during a final confrontation, Dean kills Jody Mills before Sam is killed by Bobby.

Horrified that Kaia has been trapped for two years in another universe, the group attempts to find a way back, hindered by Jack's inability to use his powers without drawing attention.

In exchange for Castiel promising to try to get her out, Ruby directs him to the Occultum's hiding place though Castiel is briefly tortured by the Shadow before Jack gets him out again.

While trying to find a way out, the demon Belphegor possesses Jack's corpse and offers his help, blasting the souls out of the reanimated corpses. With an infestation of ghosts on the loose, the three reluctantly form an alliance with the demon. With the nearby town of [[Harlan, Kansas]] in danger, the Winchesters and Castiel begin an evacuation while facing off with many ghosts, including former enemies Constance Welch, Mary Worthington and [[John Wayne Gacy]]. The group manages to safely evacuate most of the town and Belphegor casts a spell that traps the ghosts inside the abandoned town. However, he reveals that there were two to three billion souls in Hell who were all released when Chuck opened the doors. Additionally, this opened Lucifer's Cage, potentially releasing Michael to wreak havoc as well. Castiel proves unable to heal Sam's gunshot wound from when he tried to kill Chuck and discovers a strange energy he has never felt before blocking Castiel's powers. With only a day or two to sort things out before the real authorities show up, Sam suggests that if they stop the end of the world this time, they will truly be free as Chuck has abandoned their world as he did other worlds in the past such as Apocalypse World.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 309\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Raising Hell\n| DirectedBy      = [[Robert Singer (producer)|Robert Singer]]\n| WrittenBy       = Brad Buckner & Eugenie Ross-Leming\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|17}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21753\n| Viewers         = 1.16<ref name=\"15.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|title='Young Sheldon' and 'Legacies' adjust up, 'How to Get Away with Murder' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=October 18, 2019|accessdate=October 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018220901/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-17-2019/|archive-date=October 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Still in Harlan, Kansas, the Winchesters and their hunter allies struggle to contain both the ghosts and the restless citizens as the barrier begins to weaken. Led by [[Francis Tumblety]], better known as the infamous serial killer [[Jack the Ripper]], the ghosts plot their escape while killing as many people as they can. The Winchesters are joined by Rowena, who works on a spell to more permanently contain the ghosts and Arthur Ketch who reveals he was hired by a demon named Ardat to assassinate Belphegor. To their surprise, Sam and Dean also receive help from the ghost of Kevin Tran who had been cast into Hell instead of Heaven as Chuck claimed. The Winchesters succeed in containing the ghosts in a crystal, but more rise from Hell. Having learned that he cannot go to Heaven, Kevin decides to wander the Earth as a ghost rather than risk returning to Hell. At the same time, Chuck seeks the help of Amara in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Chuck is revealed to have been severely weakened and diminished when Sam shot him and Amara, seeing that her brother hasn't changed from the petulant narcissistic being he always was, refuses to help and abandons her brother who is trapped on Earth and has developed a link with Sam.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 310\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = The Rupture\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charles Beeson (director)|Charles Beeson]]\n| WrittenBy       = Robert Berens\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|10|24}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21754\n| Viewers         = 1.24<ref name=\"15.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|title='Law & Order: SVU' adjusts down: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=October 25, 2019|accessdate=October 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025205529/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-october-24-2019/|archive-date=October 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Rowena attempts to use a spell from the ''Book of the Damned'' to strengthen the barrier, but discovers that the barrier is too weak and will inevitably fall. Belphegor offers a solution where they retrieve Lilith's crook from Hell and use it to draw in all of the escaped souls and demons while Sam and Rowena perform a spell to close the rupture. At the same time, the demon Ardat brutally murders Arthur Ketch while seeking out Belphegor who travels into Hell with Castiel. After they retrieve the crook, Ardat attacks, revealing that Belphegor is using the Winchesters to gain power in Hell for himself. Belphegor kills Ardat and attempts to draw all of the souls and demons inside of himself to gain unlimited power, but is smote by Castiel, destroying the crook. With no other way, Rowena decides to use a spell that requires the sacrifice of her own life to draw the souls and demons inside of herself and then travel into Hell. At Rowena's request, Sam reluctantly fatally stabs Rowena who casts the souls and demons back into Hell. Sam and Dean are left devastated by the losses of Arthur and Rowena and Dean accuses Castiel of being responsible for everything going wrong. Realizing that Dean still blames him for Mary's death, Castiel reveals that his powers are failing and decides that its time to move on with the situation seemingly under control.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 311\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Atomic Monsters\n| DirectedBy      = [[Jensen Ackles]]\n| WrittenBy       = Davy Perez\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|7}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21751\n| Viewers         = 1.10<ref name=\"15.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|title=Chargers vs. Raiders adjusts up: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 8, 2019|accessdate=November 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108214556/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/tv-ratings-thursday-november-7-2019/|archive-date=November 8, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Sam experiences a nightmare where he, under the influence of demon blood, appears to be leading several demons and kills several hunters including Dean and his old vampire friend Benny. Still reeling from the death of Rowena, Sam reluctantly joins Dean on a hunt in Beaverdale, Iowa where the head cheerleader, Suzie, was apparently killed by a vampire and another cheerleader, Tory, was abducted. Using security footage of the abduction, the Winchesters identify Suzie's boyfriend Billy's family as the culprits and rescue Tory. Billy was recently turned into a vampire and accidentally killed Suzie when he lost control of his bloodlust. Though his parents have been trying to protect him, a guilt-ridden Billy recognizes that he has become a monster and has his parents blame the murder and kidnapping on him while the Winchesters take Billy out into the woods to kill him. While Dean wants to continue fighting monsters for the sake of the people who have believed in them, Sam displays a more cynical and depressed view. At the same time, God visits Becky Rosen, having lost his sense of purpose. Becky convinces him to start writing again, but is horrified by the dark ending God has in mind for the Winchesters. God makes Becky and her family vanish and begins preparing his plan to bring the Winchesters to a dark end.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 312\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = Proverbs 17:3\n| DirectedBy      = [[Richard Speight Jr.]]\n| WrittenBy       = Steve Yockey\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|11|14}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21755\n| Viewers         = 1.30<ref name=\"15.05\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-rating-november-14-2019/|title=Thursday Night Football and 'Superstore' adjust up: Thursday final ratings|last=Rejent|first=Joseph|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 15, 2019|accessdate=November 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115214855/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-rating-november-14-2019/|archive-date=November 15, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Sam continues to have nightmares of dark alternate worlds.

The werewolves, brothers Andy and Josh, kidnap the last survivor of their attacks after Dean unexpectedly falls asleep. However, Andy, who hates what they are doing, kills his brother and then himself. The girl the Winchesters were protecting turns out to be [[Lilith (Supernatural)|Lilith]], resurrected by God from the Empty and in search of The Equalizer, the gun God created to kill Jack.

Eileen's soul was dragged to Hell by the hellhound that killed her, but she managed to escape when God opened Hell. As Eileen fears returning to Hell or going insane, Dean suggests using Rowena's journals to create a Soul Catcher to contain her. However, Sam finds a resurrection spell Rowena was creating that could potentially bring Eileen back to life. The spell brings him into conflict with two witches who seek the spell for their own use. With the help of Dean and Eileen, Sam dispatches the witches, using a spell he learned from Rowena to kill one. At the same time, Castiel enjoys a vacation until he learns of a series of strange deaths in the area. Suspecting a djinn, Castiel helps a mother whose son has gone missing, ultimately discovering the local sheriff to be the culprit. Castiel kills the djinn with his angel blade and decides to return to helping people. At the end of the episode, Sam succeeds in using Rowena's spell to resurrect Eileen and asks for Dean to help him again rather than give up.\n| LineColor       = C8894E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Supernatural (season 15)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 314\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Last Call\n| DirectedBy      = Amyn Kaderali\n| WrittenBy       = Jeremy Adams\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|5}}\n| ProdCode        = T13.21757\n| Viewers         = 1.06<ref name=\"15.07\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-dec-5-2019/|title=\u2018Thursday Night Football\u2019 adjusts up: Thursday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|work=TV by the Numbers|date=December 9, 2019|accessdate=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209223529/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/thursday-final-ratings-dec-5-2019/|archive-date=December 9, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = After learning of the disappearance of teenager Angela Sullivan in [[Texhoma, Texas]], Dean decides to investigate the case on his own and is surprised to run into old friend Lee Webb whom Dean hunted with alongside his father when he was younger.

In response, God shows Sam the future if they win, where monsters run increasingly rampant upon the Earth, both innocent people and their friends die, and Castiel had to be locked in the Ma'lak Box after going crazy from taking the Mark of Cain. Sam and Dean are eventually turned into vampires and during a final confrontation, Dean kills Jody Mills before Sam is killed by Bobby.

English singer-songwriter [[David Bowie]], originally released on the album ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' in December 1971 and as a single on 7 January 1972, the day before Bowie's 25th birthday. Despite missing the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], \"Changes\" became one of Bowie's best-known songs. The lyrics are often seen as a manifesto for his chameleonic personality, the frequent change of the world today, and frequent reinventions of his musical style throughout the 1970s.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> This single has been cited as David Bowie's official North American debut, despite the fact that the song \"[[The Man Who Sold the World]]\" was released in North America two years prior.<ref name=MEMag>\"Watch that Man\" by Tina Clarke, Music Express magazine, March 1990, page 9</ref> \"Changes\" was the last song Bowie performed live on stage before his retirement from live performances at the end of 2006.<ref name=RS1149>{{Citation | last=Gilmore | first=Mikal | title=How Ziggy Stardust Fell to Earth | journal=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone magazine]] | issue=1149 | date=2 February 2012 | pages=36\u201343, 68}}</ref>\n\nThe song ranked number 128 on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' list of the [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

He began the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist]] movement in [[Danish literature]] and was a part of the [[Modern Breakthrough]].\n\n==Biography==\nJacobsen was born in [[Thisted]] in [[Jutland]], the eldest of the five children of a prosperous merchant.  He went to school in [[Copenhagen]] and was a student at the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1868.  As a boy, he showed a remarkable talent for science, in particular [[botany]].  In 1870, although he was already secretly writing poetry, Jacobsen adopted botany as a profession.

His illness prompted travels to southern Europe, cut him off from scientific investigation, and drove him to literature. He met the famous critic [[Georg Brandes]], who was struck by his powers of expression, and under his influence, in the spring of 1873, Jacobsen began his great historical romance, ''Marie Grubbe''.<ref name=eb11/>\n\nJacobsen was an atheist.<ref>Flynn, T.

A Lady of the Seventeenth Century'' 1917) is the first Danish treatment of a woman as a sexual creature.  Based upon the life of [[Marie Grubbe|a 17th-century Danish noblewoman]], it charts her downfall from a member of the royal family to the wife of a ferryman, as a result of her desire for an independent and satisfying erotic life. In many ways the books anticipates the themes of [[D. H. Lawrence]].\n\nJacobsen's second novel ''[[Niels Lyhne]]'' (1880, English translation 1919) traces the fate of an atheist in a merciless world: his lack of faith is \"tested\" by tragedies and personal crises until he dies in war, disillusioned but unrepentant. According to biographer Morten H\u00f8i Jensen, the novel anticipates the work of Albert Camus.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Jensen|first=Morten H\u00f8i|title=A Difficult Death: The Life and Work of Jens Peter Jacobsen|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2017|isbn=978-0300218930|location=New Haven, CT|pages=xviii}}</ref> \n\nJacobsen's short stories are collected in ''Mogens og andre Noveller'' (1882, translated as ''Mogens and Other Tales'', 1921, and ''Mogens and Other Stories'', 1994). Among them must be mentioned ''Mogens'' (1872, his official debut), the tale of a young dreamer and his maturing during love, sorrow and new hope of love. ''Et Skud i Taagen'' (''A Shot in the Fog'') is a Poe-inspired tale of the sterility of hatred and revenge. ''Pesten i Bergamo'' (The Plague of Bergamo) shows people clinging to religion even when tempted to be \"free men\". ''Fru F\u00f8nss'' (1882) is a sad story about a widow's tragic break with her egoistic children when she wants to remarry.\n\n''Mogens og andre Noveller'' and ''Niels Lyhne'' were both highly praised by [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] in his letters to [[Franz Xaver Kappus]], translated as ''Letters to a Young Poet''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sfgoth.com/~immanis/rilke/letter2.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-12-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209175812/http://www.sfgoth.com/~immanis/rilke/letter2.html |archive-date=2007-12-09 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Poetry===\nThe poems of Jacobsen are more influenced by late romanticism than his prose. Many of them are wistful, dreamy and melancholic but also naturalistic. Most important is the great obscure poem ''Arabesque to a Hand-drawing by Michel Angelo'' (about 1875) the idea of which seems to be that art is going to replace immortality as the meaning of life. They  significantly inspired the Danish symbolist poetry of the 1890s.\n\n==Legacy==\nUnlike many of his colleagues Jacobsen did not take much interest in politics, his main interests being science and psychology.  He is primarily an ''artist'': his ability to create \"paintings\" and arabesque-like scenes both in his prose and his poetry (which has sometimes been criticized as \"mannered\") is one of the secrets of his art. It has been said that his novels are a presentation of various snapshots rather than tales of action.\n\nIn spite of his not very extensive oeuvre Jacobsen's international influence has been quite strong. In Germany both his novels and poems were widely read and they are known to have influenced [[Thomas Mann]], as well as the Englishmen [[George Gissing]] and [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Gissing read the Reclam edition of [[Niels Lyhne]] in 1889 and again in 1890 when he wrote 'which I admire more than ever'.<ref>Coustillas. Pierre ed. London and the Life of Literature in Late Victorian England: the Diary of George Gissing, Novelist, Brighton: Harvester Press, 1978, pp.156-7 and 211-2.</ref>  Jacobsen's works also greatly inspired [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s prose: in ''[[Letters to a Young Poet|Briefe an einen jungen Dichter]]'' (trans. ''Letters to a Young Poet'') (1929) Rilke recommends to [[Franz Xaver Kappus]] to read the works of Jacobsen, adding that Rilke always carried the Bible and Jacobsen's collected works.  Further, Rilke's only novel ''[[The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge|Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge]]'' (translated as ''The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge'') (1910) is semi-autobiographical but is heavily influenced by Jacobsen's second novel ''Niels Lyhne'' (1880) which traces the fate of an atheist in a merciless world.\n\nJacobsen also influenced many other authors of the turn of the 20th century, including [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[Stefan Zweig]], and [[T. E. Lawrence]], who all commented on his work. Thomas Mann once told an interviewer that \"perhaps it is J. P. Jacobsen who has had the greatest influence on my style so far.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nHe also had a musical influence: [[Frederick Delius]]'s ''[[Fennimore and Gerda]]'' and [[Arnold Schoenberg|Arnold Sch\u00f6nberg]]'s ''[[Gurre-Lieder]]'' are based upon themes from Jacobsen's books.  Schoenberg also set a Jacobsen text, translated by [[Robert Franz Arnold]], as No. 4 of his Six Songs, Op. 3.\n\nJacobsen's Samlede Skrifter is featured in the Hong Kong Disneyland theme park in Tarzan's Treehouse as one of the books salvaged from a shipwreck.\n\n==Works==\n* ''Mogens'' (1872)\n* ''Fru Marie Grubbe'' (1876)\n* ''[[Niels Lyhne]]'' (1880)\n* ''Pesten i Bergamo'' (1881)\n* ''Mogens og andre Noveller'' (1882)\n* ''Digte'' (1886)\n* ''Skitser og Udkast'' (1886)\n\n===About J.

The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302, or 1303, the former three indicating [[engine displacement]], the latter two derived from the model number. The car became widely known in its home country as the ''K\u00e4fer'' (German for \"[[beetle]]\", cognate with English [[Wikt:chafer|chafer]]) and was later marketed under that name in Germany,<ref name= samba-1973-de-super/> and as the Volkswagen in other countries. For example, in France it was known as the {{lang|fr|Coccinelle}}<!--was that an official VW model name or just a common nickname?--> (French for [[coccinellidae|ladybug]]).<ref name=\"samba-1970-ca-full\"/><ref name=\"samba-1970-us-super\"/> In 1943, [[Roy Fedden]] applied for a patent, [[https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/010067840/publication/GB570814A]] GB570814, 'Improvements relating to road vehicles', a car identical to VW K\u00e4fer.\n\nThe original 25&nbsp;hp Beetle was designed for a top speed around 100&nbsp;km/h (62&nbsp;mph), which would be a viable cruising speed on the ''[[Reichsautobahn]]'' system. As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40&nbsp;hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the \"classic\" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle gave rise to multiple variants: mainly the 1950 [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 'Bus']], the 1955 [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]], as well as the 1961 [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3 'Ponton']] and the 1968 [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4 (411/412)]] [[family car]]s, ultimately forming the basis of an entirely rear-engined VW product range. The Beetle thus marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, and then by [[Fiat]] and [[Renault]], whereby the [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] increased from 2.6&nbsp;percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6&nbsp;percent in 1956.<ref name=SmallCar196501>{{cite journal |authorlink= Laurence Pomeroy |title=BMC's Mini: The Background story: Part one: The Volkswagen cometh |journal=[[Car Magazine|Small Car]] |pages=42\u201347 |date=January 1965}}</ref> In 1959 even General Motors launched an air-cooled, rear-engined car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]\u2014which even shared the Beetle's flat engine and [[swing axle]] architecture.\n\nOver time, [[front-wheel drive]], and frequently [[hatchback]]-bodied cars would come to dominate the European small-car market. In 1974, Volkswagen's own front-wheel drive [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] hatchback succeeded the Beetle. In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the [[Volkswagen New Beetle#History|Concept One]], a \"retro\"-themed [[concept car]] with a resemblance to the original Beetle, and in 1998 introduced the \"[[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]]\", built on the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|contemporary Golf]] platform with styling recalling the original Type 1.

The Japanese had refined rear-wheel-drive, water-cooled, front-engine, small cars including the [[Datsun 510]] and [[Toyota Corona]], whose sales in the North American market grew rapidly at the expense of Volkswagen in the late 1960s.  [[Honda]] introduced the [[Honda N360|N600]], based on the space-efficient transverse-engine, front-wheel-drive layout of the original [[Austin Mini]], to the North American market in late 1969, and upgraded the model to the [[Honda Civic]] in 1972.  The Japanese \"big three\" would soon dominate compact auto sales in North America.  In 1971 [[Ford]] introduced its [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]], which had some market impact as a low cost alternative in the wake of the [[Nixon shock|drop of the US Dollar against the Deutschmark]] that same year.  As the 1960s came to a close, Volkswagen faced increasingly stiff competition from European cars as well.  The Beetle was faced with competition from new designs like the [[Fiat 127]] and [[Renault 5]], and more robust designs based on the Austin Mini layout such as the [[supermini car|Superminis]]. German competitors, [[Ford]] and [[Opel]] also enjoyed strong sales of modern smaller cars like the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Opel Kadett]].  Volkswagen's attempts to boost the power of their air-cooled motor to meet the demands of higher highway speeds in the late 1960s, then comply with new pollution control regulations, caused problems for reliability and fuel efficiency that impaired the reputation of the aging design.  Safety issues with the Beetle came under increasing scrutiny, culminating in the 1972 release of a rather scathing report.<ref>{{cite book|author=Center for Auto Safety|title=Small on Safety:The designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen|date= 1972|isbn=978-0670652495}}</ref>  During the early 1970s, sales of the Beetle in Europe and North America plummeted.\n\nVW introduced other models to supplement the Beetle throughout the 1960s; the [[VW Type 3|Type 3]], [[VW Type 4|Type 4]], and the NSU-based and larger [[VW K70|K70]].  None of these models, aimed at more upscale markets, achieved the level of success of the Beetle. The over-reliance on a single model, now in decline, meant that Volkswagen was in financial crisis by 1974. It needed German government funding to produce the Beetle's replacement.\n\nProduction lines at Wolfsburg switched to the new water-cooled, front-engined, [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] in 1974, sold in North America at the time as the \"Rabbit\".  The Golf eventually became Volkswagen's most successful model since the Beetle. It was periodically redesigned over its lifetime, with only a few components carried over between generations, entering its seventh generation in 2012; the Beetle had only minor refinements of its original design.\n\nThe Golf did not kill Beetle production, nor did the smaller [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] which was launched a year later. Production of the Beetle continued in smaller numbers at other German factories until 19 January 1978, when mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico: markets where low operating cost was an important factor. After this shift in production, sales in Europe did not stop, but became very low. Beetle sedans were produced for U.S. markets until July 1977<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\">Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com {{cite web|url=http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/bugchassisdating.php|title=Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com}}</ref> and for European markets until 1985, with other companies continuing to import cars produced in Mexico after 1985. The Beetle convertible/Cabriolet ended production (as 1979 models) on January 31, 1980.<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\"/>\n\nThe last Beetle was produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico, in July 2003.<ref name=\"AutoMotoruSport200313\"/> The final batch of 3,000 Beetles were sold as 2004 models and badged as the ''\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n'', with [[whitewall tires]], a host of previously discontinued chrome trim, and the choice of two special paint colors taken from the [[New Beetle]]. Production in Brazil ended in 1986, then started again in 1993 and continued until 1996.\n\nThe Beetle outlasted most other cars which had adopted the rear-engine, air-cooled layout such as those by [[Subaru 360|Subaru]], [[Fiat]], and [[Chevrolet Corvair|General Motors]]. Porsche's 356 series which originally used some Volkswagen-sourced parts, continued to use the classic rear-engine layout (which later became water cooled) in the [[Porsche 911]] 996 series, which remains competitive in the third decade of the 21st century.\n\n=== Worldwide end of production ===\n[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|\"\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n\" (Final Edition) in Aquarius Blue (2003).]]\nBy 2002, over 21 million Type 1s had been produced, but by 2003, annual production had dropped to 30,000 from a peak of 1.3&nbsp;million in 1971.

Certain initial features were subsequently revised, including mechanical drum brakes, split-window rear windows, mechanical direction-indicators and the non-synchronized gearbox.  Other features, including its distinctive overall shape, endured. In fact, the Beetle was prized for its seemingly unchanged appearance and \"marketed to American consumers as the anti-GM and Ford: 'We do not believe in planned obsolescence.

An engine oil cooler (located in the engine fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold. Later models of the carburetor featured an automatic [[choke valve|choke]]. Engine intake air passed through a metallic filter, while heavier particles were captured by an oil bath. After 1960, steering featured a hydraulic damper that absorbed steering irregularities.\n\nIndicative of the car's utilitarian design, the interior featured painted metal surfaces, a metal dash consolidating instruments in a single, circular [[binnacle]], adjustable front seats, a fold-down rear seat, optional swing-out rear windows, front windows with pivoting vent windows, heating via air-to-air exchange manifolds operating off the engine's heat, and a windshield washer system that eschewed the complexity and cost of an additional electric pump and instead received its pressurization from the car's spare tire (located in the front luggage compartment) which was accordingly overinflated to accommodate the washer function.\n\nThroughout its production, VW marketed the Beetle with a four-speed manual transmission. From 1961 (and almost exclusively in Europe),<ref>{{cite web|title=K\u00e4fer 1200 Limousine (1954\u20131973): Modellpflege |trans-title=Beetle 1200 sedan (1954\u20131973): Model changes |language=German |publisher=Volkswagen |work=Volkswagen Classic |url=http://www.volkswagen-classic.de/modelle/kaefer-1200-limousine-1954-1965 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130212214136/http://www.volkswagen-classic.de/modelle/kaefer-1200-limousine-1954-1965 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-02-12 |at=\"''Modellpflege''\" tab }}</ref> VW offered an optional version of the [[Saxomat]] manumatic transmission: a regular 4-speed manual transaxle coupled to an electromagnetic clutch with a centrifugal clutch used for idle. Subsequently, (beginning in 1967 in Europe and 1968 in the United States), VW offered an optional manumatic transmission (marketed as ''Automatic Stick Shift'' and also called ''[[AutoStick]]'',{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}) which was a 3-speed manual coupled to an [[electro-pneumatic]] clutch and torque converter.<ref name=\"autostick\">{{cite web | title = Volkswagen New Beetle History | publisher = Edmunds.com  | url = http://www.edmunds.com/volkswagen/new-beetle/history.html}}</ref>\n\nWhile the overall appearance of the Beetle changed little over its life span, it received over 78,000&nbsp;incremental changes during its production.<ref name=\"willson\"/>\n\n== Evolution and design changes ==\n\n=== Beetle cabriolet ===\n[[File:12-02-02-autostadt-wolfsburg-070.jpg|thumb|1960 VW 1200 Cabriolet]]\nIt was in 1948 that Wilhelm Karmann first bought a VW Beetle [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] and converted it into a four-seated [[convertible (car)|convertible]].  After successfully presenting it at VW in Wolfsburg the Beetle Cabriolet began production in 1949 by [[Karmann]] in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nThe convertible was more than a Beetle with a folding top. To compensate for the strength lost in removing the roof, the sills were reinforced with welded U-channel rails, a transverse beam was fitted below the front edge of the rear seat cushion, and the side cowl-panels below the instrument panel were double-wall. In addition, the lower corners of the door apertures had welded-in curved gussets, and the doors had secondary alignment wedges at the B-pillar.\n\nThe top was cabriolet-style with a full inner headliner hiding the folding mechanism and crossbars. In between the two top layers was {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of insulation. The rear window was tempered safety glass, and after 1968, heated. Due to the thickness of the top, it remained quite tall when folded. To enable the driver to see over the lowered top, the inside rearview was mounted on an offset pivot. By twisting the mirror 180 degrees on a longitudinal axis, the mirror glass would raise approximately {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe convertible was generally more lavishly equipped than the sedan with dual rear ashtrays, twin map pockets, a visor vanity mirror on the passenger side, rear stone shields, and through 1969, wheel trim rings. Many of these items did not become available on other Beetles until the advent of the optional \"L\" (Luxus) Package of 1970.\n\nAfter a number of stylistic and technical alterations made to the Karmann cabriolet,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jon Gilbert |url=http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |title=volksworld.com |publisher=volksworld.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809014310/http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |archive-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> (corresponding to the many changes VW made to the Beetle throughout its history), the last of 331,847 cabriolets came off the production line on 10 January 1980.\n\n===1950\u20131959 models===\n[[File:VW K\u00e4fer blue 1956 vr TCE.jpg|thumb|1956 Volkswagen Beetle]]\n\nDuring this period, a myriad of changes were made throughout the vehicle beginning with the availability of hydraulic brakes and a folding fabric sunroof in 1950.  The rear window of the VW Beetle evolved from a divided or \"split\" oval, to a singular oval. The change occurred between October 1952 and March 1953.<ref name=\"Ponchard\">{{cite journal|last=Ponchard|first=Nathan|title=Auction Action|journal=Unique Cars|date=27 February 2013|issue=347|page=22|url=http://www.uniquecarsmag.com.au|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Beetles built during this time were known as a \"Zwitter\", or \"hybrid\", as they used the split-window bodyshell with oval-model chrome trim, vent windows and dashboard.<ref name=\"Ponchard\" />\n\n1953 models received a redesigned instrument panel.  The one-piece \u201cPope's Nose\u201d combination license plate/brake light was replaced by a smaller flat-bottomed license plate light. The brake light function was transferred to new heart-shaped lamps located in the top of the taillight housings.<ref>{{cite book|  title=Vintage Volkswagens |  url=https://archive.org/details/vintagevolkswage00flat |  url-access=registration |publisher=Flat 4 Project/Chronicle Books| location=San Francisco| year=1985}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Volkswagen added {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the cylinder bore, increasing the [[engine displacement|displacement]] from 1,131 (1100)&nbsp;cc to 1,192 (1200)&nbsp;cc.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961>{{cite journal|journal=Practical Motorist |volume = 7 | issue = 81  |title =Knowing your Volkswagen | page = 943|date=May 1961}}</ref> This coincided with upgrades to various key components including a redesign of the crankshaft. This increased power from {{convert|30|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} to {{convert|36|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} and improved the engine's free revving abilities without compromising torque at lower engine speeds.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/> At the same time, compression ratios were progressively raised as, little by little, the octane ratings of available fuel was raised in major markets during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/>\n\nIn 1955, the separate brake lights were discontinued and were combined into a new larger taillight housing.  The traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicator lamps for North America.\n\nFor 1956, the Beetle received what would become one of its more distinctive features, a set of twin chrome tailpipes. Models for North America gained taller bumper guards and tubular overrider bars.\n\nFor 1958, the Beetle received a revised instrument panel, and a larger rectangular rear window replaced the previous oval design.\n\n===1960\u20131969 models===\n\n1960 models received a front [[sway bar|anti roll bar]] along with hydraulic [[steering damper]].\n\nFor 1961, significant technical advances occurred in the form of a new engine and transmission. The engine remained at {{cvt|1192|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} but the power increased to {{convert|40|bhp|PS kW|abbr=on}} at 3900 rpm and {{convert|88|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/s7533/Volkswagen-Beetle.aspx|website=conceptcarz|title=1963 Volkswagen Beetle Technical Specifications and Dimensions|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}</ref> primarily due to an increase in [[compression ratio]] to 7.1:1. The single-barrel [[Solex]] [[carburetor]] received an electric automatic choke and the transmission was now [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchronized]] on all forward gears. The traditional semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicators worldwide. The standard model called the TYPE 111-112, continued to use the 36&nbsp;hp 1200 engine of the old architecture that dates back to Franz Reimspiess original design of 1937 all the way until the end of the 1965 model year. 1965 standard model in 1965 is called the \"A\" sedan.\n\nFor 1962, the Beetle received a mechanical fuel level gauge in place of the former fuel tap. The Standard model continued without a gas gauge until the end of the 1965 model year. At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style windscreen washer was replaced by a new design using compressed air. A [[Schrader valve]] located on the washer fluid tank allowed the system to be charged at a filling station to the recommended {{convert|35|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 77 }}</ref>\n\n1964 models could be identified by a widened light housing on the engine lid over the rear license plate, however the standard model continued to use the old teardrop style to the end of the 1965 model run.\n\nThe largest change to date for the Beetle was in 1965: the majority of the body stampings were revised, which allowed for significantly larger windows. The windshield increased in area by 11% and was now slightly curved, rather than flat. Door windows increased accordingly by 6% (and door vent window edges were canted slightly back), rear side windows 17.5%, and the rear window 19.5%. The result was a more open, airy, modern look.<ref name=\"Small Wonder\">{{Cite book | title = Small Wonder| author=Walter Henry Nelson| publisher = Little, Brown and Co. |date= 1970 | page = 308 }}</ref>\n\nFor 1966, the big news was an optional new 1300cc {{convert|50|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} engine in lieu of the previous 1200cc engine that had been the sole engine since 1954. Models so equipped carried a \"1300\" badge on the engine lid. The 1300cc engine was standard for North America.\n\nFor 1967, a yet-again larger-[[engine displacement|displacement]] engine was made available: [[Volkswagen air-cooled engine|1500cc]], {{convert|53|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 4,200&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"TAM67\">{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote Speciale: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1967 | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A |date=February 1967 | language = Italian | pages = 296\u2013298 | location = Milano }}</ref> 1200 and 1300 engines continued to be available, as many markets based their taxation on engine size.<ref name=\"TAM67\"/> 1500cc Beetles were equipped with front disc brakes and were identified with a \"VW 1500\" badge on the engine lid. North America received the 1500 engine as standard equipment, but did not receive front disc brakes. These models were identified by a \"Volkswagen\" badge on the engine lid.\n\nThe rear suspension was significantly revised and included a widened track, softer torsion bars and the addition of a unique ''Z-configuration'' equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360&nbsp;watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the [[flywheel]]. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed [[windscreen wiper]]s, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108]], North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass [[headlamp]] covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to the leading edge of the front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. In the rest of the world markets the 1967 model retained the older headlights. Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) \u2013 the overriders have a different shape than the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.{{clarify|reason=what does the end of this sentence (from \"besides\") mean?|date=October 2018}} The Brazilian market model (Volkswagen Fusca) retained the pre-1967 headlamps until 1972.{{Citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph needs a source, please|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:'68 VW 1500.jpg|thumb|1968 Type 1]]\n1968 was a year of major change. The most noticeable of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted and were able to accommodate reversing lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with [[ECE regulations]] rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of {{convert|42|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. A pressure valve in the connecting hose closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below {{convert|30|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires.<ref>\">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle:  The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 123 }}</ref> A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid.  For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by {{convert|78|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nA number of safety improvements were made in order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary front hood latch, collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with [[pictographs]]. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Standard model 111-112, called the 1200 \"A\" still used the 1200 engine but for the first time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.\n\n[[File:'68 Volkswagen AutoStick Badge.jpg|thumb|'68\u2013'69 Automatic ''StickShift'' badge]]\n\nA new 3-speed [[manumatic]] gear box with [[torque converter]] and vacuum-operated clutch became available mid-production year. The manumatic models received a vastly improved [[Trailing arm|semi-trailing-arm]] rear suspension (also known as \"independent rear suspension\" although the earlier swing axle Beetles were also [[Suspension (vehicle)#Independent suspension|independent]]) and eliminated the need for the equalizing torsion spring. This new rear suspension layout would eventually become an option on later models. Beetles equipped with the automatic were identified with a \"VW Automatic\" badge on the engine lid and a matching decal in the rear window. In North America, the badging and decal were later revised to read, \"Automatic ''Stick Shift''\".\n\nFor 1969, the only exterior change was the fuel filler flap no longer had a finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.\n\n===1970\u20131979 models===\nIn 1970, a new \"L\" (Luxus) Package was introduced including, among other items, twin map pockets, dual rear ashtrays, full carpeting, a passenger-side visor vanity mirror, and rubber bumper moldings. The optional 1500&nbsp;cc engine now came with an engine lid having two rows of cooling louvers, while the convertible's engine lid gained two additional sets for a total of four. For North America, the 1500&nbsp;cc engine was enlarged to 1600&nbsp;cc engine and produced {{convert|57|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}\n\nThere were two Beetles for the first time in 1971, the familiar standard Beetle and a new, larger version, different from the windscreen forward. All Beetles received an engine upgrade: the optional 1500 cc engine was replaced by a 1600 cc with twin-port cylinder heads and a larger, relocated oil cooler. The new engine produced {{convert|60|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. The ventilation system was improved with the original dash-top vents augmented by a second pair aimed directly at the driver and passenger. For the first time the system was a flow-through design with crescent-shaped air exits fitted behind the rear quarter windows. Airflow could be increased via an optional 2-speed fan. The standard Beetle was now badged as the VW 1300; when equipped with the 1600 engine, it was badged 1300 S, to avoided confusion with the Type 3, which wore VW 1600 badges.\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align = \n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 230\n| image1 = D\u00fclmen, Kirchspiel, VW 1303 -- 2017 -- 2279.jpg\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Beetle 1303 Cabriolet\n| image2 = M\u00fcnster, Volkswagen 1303 Cabrio -- 2018 -- 2475.jpg\n| caption2 = Detail\n}}\n\nThe new, larger Beetle was sold as the 1302/1302 S, offering nearly 43% more luggage capacity, up from 140 liters in front to 260 (remaining at 140 in back)<ref name=\"The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car.\">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle:  The Chronicles of the Peoples' Car | author= Volkswagen of America| publisher = Haynes Publishing. |date= 1988 | pages = 140}}</ref> A new [[MacPherson strut]] front suspension was incorporated, similar to what was used in the Type 4, and the front track was widened. The new suspension layout allowed the spare tire to be positioned flat under the trunk floor. Although the car had to be lengthened slightly to accomplish this, it allowed a reduction in turning radius. To gain additional trunk volume, the under-dash panel{{clarify|date=May 2017|what is that, exactly?}} was lowered, allowing the fuel tank to be shifted rearward. From the windscreen back the big Beetle was identical to its smaller progenitor, except for having the also new [[trailing-arm suspension|semi-trailing arm]] rear suspension as standard equipment. Overall, the bigger Beetle was {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} wider, and rode on a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}-longer wheelbase. Both Beetles were available with or without the L Package. The convertible was now based on the 1302 body. In North America, the 1302 was marketed as the Super Beetle and came only with the L Package and 1600 cc engine. While it lacked the front disc brakes that normally accompanied the larger motor, it was fitted with brake drums that were slightly larger than the standard Beetle. With the Super Beetle being sold as the premium model in North America, the standard Beetle, while retaining the same 1600 cc engine, was stripped of many of its earlier features in order to reduce the selling price. Bright window and running board moldings disappeared, along with the day/night mirror, horn ring, map pocket, locking glove box and miscellaneous other items.\n\n1972 models had an 11% larger rear window ({{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} taller), and the convertible engine lid with four rows of louvres was now used on all Beetles. Inside the vehicle, a four-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel was introduced, the windshield wiper/washer knob was replaced in favor of a steering column stalk, and intermittent wipers were a new option available in selected markets. An engine compartment socket for the proprietary VW Diagnosis system was also introduced. The rear luggage area was fitted with a folding parcel shelf. A limited-edition Commemorative model was launched in celebration of the Beetle's passing the record of the Ford Model T as the world's most-produced automobile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebeetles.com/marathon/ |title=1972 Marathon Beetle - All the VW Beetle Special Editions |publisher=SE Beetles |date=2016-05-20 |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Commemorative Beetle was a 1302 S finished in a special Marathon Blue Metallic paint and unique 4.5 x 15 styled steel wheels. In the U.S., it was marketed as the Super Beetle Baja Champion SE.\n \n[[File:Volkswagen Beetle .jpg|thumb|1973 1303/Super Beetle]]\n[[File:1973-1974 Volkswagen \"1303 Big\", Istanbul.jpg|left|thumb|1973\u201374 1303/Super Beetle \"Big\"]]\n\n1973 models featured significantly enlarged \"elephant foot\" taillamps mounted in reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner gave way to a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters.  The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for \"Yellow-Black Racer\") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear deck lids were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim with the exception of the chrome headlamp bezels. Inside were [[corduroy]] and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke steering wheel with padded leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color deck lids and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport steering wheel and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.\n\nFor 1974, North American models received newly required {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} impact bumpers mounted on self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment point of the strut, was redesigned to improve handling and stability in the event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof. Mid-year, the Love Bug was introduced for North America: based on the standard Beetle, it was available only in Phoenix Red or Ravenna Green (both colors shared with the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914]]) with all exterior trim finished in matte black. A price leader, the Love Bug retailed for less than a standard Beetle.\n\nIn 1975, front turn indicators were moved from the top of the front fenders down into the bumper. At the rear, the license plate light housing was now molded of plastic with a ribbed top surface. To comply with tightening emission standards, the 1600 cc engine in Japanese and North American markets received Bosch [[Jetronic#L|L-Jetronic]] fuel injection, rather than the [[Jetronic#D|D-Jetronic]] system formerly used in the VW Type 3 and Type 4. The injected engine received a new muffler and in California a catalytic converter. This necessitated a bulge in the rear apron under the rear bumper and replaced the distinctive twin \"pea shooter\" tailpipes with a single offset pipe, making injected models identifiable at a glance.  {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper-equipped North American models retained fender-top front indicators. The 1303 received rack and pinion steering. In North America, the 1303/Super Beetle sedan was moved upmarket and was now christened La Grande Bug. Similar to the Big Beetle of 1974, La Grande Bug was available in blue or green metallic paint in the U.S. and blue, green or gold metallic in Canada and was equipped with the same features as the 1974 Sun Bug. The \"Volkswagen\" script on the engine lid of all North American Beetles was replaced with a \"Fuel Injection\" badge.\n\nIn 1976, the 1303/La Grande Bug was discontinued, with the larger body continuing only in convertible form. To make up for the loss in North American markets, the standard Beetle was upgraded, regaining some of the features that were removed in 1971. In addition, the 2-speed ventilation fan was included, previously available in North America only on the larger Beetle. The automatic stickshift option was discontinued as well.\n\n1977 models received new front seats with separate head restraints.  This was the final model year for the Beetle sedan in North America. The convertible was offered in a \"triple white\" Champagne Edition in Alpine White with  white top and interior with the padded deluxe steering wheel, tiger maple wood-grain dash trim and {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels. Approximately 1,000 Champagne Editions were produced.\n\nFor 1978, a new Champagne 2nd Edition convertible was launched, available in blue or red metallic paint with white leatherette interior. Features included the {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide styled steel sport wheels, AM/FM radio, analog [[quartz clock]], padded deluxe steering wheel and rosewood-grain instrument panel trim. Approximately 1,100 were produced.\n\nIn 1979, VW offered an Epilogue Edition of the convertible in triple black with features similar to the 1978 Champagne Edition. This would be the last year of convertible production worldwide as well as the final year for the Beetle in the USA and Canada.\n\n== Introduction to international markets ==\n\n===Ireland ===\n{{Main|History of Volkswagen in Ireland}}\n\nVolkswagen began its involvement in Ireland when in 1949, Motor Distributors Limited, founded by Stephen O'Flaherty secured the [[franchising|franchise]] for the country at that year\u2019s [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era/ |title=Motor moguls facing end of an era |author=Brian Carey |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=14 September 2003 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310065902/http://tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era |archivedate=10 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/the-motor-moguls-955766.html|title=The Motor Moguls|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> In 1950, Volkswagen Beetles started arriving into [[Dublin]] packed in crates in what was termed \"[[knockdown kit|completely knocked down]]\" (CKD) form ready to be assembled.

Its exterior dimensions and engine displacement were in compliance with Japanese Government [[Vehicle size class#Japan|regulations]], which helped sales. Several Japanese vehicles were introduced after the Beetle was sold in Japan, using an air-cooled engine and rear mounting of the engine, such as the [[Subaru 360]], or an engine installed in the front, like the [[Honda N360]], the [[Suzuki Fronte]], and the [[Mitsubishi Minica]].\n\n=== Vietnam ===\n\nNguyen Hoang Hiep, vice chairman of the National Traffic Safety Committee, reported in 2014 that there were 2.1 million vehicles registered in Vietnam.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nguyen|first1=Quang Thong|title=Vietnam sees faster-than-expected growth of motorbikes|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/society/vietnam-sees-fasterthanexpected-growth-of-motorbikes-24223.html|publisher=Thanh Nien|accessdate=22 September 2016|ref=Vietnam}}</ref> Volkswagen vehicles have been sold in Vietnam through World Auto since 2007 with an average of 100 units sold each year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Will Volkswagen assemble cars in Vietnam?|url=http://english.vietnamnet.vn/fms/business/143385/will-volkswagen-assemble-cars-in-vietnam-.html|website=Vietnam Net Bridge|publisher=VIETNAMNET Bridge|accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n== International production ==\nGerman production of the Beetle took place initially at the parent Wolfsburg plant until the Golf's introduction in 1974, later expanding to the newer Emden and Hanover plants.

The last German made cars were assembled at Emden in 1978, after which the Puebla, Mexico plant became the principal source of Beetle production.

In 1993 production resumed and continued to 1996. The Brazilian version retained the 1958\u201364 body style (Europe and U.S. version) with the thick door pillars and smaller side windows. This body style was also produced in Mexico until 1971. Around 1973, all Brazilian Beetles (1300 and 1500 series) were updated with the 1968-up sheet metal, bumpers, and four-lug rims; although the five-stud rims and \"bugeye\" headlights were produced as late as 1972 (the base VW 1200 and 1300 manufactured in Brazil was similar to the 1964 European/U.S. 1200 until the 1970 model year but came with vented wheels since the mid-1960s). The 1971 and 1972 1300s had the 1964-era taillights and headlights, fuel tank, but fitted with the 1968-up raised bumpers. Brazilian CKD kits were shipped to Nigeria between 1975 and 1987 where Beetles were locally assembled. The Brazilian-produced versions have been sold in neighboring South American nations bordering Brazil, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru.\n\nThe Brazilian Type 1s have four different engines: 1,200&nbsp;cc, 1,300&nbsp;cc, 1,500&nbsp;cc, and 1,600&nbsp;cc. In the 1970s, Volkswagen made the SP-2 (derived from the Type 1 pan and the Type 3 powertrain) with a 1,700&nbsp;cc engine (a [[cylinder bore|bored-out]] 1,600&nbsp;cc). In Brazil, the Type 1 never received electronic fuel injection, instead retaining carburetors (one or two one-barrels) throughout its entire life, although the carburetion differs from engines of different years and specification.\n\nThe production of the air-cooled engine finally ended in 2006, after more than 60 years.  It was last used in the Brazilian version of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Bus]], called the \"Kombi\", and was replaced by a 1.4&nbsp;L water-cooled engine with a front-mounted cooling system. [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] engaged in some string pulling in the early sixties when a law requiring taxis to have four doors and five seats was being considered. After proving that the average taxi fare only carried 1.8 passengers and an overall saving of twenty percent for a smaller two-door car, the Brazilian government relented and the law never entered the books.<ref name=Stern137>[[#stern|''VW-Tochter: Erfolg mit Fusca'']], p. 137</ref> The Fusca proceeded to have a long career as a taxi in urban Brazil.\n\n=== Southern Rhodesia ===\nThe Volkswagen Type 1 chassis was used as the basis for a mine-protected [[armoured personnel carrier|APC]] called the [[Leopard security vehicle]] and the [[Pookie (vehicle)|Pookie]] demining vehicle, fielded by the Republic of Rhodesia during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n=== Mexico ===\n[[File:Sedan Jeans.jpg|thumb|1995 Mexican Volkswagen Beetle, the last model with chrome moldings. In the picture, the 1995 Jeans Limited Edition.]]\n[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|The very last Volkswagen Beetle produced, manufactured in Puebla, Mexico, July 30, 2003.]]\n{{Main|Volkswagen Beetle in Mexico}}\nMexican production began in 1955 because of agreements with companies such as [[Chrysler]] in Mexico and the [[Studebaker-Packard Corporation]] which assembled cars imported in CKD form. In 1964, they began to be locally produced.  These models have the larger windshield, rear window, door and quarter glass starting in 1972; and the rear window from 1965 to 1971 German built models was used on the Mexican models from 1972 to 1985, when it was replaced with the larger rear window used on 1972 and later German built Beetles. This version, after the mid-1970s, saw little change with the incorporation of electronic ignition in 1988, an anti-theft alarm system in 1990, a [[catalytic converter]] in 1991 (as required by law), as well as electronic [[Digifant]] [[fuel injection]], hydraulic valve lifters, and a spin-on oil filter in 1993. The front turn signals were located in the bumper instead of the Beetle's traditional placement on top of the front fenders from the 1977 model year on, as they had been on German Beetles sold in Europe from 1975 onwards. Starting in 1995, the Mexican Beetle included front disc brakes, an alternator instead of a generator, and front automatic seat belts. During the 1995 model year, the chrome moldings disappeared leaving body colored bumpers and black moldings instead on some models. By the start of the 1996 model year, exterior chrome or matt moldings were dropped altogether and Volkswagen de Mexico (VWdM) dropped the Sedan's flow-through ventilation system with all its fittings, notably the exterior crescent-shaped vents behind the rear side windows the same year.\n\nIn mid-1996, front drum brakes and fixed front seat belts were re-launched in a new budget version called the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n City\", which was sold alongside the upscale version \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico\" which had front disc brakes, automatic seat belts, right side mirror, velour upholstery, optional metallic colors and wheel covers in matte finish (also found on some 1980s Beetles and Buses). These two versions were sold until mid 1998. From mid 1998\u20132003, The Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico was discontinued and the Sed\u00e1n City lost its prefix and gained disc brakes, automatic seat belts and optional metallic colors. This last version was named the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Unificado\" or simply the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n\".\n\n[[File:Vochol09MAP.jpg|thumb|left| A Beetle decorated in the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] style of beading now on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]\n\nIndependent importers continued to supply several major countries, including Germany, France, and the UK until the end of production in 2003.  Devoted fans of the car even discovered a way to circumvent US safety regulations by placing more recently manufactured Mexican Beetles on the [[floorpan]]s of earlier, US-registered cars. The Mexican Beetle (along with its Brazilian counterpart) was on the US DOT's (Department of Transportation) hot list of [[grey market]] imports after 1978 as the vehicle did not meet safety regulations.\n\nIn the Southwest US ([[Arizona]], California, [[New Mexico]], Texas), Mexican Beetles (and some [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)|Brazilian T2c Transporters]]) are a fairly common sight since Mexican nationals can legally operate the vehicle in the United States, provided the cars remain registered in Mexico. Some of the Mexican Beetles have been registered in the United States since the 1998 NHTSA amendment granting the 25-year cutoff where it (and its Brazilian counterpart including the T2C) can be legally registered in any of the 50 states (this means a 1992 or earlier Mexican Beetle as of 2017 can be registered under the current NHTSA 25-year cutoff exemption).\n\nThe end of production in Mexico can be attributed primarily to Mexican political measures: the Beetles no longer met [[emission standard]]s for Mexico City, in which the ubiquitous Beetles were used as taxicabs; and the government outlawed their use as taxicabs because of rising crime rates, requiring only four-door vehicles be used. The last Vocho taxis in Mexico City were retired at the end of 2012.<ref name=Hemmings>{{cite journal | title = Vochos No Mas | journal = Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=June 2012 | last = Shea | first = Terry | page = 48 | issue = 10 | volume = 7 | publisher = [[Hemmings Motor News]] | location = Bennington, VT | issn = 1555-6867 }}</ref> In addition, Volkswagen (now Germany's largest automaker) has been attempting to cultivate a more upscale, premium brand image, and the humble Beetle clashed with this identity, as seen in the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] and [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] luxury vehicles. In the late 1990s consumers strongly preferred more modern cars such as the [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Mexican Chevy]], the [[Nissan Tsuru#B13 (1991\u20131994)|Nissan Tsuru]], and the [[Volkswagen Gol#Gol G2 to G4 (1994-2008)|Volkswagen Pointer]] and [[Volkswagen Fox|Lupo]].\n\nHowever, demand for the Beetle was relatively high, especially in the 1990s, with the workforce increasing at the start of the decade. The price of the base model (without even a radio) was pegged with the official minimum wage, by an agreement between the company and the government. In 1990 it cost US$5,300.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/20/world/mexico-city-journal-miss-the-vw-bug-it-lives-beyond-the-rio-grande.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Mark A. | last=Uhlig | title=Mexico City Journal; Miss the VW Bug?

Volkswagen Australia was formed in 1957, and by 1960 locally produced body panels were being used for the first time. When the European Type One body received the larger windows for the 1965 model year, Volkswagen Australia decided not to update, but continued to produce the smaller-windowed bodies, with unique features to the Australian versions. This was due to the limited size of the market and the costs involved in retooling. Australian content had reached almost 95% by this time.<ref name=\"clubvw.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubvw.org.au/history004 |title=1965 - 1969 - Club VeeDub |publisher=Clubvw.org.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Australian subsidiary continued to produce the earlier body style until 1967, when declining sales forced a switch to CKD assembly using imported components the following year. In 1968, Volkswagen Australia released its own locally designed utilitarian version of the Type 1, the [[Volkswagen Country Buggy]] or Type 197.\n\nThe last Australian-assembled Beetle was produced in July 1976 with assembly of other models ending in February 1977.<ref name=clubvw>[http://www.clubvw.org.au/austvw001 Australian Volkswagens,www.clubvw.org.au] Retrieved 25 March 2018</ref> All Volkswagens for the Australian market have been fully imported since then.<ref name=clubvw/>\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nThe Beetle was also produced in South Africa at the Uitenhage plant from 31 August 1951 to 1979.  Several features from the Super Beetle were grafted onto the South African Beetle 1600S, such as curved windshield, new dashboard, and larger taillights, while retaining the Beetle chassis and mechanicals. The 1600 model was introduced to South Africa in 1972; it was marketed as the cheapest 1.6-liter car available there. In late 1976, the sporty SP 1600 Beetle arrived \u2013 this version received bright red, yellow, or silver paint with black stripes, a front spoiler, wide tyres, and a more powerful engine with twin carburettors and a freer flowing exhaust.<ref name=SAM1276>{{cite journal | ref = SAM1276 | journal = SA Motor | title = New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood | pages = 31\u201332 | last = Howard | first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1976 }}</ref> The interior was also sporty, with red tartan upholstery, a small steering wheel, and lots of matte black.

The vehicles were entered in such famous races as TAP (Portugal), Austrian Alpine, Elba, Acropolis etc. Drivers were top performers such as [[Tony Fall]] (GB), Guenter Janger (AUT), [[Harry K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m]] (S), [[Achim Warmbold]] (D), Franz Wurz (A), etc. The engines were highly modified 1600s delivering {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}, later on mated to a Porsche 914 five-speed manual gearbox. Victories were achieved in 1973 on Elba for overall and class, Acropolis for class (5th overall), Austrian championship 1972, 1973 January Rallye for overall and class. Rally of 1000 minutes for overall 2nd (1st in class).\n\nThe fuel crisis, along with the arrival of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] (Rabbit), put an end to the days of unofficially supported rallying in 1974. All vehicles either used for training or actual racing were sold off to privateers, many kept racing with noticeable results until the early 1980s.\n\n=== Trans-Am Series ===\n\nBeetles were used in the [[Trans-Am Series]] for the two-litre class from 1966 to 1967 and again in 1972.\n\n===Armstrong 500===\nA Volkswagen won its class in the [[Armstrong 500]] in [[Australia]] in both [[1962 Armstrong 500|1962]] and [[1963 Armstrong 500|1963]].\n\n=== Baja 1000 ===\n[[File:Baja Bug.jpg|thumb|[[Baja Bug]]-style modified Beetle]]\nThe [[Baja 1000]] [[off-road racing|off-road race]] in the [[Baja California Peninsula]], Mexico includes specific vehicle classes for both standard Beetles and [[Baja Bug]]s. These can be seen in the documentary movie ''[[Dust to Glory]]''.\n\nThe classes are:\n*[[SCORE Class 5|Class 5]]: Unlimited Baja Bugs\n*[[SCORE Class 5-1600|Class 5-1600]]: 1,600 cc Baja Bugs\n*[[SCORE Class 11|Class 11]]: Stock VW sedans\n\n=== Beetle Challenge ===\n\nThe Beetle Challenge is a UK-based circuit racing championship for classic air-cooled Volkswagen Beetles. The general concept is to take any Beetle, of any age or model from the 40s through to 1303s, and with minimal restrictions, allowing parts from various years to be interchanged, and of course the cars being prepared to the MSA safety requirements (cage, restraints, fire system etc.) Essentially the cars must be air-cooled Beetles (any age and parts can be swapped between years and models), with a 15-inch x 6-inch max wheel size with a control tyre. Engines must be based on a Type 1 case, with no electronic fuel injection or ignition and no forced induction, with an unlimited capacity. Other regulations apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beetlechallenge.com |title=Beetle Challenge |publisher=Beetle Challenge |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Retrofit program ==\nVolkswagen has joined up with eClassics to allow beetle owners to convert their car to electric.\nThe battery will have a total capacity of 36.8 kWh, which should be good for around 200 kilometers of range. It reaches a top speed of 150 km/h and charging for an hour allows to store enough energy for a journey of over 150 km.<ref>[https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/premiere-new-energy-for-the-beetle-5312 Premiere:\nNew energy for the Beetle]</ref><ref>[https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851784/vw-beetle-electric-conversion-frankfurt-motor-show VW beetle electric conversion]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n[[File:KDF-wagen tinplate toy.JPG|thumb|1940 KDF-wagen (Volkswagen Beetle) tin-plate toy, by the Nuremberg toymaker Georg Fischer, displayed in the '' {{lang|de|[[Hamburg Museum of Work|Museum der Arbeit]]}}'', Hamburg, Germany]]\n\n* [[Black Current]]\n* [[Cal looker]]\n* [[Cal-Style VW]]\n* [[Herbie]], a famous fictional Volkswagen Beetle.\n* [[List of names for the Volkswagen Type 1]]\n* [[Meyers Manx]]\n* [[Punch buggy]]\n* [[Steyr 50]]\n* [[Trabant]]\n* [[Volksrod]]\n* [[Volkswagen advertising]]\n* [[Time Inc.

cheap, simple car to be mass-produced for his country's new road network ([[Reichsautobahn]]). Members of the National Socialist party, with an additional dues surcharge, were promised the first production, but [[Spanish civil war|civil war in Spain]] shifted most production resources to military vehicles instead to support [[Francisco Franco]].

The car was then internally designated the Volkswagen Type 1, and marketed simply as the Volkswagen. Later models were designated Volkswagen 1200, 1300, 1500, 1302, or 1303, the former three indicating [[engine displacement]], the latter two derived from the model number. The car became widely known in its home country as the ''K\u00e4fer'' (German for \"[[beetle]]\", cognate with English [[Wikt:chafer|chafer]]) and was later marketed under that name in Germany,<ref name= samba-1973-de-super/> and as the Volkswagen in other countries.

As Autobahn speeds increased in the postwar years, its output was boosted to 36, then 40&nbsp;hp, the configuration that lasted through 1966 and became the \"classic\" Volkswagen motor. The Beetle gave rise to multiple variants: mainly the 1950 [[Volkswagen Type 2|Type 2 'Bus']], the 1955 [[Volkswagen Karmann Ghia|Karmann Ghia]], as well as the 1961 [[Volkswagen Type 3|Type 3 'Ponton']] and the 1968 [[Volkswagen Type 4|Type 4 (411/412)]] [[family car]]s, ultimately forming the basis of an entirely rear-engined VW product range. The Beetle thus marked a significant trend, led by Volkswagen, and then by [[Fiat]] and [[Renault]], whereby the [[rear-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout]] increased from 2.6&nbsp;percent of continental Western Europe's car production in 1946 to 26.6&nbsp;percent in 1956.<ref name=SmallCar196501>{{cite journal |authorlink= Laurence Pomeroy |title=BMC's Mini: The Background story: Part one: The Volkswagen cometh |journal=[[Car Magazine|Small Car]] |pages=42\u201347 |date=January 1965}}</ref> In 1959 even General Motors launched an air-cooled, rear-engined car, the [[Chevrolet Corvair]]\u2014which even shared the Beetle's flat engine and [[swing axle]] architecture.\n\nOver time, [[front-wheel drive]], and frequently [[hatchback]]-bodied cars would come to dominate the European small-car market.

The Japanese had refined rear-wheel-drive, water-cooled, front-engine, small cars including the [[Datsun 510]] and [[Toyota Corona]], whose sales in the North American market grew rapidly at the expense of Volkswagen in the late 1960s.  [[Honda]] introduced the [[Honda N360|N600]], based on the space-efficient transverse-engine, front-wheel-drive layout of the original [[Austin Mini]], to the North American market in late 1969, and upgraded the model to the [[Honda Civic]] in 1972.  The Japanese \"big three\" would soon dominate compact auto sales in North America.  In 1971 [[Ford]] introduced its [[Ford Pinto|Pinto]], which had some market impact as a low cost alternative in the wake of the [[Nixon shock|drop of the US Dollar against the Deutschmark]] that same year.  As the 1960s came to a close, Volkswagen faced increasingly stiff competition from European cars as well.  The Beetle was faced with competition from new designs like the [[Fiat 127]] and [[Renault 5]], and more robust designs based on the Austin Mini layout such as the [[supermini car|Superminis]]. German competitors, [[Ford]] and [[Opel]] also enjoyed strong sales of modern smaller cars like the [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Ford Escort]] and [[Opel Kadett]].  Volkswagen's attempts to boost the power of their air-cooled motor to meet the demands of higher highway speeds in the late 1960s, then comply with new pollution control regulations, caused problems for reliability and fuel efficiency that impaired the reputation of the aging design.  Safety issues with the Beetle came under increasing scrutiny, culminating in the 1972 release of a rather scathing report.<ref>{{cite book|author=Center for Auto Safety|title=Small on Safety:The designed-in dangers of the Volkswagen|date= 1972|isbn=978-0670652495}}</ref>  During the early 1970s, sales of the Beetle in Europe and North America plummeted.\n\nVW introduced other models to supplement the Beetle throughout the 1960s; the [[VW Type 3|Type 3]], [[VW Type 4|Type 4]], and the NSU-based and larger [[VW K70|K70]].  None of these models, aimed at more upscale markets, achieved the level of success of the Beetle. The over-reliance on a single model, now in decline, meant that Volkswagen was in financial crisis by 1974. It needed German government funding to produce the Beetle's replacement.\n\nProduction lines at Wolfsburg switched to the new water-cooled, front-engined, [[front-wheel-drive]] [[Volkswagen Golf|Golf]] designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] in 1974, sold in North America at the time as the \"Rabbit\".  The Golf eventually became Volkswagen's most successful model since the Beetle. It was periodically redesigned over its lifetime, with only a few components carried over between generations, entering its seventh generation in 2012; the Beetle had only minor refinements of its original design.\n\nThe Golf did not kill Beetle production, nor did the smaller [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]] which was launched a year later. Production of the Beetle continued in smaller numbers at other German factories until 19 January 1978, when mainstream production shifted to Brazil and Mexico: markets where low operating cost was an important factor. After this shift in production, sales in Europe did not stop, but became very low. Beetle sedans were produced for U.S. markets until July 1977<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\">Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com {{cite web|url=http://www.thesamba.com/vw/archives/info/bugchassisdating.php|title=Beetle VIN / Chassis Numbers - TheSamba.com}}</ref> and for European markets until 1985, with other companies continuing to import cars produced in Mexico after 1985. The Beetle convertible/Cabriolet ended production (as 1979 models) on January 31, 1980.<ref name=\"TheSamba.com\"/>\n\nThe last Beetle was produced in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico, in July 2003.<ref name=\"AutoMotoruSport200313\"/> The final batch of 3,000 Beetles were sold as 2004 models and badged as the ''\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n'', with [[whitewall tires]], a host of previously discontinued chrome trim, and the choice of two special paint colors taken from the [[New Beetle]]. Production in Brazil ended in 1986, then started again in 1993 and continued until 1996.\n\nThe Beetle outlasted most other cars which had adopted the rear-engine, air-cooled layout such as those by [[Subaru 360|Subaru]], [[Fiat]], and [[Chevrolet Corvair|General Motors]]. Porsche's 356 series which originally used some Volkswagen-sourced parts, continued to use the classic rear-engine layout (which later became water cooled) in the [[Porsche 911]] 996 series, which remains competitive in the third decade of the 21st century.\n\n=== Worldwide end of production ===\n[[File:Volkswagen Bubbla sista bilen.jpg|thumb|\"\u00daltima Edici\u00f3n\" (Final Edition) in Aquarius Blue (2003).]]\nBy 2002, over 21 million Type 1s had been produced, but by 2003, annual production had dropped to 30,000 from a peak of 1.3&nbsp;million in 1971.

Each car included the 1.6 engine, whitewall tires, a CD player with four speakers, chrome bumpers, trim, hub caps and exterior mirrors, a Wolfsburg emblem above the front trunk's handle, an all-cloth interior, chrome glove box badge, body coloured wheels, tinted glass, a rear parcel shelf, and VW \u00daltima Edici\u00f3n plaque.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/accidentally-like-a-martyr-2003-vw-beetle-ltima-edicin/|website=www.hemmings.com|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref>\n\nA [[mariachi]] band serenaded production of the last car. In Mexico, there was an advertising campaign as a goodbye for the Beetle. In one of the ads was a very small parking space on the street, and many big cars tried to use it, but could not.

The bodywork attached with eighteen bolts to its nearly flat [[platform chassis]] which featured a central structural tunnel. Front and rear suspension featured [[Torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] along with front stabilizer bar\u2014providing independent suspension at all wheels. Certain initial features were subsequently revised, including mechanical drum brakes, split-window rear windows, mechanical direction-indicators and the non-synchronized gearbox.  Other features, including its distinctive overall shape, endured. In fact, the Beetle was prized for its seemingly unchanged appearance and \"marketed to American consumers as the anti-GM and Ford: 'We do not believe in planned obsolescence. We don't change a car for the sake of change.'\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abramson|first=Daniel|year=2012|title=From Obsolescence to Sustainability, Back Again, and Beyond|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=279\u2013298|via=}}</ref>\n\nIts engine, transmission, and cylinder heads were constructed of light alloy. An engine oil cooler (located in the engine fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold. Later models of the carburetor featured an automatic [[choke valve|choke]]. Engine intake air passed through a metallic filter, while heavier particles were captured by an oil bath. After 1960, steering featured a hydraulic damper that absorbed steering irregularities.\n\nIndicative of the car's utilitarian design, the interior featured painted metal surfaces, a metal dash consolidating instruments in a single, circular [[binnacle]], adjustable front seats, a fold-down rear seat, optional swing-out rear windows, front windows with pivoting vent windows, heating via air-to-air exchange manifolds operating off the engine's heat, and a windshield washer system that eschewed the complexity and cost of an additional electric pump and instead received its pressurization from the car's spare tire (located in the front luggage compartment) which was accordingly overinflated to accommodate the washer function.\n\nThroughout its production, VW marketed the Beetle with a four-speed manual transmission.

After successfully presenting it at VW in Wolfsburg the Beetle Cabriolet began production in 1949 by [[Karmann]] in [[Osnabr\u00fcck]].\n\nThe convertible was more than a Beetle with a folding top. To compensate for the strength lost in removing the roof, the sills were reinforced with welded U-channel rails, a transverse beam was fitted below the front edge of the rear seat cushion, and the side cowl-panels below the instrument panel were double-wall. In addition, the lower corners of the door apertures had welded-in curved gussets, and the doors had secondary alignment wedges at the B-pillar.\n\nThe top was cabriolet-style with a full inner headliner hiding the folding mechanism and crossbars. In between the two top layers was {{convert|1|in|mm|abbr=on}} of insulation. The rear window was tempered safety glass, and after 1968, heated. Due to the thickness of the top, it remained quite tall when folded. To enable the driver to see over the lowered top, the inside rearview was mounted on an offset pivot. By twisting the mirror 180 degrees on a longitudinal axis, the mirror glass would raise approximately {{convert|2|in|cm|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe convertible was generally more lavishly equipped than the sedan with dual rear ashtrays, twin map pockets, a visor vanity mirror on the passenger side, rear stone shields, and through 1969, wheel trim rings. Many of these items did not become available on other Beetles until the advent of the optional \"L\" (Luxus) Package of 1970.\n\nAfter a number of stylistic and technical alterations made to the Karmann cabriolet,<ref>{{cite web |author=Jon Gilbert |url=http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |title=volksworld.com |publisher=volksworld.com |date=2008-10-31 |accessdate=2012-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809014310/http://www.volksworld.com/news/cars/279437/1963-vw-beetle-cabriolet.html |archive-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> (corresponding to the many changes VW made to the Beetle throughout its history), the last of 331,847 cabriolets came off the production line on 10 January 1980.\n\n===1950\u20131959 models===\n[[File:VW K\u00e4fer blue 1956 vr TCE.jpg|thumb|1956 Volkswagen Beetle]]\n\nDuring this period, a myriad of changes were made throughout the vehicle beginning with the availability of hydraulic brakes and a folding fabric sunroof in 1950.  The rear window of the VW Beetle evolved from a divided or \"split\" oval, to a singular oval. The change occurred between October 1952 and March 1953.<ref name=\"Ponchard\">{{cite journal|last=Ponchard|first=Nathan|title=Auction Action|journal=Unique Cars|date=27 February 2013|issue=347|page=22|url=http://www.uniquecarsmag.com.au|accessdate=5 March 2013}}</ref> Beetles built during this time were known as a \"Zwitter\", or \"hybrid\", as they used the split-window bodyshell with oval-model chrome trim, vent windows and dashboard.<ref name=\"Ponchard\" />\n\n1953 models received a redesigned instrument panel.  The one-piece \u201cPope's Nose\u201d combination license plate/brake light was replaced by a smaller flat-bottomed license plate light. The brake light function was transferred to new heart-shaped lamps located in the top of the taillight housings.<ref>{{cite book|  title=Vintage Volkswagens |  url=https://archive.org/details/vintagevolkswage00flat |  url-access=registration |publisher=Flat 4 Project/Chronicle Books| location=San Francisco| year=1985}}</ref>\n\nIn 1954, Volkswagen added {{convert|2|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the cylinder bore, increasing the [[engine displacement|displacement]] from 1,131 (1100)&nbsp;cc to 1,192 (1200)&nbsp;cc.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961>{{cite journal|journal=Practical Motorist |volume = 7 | issue = 81  |title =Knowing your Volkswagen | page = 943|date=May 1961}}</ref> This coincided with upgrades to various key components including a redesign of the crankshaft. This increased power from {{convert|30|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} to {{convert|36|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} and improved the engine's free revving abilities without compromising torque at lower engine speeds.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/> At the same time, compression ratios were progressively raised as, little by little, the octane ratings of available fuel was raised in major markets during the 1950s and 1960s.<ref name=PracticalMotorist1961/>\n\nIn 1955, the separate brake lights were discontinued and were combined into a new larger taillight housing.  The traditional VW semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicator lamps for North America.\n\nFor 1956, the Beetle received what would become one of its more distinctive features, a set of twin chrome tailpipes. Models for North America gained taller bumper guards and tubular overrider bars.\n\nFor 1958, the Beetle received a revised instrument panel, and a larger rectangular rear window replaced the previous oval design.\n\n===1960\u20131969 models===\n\n1960 models received a front [[sway bar|anti roll bar]] along with hydraulic [[steering damper]].\n\nFor 1961, significant technical advances occurred in the form of a new engine and transmission. The engine remained at {{cvt|1192|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} but the power increased to {{convert|40|bhp|PS kW|abbr=on}} at 3900 rpm and {{convert|88|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 2400 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.conceptcarz.com/s7533/Volkswagen-Beetle.aspx|website=conceptcarz|title=1963 Volkswagen Beetle Technical Specifications and Dimensions|accessdate=July 1, 2018}}</ref> primarily due to an increase in [[compression ratio]] to 7.1:1. The single-barrel [[Solex]] [[carburetor]] received an electric automatic choke and the transmission was now [[Manual transmission#Synchromesh|synchronized]] on all forward gears. The traditional semaphore turn signals were replaced by conventional flashing directional indicators worldwide. The standard model called the TYPE 111-112, continued to use the 36&nbsp;hp 1200 engine of the old architecture that dates back to Franz Reimspiess original design of 1937 all the way until the end of the 1965 model year. 1965 standard model in 1965 is called the \"A\" sedan.\n\nFor 1962, the Beetle received a mechanical fuel level gauge in place of the former fuel tap. The Standard model continued without a gas gauge until the end of the 1965 model year. At the rear, larger tail lights were introduced incorporating a separate amber turn signal section to meet new European standards (these turn signals remained red in the US market until 1973). The former hand-pump style windscreen washer was replaced by a new design using compressed air. A [[Schrader valve]] located on the washer fluid tank allowed the system to be charged at a filling station to the recommended {{convert|35|psi|bar|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite book | title = The Beetle: The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 77 }}</ref>\n\n1964 models could be identified by a widened light housing on the engine lid over the rear license plate, however the standard model continued to use the old teardrop style to the end of the 1965 model run.\n\nThe largest change to date for the Beetle was in 1965: the majority of the body stampings were revised, which allowed for significantly larger windows. The windshield increased in area by 11% and was now slightly curved, rather than flat. Door windows increased accordingly by 6% (and door vent window edges were canted slightly back), rear side windows 17.5%, and the rear window 19.5%. The result was a more open, airy, modern look.<ref name=\"Small Wonder\">{{Cite book | title = Small Wonder| author=Walter Henry Nelson| publisher = Little, Brown and Co. |date= 1970 | page = 308 }}</ref>\n\nFor 1966, the big news was an optional new 1300cc {{convert|50|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} engine in lieu of the previous 1200cc engine that had been the sole engine since 1954. Models so equipped carried a \"1300\" badge on the engine lid. The 1300cc engine was standard for North America.\n\nFor 1967, a yet-again larger-[[engine displacement|displacement]] engine was made available: [[Volkswagen air-cooled engine|1500cc]], {{convert|53|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}} at 4,200&nbsp;rpm.<ref name=\"TAM67\">{{Cite book | title = Quattroruote Speciale: Tutte le Auto del Mondo 1967 | publisher = Editoriale Domus S.p.A |date=February 1967 | language = Italian | pages = 296\u2013298 | location = Milano }}</ref> 1200 and 1300 engines continued to be available, as many markets based their taxation on engine size.<ref name=\"TAM67\"/> 1500cc Beetles were equipped with front disc brakes and were identified with a \"VW 1500\" badge on the engine lid. North America received the 1500 engine as standard equipment, but did not receive front disc brakes. These models were identified by a \"Volkswagen\" badge on the engine lid.\n\nThe rear suspension was significantly revised and included a widened track, softer torsion bars and the addition of a unique ''Z-configuration'' equalizing torsion spring. On US, UK and Ireland models, the generator output was increased from 180 to 360&nbsp;watts, and the entire electrical system was upgraded from 6 volts to 12 volts. The clutch disc also increased in size and changes were made to the [[flywheel]]. New equipment included a driver's armrest on the door and locking buttons on both doors. Safety improvements included two-speed [[windscreen wiper]]s, reversing lights (in some markets), and a driver's side mirror. In accord with the newly enacted US [[Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 108]], North American models received a dual-circuit brake system, the clear glass [[headlamp]] covers were deleted; the headlamps were brought forward to the leading edge of the front fenders, and the sealed-beam units were exposed and surrounded by chrome bezels. In the rest of the world markets the 1967 model retained the older headlights. Another oddity of the 1967 North American market Beetle is the rear bumper overriders (towel rails) \u2013 the overriders have a different shape than the older models besides the one-year only engine decklid.{{clarify|reason=what does the end of this sentence (from \"besides\") mean?|date=October 2018}} The Brazilian market model (Volkswagen Fusca) retained the pre-1967 headlamps until 1972.{{Citation needed|reason=Entire paragraph needs a source, please|date=October 2018}}\n\n[[File:'68 VW 1500.jpg|thumb|1968 Type 1]]\n1968 was a year of major change. The most noticeable of which were the new larger, higher mounted C-section bumpers. At the rear, new larger taillamps were adopted and were able to accommodate reversing lamps, which were previously separate bumper-mounted units. Beetles worldwide received the '67 North American style vertical headlamp placement, but with replaceable-bulb headlamps compliant with [[ECE regulations]] rather than the US sealed beams. Other improvements were a new outside gas filler with spring-loaded flap, eliminating the need to open the trunk to refuel. The fuel gauge was integrated with the speedometer and was now electrically actuated rather than cable-operated. The windscreen washer was now pressured by the spare tire, which was to be maintained at a pressure of {{convert|42|psi|bar|abbr=on}}. A pressure valve in the connecting hose closed airflow to the fluid reservoir if spare tire pressure fell below {{convert|30|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, which was above the recommended pressures for the road tires.<ref>\">{{Cite book | title = The Beetle:  The Chronicles of the People's Car| author=H.R. Etzold| publisher = Haynes Publishing Group |date= 1988 | page = 123 }}</ref> A ventilation system was introduced, which drew fresh air into the cabin from louvres on the front decklid.  For improved shifting, the shift lever was shortened, stiffened and moved rearward by {{convert|78|mm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nA number of safety improvements were made in order to comply with new American safety regulations: these included trigger-operated outside door handles, a secondary front hood latch, collapsing steering column, soft vent window latches, rotary glove compartment latch and instrument panel knobs labeled with [[pictographs]]. US models received a padded instrument panel that was optional in other markets. To meet North American head restraint requirements, VW developed the industry's first high-back bucket seat.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The Standard model 111-112, called the 1200 \"A\" still used the 1200 engine but for the first time for Europe it came with a 12 volt system.\n\n[[File:'68 Volkswagen AutoStick Badge.jpg|thumb|'68\u2013'69 Automatic ''StickShift'' badge]]\n\nA new 3-speed [[manumatic]] gear box with [[torque converter]] and vacuum-operated clutch became available mid-production year. The manumatic models received a vastly improved [[Trailing arm|semi-trailing-arm]] rear suspension (also known as \"independent rear suspension\" although the earlier swing axle Beetles were also [[Suspension (vehicle)#Independent suspension|independent]]) and eliminated the need for the equalizing torsion spring. This new rear suspension layout would eventually become an option on later models. Beetles equipped with the automatic were identified with a \"VW Automatic\" badge on the engine lid and a matching decal in the rear window. In North America, the badging and decal were later revised to read, \"Automatic ''Stick Shift''\".\n\nFor 1969, the only exterior change was the fuel filler flap no longer had a finger indentation due to a new interior-mounted fuel door release. For North America, the Beetle received a heated rear window, day/night mirror and the semi-trailing, independent suspension with double jointed swing axles as standard equipment. In other markets, manual transmission models retained a swing axle independent suspension which would continue until the end of German Beetle production.\n\n===1970\u20131979 models===\nIn 1970, a new \"L\" (Luxus) Package was introduced including, among other items, twin map pockets, dual rear ashtrays, full carpeting, a passenger-side visor vanity mirror, and rubber bumper moldings. The optional 1500&nbsp;cc engine now came with an engine lid having two rows of cooling louvers, while the convertible's engine lid gained two additional sets for a total of four. For North America, the 1500&nbsp;cc engine was enlarged to 1600&nbsp;cc engine and produced {{convert|57|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}\n\nThere were two Beetles for the first time in 1971, the familiar standard Beetle and a new, larger version, different from the windscreen forward. All Beetles received an engine upgrade: the optional 1500 cc engine was replaced by a 1600 cc with twin-port cylinder heads and a larger, relocated oil cooler. The new engine produced {{convert|60|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}. The ventilation system was improved with the original dash-top vents augmented by a second pair aimed directly at the driver and passenger. For the first time the system was a flow-through design with crescent-shaped air exits fitted behind the rear quarter windows. Airflow could be increased via an optional 2-speed fan.

Although the car had to be lengthened slightly to accomplish this, it allowed a reduction in turning radius. To gain additional trunk volume, the under-dash panel{{clarify|date=May 2017|what is that, exactly?}} was lowered, allowing the fuel tank to be shifted rearward. From the windscreen back the big Beetle was identical to its smaller progenitor, except for having the also new [[trailing-arm suspension|semi-trailing arm]] rear suspension as standard equipment. Overall, the bigger Beetle was {{convert|50|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|35|mm|in|abbr=on}} wider, and rode on a {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=on}}-longer wheelbase. Both Beetles were available with or without the L Package. The convertible was now based on the 1302 body. In North America, the 1302 was marketed as the Super Beetle and came only with the L Package and 1600 cc engine. While it lacked the front disc brakes that normally accompanied the larger motor, it was fitted with brake drums that were slightly larger than the standard Beetle. With the Super Beetle being sold as the premium model in North America, the standard Beetle, while retaining the same 1600 cc engine, was stripped of many of its earlier features in order to reduce the selling price. Bright window and running board moldings disappeared, along with the day/night mirror, horn ring, map pocket, locking glove box and miscellaneous other items.\n\n1972 models had an 11% larger rear window ({{convert|40|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} taller), and the convertible engine lid with four rows of louvres was now used on all Beetles. Inside the vehicle, a four-spoke energy-absorbing steering wheel was introduced, the windshield wiper/washer knob was replaced in favor of a steering column stalk, and intermittent wipers were a new option available in selected markets. An engine compartment socket for the proprietary VW Diagnosis system was also introduced. The rear luggage area was fitted with a folding parcel shelf. A limited-edition Commemorative model was launched in celebration of the Beetle's passing the record of the Ford Model T as the world's most-produced automobile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sebeetles.com/marathon/ |title=1972 Marathon Beetle - All the VW Beetle Special Editions |publisher=SE Beetles |date=2016-05-20 |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Commemorative Beetle was a 1302 S finished in a special Marathon Blue Metallic paint and unique 4.5 x 15 styled steel wheels. In the U.S., it was marketed as the Super Beetle Baja Champion SE.\n \n[[File:Volkswagen Beetle .jpg|thumb|1973 1303/Super Beetle]]\n[[File:1973-1974 Volkswagen \"1303 Big\", Istanbul.jpg|left|thumb|1973\u201374 1303/Super Beetle \"Big\"]]\n\n1973 models featured significantly enlarged \"elephant foot\" taillamps mounted in reshaped rear fenders. In the engine bay, the oil-bath air cleaner gave way to a dry element filter, and the generator was replaced with an alternator. The 1302/Super became the 1303 with a new taller wrap-around windscreen. The changes to the cowl and windshield resulted in slight redesign of the front hood. The instrument panel, formerly shared with the standard Beetle, was all-new and incorporated a raised speedometer pod, rocker-style switches and side-window defrosters.  The limited-edition GSR (Gelb-Schwarzer Renner; German for \"Yellow-Black Racer\") was a 1303 S available only in Saturn Yellow paint equipped with special {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels fitted with 175/70-15 Pirelli Cinturato CN36 high-performance radial tires. Front and rear deck lids were finished in matte black, as was all exterior trim with the exception of the chrome headlamp bezels. Inside were [[corduroy]] and leatherette high-bolstered sport seats and a small diameter three-spoke steering wheel with padded leather rim and a small red VW logo on the bottom spoke. In North America, the GSR was sold as the Super Beetle Sports Bug. The North American model had body-color deck lids and was available in Marathon Blue Metallic in addition to Saturn Yellow. In some markets, the sport wheels (in both 4.5-inch and 5.5-inch widths), sport steering wheel and sport seats became available as stand-alone options.\n\nFor 1974, North American models received newly required {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} impact bumpers mounted on self-restoring energy absorbers, which added approximately {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} to the car's overall length. On the Super Beetle, the steering knuckle, and consequently the lower attachment point of the strut, was redesigned to improve handling and stability in the event of a tire blowout. A limited-edition Big Beetle was introduced based on the 1303 LS. Available in unique metallic paint colors, the car featured styled-steel {{convert|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels wrapped in 175/70-15 tires, corduroy seat inserts, upgraded loop-pile carpet, wood-look instrument panel trim and a padded steering wheel with bright accents. In the North American market, a limited-edition Sun Bug was introduced as a standard Beetle or Super Beetle. Both were finished in metallic gold and featured styled-steel {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}-wide sport wheels. Inside were brown corduroy and leatherette seats, loop-pile carpet, and padded four-spoke deluxe steering wheel. The Super Beetle Sun Bug included a sliding-steel sunroof. Mid-year, the Love Bug was introduced for North America: based on the standard Beetle, it was available only in Phoenix Red or Ravenna Green (both colors shared with the [[Porsche 914|VW-Porsche 914]]) with all exterior trim finished in matte black. A price leader, the Love Bug retailed for less than a standard Beetle.\n\nIn 1975, front turn indicators were moved from the top of the front fenders down into the bumper. At the rear, the license plate light housing was now molded of plastic with a ribbed top surface. To comply with tightening emission standards, the 1600 cc engine in Japanese and North American markets received Bosch [[Jetronic#L|L-Jetronic]] fuel injection, rather than the [[Jetronic#D|D-Jetronic]] system formerly used in the VW Type 3 and Type 4. The injected engine received a new muffler and in California a catalytic converter. This necessitated a bulge in the rear apron under the rear bumper and replaced the distinctive twin \"pea shooter\" tailpipes with a single offset pipe, making injected models identifiable at a glance.  {{convert|5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} bumper-equipped North American models retained fender-top front indicators. The 1303 received rack and pinion steering. In North America, the 1303/Super Beetle sedan was moved upmarket and was now christened La Grande Bug. Similar to the Big Beetle of 1974, La Grande Bug was available in blue or green metallic paint in the U.S. and blue, green or gold metallic in Canada and was equipped with the same features as the 1974 Sun Bug. The \"Volkswagen\" script on the engine lid of all North American Beetles was replaced with a \"Fuel Injection\" badge.\n\nIn 1976, the 1303/La Grande Bug was discontinued, with the larger body continuing only in convertible form. To make up for the loss in North American markets, the standard Beetle was upgraded, regaining some of the features that were removed in 1971. In addition, the 2-speed ventilation fan was included, previously available in North America only on the larger Beetle. The automatic stickshift option was discontinued as well.\n\n1977 models received new front seats with separate head restraints.  This was the final model year for the Beetle sedan in North America. The convertible was offered in a \"triple white\" Champagne Edition in Alpine White with  white top and interior with the padded deluxe steering wheel, tiger maple wood-grain dash trim and {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide sport wheels. Approximately 1,000 Champagne Editions were produced.\n\nFor 1978, a new Champagne 2nd Edition convertible was launched, available in blue or red metallic paint with white leatherette interior. Features included the {{convert|4.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide styled steel sport wheels, AM/FM radio, analog [[quartz clock]], padded deluxe steering wheel and rosewood-grain instrument panel trim. Approximately 1,100 were produced.\n\nIn 1979, VW offered an Epilogue Edition of the convertible in triple black with features similar to the 1978 Champagne Edition. This would be the last year of convertible production worldwide as well as the final year for the Beetle in the USA and Canada.\n\n== Introduction to international markets ==\n\n===Ireland ===\n{{Main|History of Volkswagen in Ireland}}\n\nVolkswagen began its involvement in Ireland when in 1949, Motor Distributors Limited, founded by Stephen O'Flaherty secured the [[franchising|franchise]] for the country at that year\u2019s [[Paris Motor Show]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era/ |title=Motor moguls facing end of an era |author=Brian Carey |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=14 September 2003 |accessdate=6 November 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310065902/http://tribune.ie/archive/article/2003/sep/14/motor-moguls-facing-end-of-an-era |archivedate=10 March 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/the-motor-moguls-955766.html|title=The Motor Moguls|work=[[Irish Independent]]|date=5 July 2007|accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> In 1950, Volkswagen Beetles started arriving into [[Dublin]] packed in crates in what was termed \"[[knockdown kit|completely knocked down]]\" (CKD) form ready to be assembled.

The last German made cars were assembled at Emden in 1978, after which the Puebla, Mexico plant became the principal source of Beetle production.

In 1993 production resumed and continued to 1996. The Brazilian version retained the 1958\u201364 body style (Europe and U.S. version) with the thick door pillars and smaller side windows. This body style was also produced in Mexico until 1971. Around 1973, all Brazilian Beetles (1300 and 1500 series) were updated with the 1968-up sheet metal, bumpers, and four-lug rims; although the five-stud rims and \"bugeye\" headlights were produced as late as 1972 (the base VW 1200 and 1300 manufactured in Brazil was similar to the 1964 European/U.S. 1200 until the 1970 model year but came with vented wheels since the mid-1960s). The 1971 and 1972 1300s had the 1964-era taillights and headlights, fuel tank, but fitted with the 1968-up raised bumpers. Brazilian CKD kits were shipped to Nigeria between 1975 and 1987 where Beetles were locally assembled. The Brazilian-produced versions have been sold in neighboring South American nations bordering Brazil, including Argentina, Uruguay, and Peru.\n\nThe Brazilian Type 1s have four different engines: 1,200&nbsp;cc, 1,300&nbsp;cc, 1,500&nbsp;cc, and 1,600&nbsp;cc. In the 1970s, Volkswagen made the SP-2 (derived from the Type 1 pan and the Type 3 powertrain) with a 1,700&nbsp;cc engine (a [[cylinder bore|bored-out]] 1,600&nbsp;cc). In Brazil, the Type 1 never received electronic fuel injection, instead retaining carburetors (one or two one-barrels) throughout its entire life, although the carburetion differs from engines of different years and specification.\n\nThe production of the air-cooled engine finally ended in 2006, after more than 60 years.  It was last used in the Brazilian version of the [[Volkswagen Type 2|VW Bus]], called the \"Kombi\", and was replaced by a 1.4&nbsp;L water-cooled engine with a front-mounted cooling system. [[Volkswagen do Brasil]] engaged in some string pulling in the early sixties when a law requiring taxis to have four doors and five seats was being considered. After proving that the average taxi fare only carried 1.8 passengers and an overall saving of twenty percent for a smaller two-door car, the Brazilian government relented and the law never entered the books.<ref name=Stern137>[[#stern|''VW-Tochter: Erfolg mit Fusca'']], p. 137</ref> The Fusca proceeded to have a long career as a taxi in urban Brazil.\n\n=== Southern Rhodesia ===\nThe Volkswagen Type 1 chassis was used as the basis for a mine-protected [[armoured personnel carrier|APC]] called the [[Leopard security vehicle]] and the [[Pookie (vehicle)|Pookie]] demining vehicle, fielded by the Republic of Rhodesia during the [[Rhodesian Bush War]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}\n\n=== Mexico ===\n[[File:Sedan Jeans.jpg|thumb|1995 Mexican Volkswagen Beetle, the last model with chrome moldings.

In 1964, they began to be locally produced.  These models have the larger windshield, rear window, door and quarter glass starting in 1972; and the rear window from 1965 to 1971 German built models was used on the Mexican models from 1972 to 1985, when it was replaced with the larger rear window used on 1972 and later German built Beetles. This version, after the mid-1970s, saw little change with the incorporation of electronic ignition in 1988, an anti-theft alarm system in 1990, a [[catalytic converter]] in 1991 (as required by law), as well as electronic [[Digifant]] [[fuel injection]], hydraulic valve lifters, and a spin-on oil filter in 1993. The front turn signals were located in the bumper instead of the Beetle's traditional placement on top of the front fenders from the 1977 model year on, as they had been on German Beetles sold in Europe from 1975 onwards. Starting in 1995, the Mexican Beetle included front disc brakes, an alternator instead of a generator, and front automatic seat belts. During the 1995 model year, the chrome moldings disappeared leaving body colored bumpers and black moldings instead on some models. By the start of the 1996 model year, exterior chrome or matt moldings were dropped altogether and Volkswagen de Mexico (VWdM) dropped the Sedan's flow-through ventilation system with all its fittings, notably the exterior crescent-shaped vents behind the rear side windows the same year.\n\nIn mid-1996, front drum brakes and fixed front seat belts were re-launched in a new budget version called the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n City\", which was sold alongside the upscale version \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico\" which had front disc brakes, automatic seat belts, right side mirror, velour upholstery, optional metallic colors and wheel covers in matte finish (also found on some 1980s Beetles and Buses). These two versions were sold until mid 1998. From mid 1998\u20132003, The Sed\u00e1n Cl\u00e1sico was discontinued and the Sed\u00e1n City lost its prefix and gained disc brakes, automatic seat belts and optional metallic colors. This last version was named the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n Unificado\" or simply the \"Volkswagen Sed\u00e1n\".\n\n[[File:Vochol09MAP.jpg|thumb|left| A Beetle decorated in the [[Huichol people|Huichol]] style of beading now on display at the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City]]\n\nIndependent importers continued to supply several major countries, including Germany, France, and the UK until the end of production in 2003.  Devoted fans of the car even discovered a way to circumvent US safety regulations by placing more recently manufactured Mexican Beetles on the [[floorpan]]s of earlier, US-registered cars. The Mexican Beetle (along with its Brazilian counterpart) was on the US DOT's (Department of Transportation) hot list of [[grey market]] imports after 1978 as the vehicle did not meet safety regulations.\n\nIn the Southwest US ([[Arizona]], California, [[New Mexico]], Texas), Mexican Beetles (and some [[Volkswagen Type 2 (T2)|Brazilian T2c Transporters]]) are a fairly common sight since Mexican nationals can legally operate the vehicle in the United States, provided the cars remain registered in Mexico. Some of the Mexican Beetles have been registered in the United States since the 1998 NHTSA amendment granting the 25-year cutoff where it (and its Brazilian counterpart including the T2C) can be legally registered in any of the 50 states (this means a 1992 or earlier Mexican Beetle as of 2017 can be registered under the current NHTSA 25-year cutoff exemption).\n\nThe end of production in Mexico can be attributed primarily to Mexican political measures: the Beetles no longer met [[emission standard]]s for Mexico City, in which the ubiquitous Beetles were used as taxicabs; and the government outlawed their use as taxicabs because of rising crime rates, requiring only four-door vehicles be used. The last Vocho taxis in Mexico City were retired at the end of 2012.<ref name=Hemmings>{{cite journal | title = Vochos No Mas | journal = Hemmings Sports & Exotic Car |date=June 2012 | last = Shea | first = Terry | page = 48 | issue = 10 | volume = 7 | publisher = [[Hemmings Motor News]] | location = Bennington, VT | issn = 1555-6867 }}</ref> In addition, Volkswagen (now Germany's largest automaker) has been attempting to cultivate a more upscale, premium brand image, and the humble Beetle clashed with this identity, as seen in the [[Volkswagen Touareg|Touareg]] and [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] luxury vehicles. In the late 1990s consumers strongly preferred more modern cars such as the [[Opel Corsa#Opel Corsa B|Mexican Chevy]], the [[Nissan Tsuru#B13 (1991\u20131994)|Nissan Tsuru]], and the [[Volkswagen Gol#Gol G2 to G4 (1994-2008)|Volkswagen Pointer]] and [[Volkswagen Fox|Lupo]].\n\nHowever, demand for the Beetle was relatively high, especially in the 1990s, with the workforce increasing at the start of the decade. The price of the base model (without even a radio) was pegged with the official minimum wage, by an agreement between the company and the government. In 1990 it cost US$5,300.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/10/20/world/mexico-city-journal-miss-the-vw-bug-it-lives-beyond-the-rio-grande.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Mark A. | last=Uhlig | title=Mexico City Journal; Miss the VW Bug?

Volkswagen Australia was formed in 1957, and by 1960 locally produced body panels were being used for the first time. When the European Type One body received the larger windows for the 1965 model year, Volkswagen Australia decided not to update, but continued to produce the smaller-windowed bodies, with unique features to the Australian versions. This was due to the limited size of the market and the costs involved in retooling. Australian content had reached almost 95% by this time.<ref name=\"clubvw.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://www.clubvw.org.au/history004 |title=1965 - 1969 - Club VeeDub |publisher=Clubvw.org.au |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref> The Australian subsidiary continued to produce the earlier body style until 1967, when declining sales forced a switch to CKD assembly using imported components the following year. In 1968, Volkswagen Australia released its own locally designed utilitarian version of the Type 1, the [[Volkswagen Country Buggy]] or Type 197.\n\nThe last Australian-assembled Beetle was produced in July 1976 with assembly of other models ending in February 1977.<ref name=clubvw>[http://www.clubvw.org.au/austvw001 Australian Volkswagens,www.clubvw.org.au] Retrieved 25 March 2018</ref> All Volkswagens for the Australian market have been fully imported since then.<ref name=clubvw/>\n\n=== South Africa ===\n\nThe Beetle was also produced in South Africa at the Uitenhage plant from 31 August 1951 to 1979.  Several features from the Super Beetle were grafted onto the South African Beetle 1600S, such as curved windshield, new dashboard, and larger taillights, while retaining the Beetle chassis and mechanicals. The 1600 model was introduced to South Africa in 1972; it was marketed as the cheapest 1.6-liter car available there. In late 1976, the sporty SP 1600 Beetle arrived \u2013 this version received bright red, yellow, or silver paint with black stripes, a front spoiler, wide tyres, and a more powerful engine with twin carburettors and a freer flowing exhaust.<ref name=SAM1276>{{cite journal | ref = SAM1276 | journal = SA Motor | title = New VWs reflect determinedly cheerful mood | pages = 31\u201332 | last = Howard | first = Tony | publisher = Scott Publications | location = Cape Town, South Africa | date = December 1976 }}</ref> The interior was also sporty, with red tartan upholstery, a small steering wheel, and lots of matte black.

It is even claimed that Porsche had visited Briggs automobiles one summer, when Tjaarda was head of R&D there, and several auto historians claim Porsche's People's Car was influenced by Tjaarda's designs, including the \"Sterkenburg series\" of the late twenties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.coachbuilt.com/des/t/tjaarda/tjaarda_john.htm|title=Coachbult.com - John Tjaarda van Sterkenburg|website=www.coachbuilt.com}}</ref>\n\n== Motorsport ==\n=== Drag racing ===\n\nThe Beetle has been modified for use in [[drag racing]];<ref>[http://www.aftenposten.no/webtv/Dragrace-i-folkevogn-7671021.html VW Beetle drag racing video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083815/http://www.aftenposten.no/webtv/Dragrace-i-folkevogn-7671021.html |date=19 August 2014 }} \u2013 in Norwegian</ref> its rearward ([[RR layout]]) weight distribution keeps the weight over the rear wheels, maximizing grip off the starting line. The car's weight is reduced for a full competition drag Beetle, further improving the grip and also the power-to-weight ratio. Combined with the Beetle's RR layout, [[wheelie]]s can be achieved easily, but time \"in the air\" worsens 1/4 mile time. To prevent this, \"wheelie bars\" were added. A notable version, campaigned in the USA was the EMPI Inch Pincher.\n\n=== Formula Vee ===\n\nThe Beetle is also used as the basis for the [[Formula Vee]] [[open-wheel]] racing category: specifically, the front suspension crossmember assembly (the [[shock absorber]] mounts are sometimes removed, depending on regulations in the class), and the engine and [[transaxle]] assembly (usually the earlier swing-axle type, not the later double-jointed axle).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formulavee.us/what_is_fv.htm |title=Formula Vee Specifications |publisher=Formulavee.us |date= |accessdate=2016-07-10}}</ref>\nIn original 1,200&nbsp;cc Formula Vee spec, upgrades to the cars would only be allowed sparsely, so that the wheels, tires and engines didn't differ very much from the original Beetle. At the end of the 1960s, Vee Beetle engine output on a single carburetor would reach up to 70 BHP; top speeds would gradually rise to nearly {{Convert|200|km/h|mi/h|0|abbr=on}}. In this configuration, FV would become one of the most popular entry-level motorsports classes of its time.\n\nLater on, double carbs and more extensive modification would be allowed, leading to the more powerful Super Vee class featuring wings for downforce and {{Convert|123|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} engines, which in the end had fairly little in common with the original VW Beetle. Around 2000, worldwide Vee racing had re-established itself as a 1,200/1,300&nbsp;cc beginner class with wingless cars and VW engines outputting about {{Convert|60|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, but incorporating more modern chassis and tyres.\n\n=== Uniroyal Fun Cup ===\n\nVolkswagen Beetle-style bodies are fitted to space frame racing chassis, and are used in the [[Uniroyal Fun Cup]], which includes the longest continuous motor-race in the world, the 25 Hours of Spa. It is an affordable entry-level series that gentleman drivers race.\n\n=== Rally and Rallycross ===\nEspecially the Austrian sole distributor Porsche Salzburg (now Porsche Austria) seriously entered the Volkswagen in local and European contests in the 1960s and early 1970s. Starting with the VW 1500, in the mid-1960s the peak of their racing performance was achieved with the VW 1302S and VW 1303S (known as the Salzburg Rally Beetle) from 1971 to 1973. The vehicles were entered in such famous races as TAP (Portugal), Austrian Alpine, Elba, Acropolis etc. Drivers were top performers such as [[Tony Fall]] (GB), Guenter Janger (AUT), [[Harry K\u00e4llstr\u00f6m]] (S), [[Achim Warmbold]] (D), Franz Wurz (A), etc. The engines were highly modified 1600s delivering {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}, later on mated to a Porsche 914 five-speed manual gearbox. Victories were achieved in 1973 on Elba for overall and class, Acropolis for class (5th overall), Austrian championship 1972, 1973 January Rallye for overall and class. Rally of 1000 minutes for overall 2nd (1st in class).\n\nThe fuel crisis, along with the arrival of the [[Volkswagen Golf]] (Rabbit), put an end to the days of unofficially supported rallying in 1974. All vehicles either used for training or actual racing were sold off to privateers, many kept racing with noticeable results until the early 1980s.\n\n=== Trans-Am Series ===\n\nBeetles were used in the [[Trans-Am Series]] for the two-litre class from 1966 to 1967 and again in 1972.\n\n===Armstrong 500===\nA Volkswagen won its class in the [[Armstrong 500]] in [[Australia]] in both [[1962 Armstrong 500|1962]] and [[1963 Armstrong 500|1963]].\n\n=== Baja 1000 ===\n[[File:Baja Bug.jpg|thumb|[[Baja Bug]]-style modified Beetle]]\nThe [[Baja 1000]] [[off-road racing|off-road race]] in the [[Baja California Peninsula]], Mexico includes specific vehicle classes for both standard Beetles and [[Baja Bug]]s.

The general concept is to take any Beetle, of any age or model from the 40s through to 1303s, and with minimal restrictions, allowing parts from various years to be interchanged, and of course the cars being prepared to the MSA safety requirements (cage, restraints, fire system etc.) Essentially the cars must be air-cooled Beetles (any age and parts can be swapped between years and models), with a 15-inch x 6-inch max wheel size with a control tyre. Engines must be based on a Type 1 case, with no electronic fuel injection or ignition and no forced induction, with an unlimited capacity. Other regulations apply.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beetlechallenge.com |title=Beetle Challenge |publisher=Beetle Challenge |accessdate=30 September 2010}}</ref>\n\n== Retrofit program ==\nVolkswagen has joined up with eClassics to allow beetle owners to convert their car to electric.\nThe battery will have a total capacity of 36.8 kWh, which should be good for around 200 kilometers of range.

He was originally a [[linotype machine|linotyper]] for the ''Daily Courier'' who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''. A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the ''Courier'' with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; Wayne is a former wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force and Scott is the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected by Psycho Pirate as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nWhile in Limbo, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who has merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world, although many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]]; Carlyle's heart fails him, however, and he dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\", where he is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Because of this control, Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman. Psycho-Pirate murders several Smallville citizens after using his powers to enhance their emotions, as Black Lanterns enjoy attacking the emotionally overwrought.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #2 (2009)</ref>\n\nConner attacks Superman and aids the Black Lantern [[Kal-L|Superman from Earth 2]], however the effect of the mask wears off and Conner once more regains his senses. Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Earth-2 Superman (Kal-L), causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. Psycho-Pirate managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. Hayden is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. Hayden, however, disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. Shift reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers, however, he is a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions onto people. Often it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest any DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' or any living character period. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths, levitation, draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own, projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he uses to attack, forming a psychic link with another person, projecting his mind over tremendous distances (essentially granting him omnipresence), deflecting psionic attacks, projecting bolts of psionic energy and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.

He was originally a [[linotype machine|linotyper]] for the ''Daily Courier'' who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''. A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the ''Courier'' with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; Wayne is a former wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force and Scott is the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected by Psycho Pirate as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nWhile in Limbo, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who has merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world, although many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]]; Carlyle's heart fails him, however, and he dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\", where he is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Because of this control, Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman. Psycho-Pirate murders several Smallville citizens after using his powers to enhance their emotions, as Black Lanterns enjoy attacking the emotionally overwrought.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #2 (2009)</ref>\n\nConner attacks Superman and aids the Black Lantern [[Kal-L|Superman from Earth 2]], however the effect of the mask wears off and Conner once more regains his senses. Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Earth-2 Superman (Kal-L), causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. Psycho-Pirate managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. Hayden is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. Hayden, however, disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. Shift reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers, however, he is a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions onto people. Often it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''; this power expands to any Multiverse character, including the still-living. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths, levitation, draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own, projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he uses to attack, forming a psychic link with another person, projecting his mind over tremendous distances (essentially granting him omnipresence), deflecting psionic attacks, projecting bolts of psionic energy and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.

Gillette|King Camp Gillette]] came up with the idea of a [[safety razor]] that used disposable blades. Safety razors at the time were essentially short pieces of a [[straight razor]] clamped to a holder. The blade had to be [[Razor strop|stropped]] before each shave and after a time needed to be [[Sharpening|honed]] by a cutler.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=5}} Gillette's invention was inspired by his mentor at [[Crown Holdings|Crown Cork & Seal Company]], [[William Painter (inventor)|William Painter]], who had invented the [[Crown cork]]. Painter encouraged Gillette to come up with something that, like the Crown cork, could be thrown away once used.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=7-8}}{{sfn|Gillette|1918}}\n\nWhile Gillette came up with the idea in 1895, developing the concept into a working model and drawings that could be submitted to the Patent Office took six years. Gillette had trouble finding anyone capable of developing a method to manufacture blades from thin [[Sheet metal|sheet steel]], but finally found William Emery Nickerson, an MIT graduate with a degree in chemistry. Gillette and other members of the project founded The American Safety Razor Company on September 28, 1901. The company had issues getting funding until Gillette's old friend John Joyce invested the necessary amount for the company to begin manufacturing.<ref name=\"smithsonian-blade\"/>{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=7-8}}{{sfn|Gillette|1918}} Production began slowly in 1903, but the following year Nickerson succeeded in building a new blade grinding machine that had bottlenecked production. During its first year of operation, the company had sold 51 razors and 168 blades, but the second year saw sales rise to 90,884 razors and 123,648 blades. The company was renamed to the Gillette Safety Razor Company in 1904 and it quickly began to expand outside the United States. In 1905 the company opened a sales office in London and a blade manufacturing plant in Paris, and by 1906 Gillette had a blade plant in Canada, a sales operation in Mexico, and a European distribution network that sold  in many nations, including Russia.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=7-8}}<ref>[https://books.google.fi/books?redir_esc=y&hl=fi&id=HZLtCQAAQBAJ&q=American+Safety+Razor+Company#v=snippet&q=American%20Safety%20Razor%20Company&f=false company renamed]</ref>\n\n=== First World War and the 1920s ===\n\nDue to its premium pricing strategy, the Gillette Safety Razor Company's razor and blade unit sales grew at a modest pace from 1908 to 1916. Disposable razor blades still weren't a true mass market product, and [[wikt:Special:Search/barbershop|barbershops]] and self-shaving with a straight razor were still popular methods of grooming. Among the general U.S. population, a two-day stubble was not uncommon. This changed once the United States declared war on the [[Central Powers]] in 1917; military regulations required every soldier provide their own shaving kit, and Gillette's compact kit with disposable blades outsold competitors whose razors required stropping. Gillette marketed their razor by designing a military-only case decorated with U.S. Army and Navy insignia and in 1917 the company sold 1.1 million razors.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=18-20}}\n[[File:Vintage Gillette Khaki U.S. Army Safety Razor Set, Model 102 Razor, Serial No. G504335, Made In USA For Use By Soldiers In World War I, Marked Property U.S. Army, Circa 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Khaki Set, the safety razor set produced by Gillette for the U.S. Army during the First World War<ref name=\"WWI-service-sets\">[https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1153449 Gillette U.S. Service Razor Set]</ref>]]\n\nIn 1918, the U.S. military began issuing Gillette shaving kits to every U.S. serviceman. Gillette's sales rose to 3.5 million razors and 32 million blades. As a consequence, millions of servicemen got accustomed to daily shaving using Gillette's razor. After the war, Gillette utilised this in their domestic marketing and used advertising to reinforce the habit acquired during the war.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=18-20}}\n\nGillette's original razor patent was due to expire in November 1921 and to stay ahead of upcoming competition, the company introduced the New Improved Gillette Safety Razor in spring 1921 and switched to the [[Razor and blades model|razor and blades pricing structure]]\u00a0the company is known for today. While the New Improved razor was sold for $5 ({{Inflation|US|5|1921|fmt=eq}}) \u2013\u00a0the selling price of the previous razor \u2013 the original razor was renamed to the Old Type and sold in inexpensive packaging as \"Brownies\" for $1 ({{Inflation|US|1|1921|fmt=eq}}). While some Old Type models were still sold in various kinds of packaging for an average price of $3.50, the Brownie razors made a Gillette much more affordable for the average person and expanded the company's blade market significantly. From 1917 to 1925, Gillette's unit sales increased tenfold. The company also expanded its overseas operations right after the war by opening a manufacturing plant in [[Slough]], near London, to build New Improved razors, and setting up dozens of offices and subsidiaries in Europe and other parts of the world.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=20-21}}\n\nGillette experienced a setback at the end of the 1920s as its competitor AutoStrop sued for patent infringement. The case was settled out of court with Gillette agreeing to buy out AutoStrop for 310,000 [[Non-voting stock|non-voting shares]]. However, before the deal went through, it was revealed in an audit that Gillette had been overstating its sales and profits by $12 million over a five-year period and giving bonuses to its executives based on these numbers. AutoStrop still agreed to the buyout but instead demanded a large amount of [[preferred stock]] with voting rights. The merger was announced on October 16, 1930, and gave AutoStrop's owner [[Henry Jacques Gaisman|Henry Gaisman]] controlling interest in Gillette.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=29-30}}\n\n=== 1930s and the Second World War ===\n[[File:1930's Gillette Razor and Packaging rightcrop.png|thumb|upright=1.1|A 1930s Gillette One-Piece Tech razor and a pack of Blue Blades]]\n[[Great Depression|The Great Depression]]\u00a0weakened Gillette's position in the market significantly. The company had fallen behind its competitors in blade manufacturing technology in the 1920s and had let [[quality control]] slip while over-stretching its production equipment in order to hurry a new Kroman razor and blade to market in 1930. In 1932, Gillette apologized for the reduction in blade quality, withdrew the Kroman blade, and introduced the Blue Blade (initially called the Blue Super Blade) as its replacement.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=29-33}} Other Gillette introductions during the Depression years were the Brushless Shaving Cream and an electric shaver that was soon discontinued due to modest sales.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=34}}\n\nIn 1938 Gillette introduced the Thin Blade, which was cheaper and about half the weight of the Blue Blade, even though it cost almost as much to manufacture. The Thin Blade became more popular than the Blue Blade for several years during the Second World War due to high demand of low-cost products and the shortage of carbon steel.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=35}} Beginning in 1939, Gillette began investing significant amounts on advertising in sports events after its advertising in the [[World Series]]\u00a0increased sales more than double the company had expected.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=36-39}}\n\nThough competition hit Gillette hard in the domestic market during the Great Depression, overseas operations helped keep the company afloat. In 1935 more than half of Gillette's earnings came from foreign operations and in 1938 \u2013\u00a0the worst of the Depression years for Gillette, with a mere 18 percent market share \u2013\u00a0nearly all of the company's $2.9 million earnings came from outside the U.S. AutoStrop's Brazilian factory allowed Gillette to start expanding into the Latin America, in England the Gillette and AutoStrop operations were combined under the Gillette name, and the company built a new blade manufacturing plant in London. In 1937, Gillette's Berlin factory produced 40 percent of Germany's 900 million blades and retained a 65 to 75 percent share of the German blade market.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=34-35}}\n\nThe Second World War reduced Gillette's blade production both domestically and internationally. As a result of the war, many markets were closed off, German and Japanese forces expropriated the company's plants and property, and Gillette's plants in Boston and London were partially converted for weapons production. In 1942 the [[War Production Board]]\u00a0ordered Gillette to dedicate its entire razor production and most blade production to the U.S. military. By the end of the war, servicemen had been issued 12.5 million razors and 1.5 billion blades. Gillette also assisted the U.S. army in military intelligence by producing copies of German razor blades for secret agents venturing behind German lines so that their identities wouldn't be compromised by their shaving equipment. The company also manufactured razors that concealed money and escape maps in their handles, and magnetic double-edge blades that [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] could use as a compass.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=39-40}}\n\n=== Recovery from the war and diversification ===\n\nDuring the post-war years, Gillette began to quickly ramp up production by modernizing its major manufacturing plants in the United States and England, expanding the capacity of several foreign plants, and re-opening plants closed during the war. The company opened a new plant in Switzerland and began manufacturing blades in Mexico City. Sales rose to $50 million in 1946 and in 1947 Gillette sold a billion blades. By 1950, Gillette's share of the U.S. blade market had climbed to 50 percent.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=40-45}} During the 1950s, the company updated and in some cases moved some of its older European factories: the Paris factory, for example, was moved to [[Annecy]].{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=61}}\n[[File:Vintage Gillette Red Tip Super Speed DE Safety Razor, Twist-To-Open, Made In USA, Date Code D-1 (1958) (30521266125).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A 1958 Gillette Super Speed razor and a blade dispenser]]\nIn 1947 Gillette introduced the Gillette Super Speed razor and along with it the Speed-pak blade dispenser the company had developed during the war. The dispenser allowed the blade to be slid out of the dispenser into the razor without danger of touching the sharp edge. It also had a compartment for holding used blades.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=44-45}}{{sfn|Waits|2014|p=466}}\n\nIn 1948 Gillette bought the home [[Perm (hairstyle)|permanent]] kit manufacturer The Toni Company{{sfn|McKibben|1998|loc=The legend of the \"Which twin has the Toni?\" advert between pages 52 and 53}} and later expanded into other feminine products such as shampoos and hair sprays.

The company began TV advertising in 1944 and in 1950 it spent $6 million to acquire exclusive sponsorship rights to the World Series for six years. By the mid-1950s, 85 percent of Gillette's advertising budget was used for television advertising. The company also advertised the Toni product line by sponsoring the TV show [[Arthur Godfrey and His Friends]] and the 1958 [[Miss America]] contest and its winner.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=49-52}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150520022102/http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/gillette/98674/ Gillette Co.]</ref>\n[[File:Gillette Ad How Are Ya Fixed For Blades.webm|left|thumb|upright=1.1|1950s TV commercial for Gillette's Blue Blades]]\nAlthough Gillette's immediate priority after the war was satisfying U.S. demand and later diversifying its domestic business, the company pursued expansion in foreign markets that showed potential for growth, such as Latin America and Asia. However, the [[Cold War]] restricted Gillette's operations in many parts of the world and closed entire markets the company would've otherwise entered in Russia, China, Eastern Europe, Near East, Cuba, and parts of Asia. More and more countries demanded local ownership for foreign enterprise in exchange for continued operation or entry into their markets. Outside the U.S. and European markets, Gillette spent time and money building manufacturing facilities and distribution networks in anticipation that the markets would eventually be opened up and nationalistic restrictions lifted. Some of Gillette's joint ventures included a 40 percent Gillette 60 percent Malaysian mini-plant operation that began production in 1970, and an Iranian manufacturing plant with 51 percent government ownership. The Iran plant was one of Gillette's largest and most modern factories until the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 when [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] rose into power and American businesses were targeted as enemies of the new government, forcing Gillette to abandon the operation and withdraw from the country.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=61-66}}\n\n=== Super Blue and the Wilkinson shock ===\n\nIn 1960, Gillette introduced the Super Blue blade, the company's first coated blade and the first significantly improved razor blade since the Blue Blade of the 1930s. The new blade was coated with silicone and in Gillette's laboratory testing produced much more comfortable and close shaves by reducing the blade's adhesion to whiskers. Super Blue was a success and sold more than the Blue Blade and Thin Blade combined. By the end of 1961, Gillette's double edge blade market share had risen to 90 percent and the company held a total razor blade market share of 70 percent.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=53-54}}\n\nIn 1962, roughly two years after the introduction of the Super Blue blade, [[Wilkinson Sword]] introduced the world's first razor blade made from [[stainless steel]]. According to users, the blade stayed sharp about three times longer than the best carbon steel blades \u2013\u00a0including Gillette's. Wilkinson's introduction took Gillette by surprise and the company struggled to respond as its smaller rivals, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and the [[American Safety Razor Company]], came out with their own stainless steel blade. However, during the development of the silicon coating for the Super Blue blade, Gillette had also discovered the method of producing coated stainless steel blades that Wilkinson Sword was using and managed to patent it before Wilkinson did. The English company was forced to pay royalty to Gillette for each blade it sold.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=56-58}}\n\nGillette hesitated in bringing its own stainless steel blades to market as Super Blue had been a huge success and replacing it with a longer-lasting blade would've reduced profits. The company eventually brought the Gillette Stainless blade to the market in August 1963, about a year after Wilkinson's stainless blades. As a result of the affair, Gillette's share of the double-edge blade market dropped from 90 percent to about 70 percent.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=56-58}}\n\nTwo years after the introduction of the Gillette Stainless blades, the company brought out the Super Stainless blades \u2013 known in Europe as Super Silver \u2013\u00a0that were made from an improved steel alloy. Gillette also introduced the Techmatic, a new type of razor that used a continuous spool of stainless blade housed in a plastic cartridge.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=58}}{{sfn|Waits|2014|p=468}}\n\nThe success of the coated Super Blue blades marked the start of a period when chemistry became as important metallurgy in Gillette's blade manufacturing. The Super Blue's coating was a result of teamwork between the Gillette's British and American scientists.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=53}} As a result of the Wilkinson ordeal, Gillette's then-chairman Carl Gilbert increased the company's spending on research and development facilities in the U.S., championed the building of a research facility in [[Rockville, Maryland]], and encouraged further expansion of R&D activities in England.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Trac II: The move to cartridge razors ===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 260\n| image1 = Gillette Atra patent illustration.png\n| image2 = Vintage Gillette Deluxe Trac II Razor, Circa 1972 (14571948670).jpg\n| footer = Patent drawing of the abandoned Atra razor and a picture of a Deluxe model Trac II razor\n}}\nThe development of Gillette's first twin-blade razor began in early 1964 in the company's Reading laboratories in England when a new employee Norman C. Welsh experimented with tandem blades and discovered what he called the \"hysteresis effect\"; a blade pulling the whisker out of the hair follicle before cutting it, and enabling a second blade cut the whisker even shorter before it retracted back into the follicle. For six years afterwards, Welsh and his colleagues worked on a means of utilizing the hysterisis effect, almost exclusively concentrating on what would later be known as the Atra twin-blade system. The Atra razor featured two blades set in a plastic cartridge with edges that faced each other. Using the razor required the user to move it in an up-and-down scrubbing motion, and whiskers were cut on both the up and down strokes. Another twin-blade system with blades set in tandem, codenamed \"Rex\", also existed, but it had too many technical problems and was behind Atra in development.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=67-68}}\n\nIn consumer tests, the Atra razor had outperformed existing razor systems, but Gillette's marketing executives feared the razor would meet resistance among shavers due to the unfamiliar scrubbing motion required to use it. Even though the Atra project was so far along in mid-1970 that packaging and production machinery was nearly ready for a full market introduction, Gillette decided to start a development drive to finish Rex instead as it didn't require learning a new way to shave. The project succeeded, Atra was abandoned, and Gillette announced the first twin-blade razor \u2013\u00a0now renamed to Trac II \u2013\u00a0in fall of 1971. The Trac II captured the premium shaving market and came out in time to counter Wilkinson Sword's Bonded Blade system that utilised single-blade cartridges.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=67-69}}\n\n=== The challenge of disposables ===\n\nIn 1974, the French [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bic]] introduced the world's first [[Razor#Disposable safety razors|disposable razor]]. The razor was first brought to market in Greece, where it sold well, after which it was introduced to Italy and many other European countries. Gillette hurried to develop their own disposable before Bic could bring their razor to the United States. Gillette designed a single-blade razor similar to Bic's but soon abandoned the concept in favor of a razor that was essentially a Trac II cartridge molded into a blue plastic handle. Gillette introduced this disposable as the Good News in 1976, about a year before Bic's razor reached the United States, and managed to establish market leadership once Bic and other competitors came to market. Good News was released under various names in Europe and was equally and sometimes even more successful than Bic's razor. Gillette quickly brought its razor to markets Bic hadn't yet reached, such as Latin America where the razor was known as Prestobarba.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=97-98}}\n\nIn Latin America, Gillette used a so-called [[Cannibalization (marketing)|cannibalization strategy]]\u00a0by selling the razor in several [[Market segmentation|market segments]]: along with the heavily advertised Prestobarba, the razor was also sold under different names \u2013\u00a0such as Permasharp in Mexico and Probak in Brazil \u2013\u00a0and sold for at least 10 to 15 percent less. The less expensive variants were differentiated from the blue Prestobarba by manufacturing them from yellow plastic, and in addition they weren't advertised. The strategy was successful and later market arrivals were unable to gain a major foothold. Once the approach proved to be a successful one, Gillette's subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and multiple Asian and Near Eastern markets began utilising the same strategy.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=336-337}}\n\nWhile Gillette managed to retain market leadership against Bic and other competitors, the popularity of disposable razors, their higher production cost compared to cartridges, and price competition eroded the company's profits. Gillette had at first hoped that disposables would take no more than 10 percent of the total razor and blades market, but by 1980, disposables accounted for more than 27 percent of the world shaving market in terms of unit sales, and 22 percent of total revenue.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=98-99}}<ref>[https://www.casrilanka.com/casl/images/stories/EDBA/03%20gillette%20and%20the%20mengcos%20wet%20shaving%20market%20%20business%20case%20%20team%2003%202018.pdf Gillette and the men's wet-shaving market], page 2</ref> John W. Symons began steering Gillette into a different direction after becoming the director of Gillette's European Sales Group in 1979. Despite Gillette's strong sales and large share of the European razor and blades market \u2013\u00a070 percent, which was higher than in the United States \u2013\u00a0cash flow was declining. In Symons's view, the issue was Gillette's attempt to compete with Bic in the disposables market, which was eating into the sales of its more profitable cartridge razors. Symons reduced the marketing budget of disposables in Europe and hired the advertising agency [[BBDO]]'s London branch to create an ad campaign to make Gillette's blade and razor systems \u2013 such as Contour\u00a0\u2013 more desirable in the eyes of men. The new marketing strategy, combined with cutting costs and centralizing production increased profits. In 1985, Gillette's profits in the European market were $96 million, while two years previously they were $77 million.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=114-117}}\n\n[[File:Gillette old.png|thumb|The logo of Gillette used from 1989 to 2008.]]\nIn 1980, Gillette introduced Atra \u2013 known in Europe as Contour\u00a0\u2013 a twin-blade razor with a pivoting head. The razor became a best-seller in the United States during its first year and eventually became a market leader in Europe.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=96}}\n\n== Product history ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Double-edged safety razors ===\n[[File:1930's Gillette Razor and Packaging.tif|thumb|Gillette razor and packaging, circa 1930s]]\nThe first [[safety razor]] using the new [[disposable]] blade went on sale in 1903.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gillette maintained a limited range of models of this new type razor until 1921 when the original Gillette patent expired.<ref name=\":1\" /> In anticipation of the event, Gillette introduced a redesigned razor and offered it at a variety of prices in different cases and finishes, including the long running \u201caristocrat\". Gillette continued to sell the original razor but instead of pricing it at $5, it was priced at $1, making a Gillette razor truly affordable to every man regardless of economic class. In 1932 the Gillette Blue Blade, so-named because it was dipped in blue lacquer, was introduced. It became one of the most recognizable blades in the world. In 1934 the \"twist to open\" (TTO) design was instituted, which featured butterfly-like doors that made blade changing much easier than it had been, wherein the razor head had to be detached from the handle.\n\nRazor handles continued to advance to allow consumer to achieve a closer shave. In 1947, the new (TTO) model, the ''\"Super Speed\"'', was introduced. This was updated in 1955, with different versions being produced to shave more closely \u2014 the degree of closeness being marked by the color of the handle tip.\n\nIn 1955, the first ''adjustable'' razor was produced. This allowed for an adjustment of the blade to increase the closeness of the shave. The model, in various versions, remained in production until 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vintage Gillette Adjustable Double Edge Razors|url=http://www.gilletteadjustable.com|publisher=GilletteAdjustable.com|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>[[File:Vintage Gillette Safety Razor, Old Type Set, Made In USA, Circa 1920s (19844414006).jpg|thumb|\"Old type\" Gillette safety razor, made between 1921 and 1928]]\n\nThe Super Speed razor was again redesigned in 1966 and given a black resin coated metal handle. It remained in production until 1988. A companion model  the,''\"Knack\"'', with a longer plastic handle, was produced from 1966 to 1975. In Europe, the Knack was sold as \"Slim Twist\" and \"G2000\" from 1978 to 1988, a later version known as \"G1000\" was made in England and available until 1998.

Gillette|King Camp Gillette]] came up with the idea of a [[safety razor]] that used disposable blades. Safety razors at the time were essentially short pieces of a [[straight razor]] clamped to a holder. The blade had to be [[Razor strop|stropped]] before each shave and after a time needed to be [[Sharpening|honed]] by a cutler.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=5}} Gillette's invention was inspired by his mentor at [[Crown Holdings|Crown Cork & Seal Company]], [[William Painter (inventor)|William Painter]], who had invented the [[Crown cork]]. Painter encouraged Gillette to come up with something that, like the Crown cork, could be thrown away once used.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=7-8}}{{sfn|Gillette|1918}}\n\nWhile Gillette came up with the idea in 1895, developing the concept into a working model and drawings that could be submitted to the Patent Office took six years. Gillette had trouble finding anyone capable of developing a method to manufacture blades from thin [[Sheet metal|sheet steel]], but finally found William Emery Nickerson, an MIT graduate with a degree in chemistry. Gillette and other members of the project founded The American Safety Razor Company on September 28, 1901. The company had issues getting funding until Gillette's old friend John Joyce invested the necessary amount for the company to begin manufacturing.<ref name=\"smithsonian-blade\"/>{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=7-8}}{{sfn|Gillette|1918}} Production began slowly in 1903, but the following year Nickerson succeeded in building a new blade grinding machine that had bottlenecked production. During its first year of operation, the company had sold 51 razors and 168 blades, but the second year saw sales rise to 90,884 razors and 123,648 blades. The company was renamed to the Gillette Safety Razor Company in 1904 and it quickly began to expand outside the United States. In 1905 the company opened a sales office in London and a blade manufacturing plant in Paris, and by 1906 Gillette had a blade plant in Canada, a sales operation in Mexico, and a European distribution network that sold  in many nations, including Russia.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=7-8}}<ref>[https://books.google.fi/books?redir_esc=y&hl=fi&id=HZLtCQAAQBAJ&q=American+Safety+Razor+Company#v=snippet&q=American%20Safety%20Razor%20Company&f=false company renamed]</ref>\n\n=== First World War and the 1920s ===\n\nDue to its premium pricing strategy, the Gillette Safety Razor Company's razor and blade unit sales grew at a modest pace from 1908 to 1916. Disposable razor blades still weren't a true mass market product, and [[wikt:Special:Search/barbershop|barbershops]] and self-shaving with a straight razor were still popular methods of grooming. Among the general U.S. population, a two-day stubble was not uncommon. This changed once the United States declared war on the [[Central Powers]] in 1917; military regulations required every soldier provide their own shaving kit, and Gillette's compact kit with disposable blades outsold competitors whose razors required stropping. Gillette marketed their razor by designing a military-only case decorated with U.S. Army and Navy insignia and in 1917 the company sold 1.1 million razors.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=18-20}}\n[[File:Vintage Gillette Khaki U.S. Army Safety Razor Set, Model 102 Razor, Serial No. G504335, Made In USA For Use By Soldiers In World War I, Marked Property U.S. Army, Circa 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The Khaki Set, the safety razor set produced by Gillette for the U.S. Army during the First World War<ref name=\"WWI-service-sets\">[https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_1153449 Gillette U.S. Service Razor Set]</ref>]]\n\nIn 1918, the U.S. military began issuing Gillette shaving kits to every U.S. serviceman. Gillette's sales rose to 3.5 million razors and 32 million blades. As a consequence, millions of servicemen got accustomed to daily shaving using Gillette's razor. After the war, Gillette utilised this in their domestic marketing and used advertising to reinforce the habit acquired during the war.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=18-20}}\n\nGillette's original razor patent was due to expire in November 1921 and to stay ahead of upcoming competition, the company introduced the New Improved Gillette Safety Razor in spring 1921 and switched to the [[Razor and blades model|razor and blades pricing structure]]\u00a0the company is known for today. While the New Improved razor was sold for $5 ({{Inflation|US|5|1921|fmt=eq}}) \u2013\u00a0the selling price of the previous razor \u2013 the original razor was renamed to the Old Type and sold in inexpensive packaging as \"Brownies\" for $1 ({{Inflation|US|1|1921|fmt=eq}}). While some Old Type models were still sold in various kinds of packaging for an average price of $3.50, the Brownie razors made a Gillette much more affordable for the average person and expanded the company's blade market significantly. From 1917 to 1925, Gillette's unit sales increased tenfold. The company also expanded its overseas operations right after the war by opening a manufacturing plant in [[Slough]], near London, to build New Improved razors, and setting up dozens of offices and subsidiaries in Europe and other parts of the world.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=20-21}}\n\nGillette experienced a setback at the end of the 1920s as its competitor AutoStrop sued for patent infringement. The case was settled out of court with Gillette agreeing to buy out AutoStrop for 310,000 [[Non-voting stock|non-voting shares]]. However, before the deal went through, it was revealed in an audit that Gillette had been overstating its sales and profits by $12 million over a five-year period and giving bonuses to its executives based on these numbers. AutoStrop still agreed to the buyout but instead demanded a large amount of [[preferred stock]] with voting rights. The merger was announced on October 16, 1930, and gave AutoStrop's owner [[Henry Jacques Gaisman|Henry Gaisman]] controlling interest in Gillette.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=29-30}}\n\n=== 1930s and the Second World War ===\n[[File:1930's Gillette Razor and Packaging rightcrop.png|thumb|upright=1.1|A 1930s Gillette One-Piece Tech razor and a pack of Blue Blades]]\n[[Great Depression|The Great Depression]]\u00a0weakened Gillette's position in the market significantly. The company had fallen behind its competitors in blade manufacturing technology in the 1920s and had let [[quality control]] slip while over-stretching its production equipment in order to hurry a new Kroman razor and blade to market in 1930. In 1932, Gillette apologized for the reduction in blade quality, withdrew the Kroman blade, and introduced the Blue Blade (initially called the Blue Super Blade) as its replacement.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=29-33}} Other Gillette introductions during the Depression years were the Brushless Shaving Cream and an electric shaver that was soon discontinued due to modest sales.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=34}}\n\nIn 1938 Gillette introduced the Thin Blade, which was cheaper and about half the weight of the Blue Blade, even though it cost almost as much to manufacture. The Thin Blade became more popular than the Blue Blade for several years during the Second World War due to high demand of low-cost products and the shortage of carbon steel.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=35}} Beginning in 1939, Gillette began investing significant amounts on advertising in sports events after its advertising in the [[World Series]]\u00a0increased sales more than double the company had expected.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=36-39}}\n\nThough competition hit Gillette hard in the domestic market during the Great Depression, overseas operations helped keep the company afloat. In 1935 more than half of Gillette's earnings came from foreign operations and in 1938 \u2013\u00a0the worst of the Depression years for Gillette, with a mere 18 percent market share \u2013\u00a0nearly all of the company's $2.9 million earnings came from outside the U.S. AutoStrop's Brazilian factory allowed Gillette to start expanding into the Latin America, in England the Gillette and AutoStrop operations were combined under the Gillette name, and the company built a new blade manufacturing plant in London. In 1937, Gillette's Berlin factory produced 40 percent of Germany's 900 million blades and retained a 65 to 75 percent share of the German blade market.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=34-35}}\n\nThe Second World War reduced Gillette's blade production both domestically and internationally. As a result of the war, many markets were closed off, German and Japanese forces expropriated the company's plants and property, and Gillette's plants in Boston and London were partially converted for weapons production. In 1942 the [[War Production Board]]\u00a0ordered Gillette to dedicate its entire razor production and most blade production to the U.S. military. By the end of the war, servicemen had been issued 12.5 million razors and 1.5 billion blades. Gillette also assisted the U.S. army in military intelligence by producing copies of German razor blades for secret agents venturing behind German lines so that their identities wouldn't be compromised by their shaving equipment. The company also manufactured razors that concealed money and escape maps in their handles, and magnetic double-edge blades that [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] could use as a compass.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=39-40}}\n\n=== Recovery from the war and diversification ===\n\nDuring the post-war years, Gillette began to quickly ramp up production by modernizing its major manufacturing plants in the United States and England, expanding the capacity of several foreign plants, and re-opening plants closed during the war. The company opened a new plant in Switzerland and began manufacturing blades in Mexico City. Sales rose to $50 million in 1946 and in 1947 Gillette sold a billion blades. By 1950, Gillette's share of the U.S. blade market had climbed to 50 percent.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=40-45}} During the 1950s, the company updated and in some cases moved some of its older European factories: the Paris factory, for example, was moved to [[Annecy]].{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=61}}\n[[File:Vintage Gillette Red Tip Super Speed DE Safety Razor, Twist-To-Open, Made In USA, Date Code D-1 (1958) (30521266125).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A 1958 Gillette Super Speed razor and a blade dispenser]]\nIn 1947 Gillette introduced the Gillette Super Speed razor and along with it the Speed-pak blade dispenser the company had developed during the war. The dispenser allowed the blade to be slid out of the dispenser into the razor without danger of touching the sharp edge. It also had a compartment for holding used blades.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=44-45}}{{sfn|Waits|2014|p=466}}\n\nIn 1948 Gillette bought the home [[Perm (hairstyle)|permanent]] kit manufacturer The Toni Company{{sfn|McKibben|1998|loc=The legend of the \"Which twin has the Toni?\" advert between pages 52 and 53}} and later expanded into other feminine products such as shampoos and hair sprays.

The company began TV advertising in 1944 and in 1950 it spent $6 million to acquire exclusive sponsorship rights to the World Series for six years. By the mid-1950s, 85 percent of Gillette's advertising budget was used for television advertising. The company also advertised the Toni product line by sponsoring the TV show [[Arthur Godfrey and His Friends]] and the 1958 [[Miss America]] contest and its winner.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=49-52}}<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150520022102/http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/gillette/98674/ Gillette Co.]</ref>\n[[File:Gillette Ad How Are Ya Fixed For Blades.webm|left|thumb|upright=1.1|1950s TV commercial for Gillette's Blue Blades]]\nAlthough Gillette's immediate priority after the war was satisfying U.S. demand and later diversifying its domestic business, the company pursued expansion in foreign markets that showed potential for growth, such as Latin America and Asia. However, the [[Cold War]] restricted Gillette's operations in many parts of the world and closed entire markets the company would've otherwise entered in Russia, China, Eastern Europe, Near East, Cuba, and parts of Asia. More and more countries demanded local ownership for foreign enterprise in exchange for continued operation or entry into their markets. Outside the U.S. and European markets, Gillette spent time and money building manufacturing facilities and distribution networks in anticipation that the markets would eventually be opened up and nationalistic restrictions lifted. Some of Gillette's joint ventures included a 40 percent Gillette 60 percent Malaysian mini-plant operation that began production in 1970, and an Iranian manufacturing plant with 51 percent government ownership. The Iran plant was one of Gillette's largest and most modern factories until the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 when [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] rose into power and American businesses were targeted as enemies of the new government, forcing Gillette to abandon the operation and withdraw from the country.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=61-66}}\n\n=== Super Blue and the Wilkinson shock ===\n\nIn 1960, Gillette introduced the Super Blue blade, the company's first coated blade and the first significantly improved razor blade since the Blue Blade of the 1930s. The new blade was coated with silicone and in Gillette's laboratory testing produced much more comfortable and close shaves by reducing the blade's adhesion to whiskers. Super Blue was a success and sold more than the Blue Blade and Thin Blade combined. By the end of 1961, Gillette's double edge blade market share had rise to 90 percent and the company held a total razor blade market share of 70 percent.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=53-54}}\n\nIn 1962, roughly two years after the introduction of the Super Blue blade, [[Wilkinson Sword]] introduced the world's first razor blade made from [[stainless steel]]. According to users, the blade stayed sharp about three times longer than the best carbon steel blades \u2013\u00a0including Gillette's. Wilkinson's introduction took Gillette by surprise and the company struggled to respond as its smaller rivals, [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] and the [[American Safety Razor Company]], came out with their own stainless steel blade. However, during the development of the silicon coating for the Super Blue blade, Gillette had also discovered the method of producing coated stainless steel blades that Wilkinson Sword was using and managed to patent it before Wilkinson did. The English company was forced to pay royalty to Gillette for each blade it sold.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=56-58}}\n\nGillette hesitated in bringing its own stainless steel blades to market as Super Blue had been a huge success and replacing it with a longer-lasting blade would've reduced profits. The company eventually brought the Gillette Stainless blade to the market in August 1963, about a year after Wilkinson's stainless blades. As a result of the affair, Gillette's share of the double-edge blade market dropped from 90 percent to about 70 percent.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=56-58}}\n\nTwo years after the introduction of the Gillette Stainless blades, the company brought out the Super Stainless blades \u2013 known in Europe as Super Silver \u2013\u00a0that were made from an improved steel alloy. Gillette also introduced the Techmatic, a new type of razor that used a continuous spool of stainless blade housed in a plastic cartridge.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=58}}{{sfn|Waits|2014|p=468}}\n\nThe success of the coated Super Blue blades marked the start of a period when chemistry became as important metallurgy in Gillette's blade manufacturing. The Super Blue's coating was a result of teamwork between the Gillette's British and American scientists.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=53}} As a result of the Wilkinson ordeal, Gillette's then-chairman Carl Gilbert increased the company's spending on research and development facilities in the U.S., championed the building of a research facility in [[Rockville, Maryland]], and encouraged further expansion of R&D activities in England.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=59}}\n\n=== Trac II: The move to cartridge razors ===\n{{multiple image\n| direction = vertical\n| total_width = 260\n| image1 = Gillette Atra patent illustration.png\n| image2 = Vintage Gillette Deluxe Trac II Razor, Circa 1972 (14571948670).jpg\n| footer = Patent drawing of the abandoned Atra razor and a picture of a Deluxe model Trac II razor\n}}\nThe development of Gillette's first twin-blade razor began in early 1964 in the company's Reading laboratories in England when a new employee Norman C. Welsh experimented with tandem blades and discovered what he called the \"hysteresis effect\"; a blade pulling the whisker out of the hair follicle before cutting it, and enabling a second blade cut the whisker even shorter before it retracted back into the follicle. For six years afterwards, Welsh and his colleagues worked on a means of utilizing the hysterisis effect, almost exclusively concentrating on what would later be known as the Atra twin-blade system. The Atra razor featured two blades set in a plastic cartridge with edges that faced each other. Using the razor required the user to move it in an up-and-down scrubbing motion, and whiskers were cut on both the up and down strokes. Another twin-blade system with blades set in tandem, codenamed \"Rex\", also existed, but it had too many technical problems and was behind Atra in development.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=67-68}}\n\nIn consumer tests, the Atra razor had outperformed existing razor systems, but Gillette's marketing executives feared the razor would meet resistance among shavers due to the unfamiliar scrubbing motion required to use it. Even though the Atra project was so far along in mid-1970 that packaging and production machinery was nearly ready for a full market introduction, Gillette decided to start a development drive to finish Rex instead as it didn't require learning a new way to shave. The project succeeded, Atra was abandoned, and Gillette announced the first twin-blade razor \u2013\u00a0now renamed to Trac II \u2013\u00a0in fall of 1971. The Trac II captured the premium shaving market and came out in time to counter Wilkinson Sword's Bonded Blade system that utilised single-blade cartridges.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=67-69}}\n\n=== The challenge of disposables ===\n\nIn 1974, the French [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Bic]] introduced the world's first [[Razor#Disposable safety razors|disposable razor]]. The razor was first brought to market in Greece, where it sold well, after which it was introduced to Italy and many other European countries. Gillette hurried to develop their own disposable before Bic could bring their razor to the United States. Gillette designed a single-blade razor similar to Bic's but soon abandoned the concept in favor of a razor that was essentially a Trac II cartridge molded into a blue plastic handle. Gillette introduced this disposable as the Good News in 1976, about a year before Bic's razor reached the United States, and managed to establish market leadership once Bic and other competitors came to market. Good News was released under various names in Europe and was equally and sometimes even more successful than Bic's razor. Gillette quickly brought its razor to markets Bic hadn't yet reached, such as Latin America where the razor was known as Prestobarba.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=97-98}}\n\nIn Latin America, Gillette used a so-called [[Cannibalization (marketing)|cannibalization strategy]]\u00a0by selling the razor in several [[Market segmentation|market segments]]: along with the heavily advertised Prestobarba, the razor was also sold under different names \u2013\u00a0such as Permasharp in Mexico and Probak in Brazil \u2013\u00a0and sold for at least 10 to 15 percent less. The less expensive variants were differentiated from the blue Prestobarba by manufacturing them from yellow plastic, and in addition they weren't advertised. The strategy was successful and later market arrivals were unable to gain a major foothold. Once the approach proved to be a successful one, Gillette's subsidiaries in Russia, Poland, and multiple Asian and Near Eastern markets began utilising the same strategy.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=336-337}}\n\nWhile Gillette managed to retain market leadership against Bic and other competitors, the popularity of disposable razors, their higher production cost compared to cartridges, and price competition eroded the company's profits. Gillette had at first hoped that disposables would take no more than 10 percent of the total razor and blades market, but by 1980, disposables accounted for more than 27 percent of the world shaving market in terms of unit sales, and 22 percent of total revenue.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=98-99}}<ref>[https://www.casrilanka.com/casl/images/stories/EDBA/03%20gillette%20and%20the%20mengcos%20wet%20shaving%20market%20%20business%20case%20%20team%2003%202018.pdf Gillette and the men's wet-shaving market], page 2</ref> John W. Symons began steering Gillette into a different direction after becoming the director of Gillette's European Sales Group in 1979. Despite Gillette's strong sales and large share of the European razor and blades market \u2013\u00a070 percent, which was higher than in the United States \u2013\u00a0cash flow was declining. In Symons's view, the issue was Gillette's attempt to compete with Bic in the disposables market, which was eating into the sales of its more profitable cartridge razors. Symons reduced the marketing budget of disposables in Europe and hired the advertising agency [[BBDO]]'s London branch to create an ad campaign to make Gillette's blade and razor systems \u2013 such as Contour\u00a0\u2013 more desirable in the eyes of men. The new marketing strategy, combined with cutting costs and centralizing production increased profits. In 1985, Gillette's profits in the European market were $96 million, while two years previously they were $77 million.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=114-117}}\n\n[[File:Gillette old.png|thumb|The logo of Gillette used from 1989 to 2008.]]\nIn 1980, Gillette introduced Atra \u2013 known in Europe as Contour\u00a0\u2013 a twin-blade razor with a pivoting head. The razor became a best-seller in the United States during its first year and eventually became a market leader in Europe.{{sfn|McKibben|1998|p=96}}\n\n== Product history ==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2017}}\n\n=== Double-edged safety razors ===\n[[File:1930's Gillette Razor and Packaging.tif|thumb|Gillette razor and packaging, circa 1930s]]\nThe first [[safety razor]] using the new [[disposable]] blade went on sale in 1903.<ref name=\":0\" /> Gillette maintained a limited range of models of this new type razor until 1921 when the original Gillette patent expired.<ref name=\":1\" /> In anticipation of the event, Gillette introduced a redesigned razor and offered it at a variety of prices in different cases and finishes, including the long running \u201caristocrat\". Gillette continued to sell the original razor but instead of pricing it at $5, it was priced at $1, making a Gillette razor truly affordable to every man regardless of economic class. In 1932 the Gillette Blue Blade, so-named because it was dipped in blue lacquer, was introduced. It became one of the most recognizable blades in the world. In 1934 the \"twist to open\" (TTO) design was instituted, which featured butterfly-like doors that made blade changing much easier than it had been, wherein the razor head had to be detached from the handle.\n\nRazor handles continued to advance to allow consumer to achieve a closer shave. In 1947, the new (TTO) model, the ''\"Super Speed\"'', was introduced. This was updated in 1955, with different versions being produced to shave more closely \u2014 the degree of closeness being marked by the color of the handle tip.\n\nIn 1955, the first ''adjustable'' razor was produced. This allowed for an adjustment of the blade to increase the closeness of the shave. The model, in various versions, remained in production until 1988.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vintage Gillette Adjustable Double Edge Razors|url=http://www.gilletteadjustable.com|publisher=GilletteAdjustable.com|accessdate=12 March 2017}}</ref>[[File:Vintage Gillette Safety Razor, Old Type Set, Made In USA, Circa 1920s (19844414006).jpg|thumb|\"Old type\" Gillette safety razor, made between 1921 and 1928]]\n\nThe Super Speed razor was again redesigned in 1966 and given a black resin coated metal handle. It remained in production until 1988. A companion model  the,''\"Knack\"'', with a longer plastic handle, was produced from 1966 to 1975. In Europe, the Knack was sold as \"Slim Twist\" and \"G2000\" from 1978 to 1988, a later version known as \"G1000\" was made in England and available until 1998.
