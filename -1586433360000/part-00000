Most towns and villages had their own mill so that local farmers could easily transport their grain there to be milled. These communities were dependent on their local mill as bread was a staple part of the diet.\n\nClassical mill designs are usually [[water mill|water-powered]], though some are powered by the wind or by livestock. In a watermill a [[sluice]] gate is opened to allow water to flow onto, or under, a [[water wheel]] to make it turn.  In most watermills the water wheel was mounted vertically, i.e., edge-on, in the water, but in some cases horizontally (the tub wheel and so-called [[Water wheel#Horizontal wheel|Norse wheel]]). Later designs incorporated horizontal steel or cast iron [[turbines]] and these were sometimes refitted into the old wheel mills.\n\nIn most wheel-driven mills, a large gear-wheel called the ''[[Mill machinery#Pit Wheel|pit wheel]]'' is mounted on the same axle as the water wheel and this drives a smaller gear-wheel, the ''[[Mill machinery#wallower|wallower]]'', on a main [[driveshaft]] running vertically from the bottom to the top of the building. This system of gearing ensures that the main shaft turns faster than the water wheel, which typically rotates at around 10 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]].\n\nThe millstones themselves turn at around 120 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. They are laid one on top of the other. The bottom stone, called the ''bed'', is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the ''[[Runner stone|runner]]'', is mounted on a separate spindle, driven by the main shaft. A wheel called the ''[[Mill machinery#stone nut|stone nut]]'' connects the runner's spindle to the main shaft, and this can be moved out of the way to disconnect the stone and stop it turning, leaving the main shaft turning to drive other machinery. This might include driving a mechanical [[sieve]] to refine the flour, or turning a wooden drum to wind up a chain used to hoist sacks of grain to the top of the mill house. The distance between the stones can be varied to produce the grade of flour required; moving the stones closer together produces finer flour.\n\nThe grain is lifted in sacks onto the ''sack floor'' at the top of the mill on the [[hoist (device)|hoist]]. The sacks are then emptied into bins, where the grain falls down through a hopper to the millstones on the ''stone floor'' below. The flow of grain is regulated by shaking it in a gently sloping trough (the ''slipper'') from which it falls into a hole in the center of the runner stone. The milled grain (flour) is collected as it emerges through the grooves in the runner stone from the outer rim of the stones and is fed down a chute to be collected in [[flour sack|sacks]] on the ground or ''meal'' floor. A similar process is used for grains such as [[wheat]] to make flour, and for [[maize]] to make [[corn meal]].\n\nIn order to prevent vibrations from the millstones shaking the building apart, they were usually placed on a separate timber foundation, not attached to the mill walls, known as a husk. This foundation isolated the building from vibrations coming from the stones and main gearing and also allowed for the easy re-leveling of the foundation to keep the millstones perfectly horizontal. The lower bedstone was placed in an inset in the husk with the upper runner stone above the level of the husk. \n\n===The Automatic Mill===\nAmerican inventor [[Oliver Evans]] revolutionized the labor-intensive process of early mills at the end of the eighteenth century when he automated the process of making flour. His inventions included the Elevator, wood or tin buckets on a vertical endless leather belt, used to move grain and flour vertically upward; the Conveyor, a wooden auger to move material horizontally; the Hopper Boy, a device for stirring and cooling the newly ground flour; the Drill, a horizontal elevator with flaps instead of buckets (similar to the use of a conveyor but easier to build); and the Descender, an endless strap (leather or flannel) in a trough that is angled downward, the strap helps to move the ground flour in the trough. Most importantly, he integrated these into a single continuous process, the overall design later becoming known as the Automatic (or Automated) mill. In 1790 he received the third Federal patent for his process. In 1795 he published \"The Young Mill-Wright and Miller\u2019s Guide\" which fully described the process. <ref>http://www.deltamill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nInterestingly, Evans himself did not use the term gristmill to describe his automatic flour mill, which was purpose designed as a merchant mill (he used the more general term \"water-mill\"). In his book his only reference to \"grist\" (or \"grists\") is to the small batches of grain a farmer would bring in to have ground for himself (what would be generally called barter or custom milling). In his book, Evans describes a system that allows the sequential milling of these grists, noting that \"a mill, thus constructed, might grind grists in the day time, and do merchant-work at night.\" <ref>Evans, Oliver, ''The Young Mill-Wright and Miller\u2019s Guide'', Oliver Evans, Philadelphia, 1795, Chapter II, pp.88-90</ref> Over time, any small, older style flour mill became generally known as a gristmill (as a distinction from large factory flour mills).\n\n==Modern mills==\n[[File:Tartu Mill 03.jpg|thumb|Modern mills are highly automated. Interior in [[Tartu Mill]], the biggest grain milling company in the [[Baltic states]].]]\n[[File:Pittsburg August 2015 10 (Pilgrim's Pride feed mill).jpg|thumb|The [[Pilgrim's Pride]] feed mill in [[Pittsburg, Texas]], in August 2015]]\n\nModern mills typically use electricity or [[fossil fuels]] to spin heavy steel, or cast iron, serrated and flat rollers to separate the [[Whole grain|bran and germ]] from the [[endosperm]]. The endosperm is ground to create white flour, which may be recombined with the bran and germ to create whole grain or [[graham flour]]. The different milling techniques produce visibly different results, but can be made to produce nutritionally and functionally equivalent output. Stone-ground flour is, however, preferred by many bakers and natural food advocates because of its texture, nutty flavour, and the belief that it is nutritionally superior and has a better baking quality than steel-roller-milled flour.<ref name=\"EAP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/06clipfile/Nutritional%20charateristics%20of%20organic%20freshly%20stone%20-%20ground.htm|title=NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS of ORGANIC, FRESHLY STONE-GROUND, SOURDOUGH & - CONVENTIONAL BREADS |last=Campbell|first=Judy |author2=Mechtild Hauser |author3=Stuart Hill|year=1991|work=Ecological Agriculture Projects Publications|publisher=Ecological Agriculture Projects|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> It is claimed that, as the stones grind relatively slowly, the wheat germ is not exposed to the sort of excessive temperatures that could cause the fat from the germ portion to [[Beta oxidation|oxidize]] and become rancid, which would destroy some of the vitamin content.<ref name=\"EAP\" /> Stone-milled flour has been found to be relatively high in thiamin, compared to roller-milled flour, especially when milled from hard wheat.<ref name=\"EAP\" />\n\nGristmills only grind \"clean\" grains from which stalks and [[chaff]] have previously been removed, but historically some mills also housed equipment for [[threshing]], sorting, and cleaning prior to grinding.\n\nModern mills are usually \"merchant mills\" that are either privately owned and accept money or trade for milling grains or are owned by corporations that buy unmilled grain and then own the flour produced.\n\n== Pests ==\nOne common pest found in flour mills is the [[Mediterranean flour moth]].

From this time onward, water wheels began to be used for purposes other than grist milling. In England, the number of mills in operation followed population growth, and peaked at around 17,000 by 1300.<ref>Gimpel, J., ''The Medieval Machine'', Gollanz, 1976, Chapter 1.</ref>\n\nLimited extant examples of gristmills can be found in Europe from the [[High Middle Ages]].

Most towns and villages had their own mill so that local farmers could easily transport their grain there to be milled. These communities were dependent on their local mill as bread was a staple part of the diet.\n\nClassical mill designs are usually [[water mill|water-powered]], though some are powered by the wind or by livestock. In a watermill a [[sluice]] gate is opened to allow water to flow onto, or under, a [[water wheel]] to make it turn.  In most watermills the water wheel was mounted vertically, i.e., edge-on, in the water, but in some cases horizontally (the tub wheel and so-called [[Water wheel#Horizontal wheel|Norse wheel]]). Later designs incorporated horizontal steel or cast iron [[turbines]] and these were sometimes refitted into the old wheel mills.\n\nIn most wheel-driven mills, a large gear-wheel called the ''[[Mill machinery#Pit Wheel|pit wheel]]'' is mounted on the same axle as the water wheel and this drives a smaller gear-wheel, the ''[[Mill machinery#wallower|wallower]]'', on a main [[driveshaft]] running vertically from the bottom to the top of the building. This system of gearing ensures that the main shaft turns faster than the water wheel, which typically rotates at around 10 [[revolutions per minute|rpm]].\n\nThe millstones themselves turn at around 120 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. They are laid one on top of the other. The bottom stone, called the ''bed'', is fixed to the floor, while the top stone, the ''[[Runner stone|runner]]'', is mounted on a separate spindle, driven by the main shaft. A wheel called the ''[[Mill machinery#stone nut|stone nut]]'' connects the runner's spindle to the main shaft, and this can be moved out of the way to disconnect the stone and stop it turning, leaving the main shaft turning to drive other machinery. This might include driving a mechanical [[sieve]] to refine the flour, or turning a wooden drum to wind up a chain used to hoist sacks of grain to the top of the mill house. The distance between the stones can be varied to produce the grade of flour required; moving the stones closer together produces finer flour.\n\nThe grain is lifted in sacks onto the ''sack floor'' at the top of the mill on the [[hoist (device)|hoist]]. The sacks are then emptied into bins, where the grain falls down through a hopper to the millstones on the ''stone floor'' below. The flow of grain is regulated by shaking it in a gently sloping trough (the ''slipper'') from which it falls into a hole in the center of the runner stone. The milled grain (flour) is collected as it emerges through the grooves in the runner stone from the outer rim of the stones and is fed down a chute to be collected in [[flour sack|sacks]] on the ground or ''meal'' floor. A similar process is used for grains such as [[wheat]] to make flour, and for [[maize]] to make [[corn meal]].\n\nIn order to prevent vibrations from the millstones shaking the building apart, they were usually placed on a separate timber foundation, not attached to the mill walls, known as a husk. This foundation isolated the building from vibrations coming from the stones and main gearing and also allowed for the easy re-leveling of the foundation to keep the millstones perfectly horizontal. The lower bedstone was placed in an inset in the husk with the upper runner stone above the level of the husk. \n\n===The Automatic Mill===\nAmerican inventor [[Oliver Evans]] revolutionized the labor-intensive process of early mills at the end of the eighteenth century when he automated the process of making flour. His inventions included the Elevator, wood or tin buckets on a vertical endless leather belt, used to move grain and flour vertically upward; the Conveyor, a wooden auger to move material horizontally; the Hopper Boy, a device for stirring and cooling the newly ground flour; the Drill, a horizontal elevator with flaps instead of buckets (similar to the use of a conveyor but easier to build); and the Descender, an endless strap (leather or flannel) in a trough that is angled downward, the strap helps to move the ground flour in the trough. Most importantly, he integrated these into a single continuous process, the overall design later becoming known as the Automatic (or Automated) mill. In 1790 he received the third Federal patent for his process. In 1795 he published \"The Young Mill-Wright and Miller\u2019s Guide\" which fully described the process. <ref>http://www.deltamill.org/history.html</ref>\n\nInterestingly, Evans himself did not use the term gristmill to describe his automatic flour mill, which was purpose designed as a merchant mill (he used the more general term \"water-mill\"). In his book his only reference to \"grist\" (or \"grists\") is to the small batches of grain a farmer would bring in to have ground for himself (what would be generally called barter or custom milling). In his book, Evans describes a system that allows the sequential milling of these grists, noting that \"a mill, thus constructed, might grind grists in the day time, and do merchant-work at night.\" <ref>Evans, Oliver, ''The Young Mill-Wright and Miller\u2019s Guide'', Oliver Evans, Philadelphia, 1795, Chapter II, pp.88-90</ref> Over time, any small, older style flour mill became generally known as a gristmill (as a distinction from large factory flour mills).\n\n==Modern mills==\n[[File:Tartu Mill 03.jpg|thumb|Modern mills are highly automated. Interior in [[Tartu Mill]], the biggest grain milling company in the [[Baltic states]].]]\n[[File:Pittsburg August 2015 10 (Pilgrim's Pride feed mill).jpg|thumb|The [[Pilgrim's Pride]] feed mill in [[Pittsburg, Texas]], in August 2015]]\n\nModern mills typically use electricity or [[fossil fuels]] to spin heavy steel, or cast iron, serrated and flat rollers to separate the [[Whole grain|bran and germ]] from the [[endosperm]]. The endosperm is ground to create white flour, which may be recombined with the bran and germ to create whole grain or [[graham flour]]. The different milling techniques produce visibly different results, but can be made to produce nutritionally and functionally equivalent output. Stone-ground flour is, however, preferred by many bakers and natural food advocates because of its texture, nutty flavour, and the belief that it is nutritionally superior and has a better baking quality than steel-roller-milled flour.<ref name=\"EAP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.soilandhealth.org/06clipfile/Nutritional%20charateristics%20of%20organic%20freshly%20stone%20-%20ground.htm|title=NUTRITIONAL CHARACTERISTICS of ORGANIC, FRESHLY STONE-GROUND, SOURDOUGH & - CONVENTIONAL BREADS |last=Campbell|first=Judy |author2=Mechtild Hauser |author3=Stuart Hill|year=1991|work=Ecological Agriculture Projects Publications|publisher=Ecological Agriculture Projects|accessdate=15 December 2009}}</ref> It is claimed that, as the stones grind relatively slowly, the wheat germ is not exposed to the sort of excessive temperatures that could cause the fat from the germ portion to [[Beta oxidation|oxidize]] and become rancid, which would destroy some of the vitamin content.<ref name=\"EAP\" /> Stone-milled flour has been found to be relatively high in thiamin, compared to roller-milled flour, especially when milled from hard wheat.<ref name=\"EAP\" />\n\nGristmills only grind \"clean\" grains from which stalks and [[chaff]] have previously been removed, but historically some mills also housed equipment for [[threshing]], sorting, and cleaning prior to grinding.\n\nModern mills are usually \"merchant mills\" that are either privately owned and accept money or trade for milling grains or are owned by corporations that buy unmilled grain and then own the flour produced.\n\n== Pests ==\nOne common pest found in flour mills is the [[Mediterranean flour moth]].

The [[Constitution of Sri Lanka]] provides free education as a fundamental right. Sri Lanka's population had an adult literacy rate of 96.3% in 2015, which is above average by world and regional standards.Computer literacy in 2017\n28.3% and phone users in 2017 105%, website users 32% in 2017 {{efn|group=note|1=In 2013 [[South Asia]]'s literacy rate was 67.55, Asia 84.32% and the world 85.20%.<ref name=literacyrate/>}} Education plays a major part in the life and culture of the country and dates back to 543 BC. Sri Lanka's modern educational system was brought about by its integration into the [[British Empire]] in the 19th century. Education currently falls under the control of both the [[Government of Sri Lanka|Central Government]] and the [[Provinces of Sri Lanka|Provincial Councils]], with some responsibilities lying with the Central Government and the Provincial Council having autonomy for others.\n\n==Administration of the system==\nPrimary school to higher education are primarily funded and overseen by three governmental ministries.<ref>[http://www.moe.gov.lk/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=2 Historical Overview of Education in Sri Lanka, Ministry of Education] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716215924/http://www.moe.gov.lk/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=2 |date=16 July 2007 }}</ref>\n* [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Education]]: for schools, [[pirivenas]] (schools for Buddhist priests), teachers training colleges and colleges of education\n**[[Department of Examinations]]: National examination service\n* [[Ministry of Higher Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Higher Education]]: for universities\n* Ministry of Education Services:  for supplying the physical facilities required for general education\n* Ministry of Skills Development and Vocational Training: for vocational education and technical colleges\n\nExceptions to this system exist&nbsp;\u2014 mostly when it comes to tertiary with several public universities and institutes coming under the purview of different ministries. These divisions have led to a high degree of mismanagement and inefficiency over the years.\n\n==History==\nEducation in Sri Lanka has a history of over 2300 years. It is believed that the [[Sanskrit]] language was brought to the island from North India as a result of the establishment of the [[Buddhism]] in the reign of [[King]] [[Devanampiya Tissa]] from the Buddhist monks sent by [[Ashoka the Great|Emperor Asoka]] of India. Since then an education system evolved based around the Buddhist temples and [[pirivenas]] (monastic colleges), the latter primarily intended for clergy (even to this day) and higher education. Evidence of this system is found on the [[Mahawamsa]] and [[Dipavamsa]], the Chronicle of Lanka that deals with the history of the island from the arrival of [[Prince]] [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]] and his followers in the 6th century BC.<ref>[http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.1.html#s11 Historical Overview of Education in Sri Lanka - Ancient Period (543 BC - 1500 AD)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124122847/http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.1.html#s11 |date=24 November 2010 }}, Ministry of Education</ref>\n\nWith the outset of the [[Colonialism|colonial]] expansion on the island, first in the coastal provinces and then interior, Christian missionary societies become active in education. The Anglican Church's monopoly of Government Schools and in education ended following the Colebrooke Commission set up by the British administration.\n\n===Primary and secondary schools===\nA standard system of government schools were begun by the British based on the recommendations of the [[Colebrooke-Cameron Commission|Colebrooke Commission]] in 1836. This is regarded as the beginning of the government's schooling system in the island. It started with the establishment of the [[Royal College, Colombo|Royal College]] in [[Colombo]] (formerly the Colombo Academy) and lead to the formation of several [[single sex schools]] constructed during the colonial period, by the British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.3.html |publisher=Ministry of Education |title=Historical Overview of Education in Sri Lanka - The British Period: (1796 - 1948) |accessdate=20 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411221808/http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.3.html |archivedate=11 April 2011 }}</ref> Some of these schools were affiliated to the Anglican Church. These included [[St Thomas' College|S. Thomas' College]] in [[Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia|Mount Lavinia]] and [[Trinity College, Kandy|Trinity College]] in [[Kandy]]. The education in [[vernacular]] schools was largely free due to government grants to cover the cost of teaching and local [[philanthropists]] providing the buildings, equipment and the books.<ref>{{cite news|last =Jayawardena|first = Kumari|title = When the 'nobodies'made their mark|publisher = The Sunday Times|date = 17 December 2000|url = http://www.sundaytimes.lk/001217/plus5.html|accessdate = 25 February 2015}}</ref> Colebrooke decreed that all government schools be discontinued. The order did not apply to denominational Missionary schools and they continued to function unceasingly.\n\n[[File:Royal College Colombo main building.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Royal College Main building]]\n\nIn 1938 the education system in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) was made formally free following the granting of [[universal franchise]] in 1931. The Minister of Education, late Hon. Dr. [[C.W.W. Kannangara]], and the Executive Committee of Education which included members such as [[H. W. Amarasuriya]] took the initiative in establishing [[free education]]. Under this initiative the government established [[Madhya Maha Vidyalayas]] (MMV, Central Colleges) that were scattered around the island to provide education to all. The medium was either [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]].\n\nIn 1942 a special committee was appointed to observe the education system and, among the suggestions that followed, the following play an important role:\n*i. Make available to all children a good education free of charge, so that education ceases to be a commodity purchasable only by the urban affluent.\n*ii. Make national languages the media of instruction in place of English so that opportunities for higher education, lucrative employment open only to small number of the urban affluent, would become available to others as well.\n*iii. Rationalize the school system so that educational provision is adequate, efficient and economical.\n*iv. Ensure that every child is provided with instruction in the religion of his/her parents.\n*v. Protect teachers from exploitation by managers of schools.\n*vi. Make adequate provision for adult education.\n\nAfter independence, the number of schools and the literacy rate substantially increased. According to the Ministry of Statistics, today there are approximately 10,012 public schools serving close to 4,037,157 students, all around the island.\n\nDuring the colonial times, late [[national heroes]] like [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] with foreigners like [[Colonel]] [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Madame Blavatsky]] of the [[Buddhist]] [[Theosophical Society]] installed Buddhist schools to foster [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] students with an [[English language|English]] education rich in Buddhist values and to bring [[Buddhism]] to life, at a time when it was slowly fading away. Most of these schools were established in the capitals of the major [[provinces of Sri Lanka]]. The first of these were [[Ananda College]], Colombo (formerly English Buddhist School); [[Dharmaraja College, Kandy]] (formerly Kandy Buddhist High School); [[Mahinda College]], [[Galle]] (formerly Galle Buddhist Theosophical Society School);<ref>{{cite news|last = Kulatilaka|first = Justice P.H.K.|title = Ushering in the Buddhist Revival in Ceylon|publisher = Sunday Observer|date = 12 May 2013|url = http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2013/05/12/mon06.asp|accessdate = 5 September 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131005005849/http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2013/05/12/mon06.asp|archive-date = 5 October 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> [[Musaeus College]], Colombo<ref>{{cite web|title = Historical Context|publisher = Embassy of Sri Lanka-Washington DC|url = http://www.slembassyusa.org/srilanka_us_relations/historical_context.html|accessdate = 7 September 2013}}</ref> and [[Maliyadeva College]], [[Kurunegala]] (formerly Kurunegala Buddhist Institution) which were followed decades later by [[Visakha Vidyalaya|Visakha Vidyalaya, Colombo]] (formerly Buddhist Girls College), [[Nalanda Maha Vidyalaya Colombo]] and [[Mahamaya Girls' College, Kandy|Mahamaya Vidyalaya, Kandy]].\n\nSri Lanka also has many [[Catholic school]]s such as [[St. Joseph's College, Colombo|St. Joseph's College]], [[St Bridget's Convent, Colombo|St Bridget's Convent]], [[St Peter's College, Colombo|St Peter's College]], [[St. Anthony's College, Kandy]] and the [[Joseph Vaz College]] named after the Sri Lankan saint [[Joseph Vaz]].

The university was in [[Colombo]]. Several years later a second campus was built in [[Peradeniya]]. The University of Ceylon became the [[University of Sri Lanka]] follow in the ''University of Ceylon Act No. 1 of 1972'' resulting in a more centralized administration and more direct government control. This gave way for creation of separate universities after the ''Universities Act No. 16 of 1978''. Even though new universities of independent identities were created, the government maintained its direct control and centralized administration though the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]]. Late Hon. [[Lalith Athulathmudali]] as Minister of Education developed an initiative to develop the higher education of the country in the 1980s, the Mahapola Fund, established by him provided scholarship and much-needed founding to higher education institution to this day. Until amendments to the University Act were made in 1999 only state universities were allowed to grant undergraduate degrees; this has since changed.\n\n==Primary and secondary education==\n\n===Structure===\n[[File:Jaffna Hindu Ladies College.jpg|thumb|250px|School Girls of [[Jaffna Hindu Ladies' College]]]]\nSri Lanka's education structure is divided into five parts: primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, collegiate, and tertiary. [[Primary education]] lasts five years (Grade 1 to Grade 5) and at the end of this period, the students may elect to write a national exam called the Scholarship exam. This exam allows students with exceptional skills to move on to better schools. After primary education, the junior secondary level (referred to as middle school in some schools) lasts for 4 years (Grades 6-9) followed by 2 years (Grades 10-11) of the senior secondary level which is the preparation for the [[General Certificate of Education]] (G.C.E) [[Ordinary Level (SL)|Ordinary Level]] (O/Ls).\nAccording to the Sri Lankan law, it is compulsory that all children go to school till grade 9 (age 14) at which point they can choose to continue their education or drop out and engage in apprenticeship for a job or farming. However, the Ministry of Education strongly advises all students to continue with their studies at least till the G.C.E Ordinary Level.\nStudents who are pursuing [[tertiary education]] must pass the G.C.E O/Ls in order to enter the collegiate level to study for another 2 years (grades 12-13) to sit for the [[Advanced Level (SL)|G.C.E Advanced Level]]. On successful completion of this exam, students can move on to [[tertiary education]], there for the GCE A/Ls is the university entrance exam in Sri Lanka.<ref name=\"MOE\">[http://www.moe.gov.lk/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=7 Present Education System and Management Structure, Ministry of Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716214842/http://www.moe.gov.lk/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=7 |date=16 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the variety of ethnic groups in Sri Lanka, many schools teach only in either [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] medium or in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] medium and not the [[English language|English]] medium.

Currently there are 10,012 government schools with a student population of 4.2 million and 235,924 teachers,  736 [[Pirivenas]] and also 104 private schools with 127,968 students.<> With the establishment if the provincial council system in the 1980s the central government handed control of most schools to local governments.

Most of these schools were established during the colonial period and therefore are established institutions. These few are referred to as famous schools or elite schools since they have a rich history and better maintained facilities than the average public school. This is mainly due the support of their alumni. In recent years newer schools and several central colleges have been upgraded to national schools from time to time, thereby making the total number of national schools 350.<ref name=\"MOE\"/>\n\n====Provincial schools====\n[[List of schools in Sri Lanka#Provincial schools|Provincial Schools]] consists of the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka. Funded and controlled by the local governments many suffer from poor facilities and a shortage of teachers.\n\n====Piriven====\n[[Pirivena|Piriven]] are monastic colleges (similar to a [[seminary]]) for the education of [[Buddhist]] [[priest]]s. These have been the centers of secondary and higher education in ancient times for lay people as well. Today 561 Piriven are funded and maintained by the Ministry of Education under the ''Pirivena Education Act, No, 64 of 1979''. Young priests undergo training at these pirivenas prior to being their [[Ordination]] and study for GCE O/L and A/L examinations. They may gain entrance to State Universities for higher religious studies.\n\n===Non-government schools===\n\n====Private schools====\n[[File:C.M.S.

These private schools follow the local curriculum set up by the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Education]] in the local language mediums of [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]] or [[English language|English]]. Many of the private schools have access to newer facilities than state run schools. Currently there are 66 Private schools (registered before 1960 and not since then) of these, 33 non-fee-levying Assisted Private Schools (also known as semi-government schools) and 33 fee levying autonomous [[Private School]]s, in addition to the Government Schools.<ref name=\"MOE\"/>\n\n====International schools====\n[[List of international schools in Sri Lanka|International schools]] in Sri Lanka are not restricted to the expatriate community, anyone with the ability and willingness to pay can join these schools.  Starting in the late 1980s these schools have no regulation or control by the Ministry of Education as it comes under the Board of Investment (BOI),<ref name=\"MOE\"/> due to this the standard of education varies greatly between schools. The schools are mainly for the children of the expatriate community, charge high tuition fees and can therefore provide good facilities and high standards.\n\nThe majority of International schools prepares students for the [[Edexcel]] [[General Certificate of Education]] (IGCSE) Ordinary, Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced (A2) Level examinations, which is the most popular qualification. Preparation for [[Cambridge International Examinations]] is also offered by a few schools but it is less popular. Both exams are offered under the supervision of the [[British Council]], whereas some schools offer a direct partnership with the examination body in order to improve standards.\n\n====Madrasas====\nAs of 2013, there are 205 [[madrasas]] registered under the Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs providing [[Islam|Islamic education]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>[https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/documents/paperspresented/performance-report-department-of-muslim-religious-cultural-affairs-2014.pdf Department of Muslim Religious and Cultural Affairs.]</ref> These have been build and maintained by independent islamic foundations such as [[All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama]] and the Thareeqathul Aroosiyyathil Qaadhiriyyah Association in Sri Lanka which propagate [[Ahlus-Sunnah wa\u2019l-Jama\u2019ah|Sunnah wal Jamaah]].<ref>[http://www.documents.gov.lk/files/bill/2017/10/255-2017_E.pdf Thareeqathul Aroosiyyathil Qaadhiriyyah Association in Sri Lanka]</ref> This is in addition to the 749 Muslim Schools in Sri Lanka.\n\n==Tuition==\nDue to the high competitive nature of exams such as [[Scholarship Examination|year 5]], [[Ordinary Level (SL)|GCE O/L]] and [[Advanced Level (SL)|GCE A/L]] as well as [[General Certificate of Education|London O/Ls and A/Ls]]; parents seek additional help at home and at group/mass classes to improve their children's grades and performance. In recent years this has become a lucrative enterprise, which has resulted in successive governments attempting to regulate it. Many scholars have also accused tuition classes of robbing the childhood and having a negative impact on the child's health.\n\nThese Private Educational Institutes or Tuition Centers are concentrated in Major cities of Sri Lanka: Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Negombo, Kurunegala, Kandy, Galle, Matara, Tangalle, Kegalle, Badulla and Ratnapura.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://studentlanka.com/2012/08/28/tuition-centers/|title=Major Tuition Institutes Centers in Sri Lanka|date=2012-08-28|website=Student Sri Lanka Education|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Tertiary education==\n{{Main|Higher education in Sri Lanka|List of universities in Sri Lanka}}\nUndergraduate education in state universities is free but extremely competitive, limited and standardized.

Only the top students from each district get admissions.\n\nThe top students from urban and rural districts get the chances of having tertiary education. However, top students who got qualified under the minimum Z Scores requirements for admissions from remote districts may get in with relatively lower marks than those from urban districts. As a result, many students who are not granted admission find other means of higher education. Around 8% those qualified but could not get admission for higher education go abroad to pursue their studies,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/03/21/news3.html|title=Over 7,000 go overseas annually for studies, Island|author=Lakshmi de Silva}}</ref> others enroll themselves at the [[Open University of Sri Lanka]]\n\nSome study for entrance/membership for [[professional bodies]] both foreign (such as [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants|CIMA]], [[British Computer Society|BCS]], [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]], etc.) and local (such as [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka|ICASL]], SLIM) or do studies at vocational [[technical college]]s that specialize in mechanical and electronic subjects.

The [[North Colombo Medical College]] (NCMC) was one such institute. But efforts to establish private universities have been blocked due to protests conducted by many parties claiming that it would create more competition for state university students. In recent years this has become a reason for students who do not attend state universities to prefer going abroad or study at other institutes and [[professional bodies]].\n\nThere are three types of Degree Awarding Private Higher Education Institutes in Sri Lanka<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://studentlanka.com/2011/06/07/private-universities-and-degree-courses-in-sri-lanka/|title=Private Universities and Degree courses in Sri Lanka|date=2011-06-07|website=Student Sri Lanka Education|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref>\n# Private Institutes which offer Sri Lankan degrees recognized by [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]]\n# Private Institutes which offer Foreign Degrees in affiliation with Foreign Universities\n# [[Professional association|Professional Institutes]] which offer Degree Equivalent Professional Qualifications\nFor a complete list, see [[List of universities in Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan universities]]\n\n;Classification of tertiary qualifications\n*[[Academic certificate|Certificate]]: 1 year or less than 1 year of study.\n*[[Diploma]]: 1\u20132 years of study.\n*[[Bachelor's degree]]:\n**General degree: 3 years of coursework without a [[academic major|major]].\n**[[Bachelor's degree#Honors degrees and academic distinctions|Honours]]/Special degree: 4 years of coursework and research with a [[academic major|major]]/specialization in a field.\n*[[Master's degree]]: undertaken after the completion of one or more bachelor's degrees.

Higher education in vocational fields could be archived though several universities. The National Vocational Qualifications Systems in Sri Lanka (NVQSL) provides a structured seven levels of qualifications from Level 1 to Level 7. Vocational education and training is carried out for degree level at the [[Open University, Sri Lanka]] and the [[University of Vocational Technology]], as well as at diploma level at [[Technical College (Sri Lanka)|37 technical colleges]], [[Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education]] and the Sri Lanka School of Agriculture.\n\nApart from these, the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry of Education]] has launched a non-formal [[vocational education]] program which allows school drop-outs and adults who did not complete their school education, to earn a living, through [[self-employment]].

Since then an education system evolved based around the Buddhist temples and [[pirivenas]] (monastic colleges), the latter primarily intended for clergy (even to this day) and higher education. Evidence of this system is found on the [[Mahawamsa]] and [[Dipavamsa]], the Chronicle of Lanka that deals with the history of the island from the arrival of [[Prince]] [[Vijaya of Sri Lanka|Vijaya]] and his followers in the 6th century BC.<ref>[http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.1.html#s11 Historical Overview of Education in Sri Lanka - Ancient Period (543 BC - 1500 AD)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124122847/http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.1.html#s11 |date=24 November 2010 }}, Ministry of Education</ref>\n\nWith the outset of the [[Colonialism|colonial]] expansion on the island, first in the coastal provinces and then interior, Christian missionary societies become active in education.

It started with the establishment of the [[Royal College, Colombo|Royal College]] in [[Colombo]] (formerly the Colombo Academy) and lead to the formation of several [[single sex schools]] constructed during the colonial period, by the British.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.3.html |publisher=Ministry of Education |title=Historical Overview of Education in Sri Lanka - The British Period: (1796 - 1948) |accessdate=20 November 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110411221808/http://www.moe.gov.lk/Education_his_1.3.html |archivedate=11 April 2011 }}</ref> Some of these schools were affiliated to the Anglican Church.

The order did not apply to denominational Missionary schools and they continued to function unceasingly.\n\n[[File:Royal College Colombo main building.jpg|250px|thumbnail|Royal College Main building]]\n\nIn 1938 the education system in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) was made formally free following the granting of [[universal franchise]] in 1931. The Minister of Education, late Hon. Dr. [[C.W.W. Kannangara]], and the Executive Committee of Education which included members such as [[H. W. Amarasuriya]] took the initiative in establishing [[free education]]. Under this initiative the government established [[Madhya Maha Vidyalayas]] (MMV, Central Colleges) that were scattered around the island to provide education to all. The medium was either [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]].\n\nIn 1942 a special committee was appointed to observe the education system and, among the suggestions that followed, the following play an important role:\n*i. Make available to all children a good education free of charge, so that education ceases to be a commodity purchasable only by the urban affluent.\n*ii. Make national languages the media of instruction in place of English so that opportunities for higher education, lucrative employment open only to small number of the urban affluent, would become available to others as well.\n*iii. Rationalize the school system so that educational provision is adequate, efficient and economical.\n*iv. Ensure that every child is provided with instruction in the religion of his/her parents.\n*v. Protect teachers from exploitation by managers of schools.\n*vi. Make adequate provision for adult education.\n\nAfter independence, the number of schools and the literacy rate substantially increased. According to the Ministry of Statistics, today there are approximately 10,012 public schools serving close to 4,037,157 students, all around the island.\n\nDuring the colonial times, late [[national heroes]] like [[Anagarika Dharmapala]] with foreigners like [[Colonel]] [[Henry Steel Olcott]] and [[Madame Blavatsky]] of the [[Buddhist]] [[Theosophical Society]] installed Buddhist schools to foster [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] students with an [[English language|English]] education rich in Buddhist values and to bring [[Buddhism]] to life, at a time when it was slowly fading away. Most of these schools were established in the capitals of the major [[provinces of Sri Lanka]].

The university was in [[Colombo]]. Several years later a second campus was built in [[Peradeniya]]. The University of Ceylon became the [[University of Sri Lanka]] follow in the ''University of Ceylon Act No. 1 of 1972'' resulting in a more centralized administration and more direct government control. This gave way for creation of separate universities after the ''Universities Act No. 16 of 1978''. Even though new universities of independent identities were created, the government maintained its direct control and centralized administration though the [[University Grants Commission (Sri Lanka)|University Grants Commission]]. Late Hon. [[Lalith Athulathmudali]] as Minister of Education developed an initiative to develop the higher education of the country in the 1980s, the Mahapola Fund, established by him provided scholarship and much-needed founding to higher education institution to this day. Until amendments to the University Act were made in 1999 only state universities were allowed to grant undergraduate degrees; this has since changed.\n\n==Primary and secondary education==\n\n===Structure===\n[[File:Jaffna Hindu Ladies College.jpg|thumb|250px|School Girls of [[Jaffna Hindu Ladies' College]]]]\nSri Lanka's education structure is divided into five parts: primary, junior secondary, senior secondary, collegiate, and tertiary. [[Primary education]] lasts five years (Grade 1 to Grade 5) and at the end of this period, the students may elect to write a national exam called the Scholarship exam. This exam allows students with exceptional skills to move on to better schools. After primary education, the junior secondary level (referred to as middle school in some schools) lasts for 4 years (Grades 6-9) followed by 2 years (Grades 10-11) of the senior secondary level which is the preparation for the [[General Certificate of Education]] (G.C.E) [[Ordinary Level (SL)|Ordinary Level]] (O/Ls).\nAccording to the Sri Lankan law, it is compulsory that all children go to school till grade 9 (age 14) at which point they can choose to continue their education or drop out and engage in apprenticeship for a job or farming. However, the Ministry of Education strongly advises all students to continue with their studies at least till the G.C.E Ordinary Level.\nStudents who are pursuing [[tertiary education]] must pass the G.C.E O/Ls in order to enter the collegiate level to study for another 2 years (grades 12-13) to sit for the [[Advanced Level (SL)|G.C.E Advanced Level]]. On successful completion of this exam, students can move on to [[tertiary education]], there for the GCE A/Ls is the university entrance exam in Sri Lanka.<ref name=\"MOE\">[http://www.moe.gov.lk/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=7 Present Education System and Management Structure, Ministry of Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716214842/http://www.moe.gov.lk/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=7 |date=16 July 2007 }}</ref>\n\nDue to the variety of ethnic groups in Sri Lanka, many schools teach only in either [[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]] medium or in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] medium and not the [[English language|English]] medium.

Currently there are 10,012 government schools with a student population of 4.2 million and 235,924 teachers,  736 [[Pirivenas]] and also 104 private schools with 127,968 students.<> With the establishment if the provincial council system in the 1980s the central government handed control of most schools to local governments.

Most of these schools were established during the colonial period and therefore are established institutions. These few are referred to as famous schools or elite schools since they have a rich history and better maintained facilities than the average public school. This is mainly due the support of their alumni. In recent years newer schools and several central colleges have been upgraded to national schools from time to time, thereby making the total number of national schools 350.<ref name=\"MOE\"/>\n\n====Provincial schools====\n[[List of schools in Sri Lanka#Provincial schools|Provincial Schools]] consists of the vast majority of schools in Sri Lanka. Funded and controlled by the local governments many suffer from poor facilities and a shortage of teachers.\n\n====Piriven====\n[[Pirivena|Piriven]] are monastic colleges (similar to a [[seminary]]) for the education of [[Buddhist]] [[priest]]s. These have been the centers of secondary and higher education in ancient times for lay people as well. Today 561 Piriven are funded and maintained by the Ministry of Education under the ''Pirivena Education Act, No, 64 of 1979''. Young priests undergo training at these pirivenas prior to being their [[Ordination]] and study for GCE O/L and A/L examinations.

Many of the private schools have access to newer facilities than state run schools. Currently there are 66 Private schools (registered before 1960 and not since then) of these, 33 non-fee-levying Assisted Private Schools (also known as semi-government schools) and 33 fee levying autonomous [[Private School]]s, in addition to the Government Schools.<ref name=\"MOE\"/>\n\n====International schools====\n[[List of international schools in Sri Lanka|International schools]] in Sri Lanka are not restricted to the expatriate community, anyone with the ability and willingness to pay can join these schools.  Starting in the late 1980s these schools have no regulation or control by the Ministry of Education as it comes under the Board of Investment (BOI),<ref name=\"MOE\"/> due to this the standard of education varies greatly between schools. The schools are mainly for the children of the expatriate community, charge high tuition fees and can therefore provide good facilities and high standards.\n\nThe majority of International schools prepares students for the [[Edexcel]] [[General Certificate of Education]] (IGCSE) Ordinary, Advanced Subsidiary (AS) and Advanced (A2) Level examinations, which is the most popular qualification.

In recent years this has become a lucrative enterprise, which has resulted in successive governments attempting to regulate it. Many scholars have also accused tuition classes of robbing the childhood and having a negative impact on the child's health.\n\nThese Private Educational Institutes or Tuition Centers are concentrated in Major cities of Sri Lanka: Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Negombo, Kurunegala, Kandy, Galle, Matara, Tangalle, Kegalle, Badulla and Ratnapura.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://studentlanka.com/2012/08/28/tuition-centers/|title=Major Tuition Institutes Centers in Sri Lanka|date=2012-08-28|website=Student Sri Lanka Education|access-date=2017-05-16}}</ref>\n\n==Tertiary education==\n{{Main|Higher education in Sri Lanka|List of universities in Sri Lanka}}\nUndergraduate education in state universities is free but extremely competitive, limited and standardized.

They were generally replaced by [[millstone]]s once mechanised forms of [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] appeared, particularly the [[water mill]] and the [[windmill]], although animals were also used to operate the millstones. However, in many non-Westernised, non-mechanised cultures they are still manufactured and used regularly and have only been replaced in many parts of the world in the last century or so.\n\nThe use of grinding stones for vegetal food processing, and possibly the production of flour, was widespread across [[Europe]] from at least 30,000 years ago.<ref>Anna Revedin et al., ''Thirty thousand-year-old evidence of plant food processing'', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2010, vol. 107, no. 44, pp. 18815\u201318819 (18815)</ref>\n\nIn early [[Maya civilization]]s the process of [[nixtamalization]] was distinctive in that hard, ripe kernels of maize (corn) were boiled in water and lime, thus producing nixtamal which was then made into unleavened dough for flat cakes by grinding with a handstone on a quern (''metate'').<ref>{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D.\n  | year = 1999\n| title = The Maya|edition=Sixth\n| publisher = Thames & Hudson\n| location = New York\n| isbn = 0-500-28066-5\n| page = 13}}</ref>\n\nQuern stones were used in [[China]] at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour.

The authors concluded that this was probably due to the use of these querns in the preparation of medicines, cosmetics, dyes or even in the manufacture of alloys.<ref>Lease et al. 2001:235</ref>\n\nQuerns were widely used in grinding metals ores after mining extraction. The aim was to liberate fine ore particles which could then be separated by washing for example, prior to smelting. They were thus widely used in [[gold mining]] in antiquity.\n\nIn [[Shetland]] tobacco was not smoked when first introduced, but instead was ground up into [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], and inhaled up the nose. Snuff-querns consisted of an upper and lower stone, fixed together by a central iron pivot. The quern was held on the user's lap, the eye of the quern was filled with dried tobacco leaves, and then the upper-stone was turned using the handle. The friction caused by the turning ground the leaves into a fine powder that built up around the edge of the lower-stone. Many snuff-querns had a small hole or cut made near the edge of the upper-stone, into which a pointed end of a lamb's horn was placed in order to turn the stone; an alternative to using a handle.<ref>[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-591-022-C Snuff Quern.

These quern-stones are only about 30 cm wide.]]\nThere are, however, more surprising recorded uses of quern-stones. For example, DeBoer, in his review of the traditional gambling games of North American tribes, reports that one of the games involved bouncing a group of split canes off a quern.<ref>DeBoer 2001:223.</ref>\n\nViolence is recorded thus in the [[Old Testament]] in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:53; [[NRSV]]): \u201cBut a certain woman threw an upper-millstone on [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]]\u2019s head, and crushed his skull.\u201d\n\n==Manufacture of quern-stones==\nThe best type of stone from which to manufacture quern-stones are [[igneous]] rocks such as [[basalt]]. These have naturally rough surfaces, but grains do not detach easily, so the material being ground does not become gritty. However, such rocks are not always available, meaning that quern-stones have been manufactured from a wide variety of rocks, including [[sandstone]], [[quartzite]] and [[limestone]]. [[Quernmore]] Crag near [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in England is named after the quarrying of millstone grit used to make quern stones in these parts. The names of the mountains of [[Whernside]] and [[Great Whernside]] in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] have the same origin.\n\nRutter was able to show, for the southern Levant, that basalt quern-stones were preferred to those manufactured from other rock types. Basalt quern-stones were therefore transported over long-distances, leading him to argue that, despite their everyday, utilitarian function, they were also used as a [[status symbol]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rutter|first=Graham|title=Basaltic-rock procurement systems in the southern Levant|date=2003|publisher=PhD thesis, University of Durham|page=236|url=http://0lem.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/basalt-procurement/|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nResearch in Scotland has indicated that to a degree regional styles existed.<ref name=\"McLaren\">{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 122 - 125 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}</ref>\n[[File:Native women grinding wheat, Palestine.tiff|thumb| Women grind grain with a quern, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (1900)]]\n\n==Evolution of quern-stones==\n[[Knocking stone]]s were used in the preparation of small quantities of cereal however the earliest forms of quern were the saddle and trough querns. The earliest quern so far discovered dates to c. 9,000 BCE and was found at Abu Hureyra, Syria.<ref name=\"britmus\"/> A later development was the rotary quern, which takes several forms.\n\n===Saddle quern===\nThe saddle quern is produced by rocking or rolling the muller using parallel motions (i.e., pushing and pulling the handstone), which forms a shape looking like a [[saddle]]. These are the most ancient and widely used type of quern-stone and were superseded around the 5th to the 4th century BC by the more efficient rotary quern.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 105 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}</ref> The handstones for saddle querns are generally either roughly cylindrical (not unlike a [[rolling pin]]) and used with both hands, or rough hemispheres and used with one hand. This provides a crushing motion, not a grinding action and is more suitable for crushing malted grain. It is not easy to produce flour from a saddle quern with unmalted grain. The muller is also referred to as a 'rubber' or 'mouler'.<ref>MacSween, A & Sharp, M (1989), ''Prehistoric Scotland.'' London : B.T.Batsford. {{ISBN|0-7134-6173-X}}. p. 17.</ref>\n\n===Rotary hand quern===\nAs the name implies, the rotary quern used circular motions to grind the material, meaning both the quern and the handstone were generally circular. The handstone of a rotary quern is much heavier than that of saddle quern and provides the necessary weight for the grinding of unmalted grain into flour. In some cases the grinding surfaces of the stones fit into each other, the upper stone being slightly concave and the lower one convex.\n[[File:Quern at Estonian Open Air Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Rotary Hand Quern at the Estonian Open Air Museum]]\n\n{{See also|Jato (Stone Grinder)|Mo (grist mill)}}\n\n====Beehive quern====\n[[File:Quern stones.JPG|left|thumb|190px|<center>Querns from the [[Whithorn]] Museum</center>]] In this type the upper stone is hemispherical, or bun-shaped, with a central conical hopper to hold the grain that falls down a hole to the grinding surface. It is held in position with a pivot that fits into a central hole in the bottom stone. The upper stone also has a deep horizontal socket in its steep side in which to place the wooden peg used as a handle to rotate or oscillate the upper stone. This was the earliest type of rotary quern to appear in the British Isles. It arrived in Britain in the middle of the Iron Age (about 400-300 BC) and spread into the northern half of Ireland, probably from Scotland, some time after the 2nd century BC.<ref name=\"J.T.

In the lower stone is a wooden peg, rounded at the top; on this the upper stone is nicely balanced, so as just to touch the lower one, by means of a piece of wood fixed in a large hole in this upper piece, but which does not fill the hole, room for feeding the mill being left on each side: it is so nicely balanced, that though there is some friction from the contact of the two stones, yet a very small momentum will make it revolve several times, when it has no corn in it. The corn being dried, two women sit down on the ground, having the quern between them; the one feeds it, while the other turns it round, relieving each other occasionally, and singing some Celtic songs all the time.\"<ref name=\"Garnett155\"/>\n\n====Miniature quern====\nUnder {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter and varying from roughly dressed to carefully worked, often with vertical handle sockets, a new class of querns has been identified having been overlooked in the past as weights, etc. In all respects they are like full sized quern stones and they show the typical wear signs that indicate that they were used for grinding small amounts of seeds, minerals or herbs. A suggestion that they may have been made as toys is thought to be unlikely.<ref name=\"McLaren2008\">{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 119 - 122 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}</ref>\n\n===Other types of quern stones===\nOther forms of quern-stone include hopper-rubbers and Pompeian mills, both used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].

Various legends give miraculous power to mill-stones and several have been found which have been re-used in the construction of burial cists or as tomb stones.

They were generally replaced by [[millstone]]s once mechanised forms of [[Mill (grinding)|milling]] appeared, particularly the [[water mill]] and the [[windmill]], although animals were also used to operate the millstones. However, in many non-Westernised, non-mechanised cultures they are still manufactured and used regularly and have only been replaced in many parts of the world in the last century or so.\n\nThe use of grinding stones for vegetal food processing, and possibly the production of flour, was widespread across [[Europe]] from at least 30,000 years ago.<ref>Anna Revedin et al., ''Thirty thousand-year-old evidence of plant food processing'', Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 2010, vol. 107, no. 44, pp. 18815\u201318819 (18815)</ref>\n\nIn early [[Maya civilization]]s the process of [[nixtamalization]] was distinctive in that hard, ripe kernels of maize (corn) were boiled in water and lime, thus producing nixtamal which was then made into unleavened dough for flat cakes by grinding with a handstone on a quern (''metate'').<ref>{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D.\n  | year = 1999\n| title = The Maya|edition=Sixth\n| publisher = Thames & Hudson\n| location = New York\n| isbn = 0-500-28066-5\n| page = 13}}</ref>\n\nQuern stones were used in [[China]] at least 10,000 years ago to grind wheat into flour.

The authors concluded that this was probably due to the use of these querns in the preparation of medicines, cosmetics, dyes or even in the manufacture of alloys.<ref>Lease et al. 2001:235</ref>\n\nQuerns were widely used in grinding metals ores after mining extraction. The aim was to liberate fine ore particles which could then be separated by washing for example, prior to smelting. They were thus widely used in [[gold mining]] in antiquity.\n\nIn [[Shetland]] tobacco was not smoked when first introduced, but instead was ground up into [[Snuff (tobacco)|snuff]], and inhaled up the nose. Snuff-querns consisted of an upper and lower stone, fixed together by a central iron pivot. The quern was held on the user's lap, the eye of the quern was filled with dried tobacco leaves, and then the upper-stone was turned using the handle. The friction caused by the turning ground the leaves into a fine powder that built up around the edge of the lower-stone. Many snuff-querns had a small hole or cut made near the edge of the upper-stone, into which a pointed end of a lamb's horn was placed in order to turn the stone; an alternative to using a handle.<ref>[http://www.scran.ac.uk/000-000-591-022-C Snuff Quern.

These quern-stones are only about 30 cm wide.]]\nThere are, however, more surprising recorded uses of quern-stones. For example, DeBoer, in his review of the traditional gambling games of North American tribes, reports that one of the games involved bouncing a group of split canes off a quern.<ref>DeBoer 2001:223.</ref>\n\nViolence is recorded thus in the [[Old Testament]] in the [[Book of Judges]] (9:53; [[NRSV]]): \u201cBut a certain woman threw an upper-millstone on [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]]\u2019s head, and crushed his skull.\u201d\n\n==Manufacture of quern-stones==\nThe best type of stone from which to manufacture quern-stones are [[igneous]] rocks such as [[basalt]]. These have naturally rough surfaces, but grains do not detach easily, so the material being ground does not become gritty. However, such rocks are not always available, meaning that quern-stones have been manufactured from a wide variety of rocks, including [[sandstone]], [[quartzite]] and [[limestone]]. [[Quernmore]] Crag near [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in England is named after the quarrying of millstone grit used to make quern stones in these parts. The names of the mountains of [[Whernside]] and [[Great Whernside]] in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] have the same origin.\n\nRutter was able to show, for the southern Levant, that basalt quern-stones were preferred to those manufactured from other rock types. Basalt quern-stones were therefore transported over long-distances, leading him to argue that, despite their everyday, utilitarian function, they were also used as a [[status symbol]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rutter|first=Graham|title=Basaltic-rock procurement systems in the southern Levant|date=2003|publisher=PhD thesis, University of Durham|page=236|url=http://0lem.wordpress.com/2011/06/16/basalt-procurement/|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n\nResearch in Scotland has indicated that to a degree regional styles existed.<ref name=\"McLaren\">{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 122 - 125 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}</ref>\n[[File:Native women grinding wheat, Palestine.tiff|thumb| Women grind grain with a quern, [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (1900)]]\n\n==Evolution of quern-stones==\n[[Knocking stone]]s were used in the preparation of small quantities of cereal however the earliest forms of quern were the saddle and trough querns. The earliest quern so far discovered dates to c. 9,000 BCE and was found at Abu Hureyra, Syria.<ref name=\"britmus\"/> A later development was the rotary quern, which takes several forms.\n\n===Saddle quern===\nThe saddle quern is produced by rocking or rolling the muller using parallel motions (i.e., pushing and pulling the handstone), which forms a shape looking like a [[saddle]]. These are the most ancient and widely used type of quern-stone and were superseded around the 5th to the 4th century BC by the more efficient rotary quern.<ref>{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 105 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}</ref> The handstones for saddle querns are generally either roughly cylindrical (not unlike a [[rolling pin]]) and used with both hands, or rough hemispheres and used with one hand. This provides a crushing motion, not a grinding action and is more suitable for crushing malted grain. It is not easy to produce flour from a saddle quern with unmalted grain. The muller is also referred to as a 'rubber' or 'mouler'.<ref>MacSween, A & Sharp, M (1989), ''Prehistoric Scotland.'' London : B.T.Batsford. {{ISBN|0-7134-6173-X}}. p. 17.</ref>\n\n===Rotary hand quern===\nAs the name implies, the rotary quern used circular motions to grind the material, meaning both the quern and the handstone were generally circular. The handstone of a rotary quern is much heavier than that of saddle quern and provides the necessary weight for the grinding of unmalted grain into flour. In some cases the grinding surfaces of the stones fit into each other, the upper stone being slightly concave and the lower one convex.\n[[File:Quern at Estonian Open Air Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Rotary Hand Quern at the Estonian Open Air Museum]]\n\n{{See also|Jato (Stone Grinder)|Mo (grist mill)}}\n\n====Beehive quern====\n[[File:Quern stones.JPG|left|thumb|190px|<center>Querns from the [[Whithorn]] Museum</center>]] In this type the upper stone is hemispherical, or bun-shaped, with a central conical hopper to hold the grain that falls down a hole to the grinding surface. It is held in position with a pivot that fits into a central hole in the bottom stone. The upper stone also has a deep horizontal socket in its steep side in which to place the wooden peg used as a handle to rotate or oscillate the upper stone. This was the earliest type of rotary quern to appear in the British Isles. It arrived in Britain in the middle of the Iron Age (about 400-300 BC) and spread into the northern half of Ireland, probably from Scotland, some time after the 2nd century BC.<ref name=\"J.T.

Woodcut from [[Thomas Pennant]]'s 1772 book ''A Tour in Scotland''.]]\n\nGarnett in his 1800 tour of Scotland describes the use of a hand quern as follows: \"The quern consists of two circular pieces of stone, generally grit or granite, about twenty inches in diameter. In the lower stone is a wooden peg, rounded at the top; on this the upper stone is nicely balanced, so as just to touch the lower one, by means of a piece of wood fixed in a large hole in this upper piece, but which does not fill the hole, room for feeding the mill being left on each side: it is so nicely balanced, that though there is some friction from the contact of the two stones, yet a very small momentum will make it revolve several times, when it has no corn in it. The corn being dried, two women sit down on the ground, having the quern between them; the one feeds it, while the other turns it round, relieving each other occasionally, and singing some Celtic songs all the time.\"<ref name=\"Garnett155\"/>\n\n====Miniature quern====\nUnder {{convert|200|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter and varying from roughly dressed to carefully worked, often with vertical handle sockets, a new class of querns has been identified having been overlooked in the past as weights, etc. In all respects they are like full sized quern stones and they show the typical wear signs that indicate that they were used for grinding small amounts of seeds, minerals or herbs. A suggestion that they may have been made as toys is thought to be unlikely.<ref name=\"McLaren2008\">{{cite journal | authors = McLaren D, Hunter F| year = 2008 | title = New aspects of rotary querns in Scotland| journal = Proc Soc Antiq Scot | volume = 138 | pages = 119 - 122 | ISSN = 0081-1564 | url =}}</ref>\n\n===Other types of quern stones===\nOther forms of quern-stone include hopper-rubbers and Pompeian mills, both used by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. The larger rotary mills were usually worked by a donkey or horse via an extension arm of wood attached to the upper stone.\n[[File:Roman mill.ogg|thumb|right|Sound of a Roman mill.]]\n\nQuerns utilizing crank-and-connecting rods were used in the [[Western Han Dynasty]], coined with the term \"Long\" or \"Long Mo\", as displayed in stone reliefs unearthed in Chonggang and Sihong in Jiangsu province. Although the earliest Long was made of stone like the typical quern, these were later replaced by wood, soil, or other materials. Querns made out of soil were enclosed in a circular bamboo weave.

Various legends give miraculous power to mill-stones and several have been found which have been re-used in the construction of burial cists or as tomb stones. The association between quern stones and burial may be because they are used in the process of making bread, the staple of life.

He was the grandson of the former [[prime minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]] and elder brother of the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]. He was married three times, lastly to [[Elizabeth von Arnim]], who caricatured him in her novel ''[[Vera (novel)|Vera]]''.<ref>Erica Brown. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=155 Literary Encyclopedia: Elizabeth von Arnim (1866\u20131941)].</ref> Despite his landmark achievements in other respects, this Earl Russell is most famous for being tried for [[bigamy]] in the House of Lords in 1901, and was known to Edwardian society as the \"Wicked Earl\".\n\n== Education ==\nRussell proved hard work for his grandparents and was sent to school; first [[Cheam School|Cheam]] (1877) and then [[Winchester College]] (Jan 1879).  Winchester became his spiritual home and the friends he made there his surrogate family.  It was there that he befriended poet and critic [[Lionel Johnson]], whom he would describe as \u201cthe greatest influence of my life at Winchester\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life and Adventures|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=Cassell & Co.|year=1923|isbn=|location=London|pages=89}}</ref> though Johnson was the younger man.  When Russell went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1883, the pair wrote long, earnest letters to each other in which they explored spiritual matters and questions of sin and morality.  Twice the correspondence was banned by Johnson's father who feared that Russell's Buddhist beliefs would have a baneful influence on Johnson's welfare as a Christian.  Not to be thwarted, Russell engaged an Oxford friend, [[Charles Edward Sayle]], to correspond with Johnson on his behalf.  Johnson also corresponded with Sayle's Rugby friend [[John Haden Badley|Jack Badley]].  In 1919, Russell anonymously published Johnson's side of the correspondence with all three as ''Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=George Allen & Unwin Ltd|year=1919|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Oxford ==\nAt Balliol, Russell read Classics.  The famous Greek scholar [[Benjamin Jowett]] was then Master of Balliol and also Vice-Chancellor of the University.  Russell found Oxford stimulating, welcoming the \u201cuntrammelled and unfettered discussions on everything in heaven and earth\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life and Adventures|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=104}}</ref> But his Oxford career was cut dramatically short when in May 1885, he was sent down by Jowett for supposedly writing a \"scandalous\" letter to another male undergraduate.  Russell denied the charges but was refused a formal inquiry. Incensed at having been falsely accused, he lost his temper with Jowett, telling him he was no gentleman, and left the college.  In an unprecedented move, Jowett blocked Russell's return to Balliol and denied him the necessary ''bene discessit'' to enable him to transfer to Cambridge with his approbation.  After leaving Oxford, Russell toured the USA where he met philosopher [[George Santayana]].  The pair became lifelong friends and later George Santayana would claim that Russell told him in confidence that the real reason for his sending down was that Lionel Johnson had stayed overnight in his rooms and when spotted by the authorities had been declared too young to be Russell's \"natural friend\"; though there is evidence to suggest that even this is not the real version of events.  Nevertheless, the scandal, which remains steeped in mystery, would be revisited on Russell throughout his life, casting doubt on his sexuality, and, according to Santayana, earning him the epithet \"Wicked Earl\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Derham|first=Ruth|date=Winter 2017-18|title='A Very Improper Friend': the influence of Jowett and Oxford on Frank Russell.|url=https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/article/view/3415|journal=Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies|volume=37:2|pages=267\u2013362|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Marital history==\nFrank Russell was twice divorced, and separated permanently from his third and last wife three years after they married.  He also had extramarital affairs.\n\nHis first wife was Mabel Edith Scott, daughter of \"adventuress\" Lady Selina (Lina) Scott and her husband Sir Claude Edward Scott (1840-1880) of the [[Scott baronets|Scott baronets of Lytchet Minster]]. They married in 1890. The marriage was a disaster, lasting only 3 months.  Mabel tried to divorce him (and lost) in 1891, accusing him in the process of \"immoral behaviour\" with another university friend, Herbert Ainslie Roberts.  Having failed to convince the jury, she subsequently attempted to obtain a separation by indirect means, suing for restitution of conjugal rights in 1894.<ref>Under the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1884]], failure to comply with an order of restitution of conjugal rights served to establish desertion (\"statutory desertion\") which gave the other spouse the right to an immediate decree of [[judicial separation]], and, if coupled with the husband\u2019s [[adultery]], allowed the wife to obtain an immediate [[divorce]]. See [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228673/0369.pdf] </ref> The Earl counter-sued on the ground that her continued accusations of sodomy amounted to legal cruelty, and was granted a judicial separation in 1895.  Mabel appealed and the verdict was overturned. The case went all the way to the House of Lords where the appellate judges denied both satisfaction, binding the definition of legal cruelty to physical violence and making ''Russell v. Russell'' [2] a case of legal significance for the next 70 years.  Russell's mother-in-law also tried to harass him, by distributing 500 statements to members of the Commons and Lords, to relatives, the press and other key figures in society, accusing Russell of sodomy.  He sued for criminal libel and Lina was convicted at the Old Bailey in 1897 and sentenced to 8 months' imprisonment.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E3DC163DE433A25756C1A9619C94669ED7CF \"LADY SCOTT TO BE RELEASED.; Her Eight Months in Holloway for Libeling Earl Russell Expired.\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 15 July 1897.

Von Arnim had a three-year affair with [[H.G. Wells]], and ended her relationship with Wells when his other lover [[Rebecca West]] became pregnant. She became involved with Russell in 1914 and married him on 11 February 1916.<ref>C.D. Merriman.

Brown says that Elizabeth would have been happy to have continued the affair, but Frank Russell wanted to divorce his second wife and marry her.</ref> The marriage failed quickly and acrimoniously, and the couple separated in 1919. However, they never divorced. Von Arnim famously caricatured Russell in her 1921 novel ''Vera'' and in response he whitewashed her from his memoirs written in 1923. At the start of the Second World War von Arnim moved to the United States, where she died in 1941.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&product_id=6754 ''The Enchanted April''] NYRB Classics</ref>\n\nEarl Russell had no children, but his second and third marriages brought him several stepchildren. His second wife, Mollie, had one son by her first husband and two sons by her second husband. His third wife, Elizabeth, had five children by her first husband.\n\n==Russell as a motoring enthusiast==\nRussell was an early motorist and an active member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|RAC]] and [https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Motor_Union_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland Motor Union]. He was an outspoken defender of motorists' rights.  He is famed for having the registration A 1. This is frequently reported as being the first number plate issued in Britain, but it is not \u2013 it was, however, the first registration issued by the [[London County Council]] (LCC). \"Motoring Illustrated\" of 19 December 1903 reported that the London County Council started issuing numbers on 7 December 1903, whereas other authorities started before that date. From surviving records, the first number known to have been issued is Hastings' DY 1 issued on 23 November 1903<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Newall|first1=Les|title=A 1 \u2013 Britain's First Registration|journal=\"1903 and All That\" Newsletter|date=September 1995|issue=61|pages=8}}</ref>. It is also frequently reported that the Earl queued all night to obtain the number and only just beat another potential applicant for the number by a few seconds. There does not appear to be any contemporary record of this in motoring journals, though several report that he obtained the number A 1. Thus, it seems unlikely that this story is correct too.\n\n==Political and legal career==\nAfter the passing of the [[Local Government Act 1894|1894 Local Government Act]], Russell was elected to Cookham Parish and District Councils and became a [[Board of guardians|Guardian of the Poor]] responsible for the administration of Maidenhead workhouse.   In the same year he also became JP for Berkshire.  In 1895 he was elected onto [[London County Council]] as Progressive Party candidate for West Newington.  After failing to take the Hammersmith seat in 1898, he was made an [[Alderman]].  He became a member of the [[National Liberal Club]] (NLC) and the [[Reform Club]].  \n\nAfter his release from prison, he sought to reform the divorce laws that had put him there, introducing four bills into the House of Lords over a six-year period (all of which were considered too radical) and established the ''Society for Promoting Reforms in the Marriage and Divorce Laws of England'' which was later absorbed into the ''Divorce Law Reform Union.''  With second wife, Mollie, he became an active campaigner for women's suffrage.  \n\nHe was called to the Bar at [[Gray's Inn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/russell1861.htm|title=Russell, Earl |work=Cracroft's Peerage|accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> in 1905 and defended both motorists and suffragists.  He published a treatise on the inequality of the divorce laws in 1912.  Russell's attempts to reform divorce laws were partly negated by his own personal history,<ref>Christopher Hudson.

He was the grandson of the former [[prime minister]] [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell]] and elder brother of the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]]. He was married three times, lastly to [[Elizabeth von Arnim]], who caricatured him in her novel ''[[Vera (novel)|Vera]]''.<ref>Erica Brown. [http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=155 Literary Encyclopedia: Elizabeth von Arnim (1866\u20131941)].</ref> Despite his landmark achievements in other respects, this Earl Russell is most famous for being tried for [[bigamy]] in the House of Lords in 1901, and was known to Edwardian society as the \"Wicked Earl\".\n\n== Education ==\nRussell proved hard work for his grandparents and was sent to school; first [[Cheam School|Cheam]] (1877) and then [[Winchester College]] (Jan 1879).  Winchester became his spiritual home and the friends he made there his surrogate family.  It was there that he befriended poet and critic [[Lionel Johnson]], whom he would describe as \u201cthe greatest influence of my life at Winchester\u201d<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life and Adventures|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=Cassell & Co.|year=1923|isbn=|location=London|pages=89}}</ref> though Johnson was the younger man.  When Russell went up to [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1883, the pair wrote long, earnest letters to each other in which they explored spiritual matters and questions of sin and morality.  Twice the correspondence was banned by Johnson's father who feared that Russell's Buddhist beliefs would have a baneful influence on Johnson's welfare as a Christian.  Not to be thwarted, Russell engaged an Oxford friend, [[Charles Edward Sayle]], to correspond with Johnson on his behalf.  Johnson also corresponded with Sayle's Rugby friend [[John Haden Badley|Jack Badley]].  In 1919, Russell anonymously published Johnson's side of the correspondence with all three as ''Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson.''<ref>{{Cite book|title=Some Winchester Letters of Lionel Johnson|last=Russell|first=Earl|publisher=George Allen & Unwin Ltd|year=1919|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Oxford ==\nAt Balliol, Russell read Classics.  The famous Greek scholar [[Benjamin Jowett]] was then Master of Balliol and also Vice-Chancellor of the University.  Russell found Oxford stimulating, welcoming the \u201cuntrammelled and unfettered discussions on everything in heaven and earth\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|title=My Life and Adventures|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=104}}</ref> But his Oxford career was cut dramatically short when in May 1885, he was sent down by Jowett for supposedly writing a \"scandalous\" letter to another male undergraduate.  Russell denied the charges but was refused a formal inquiry. Incensed at having been falsely accused, he lost his temper with Jowett, telling him he was no gentleman, and left the college.  In an unprecedented move, Jowett blocked Russell's return to Balliol and denied him the necessary ''bene discessit'' to enable him to transfer to Cambridge with his approbation.  After leaving Oxford, Russell toured the USA where he met philosopher [[George Santayana]].  The pair became lifelong friends and later George Santayana would claim that Russell told him in confidence that the real reason for his sending down was that Lionel Johnson had stayed overnight in his rooms and when spotted by the authorities had been declared too young to be Russell's \"natural friend\"; though there is evidence to suggest that even this is not the real version of events.  Nevertheless, the scandal, which remains steeped in mystery, would be revisited on Russell throughout his life, casting doubt on his sexuality, and, according to Santayana, earning him the epithet \"Wicked Earl\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Derham|first=Ruth|date=Winter 2017-18|title='A Very Improper Friend': the influence of Jowett and Oxford on Frank Russell.|url=https://mulpress.mcmaster.ca/russelljournal/article/view/3415|journal=Russell: The Journal of Bertrand Russell Studies|volume=37:2|pages=267\u2013362|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Marital history==\nFrank Russell was twice divorced, and separated permanently from his third and last wife three years after they married.  He also had extramarital affairs.\n\nHis first wife was Mabel Edith Scott, daughter of \"adventuress\" Lady Selina (Lina) Scott and her husband Sir Claude Edward Scott (1840-1880) of the [[Scott baronets|Scott baronets of Lytchet Minster]]. They married in 1890. The marriage was a disaster, lasting only 3 months.  Mabel tried to divorce him (and lost) in 1891, accusing him in the process of \"immoral behaviour\" with another university friend, Herbert Ainslie Roberts.  Having failed to convince the jury, she subsequently attempted to obtain a separation by indirect means, suing for restitution of conjugal rights in 1894.<ref>Under the [[Matrimonial Causes Act 1884]], failure to comply with an order of restitution of conjugal rights served to establish desertion (\"statutory desertion\") which gave the other spouse the right to an immediate decree of [[judicial separation]], and, if coupled with the husband\u2019s [[adultery]], allowed the wife to obtain an immediate [[divorce]]. See [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/228673/0369.pdf] </ref> The Earl counter-sued on the ground that her continued accusations of sodomy amounted to legal cruelty, and was granted a judicial separation in 1895.  Mabel appealed and the verdict was overturned. The case went all the way to the House of Lords where the appellate judges denied both satisfaction, binding the definition of legal cruelty to physical violence and making ''Russell v. Russell'' [2] a case of legal significance for the next 70 years.  Russell's mother-in-law also tried to harass him, by distributing 500 statements to members of the Commons and Lords, to relatives, the press and other key figures in society, accusing Russell of sodomy.  He sued for criminal libel and Lina was convicted at the Old Bailey in 1897 and sentenced to 8 months' imprisonment.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C07E3DC163DE433A25756C1A9619C94669ED7CF \"LADY SCOTT TO BE RELEASED.; Her Eight Months in Holloway for Libeling Earl Russell Expired.\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' 15 July 1897.

Von Arnim had a three-year affair with [[H.G. Wells]], and ended her relationship with Wells when his other lover [[Rebecca West]] became pregnant. She became involved with Russell in 1914 and married him on 11 February 1916.<ref>C.D. Merriman.

Brown says that Elizabeth would have been happy to have continued the affair, but Frank Russell wanted to divorce his second wife and marry her.</ref> The marriage failed quickly and acrimoniously, and the couple separated in 1919. However, they never divorced. Von Arnim famously caricatured Russell in her 1921 novel ''Vera'' and in response he whitewashed her from his memoirs written in 1923. At the start of the Second World War von Arnim moved to the United States, where she died in 1941.<ref>[http://www.nybooks.com/shop/product?usca_p=t&product_id=6754 ''The Enchanted April''] NYRB Classics</ref>\n\nEarl Russell had no children, but his second and third marriages brought him several stepchildren. His second wife, Mollie, had one son by her first husband and two sons by her second husband. His third wife, Elizabeth, had five children by her first husband.\n\n==Russell as a motoring enthusiast==\nRussell was an early motorist and an active member of the [[Royal Automobile Club|RAC]] and [https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Motor_Union_of_Great_Britain_and_Ireland Motor Union]. He was an outspoken defender of motorists' rights.  He is famed for having the registration A 1. This is frequently reported as being the first number plate issued in Britain, but it is not \u2013 it was, however, the first registration issued by the [[London County Council]] (LCC). \"Motoring Illustrated\" of 19 December 1903 reported that the London County Council started issuing numbers on 7 December 1903, whereas other authorities started before that date. From surviving records, the first number known to have been issued is Hastings' DY 1 issued on 23 November 1903<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Newall|first1=Les|title=A 1 \u2013 Britain's First Registration|journal=\"1903 and All That\" Newsletter|date=September 1995|issue=61|pages=8}}</ref>. It is also frequently reported that the Earl queued all night to obtain the number and only just beat another potential applicant for the number by a few seconds. There does not appear to be any contemporary record of this in motoring journals, though several report that he obtained the number A 1. Thus, it seems unlikely that this story is correct too.\n\n==Political and legal career==\nAfter the passing of the [[Local Government Act 1894|1894 Local Government Act]], Russell was elected to Cookham Parish and District Councils and became a [[Board of guardians|Guardian of the Poor]] responsible for the administration of Maidenhead workhouse.   In the same year he also became JP for Berkshire.  In 1895 he was elected onto [[London County Council]] as Progressive Party candidate for West Newington.  After failing to take the Hammersmith seat in 1898, he was made an [[Alderman]].  He became a member of the [[National Liberal Club]] (NLC) and the [[Reform Club]].  \n\nAfter his release from prison, he sought to reform the divorce laws that had put him there, introducing four bills into the House of Lords over a six-year period (all of which were considered too radical) and established the ''Society for Promoting Reforms in the Marriage and Divorce Laws of England'' which was later absorbed into the ''Divorce Law Reform Union.''  With second wife, Mollie, he became an active campaigner for women's suffrage.  \n\nHe was called to the Bar at [[Gray's Inn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/russell1861.htm|title=Russell, Earl |work=Cracroft's Peerage|accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> in 1905 and defended both motorists and suffragists.  He published a treatise on the inequality of the divorce laws in 1912.  Russell's attempts to reform divorce laws were partly negated by his own personal history,<ref>Christopher Hudson.
