Among the more occasional hosts were [[Steve Rider]], [[Des Lynam]], [[Sue Barker]] and [[Lee McKenzie]].\n\n==Production==\nIn the early days of the programme, all races were commentated at [[BBC Television Centre]] in [[London]] due to the high costs of travelling to races with live broadcasts done on location.<ref>{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Simon|title=Lunch with...Murray Walker|url=https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-2011/70/lunch-murray-walker|publisher=MotorSport Magazine|date=April 2011|accessdate=}}</ref> <ref>F1 Racing, Issue: April 2012, Page 35</ref> The team would not usually travel to non-European races to commentate unless another broadcaster paid for the travel expenses. Murray Walker would usually be flown to the location of the tracks to record a short scene before returning to England to watch the race from London with some broadcasts having commentary live with highlights aired or recorded commentary in highlights. On occasions the BBC employed a \"ghost commentator\" which was someone who would be in touch with the production team in London and gained access to timing monitors so that cameras could record what was occurring off the track. The first \"ghost commentator\" was Mark Fogarty with [[Joe Saward]] taking over in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saward|first=Joe|title=Behind the scenes at the BBC|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00239.html|publisher=grandprix.com|date=1 September 1996|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Conception==\nFollowing the excitement and interest of the [[1976 Formula One season]], the [[BBC]] decided to cover all races from 1978. The BBC originally wanted to have [[Raymond Baxter]] as commentator but his commitments with [[Tomorrow's World]] and air shows that aired on BBC taking his priority, BBC had [[Murray Walker]] on their list as well and Walker got the job.\n\n==History==\n===1978-1996===\nThe first broadcast of the programme came at the [[1978 Monaco Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1978-05-07|title= BBC Two England - 7 May 1978 - BBC Genome|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The corporation had initially shown the odd race that featured on the calendar before they showed some of the races live in [[Sunday Grandstand]] and the rest as highlights in Grand Prix.

By the 1990s all of the European races were broadcast live with the summer races shown as part of ''[[Sunday Grandstand]]'', with highlights on the Grand Prix programme. Some races were shown on Grand Prix due to either race times in the morning/evening or because ''[[Grandstand]]'' was showing another major event at the same time. 1992 saw [[Jonathan Palmer]] join as a pit reporter for the live races but following the [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix]], Hunt died from a heart attack and was replaced in the commentary box by Jonathan Palmer. For the following race in France, BBC aired a tribute show to Hunt following their highlights show. In 1995, all the races were shown live and all qualifying sessions were shown live in 1996 - previously, qualifying was shown as a brief report during [[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]], apart from qualifying for the [[British Grand Prix]] which was generally shown live and in full. Many of these live races were fronted by [[Steve Rider]]. \n\n===End of ''Grand Prix''===\nIn 1995 it was announced that the [[BBC]] had lost the television broadcast rights to Formula One to [[ITV Network|ITV]] for the 1997 season. Murray Walker would continue in his role as the lead commentator.<ref>F1 Racing, Issue: September 2011, Page 33</ref> The final race broadcast by the programme was the [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix]] in which viewers saw [[Damon Hill]] win his only world championship. The loss of coverage was an example of [[BBC Sport]] department's decline in the late 1990s.\n===2009-2011===\nIn March 2008, ITV announced the coverage would be transferred to the BBC from the 2009 season. BBC hired\n\n===2012-2015===\nIn July 2011, BBC announced that half their races would be live from 2012 and got a contract to 2018 with [[Sky Sports]] covering all races. Brundle and Kravitz left BBC for Sky and the end of 2011 and were replaced by [[Ben Edwards (commentator)|Ben Edwards]] as lead commentator and former [[Jordan Grand Prix]] designer [[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|Gary Anderson]] joining as reporter and technical analyst. Jake Humphrey continued to host, Eddie Jordan analysed on live races and David Coulthard stayed as color Commentator. Humphrey was forced to skip Canada and Europe due to him hosting [[Euro 2012]] for [[BBC]]'s [[Match of the Day]] and then skipped Germany and Hungary due to him hosting the [[2012 Olympics]] for [[BBC]], Lee McKenzie filled in for him at these races and her role was taken by [[Tom Clarkson]]. Humphrey left at the end of 2012 to join [[BT Sport]] and was replaced by [[Suzi Perry]], Allan Mcnish joined as analyst and Clarkson joined full Time. BBC aired all three practice session for their live races on [[BBC Two]] or [[BBC Three]]. Anderson left at the end of 2013.\n\n===''Grand Prix'' Axed===\nIn late 2015, BBC wanted a budget cut of \u00a321 million to the sports department.

The first \"ghost commentator\" was Mark Fogarty with [[Joe Saward]] taking over in the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saward|first=Joe|title=Behind the scenes at the BBC|url=http://www.grandprix.com/ft/ft00239.html|publisher=grandprix.com|date=1 September 1996|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Conception==\nFollowing the excitement and interest of the [[1976 Formula One season]], the [[BBC]] decided to cover all races from 1978. The BBC originally wanted to have [[Raymond Baxter]] as commentator but his commitments with [[Tomorrow's World]] and air shows that aired on BBC taking his priority, BBC had [[Murray Walker]] on their list as well and Walker got the job.\n\n==History==\n===1978-1996===\nThe first broadcast of the programme came at the [[1978 Monaco Grand Prix]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbctwo/england/1978-05-07|title= BBC Two England - 7 May 1978 - BBC Genome|publisher=bbc.co.uk}}</ref> The corporation had initially shown the odd race that featured on the calendar before they showed some of the races live in [[Sunday Grandstand]] and the rest as highlights in Grand Prix. The show had featured one of the most iconic theme tunes in sport, with Fleetwood Mac's \"[[The Chain]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crash.net/motorsports/in_depth/97/bbc.html|title=BBC F1 - Formula One Racing|publisher=www.crash.net|access-date=1 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403203959/http://www.crash.net/motorsports/in_depth/97/bbc.html|archive-date=3 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> 1979 saw [[James Hunt]] join the commentary booth alongside Walker after Hunt announced his retirement from racing that year. By the 1990s all of the European races were broadcast live with the summer races shown as part of ''[[Sunday Grandstand]]'', with highlights on the Grand Prix programme. Some races were shown on Grand Prix due to either race times in the morning/evening or because ''[[Grandstand]]'' was showing another major event at the same time. 1992 saw [[Jonathan Palmer]] join as a pit reporter for the live races but following the [[1993 Canadian Grand Prix]], Hunt died from a heart attack and was replaced in the commentary box by Jonathan Palmer. For the following race in France, BBC aired a tribute show to Hunt following their highlights show. In 1995, all the races were shown live and all qualifying sessions were shown live in 1996 - previously, qualifying was shown as a brief report during [[Grandstand (TV series)|Grandstand]], apart from qualifying for the [[British Grand Prix]] which was generally shown live and in full. Many of these live races were fronted by [[Steve Rider]]. \n\n===End of ''Grand Prix''===\nIn 1995 it was announced that the [[BBC]] had lost the television broadcast rights to Formula One to [[ITV Network|ITV]] for the 1997 season. Murray Walker would continue in his role as the lead commentator.<ref>F1 Racing, Issue: September 2011, Page 33</ref> The final race broadcast by the programme was the [[1996 Japanese Grand Prix]] in which viewers saw [[Damon Hill]] win his only world championship. The loss of coverage was an example of [[BBC Sport]] department's decline in the late 1990s.\n===2009-2011===\nIn March 2008, ITV announced the coverage would be transferred to the BBC from the 2009 season. BBC hired\n\n===2012-2015===\nIn July 2011, BBC announced that half their races would be live from 2012 and got a contract to 2018 with [[Sky Sports]] covering all races. Brundle and Kravitz left BBC for Sky and the end of 2011 and were replaced by [[Ben Edwards (commentator)|Ben Edwards]] as lead commentator and former [[Jordan Grand Prix]] designer [[Gary Anderson (motorsport)|Gary Anderson]] joining as reporter and technical analyst. Jake Humphrey continued to host, Eddie Jordan analysed on live races and David Coulthard stayed as color Commentator. Humphrey was forced to skip Canada and Europe due to him hosting [[Euro 2012]] for [[BBC]]'s [[Match of the Day]] and then skipped Germany and Hungary due to him hosting the [[2012 Olympics]] for [[BBC]], Lee McKenzie filled in for him at these races and her role was taken by [[Tom Clarkson]]. Humphrey left at the end of 2012 to join [[BT Sport]] and was replaced by [[Suzi Perry]], Allan Mcnish joined as analyst and Clarkson joined full Time. BBC aired all three practice session for their live races on [[BBC Two]] or [[BBC Three]]. Anderson left at the end of 2013.\n\n===''Grand Prix'' Axed===\nIn late 2015, BBC wanted a budget cut of \u00a321 million to the sports department. In December 2015, BBC axed Grand Prix as part of their budget cuts and was replaced by [[Channel 4]] from 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2008/3/7516.html|title= The BBC wins rights to UK Formula One coverage|publisher=formula1.com}}</ref>\n\nSome episodes are still available but hidden on the BBC's website.\n\n==Broadcast History==\nHere's the history of the broadcasts BBC did on [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two]], [[BBC Three]], [[BBC HD]] or [[BBC Red Button]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://forums.autosport.com/topic/112436-a-detailed-look-into-uk-f1-television-ratings/page-19|title= F1 ratings|publisher=Autosport.com}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\"\n|-\n!
