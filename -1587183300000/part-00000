A single dark red to purplish red, sometimes pink, green or white flower, {{convert|8-12|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and wide is borne on a thread-like flowering stem {{convert|20-40|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long. The [[wikt:dorsal|dorsal]] [[sepal]] is narrow egg-shaped, {{convert|4-6|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wide. The [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] sepals are a similar length to the dorsal sepal but are about {{convert|3|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and joined to each other. The [[petal]]s spread widely and are about {{convert|4.5-7|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide. The labellum is {{convert|4-6|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and only about {{convert|0.5|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wide. It has a fringe of long, fine hairs and vibrates in the slightest breeze.

The [[wikt:lateral|lateral]] sepals are a similar length to the dorsal sepal but are about {{convert|3|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and joined to each other. The [[petal]]s spread widely and are about {{convert|4.5-7|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and about {{convert|2|mm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide. The labellum is {{convert|4-6|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} long and only about {{convert|0.5|mm|in|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wide. It has a fringe of long, fine hairs and vibrates in the slightest breeze.

After finding rest in states of meditative absorption, they are encouraged and awakened by the Buddha's body speech and mind to reach final Nirvana. Inspired by the Buddha, they then cultivate [[Bodhicita]] and practice the [[Bodhisattva]] path.<ref>Khenpo Konchog Gyaltsen Rinpoche, \"Jewel Ornament of Liberation.\" 1998, p. 51-53</ref>\n\n==In the J\u0101takas==\nPratyekabuddhas (e.g. Dar\u012bmukha J.378, Sonaka J.529) appear as teachers of Buddhist doctrine in pre-Buddhist times in several of the [[Jataka tales]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Mushi-dokugo]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Kloppenborg, Ria (1974).

By the end of 2014, three more pre-serial prototypes were flown: number '2012' on 26 July 2014, number '2013' on 29 November 2014 and finally number '2015' on 19 December 2014.\n\nOn 13 September 2015, a new prototype, marked '2016', began testing. It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently changed [[diverterless supersonic inlet|DSI bumps]] on the intakes, which save weight, complexity and radar signature. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than on its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian [[AL-31]] or Chinese [[Shenyang WS-10]] turbofan engines, though, by 2020 the J-20 is planned to use the 18\u201319 ton [[WS-15]] engine, enabling the jet to super-cruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards facing radars or electronic jamming equipment. The fuselage extends almost entirely up to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its \"2014\" and \"2015\" predecessors, the J-20's fuselage contains more of engine's surface area inside the stealthy fuselage, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy radar.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.popsci.com/stealthier-stealth-seventh-upgraded-chinese-stealth-fighter-prototype-aims-to-take-flight | title = Stealthier stealth: seventh upgraded Chinese stealth fighter prototype aims to take flight | newspaper = Popular sciende}}.</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered '2017', took to the sky. The most significant change in the new prototype is the reshaped cockpit canopy, which provides the pilot with greater visibility. The lack of other design changes suggest that \"2017\" is very close to the final J-20 production configuration. Since '2017' is likely the last J-20 prototype, low rate initial production of the J-20 is likely to begin in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/2017-prototype-heralds-end-an-era-for-j-20-fighter-jet-testing-start-another-era|title=China Is Building The World's Second Stealth Air Force|accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref> It has been reported that the design of J-20 is already mature and will not directly use the 117S engine.<ref name= \"mil.news.sina.com.cn\">{{Citation |contribution = Mil |title = News |publisher = Sina |date = 25 November 2015 |contribution-url = http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/2015-11-25/0848844774.html}}</ref>\n\nAs of March 2017 there were still a series of technical problems that needed to be tackled, including the reliability of its WS-15 engines, the aircraft's flight control system, stealth coatings and hull materials, and infrared sensor.<ref name=\"Johnson_2017-03-16\">{{cite web |last1=Johnson |first1=Reuben F. |url=http://www.janes.com/article/68755/chengdu-j-20-has-entered-service-claims-chinese-media |title=Chengdu J-20 has 'entered service', claims Chinese media |website=Jane's 360 |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=27 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316140730/http://www.janes.com/article/68755/chengdu-j-20-has-entered-service-claims-chinese-media |archive-date=16 March 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Production===\nIn late December 2015, a new J-20 numbered 2101 was spotted; it is believed to be the [[Low rate initial production|LRIP]] version of the aircraft.<ref name=\"j20_lrip\">{{cite web |url= http://plarealtalk.com/2016/01/27/j-20-first-lrip-airframe-maiden-flight-serial-number-2101/ |title= J-20 first LRIP airframe maiden flight (serial number 2101) |date=27 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, Chinese media reported that [[Chengdu Aerospace Corporation]] (CAC) initiated a series production for the J-20 and is on a path towards achieving full operational capability with the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.janes.com/article/75232/china-s-j-20-fifth-gen-fighter-moves-into-series-production |title= China's J-20 fifth-gen fighter moves into series production  |publisher=Jane's 360 |date=26 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://thediplomat.com/2017/10/chinas-first-5th-generation-fighter-moves-into-serial-production/ |title= China\u2019s First 5th Generation Fighter Moves into Serial Production  |magazine=The Diplomat |date=31 October 2017}}</ref> Initially, the lack of a suitable indigenously produced engine hindered the mass production of the J-20, however in September 2018, it was reported that issues with the development of the WS-15 engine, particularly the reliability of the turbine blades overheating at top speeds are fixed and after further minor refinements it should be ready for widespread installation by the end of 2018.<ref>{{cite news| last = Chan| first = Minnie| title = China 'nearing mass production' of J-20 stealth fighter after engine problems ironed out| work = South China Morning Post| date = 5 September 2018| url = https://m.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2162765/china-nearing-mass-production-j-20-stealth-fighter-after-engine?amp=1| accessdate = 14 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Deployment===\nAt least six J-20s are in active service, with tail numbers 78271-78276 identified.

It had noticeable improvements, such as apparently changed [[diverterless supersonic inlet|DSI bumps]] on the intakes, which save weight, complexity and radar signature. The DSI changes suggested the possibility of more powerful engines being used than on its predecessors, likely to be an advanced 14-ton thrust derivative of the Russian [[AL-31]] or Chinese [[Shenyang WS-10]] turbofan engines, though, by 2020 the J-20 is planned to use the 18\u201319 ton [[WS-15]] engine, enabling the jet to super-cruise without using afterburners. The trapezoidal flight booms around the engines were enlarged, possibly to accommodate rearwards facing radars or electronic jamming equipment. The fuselage extends almost entirely up to the engine's exhaust nozzles. Compared to its \"2014\" and \"2015\" predecessors, the J-20's fuselage contains more of engine's surface area inside the stealthy fuselage, providing greater rear-facing stealth against enemy radar.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.popsci.com/stealthier-stealth-seventh-upgraded-chinese-stealth-fighter-prototype-aims-to-take-flight | title = Stealthier stealth: seventh upgraded Chinese stealth fighter prototype aims to take flight | newspaper = Popular sciende}}.</ref>\n\nIn November 2015, a new J-20 prototype, numbered '2017', took to the sky.
