(Most of NTA other shows were shown on WKY-TV, while ABC affiliate KGEO-TV only aired its ''NTA Film Spectacular'' [[anthology series]].) This relationship lasted until [[National Telefilm Associates]] discontinued the service in November 1961, when KWTV became exclusively affiliated with CBS.\n\nChannel 9\u2014which is one of the few television stations in the United States to have had the same callsign, ownership, primary network affiliation and over-the-air channel allocation throughout its history\u2014temporarily transmitted its signal from KOMA's {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} broadcast tower near the television station's Kelley Avenue studios. KWTV activated its permanent transmission facility in September 1954; at {{convert|1,572|ft|m}}, the tower\u2014which cost $650,000 to construct and weighed {{convert|525|ST|MT}}\u2014became the tallest man-made structure and the tallest free-standing broadcast tower in the world at that time. (It would be surpassed for the title in December 1956, when [[Roswell, New Mexico]]-based KSWS-TV [now [[KOBR]]] activated a {{convert|1,610|ft|m|adj=on|disp=sqbr}} [[KOBR-TV Tower|guy-wired tower]] in [[Caprock, New Mexico]].) To commemorate the new tower, an event that KWTV management estimated had 5,000 attendees, an amateur photography competition was held in which the winning pictures of the tower (with photography equipment donated by local camera stores being awarded to the finalists) would be chosen for inclusion in station publicity advertisements. A young [[Johnny Carson]], then the host of the CBS [[game show]] ''Earn Your Vacation'', served as [[master of ceremonies]] for the tower's dedication. The [[Oklahoma Educational Television Authority]] (OETA)\u2014which, per an agreement with the Oklahoma Television Corporation, was granted free use of the land near the KWTV studio and transmitter\u2014became a tenant on the tower in April 1956, when the [[non-commercial educational|educational broadcaster]]'s [[flagship (broadcasting)|flagship station]] KETA-TV (channel 13) activated its transmitter. (The tower was decommissioned following the transition of KWTV and KETA to digital-only broadcasts in the spring of 2009, as their digital transmitters were located on a separate tower between 122nd Street and the [[John Kilpatrick Turnpike]]; the antenna and the upper half of the tower were physically disassembled by engineers and crane equipment during the summer of 2014, and its remnant sections were imploded that October.)

(The program airs instead on News 9 Now, following a simulcast of the local morning newscast's Saturday edition.) Channel 9 may preempt some CBS programs to provide long-form [[breaking news]] or [[severe weather]] coverage when necessary, or air prime time specials produced by the station's news department. The preempted programs may either be diverted on a live-to-air basis to KSBI (which also holds the right to air any preempted syndicated programs if KWTV airs extended news coverage in their time periods) or\u2014less commonly since Griffin acquired KSBI\u2014[[broadcast delay|rebroadcast]] over KWTV in place of regularly scheduled overnight programs, although station personnel also gives viewers the option of watching them on CBS's website and [[mobile app]], [[CBS All Access]], or its cable/satellite [[video-on-demand]] service the day after their initial airing. (News 9 Now previously handled substitute CBS programming responsibilities from its conversion into an over-the-air-originated service in April 2011 until December 2014, when Griffin transferred those duties to KSBI upon assuming operational responsibilities for that station.) Syndicated programs broadcast by KWTV-DT {{as of|September 2019|lc=y}} include ''[[Dr. Phil (talk show)|Dr. Phil]]'', ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan]]'', ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]'', ''[[Extra (American TV program)|Extra]]'' and ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]''.<ref name=\"titantv-kwtv\">{{cite web|title=TitanTV Programming Guide -- What's on TV, Movies, Reality Shows and Local News: KWTV-DT schedule|url=http://kwtv.titantv.com/|website=TitanTV|publisher=Broadcast Interactive Media, LLC|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\nChannel 9 formerly served as the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]] (MDA)'s \"[[MDA Labor Day Telethon#Love Network|Love Network]]\" station for the Oklahoma City market, carrying the charity's [[MDA Labor Day Telethon|annual telethon]] on [[Labor Day]] and the preceding Sunday night each September from September 1973 until September 2010.

However, CBS usually did not raise objections to preemptions made by channel 9, since it has typically been one of the network's strongest affiliates. Until 1959, KWTV preempted the ''[[CBS Evening News]] with [[Douglas Edwards]]'' to air syndicated drama series. The station also preempted ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'' and ''[[Face the Nation]]'' from September 1984 until August 1995, in favor of carrying an extended block of local and syndicated religious programs on Sunday mornings; from the time they regained clearance until 2005, both programs were shown on a half-hour delay to accommodate an additional half-hour of the station's Sunday morning newscast. After ''Face the Nation'' expanded to a one-hour broadcast in April 2014, as certain other CBS affiliates have done since that time, KWTV aired the first half-hour of the [[Sunday morning talk show]] live-to-air on Sunday mornings and the second half-hour early Monday mornings on tape delay\u2014the latter scheduling being used previously for the show (in its former half-hour format) from June 1983 until KWTV's September 1984 removal of the program\u2014until February 2016 (during this time, the program aired in its entirety on KWTV-DT2 off its \"live\" feed through a partial simulcast with the station's main feed during ''FTN''{{'}}s first half-hour).\n\nIn September 1993, the station began carrying ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' on a one-hour delay to air syndicated programs during the 10:00&nbsp;a.m. hour, forcing ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' to be moved concurrently to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. After it had considered preempting the [[late night talk show|talk show]] because of contractual issues with its late-night syndication lineup shortly before it debuted that month, KWTV became one of a handful of CBS-affiliated stations to receive permission to air the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on a half-hour delay, so as not to displace a secondary run of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' it had aired after its 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast since 1989 (it also aired ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'' on such a delay for the same reason during the 1989\u201390 season, when KWTV resumed clearance of CBS's late night block, which had aired instead on Fox affiliate [[KAUT]] [channel 43, now an independent station] the season prior). Channel 9 would eventually give in to airing the ''Late Show'' in its network-designated 10:35 timeslot in September 1994; ''The Price Is Right'' and ''The Young and the Restless'', however, would continue to air on a delayed basis until both shows returned to their recommended timeslots in September 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman Makes His CBS Debut Monday at 11 p.m. on Channel 9|url=http://newsok.com/article/2440339|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=August 29, 1993|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=KWTV Unsure It'll Air David Letterman Show|url=http://newsok.com/article/2435322|author=C.S.

Channel 9 also aired the CBS Saturday morning children's block (now branded as the ''CBS Dream Team'') in two separate blocks until September 2010, with the majority of the block airing in pattern from 8:00 to 10:30&nbsp;a.m. and an additional half-hour airing on a one-week delay at 5:30&nbsp;a.m.\n\n===Sports programming===\nSeven years before Griffin Communications acquired the latter station, KWTV and KOTV in Tulsa partnered to simulcast three games involving the state's two [[Central Hockey League]] franchises, the [[Oklahoma City Blazers (1992\u20132009)|Oklahoma City Blazers]] and the [[Tulsa Oilers]], during the league's 1993\u201394 regular season; the respective [[sports director]]s of both stations at that time, Bill Teegins and John Walls, conducted play-by-play for the broadcasts, with KWTV sports anchor Ed Murray (who would later become a news anchor in 1999, and remain in that role until his retirement from television news in 2013) doing color commentary.<ref>{{cite news|title=KWTV, KOTV to Televise Blazers' Game With Tulsa|url=http://newsok.com/article/2446386|author=Dale Saviers|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=October 29, 1993|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> From 2000 to 2011, KWTV served as the broadcast home for [[Oklahoma State Cowboys basketball|Oklahoma State Cowboys]] and [[Oklahoma State Cowgirls basketball|Cowgirls basketball]] games under an agreement with [[Oklahoma State University\u2013Stillwater|Oklahoma State University]]'s Cowboys Sports Network syndication service; the station typically broadcast around three regular season games each year during the run of the contract, which usually aired on a Wednesday or Saturday during [[prime time]].\n\nIn August 2013, channel 9 obtained the local television rights to broadcast [[National Football League|NFL]] preseason games involving the [[St. Louis Rams]] produced by the team's in-house syndication service, the Rams Television Network; for the [[2015 St. Louis Rams season|2015 season]], KWTV diverted broadcasts of the team's Thursday night preseason games to sister station KSBI. (Prior to its acquisition of channel 52, the Thursday games forced KWTV to air first-run episodes of the CBS reality series ''[[Big Brother (American TV series)|Big Brother]]'' in late night to allow viewers to watch or record the affected episode on a delayed basis.) KWTV/KSBI's contract with the Rams concluded after the 2015 season as a result of the team's move to Los Angeles effective the following year. (Ironically, most Rams regular season games air on Fox affiliate KOKH-TV by way of [[NFL on Fox|Fox]]'s contractual rights to the NFL's [[National Football Conference]], while KWTV only carried regular season games featuring the team if [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] was scheduled to carry an interconference games against an opponent in the [[American Football Conference]], or after 2014, an NFC-only matchup to which Fox passed the rights to CBS under NFL cross-flex broadcasting provisions.)\n\nOn July 24, 2015, Griffin announced an agreement with the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA) that would return high school football coverage to KSBI after a five-year sabbatical; as a byproduct of the deal, KWTV also maintained partial over-the-air rights to the OSSAA Class 5A and 6A football championships, which were split between the station's main channel, its News 9 Now subchannel and KSBI.<ref>{{cite news|title=Media notes: KSBI-52 to air high school football telecasts for the first time since 2010|url=http://newsok.com/article/5439599|author=Mel Bracht|newspaper=The Oklahoman|date=August 11, 2015|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=High School Football Is Coming to KSBI|url=http://www.news9.com/story/29626944/high-school-football-is-coming-to-ksbi|website=KWTV-DT|publisher=Griffin Communications|date=July 24, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Griffin Communications to air Oklahoma high school football state championship games|url=http://oklahomasports.net/griffin-communications-air-oklahoma-high-school-football-state-championship-games/|website=Oklahoma SportsNet|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Haisten: Griffin stations to televise 6AI, 6AII and 5A championship football games|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/okpreps/football/bill-haisten-griffin-stations-to-televise-ai-aii-and-a/article_21b3fc39-497f-5428-8d55-2fa7f5fa01f2.html|author=Bill Haisten|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|date=November 11, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Griffin Communications announces high school football championship broadcasting schedule|url=http://newsok.com/article/5528771|author=Jacob Unruh|newspaper=The Oklahoman|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n{{As of|September 2018}}, KWTV-DT broadcasts 39\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours on weekdays, five hours on Saturdays and 4\u00bd hours on Sundays).

KWTV also features select stories filed by Tulsa sister station KOTV-DT during its newscasts, and partners with that station to cover news events within the Tulsa market; both stations co-produce the sports analysis program, ''Oklahoma Sports Blitz'', which airs Sundays at 10:25&nbsp;p.m. on both stations and has been hosted since its August 2001 debut by KWTV sports director Dean Blevins and KOTV sports director John Holcomb.<ref name=\"oklahoman-sportsblitz\">{{cite news|title=Oklahoma anchors team up for statewide show|url=http://newsok.com/article/2751770|author=Mel Bracht|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=August 16, 2001|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nKWTV has long had a rivalry with KFOR-TV, vying with that station for first place as the most-watched television newscast in the Oklahoma City market in most news timeslots.

Bruce Palmer, former [[news director]] at [[WKY]] (930 AM) and eventual national president of the Radio-Television News Editors Association, headed channel 9's news department as its director of news operations until his retirement from broadcasting in 1966. Palmer also conducted weekly editorial segments that dealt with pertinent local issues; the station's editorials, which continued for several years after Palmer's departure, would help earn KWTV several journalistic honors in subsequent years, including the [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] and the National Headliners Club Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=Listeners tell TV Views|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/60-OCR/BC-1960-03-14-OCR-Page-0096.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=96|date=March 14, 1960|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Media reports...: KWTV editorial brings acclaim from citizens|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/62-OCR/1962-05-21-BC-OCR-Page-0075.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=75|date=May 21, 1962|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> To enable mobility in shooting spot news content, in 1955, KWTV staff photographer Bill Horton devised a saddle-based shoulder camera rig with a port to insert wet cell batteries on the saddle's rear and an [[Auricon]] Cine-Voice audio control panel (which was hooked to a [[dictaphone]]-style earpiece to monitor the audio recording) at front.<ref>{{cite web|title=KWTV Cameraman Devises New Film Rig|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/55-OCR/1955-03-14-BC-OCR-Page-0071.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=59|date=March 14, 1955|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> By 1959, the station had launched a half-hour noon newscast and a 15-minute-long early evening newscast that led into the ''CBS Evening News with Douglas Edwards''.

In 1968, the station hired Paul R.

England holds the record as the state's longest-serving television meteorologist, working as chief meteorologist at KWTV from October 16, 1972 until his retirement from regular broadcasting on August 28, 2013, shortly before he assumed a newly created post as Griffin Communications' vice president of corporate relations and weather development (England surpassed Jim Williams, who had a 32-year tenure as lead meteorologist at KFOR-TV from 1958 to 1990, for the title in 2005).<ref>{{cite news|title=Gary's Resume|url=http://newsok.com/article/903069|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=January 24, 2006|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Gary England to sign off as KWTV-9 chief meteorologist on Aug. 30|url=http://newsok.com/article/3865120|author=Mel Bracht|newspaper=The Oklahoman|publisher=The Anschutz Corporation|date=July 23, 2013|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Gary England marks 30 years at KWTV Desire to keep people safe in stormy times led to innovations|url=http://newsok.com/article/2811075|author=Diane Clay|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=October 15, 2002|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Gary England Celebrates 40 Years on KWTV|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvspy/gary-england-celebrates-40-years-on-kwtv_b65835|website=[[TVSpy]]|date=October 16, 2012}}</ref> England\u2014who, in 1986, would become the first Oklahoma City television personality to sign a million-dollar contract package\u2014replaced David Grant, who succeeded original chief meteorologist [[Harry Volkman]] (whose tenure also saw channel 9 become the first station in Oklahoma City to acquire a [[weather radar]]) in 1960.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gary England: $1 Million Man|url=http://newsok.com/article/2118982|author=Glen Phillips|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=August 25, 1985|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=David Guild|url=http://legacy.newsok.com/obituaries/oklahoman/obituary.aspx?pid=161581321|newspaper=The Oklahoman|publisher=The Anschutz Corporation|date=December 2, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> England's weather coverage earned him numerous awards over his 41-year career with the station (including three Heartland Emmys, National and Regional Edward R.

That February, Griffin purchased a World War II-era radar (similar in model to the [[WSR-57]]) from [[Huntsville, Alabama]]-based [[Enterprise Electronics Corporation]], the first proprietary broadcast weather radar in the U.S (four years later, KWTV became the first television station in Oklahoma to have its own color weather radar).<ref name=\"sw\">{{cite book|title=Storm Warning: The Story of a Killer Tornado|chapter=A Meteorological Star|author=Nancy Mathis|publisher=Touchstone|page=[https://archive.org/details/stormwarningstor00math/page/35 35]|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7432-8053-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/stormwarningstor00math/page/35}}</ref><ref name=\"wxing\">{{cite book|title=Weathering the Storm: Tornadoes, Television, and Turmoil|url=https://archive.org/details/weatheringstormt00engl|url-access=registration|chapter=The Revolution Begins, Changes in the Wind, The First Doppler, Major Assault, First Exposure, The Traveling Weather Show, Official Confrontations, Weather Wars|author=[[Gary England|Gary A.

England lamented the lack of warning lead time, specifically for [[tornado warning]]s (which, in 1974, when NWS protocol required storm spotters to visually confirm a tornado before a warning could be issued, averaged -10 to -15 minutes). In 1978, KWTV became the first television station in the U.S. to broadcast high-resolution weather satellite imagery (with the system being known as \"StarCom 9\").\n\nWith England's consult, John Griffin commissioned Enterprise Electronics to create a commercial Doppler radar for $250,000, spurred by successful testing of a prototype by the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] during the Union City tornado; the improved radar allowed KWTV to issue tornado warnings before the National Weather Service.<ref name=\"wxing\"/> The first commercial Doppler radar in the nation for forecasting use was installed at KWTV in 1981 (in late 1984, that radar was replaced by a [[Fast Fourier transform|Fast Fourier Transform]] system developed by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], which featured an expanded scanning area with an accuracy of up to {{convert|750|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}).<ref name=\"wxing\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Tuning In...|url=http://newsok.com/article/2266118|author=David Fisk|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=May 14, 1989|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Two weeks after the radar was installed, on May 22 (shortly before it was shut down briefly due to the expiration of the radar's temporary operational license), it detected a tornado near [[Arapaho, Oklahoma|Arapaho]]; that tornado\u2014which was recorded by a photographer inside \"Ranger 9,\" which briefly was caught in the parent thunderstorm's inflow winds\u2014became the first ever to have been filmed by a news helicopter. The first broadcaster-issued tornado warning indicated by Doppler occurred using this radar for a tornado that hit [[Ada, Oklahoma|Ada]] on March 15, 1982; the ability to issue warnings ahead of the National Weather Service led to frequent disputes over jurisdiction in the issuance of severe weather alerts between the agency's [[National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma|Norman office]] and channel 9 into the early 1990s.<ref name=\"wxing\"/>\n\nFrom 1982 to 2006, England and the KWTV weather staff presented \"Those Terrible Twisters\" (titled \"Gary's Traveling Weather Show\" until 1986), a weather education tour around Oklahoma communities during the spring and summer that taught tornado safety information and promoted the station's severe weather forecasting efforts; the station also produced half-hour specials under that banner each spring, showcasing footage shot by KWTV storm spotters and behind-the-scenes video of its storm coverage.<ref>{{cite news|title=KWTV Keeps Track of Twisters|url=http://newsok.com/article/2142634|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=March 30, 1986|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> In 1990, England, with the help of a station technician, co-developed [[First Warning]], a software product that displays a weather alert map (which was originally updated via manual input by weather staff) during regular programming, along with a [[news ticker|crawl]] showing detailed alerts issued by the NWS and the [[Storm Prediction Center|National Severe Storms Forecast Center]].

On June 13 of that year, during coverage of a [[Thunderstorm#Supercell|supercell thunderstorm]] that spawned seven tornadoes across [[Canadian County, Oklahoma|Canadian]] and northern [[Oklahoma County, Oklahoma|Oklahoma]] counties, a camera atop the station's transmission tower caught the collapse of a nearby auxiliary tower operated by KFOR-TV and radio station WKY (930 AM) from intense downdraft winds. In 2000, the station introduced \"I-News\", internet-enabled software for [[personal computer]]s that provides severe weather and breaking news alerts to users. KWTV debuted \"MOAR\" (for \"Massive Output Arrayed Radar\"; though colloquially referred by England as the \"Mother of All Radars\") on May 8, 2003 to track an [[May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence#Moore Tornado (F4)|F4 tornado]] that hit Moore; the radar used enhanced street-level mapping to detect the path of tornadoes and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] to track the location of KWTV's [[storm spotting|storm spotters]]. In February 2007, KWTV debuted \"Storm Monitor\" (later known by its brand name of ESP for \"Early Storm Protection\"), which utilized [[Volumetric Imaging and Processing of Integrated Radar|VIPIR]] technology to measure a [[mesocyclone]]'s strength and its tornado-producing potential.\n\n[[David Payne (meteorologist)|David Payne]], who joined KWTV in February 2013 after a 20-year tenure as a morning meteorologist and storm chaser at KFOR, subsequently took over as chief meteorologist on August 29 of that year.<ref>{{cite news|title=Meteorologist David Payne leaving KFOR-4 to join KWTV-9|url=http://newsok.com/article/3738318|author=Mel Bracht|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=The Anschutz Corporation|date=December 17, 2012|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Weather won't be the same|url=http://www.okgazette.com/oklahoma/article-19093-weather-won'.html|newspaper=[[Oklahoma Gazette]]|publisher=Tierra Media Group|date=August 28, 2013}}</ref> In April 2015, KWTV restructured the extended forecast graphic seen at the end of its weather segments from a seven-day to a nine-day forecast, both in reference to the station's virtual channel number and to take advantage of the 16:9 frame (likewise, rival KOCO-TV subsequently altered its extended forecast to a ten-day outlook, known as the \"5+5 Day Forecast\", in reference to its virtual channel).

To commemorate the new tower, an event that KWTV management estimated had 5,000 attendees, an amateur photography competition was held in which the winning pictures of the tower (with photography equipment donated by local camera stores being awarded to the finalists) would be chosen for inclusion in station publicity advertisements. A young [[Johnny Carson]], then the host of the CBS [[game show]] ''Earn Your Vacation'', served as [[master of ceremonies]] for the tower's dedication.

(The program airs instead on News 9 Now, following a simulcast of the local morning newscast's Saturday edition.) Channel 9 may preempt some CBS programs to provide long-form [[breaking news]] or [[severe weather]] coverage when necessary, or air prime time specials produced by the station's news department. The preempted programs may either be diverted on a live-to-air basis to KSBI (which also holds the right to air any preempted syndicated programs if KWTV airs extended news coverage in their time periods) or\u2014less commonly since Griffin acquired KSBI\u2014[[broadcast delay|rebroadcast]] over KWTV in place of regularly scheduled overnight programs, although station personnel also gives viewers the option of watching them on CBS's website and [[mobile app]], [[CBS All Access]], or its cable/satellite [[video-on-demand]] service the day after their initial airing. (News 9 Now previously handled substitute CBS programming responsibilities from its conversion into an over-the-air-originated service in April 2011 until December 2014, when Griffin transferred those duties to KSBI upon assuming operational responsibilities for that station.)

However, CBS usually did not raise objections to preemptions made by channel 9, since it has typically been one of the network's strongest affiliates. Until 1959, KWTV preempted the ''[[CBS Evening News]] with [[Douglas Edwards]]'' to air syndicated drama series. The station also preempted ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning]]'' and ''[[Face the Nation]]'' from September 1984 until August 1995, in favor of carrying an extended block of local and syndicated religious programs on Sunday mornings; from the time they regained clearance until 2005, both programs were shown on a half-hour delay to accommodate an additional half-hour of the station's Sunday morning newscast. After ''Face the Nation'' expanded to a one-hour broadcast in April 2014, as certain other CBS affiliates have done since that time, KWTV aired the first half-hour of the [[Sunday morning talk show]] live-to-air on Sunday mornings and the second half-hour early Monday mornings on tape delay\u2014the latter scheduling being used previously for the show (in its former half-hour format) from June 1983 until KWTV's September 1984 removal of the program\u2014until February 2016 (during this time, the program aired in its entirety on KWTV-DT2 off its \"live\" feed through a partial simulcast with the station's main feed during ''FTN''{{'}}s first half-hour).\n\nIn September 1993, the station began carrying ''[[The Price Is Right (American game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' on a one-hour delay to air syndicated programs during the 10:00&nbsp;a.m. hour, forcing ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' to be moved concurrently to 3:00&nbsp;p.m. After it had considered preempting the [[late night talk show|talk show]] because of contractual issues with its late-night syndication lineup shortly before it debuted that month, KWTV became one of a handful of CBS-affiliated stations to receive permission to air the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on a half-hour delay, so as not to displace a secondary run of ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' it had aired after its 10:00&nbsp;p.m. newscast since 1989 (it also aired ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]'' on such a delay for the same reason during the 1989\u201390 season, when KWTV resumed clearance of CBS's late night block, which had aired instead on Fox affiliate [[KAUT]] [channel 43, now an independent station] the season prior). Channel 9 would eventually give in to airing the ''Late Show'' in its network-designated 10:35 timeslot in September 1994; ''The Price Is Right'' and ''The Young and the Restless'', however, would continue to air on a delayed basis until both shows returned to their recommended timeslots in September 2000.<ref>{{cite news|title=Letterman Makes His CBS Debut Monday at 11 p.m. on Channel 9|url=http://newsok.com/article/2440339|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=August 29, 1993|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=KWTV Unsure It'll Air David Letterman Show|url=http://newsok.com/article/2435322|author=C.S.

(Prior to its acquisition of channel 52, the Thursday games forced KWTV to air first-run episodes of the CBS reality series ''[[Big Brother (American TV series)|Big Brother]]'' in late night to allow viewers to watch or record the affected episode on a delayed basis.) KWTV/KSBI's contract with the Rams concluded after the 2015 season as a result of the team's move to Los Angeles effective the following year. (Ironically, most Rams regular season games air on Fox affiliate KOKH-TV by way of [[NFL on Fox|Fox]]'s contractual rights to the NFL's [[National Football Conference]], while KWTV only carried regular season games featuring the team if [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] was scheduled to carry an interconference games against an opponent in the [[American Football Conference]], or after 2014, an NFC-only matchup to which Fox passed the rights to CBS under NFL cross-flex broadcasting provisions.)\n\nOn July 24, 2015, Griffin announced an agreement with the Oklahoma Secondary School Activities Association (OSSAA) that would return high school football coverage to KSBI after a five-year sabbatical; as a byproduct of the deal, KWTV also maintained partial over-the-air rights to the OSSAA Class 5A and 6A football championships, which were split between the station's main channel, its News 9 Now subchannel and KSBI.<ref>{{cite news|title=Media notes: KSBI-52 to air high school football telecasts for the first time since 2010|url=http://newsok.com/article/5439599|author=Mel Bracht|newspaper=The Oklahoman|date=August 11, 2015|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=High School Football Is Coming to KSBI|url=http://www.news9.com/story/29626944/high-school-football-is-coming-to-ksbi|website=KWTV-DT|publisher=Griffin Communications|date=July 24, 2015|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Griffin Communications to air Oklahoma high school football state championship games|url=http://oklahomasports.net/griffin-communications-air-oklahoma-high-school-football-state-championship-games/|website=Oklahoma SportsNet|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Bill Haisten: Griffin stations to televise 6AI, 6AII and 5A championship football games|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/sportsextra/okpreps/football/bill-haisten-griffin-stations-to-televise-ai-aii-and-a/article_21b3fc39-497f-5428-8d55-2fa7f5fa01f2.html|author=Bill Haisten|newspaper=[[Tulsa World]]|date=November 11, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Griffin Communications announces high school football championship broadcasting schedule|url=http://newsok.com/article/5528771|author=Jacob Unruh|newspaper=The Oklahoman|date=November 28, 2016|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==News operation==\n{{As of|September 2018}}, KWTV-DT broadcasts 39\u00bd hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with six hours on weekdays, five hours on Saturdays and 4\u00bd hours on Sundays).

Palmer also conducted weekly editorial segments that dealt with pertinent local issues; the station's editorials, which continued for several years after Palmer's departure, would help earn KWTV several journalistic honors in subsequent years, including the [[Sigma Delta Chi Award]] and the National Headliners Club Award.<ref>{{cite web|title=Listeners tell TV Views|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/60-OCR/BC-1960-03-14-OCR-Page-0096.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=96|date=March 14, 1960|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Media reports...: KWTV editorial brings acclaim from citizens|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/62-OCR/1962-05-21-BC-OCR-Page-0075.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|page=75|date=May 21, 1962|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> To enable mobility in shooting spot news content, in 1955, KWTV staff photographer Bill Horton devised a saddle-based shoulder camera rig with a port to insert wet cell batteries on the saddle's rear and an [[Auricon]] Cine-Voice audio control panel (which was hooked to a [[dictaphone]]-style earpiece to monitor the audio recording) at front.<ref>{{cite web|title=KWTV Cameraman Devises New Film Rig|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/IDX-Business/Magazines/Archive-BC-IDX/55-OCR/1955-03-14-BC-OCR-Page-0071.pdf|periodical=Broadcasting|publisher=Broadcasting Publications, Inc.|via=American Radio History|format=PDF|page=59|date=March 14, 1955|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> By 1959, the station had launched a half-hour noon newscast and a 15-minute-long early evening newscast that led into the ''CBS Evening News with Douglas Edwards''.

In 1968, the station hired Paul R.

Olson's tenure at the station (ending with her departure in 1980 to become [[Atlanta]] bureau correspondent for [[CBS News]], with Olson being replaced on the 6:00 broadcast by Debi Faubion) saw the airing of a documentary she wrote and produced in cooperation with the [[National Kidney Foundation]], ''Gift of Life'', which chronicled four kidney dialysis patients awaiting transplants; the special led to the passage of a state law that created an organ donor registry and donor ID information on Oklahoma identification cards and drivers' licenses.<ref>{{cite news|title=Journalism Hall of Fame to induct nine|url=http://newsok.com/article/2785977|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=March 17, 2002|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> That year, KWTV was actually the first television station in the Oklahoma City market to transition from film to videotape to record news footage, with the purchase of camcorder equipment it branded as \"Live MiniCam 9\".

(The midday newscast was shifted to 11:00&nbsp;a.m. on February 4, 1980 to accommodate the hour-long expansion of its CBS soap lead-in ''The Young and the Restless'', and was subsequently reduced to a 30-minute noon newscast on September 15 of that year.)\n\nIn 1979, the station began utilizing a [[helicopter]] to provide coverage of breaking news events and severe weather, with the introduction of \"Hot Shot 9\" (renamed \"Ranger 9\" in 1981). A rotational camera was installed below the nose of the chopper (branded as \"EagleVision\") in 2000, superseding the need for an in-helicopter cameraman to film breaking news. The helicopter used for \"Ranger 9\" was sold to KOTV to replace its previous helicopter model in 2006, when KWTV purchased a $1.5-million [[Bell 407]] helicopter, branded as \"SkyNews9 HD\" (now branded \"Bob Mills SkyNews9 HD\", through a sponsorship and brand licensing agreement with Oklahoma City-based regional furniture retail chain Bob Mills Furniture), which was the first in the market to be equipped with a high-definition camera that also has optical zoom capability (though helicopter images were not broadcast in HD until the station converted its news broadcasts to the 16:9 aspect ratio in October 2010).<ref>{{cite news|title=TV station spending big to upgrade aerial coverage|url=http://newsok.com/article/2938055|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=April 4, 2006|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref>\n\nRatings for KWTV's newscasts\u2014then branded as ''Big 9 News'', before adopting the ''Newsline 9'' moniker in August 1981\u2014dropped to third place in 1980, partly due to a resurgent KOCO news operation, which overtook it for second place among the market's evening newscasts with the team of Jack Bowen, Mary Ruth Carleton, chief meteorologist Fred Norman and sports director Jerry Park.

In 1978, KWTV became the first television station in the U.S. to broadcast high-resolution weather satellite imagery (with the system being known as \"StarCom 9\").\n\nWith England's consult, John Griffin commissioned Enterprise Electronics to create a commercial Doppler radar for $250,000, spurred by successful testing of a prototype by the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] during the Union City tornado; the improved radar allowed KWTV to issue tornado warnings before the National Weather Service.<ref name=\"wxing\"/> The first commercial Doppler radar in the nation for forecasting use was installed at KWTV in 1981 (in late 1984, that radar was replaced by a [[Fast Fourier transform|Fast Fourier Transform]] system developed by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], which featured an expanded scanning area with an accuracy of up to {{convert|750|ft|m|disp=sqbr}}).<ref name=\"wxing\"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Tuning In...|url=http://newsok.com/article/2266118|author=David Fisk|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=May 14, 1989|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Two weeks after the radar was installed, on May 22 (shortly before it was shut down briefly due to the expiration of the radar's temporary operational license), it detected a tornado near [[Arapaho, Oklahoma|Arapaho]]; that tornado\u2014which was recorded by a photographer inside \"Ranger 9,\" which briefly was caught in the parent thunderstorm's inflow winds\u2014became the first ever to have been filmed by a news helicopter. The first broadcaster-issued tornado warning indicated by Doppler occurred using this radar for a tornado that hit [[Ada, Oklahoma|Ada]] on March 15, 1982; the ability to issue warnings ahead of the National Weather Service led to frequent disputes over jurisdiction in the issuance of severe weather alerts between the agency's [[National Weather Service Norman, Oklahoma|Norman office]] and channel 9 into the early 1990s.<ref name=\"wxing\"/>\n\nFrom 1982 to 2006, England and the KWTV weather staff presented \"Those Terrible Twisters\" (titled \"Gary's Traveling Weather Show\" until 1986), a weather education tour around Oklahoma communities during the spring and summer that taught tornado safety information and promoted the station's severe weather forecasting efforts; the station also produced half-hour specials under that banner each spring, showcasing footage shot by KWTV storm spotters and behind-the-scenes video of its storm coverage.<ref>{{cite news|title=KWTV Keeps Track of Twisters|url=http://newsok.com/article/2142634|newspaper=The Daily Oklahoman|publisher=Oklahoma Publishing Company|date=March 30, 1986|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> In 1990, England, with the help of a station technician, co-developed [[First Warning]], a software product that displays a weather alert map (which was originally updated via manual input by weather staff) during regular programming, along with a [[news ticker|crawl]] showing detailed alerts issued by the NWS and the [[Storm Prediction Center|National Severe Storms Forecast Center]].

In 2000, the station introduced \"I-News\", internet-enabled software for [[personal computer]]s that provides severe weather and breaking news alerts to users. KWTV debuted \"MOAR\" (for \"Massive Output Arrayed Radar\"; though colloquially referred by England as the \"Mother of All Radars\") on May 8, 2003 to track an [[May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence#Moore Tornado (F4)|F4 tornado]] that hit Moore; the radar used enhanced street-level mapping to detect the path of tornadoes and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] to track the location of KWTV's [[storm spotting|storm spotters]].
