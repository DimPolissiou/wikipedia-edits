The club averaged 19,491 fans per game, with three matches surpassing 21,000, one reaching 33,000 and still another topping 45,000.\n\n==== Regular season standings ====\n''W = Wins, L = Losses, GF = Goals For, GA = Goals Against, BP = Bonus Points, Pts= point system''\n\n6 points for a win, 0 points for a loss, 1 point for each regulation goal scored up to three per game.\n:''{{Color box|#B3B7FF|border=darkgray}}-League Premiers (most points). {{Color box|#ccffcc|border=darkgray}}-Other playoff teams.''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"width:470px;

{"title_page": "Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment", "text_new": "The '''Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974''' is a 1974 provision in [[United States federal law]] intended to affect U.S. trade relations with countries with non-[[market economy|market economies]] (originally, countries of the [[Communist state|Communist bloc]]) that restrict freedom of [[emigration]] and other [[human rights]].\n\nThe amendment, named after its major co-sponsors [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry M. \"Scoop\" Jackson]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] and [[Charles A. Vanik]] of [[Ohio]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], is contained in Title IV of the [[Trade Act of 1974]]. The Trade Act of 1974 passed both houses of the [[United States Congress]] unanimously, and [[President of the United States|President]] [[Gerald Ford]] signed the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] into law with the adopted amendment on January 3, 1975. Over time, a number of countries were granted conditional normal trade relations subject to annual review, and a number of countries were liberated from the amendment.\n\nIn December 2012, the [[Magnitsky Act]], which repeals the application of the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment to the Russian Federation, was signed into law by President Obama.<ref name=\"Obama Signs Magnitsky Bill\"/>\n\n==Background==\nFrom 1972 to January 1975, [[US Congress|Congress]] debated and added the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the [[1974 Trade Act|1974 Trade Reform Act]], which restricted the President's ability to provide [[most favored nation]] (MFN) status to the [[Soviet Union]] and other non-market economies that formed the Soviet bloc. The timing and provisions of the amendment reflected the presidential ambitions and distrust of the Soviet Union of Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry Jackson]] (D-WA).<ref name=stern1>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 1.</ref>\n\nAfter the Soviet Union allowed a number of [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]] to emigrate in the years after the 1967 [[Six-Day War|June War]] in the [[Middle East]], expectations of freer emigration were raised, but they were soon shattered as the 1972 [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Soviet emigration]] head tax made emigration very difficult. This Soviet edict levied an additional exit tax on educated emigrants, which appeared to have the effect of singling out Jews most heavily. The education tax, imposed  after the 1972 Moscow summit of superpower leaders [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]], emboldened those who criticized the Nixon administration's policy of [[Detente]] for downplaying concerns for human rights.<ref name=stern1 /> Nixon's handling of the issue of Soviet Jewish emigration and US National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]]'s reluctance to broach the subject disappointed US Jewish activists.<ref name=stern1 /> The Soviets announced the abolishing of the tax just before the introduction of the amendment in Congress, arguably in an attempt to prevent it.<ref name=sana>[http://forward.com/news/12254/declassified-kgb-study-illuminates-early-years-of-00966/ \"Declassified KGB Study Illuminates Early Years of Soviet Jewish Emigration\"], Sana Krasikov, December 12, 2007 (retrieved May 31, 2015)</ref>\n\nAt first, Jackson organized the political movement to link trade and emigration in America's relations with the Soviet Union in concert with Jewish activists, but he soon took matters into his own hands. Jackson drafted what would become the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment in the summer of 1972 and introduced it to the Ninety-second Congress on October 4, 1972. Jackson's efforts, rooted in his own domestic political calculations and ideological distrust of and antipathy toward the Soviet Union, complicated the Nixon White House's pursuit of Detente, which it had worked on since 1969.<ref name=stern2 /> However, three-quarters of the Senate co-sponsored the amendment, neutralizing opposition from President Nixon.<ref name=stern2>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nJackson's staffer [[Richard Perle]] said in an interview that the idea belonged to Jackson, who believed that the right to emigrate was the most powerful among the human rights in certain respects: \"if people could vote with their feet, governments would have to acknowledge that and governments would have to make for their citizens a life that would keep them there.\"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1017.html \"Richard Perle: The Making of a Neoconservative\"], a PBS transcript</ref> While there was some opposition, the American Jewish establishment on the whole and Soviet Jewry activists (particularly the Washington Committee for Soviet Jewry<ref>http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=384545</ref> and the [[National Conference on Soviet Jewry]]) supported the amendment over Nixon's and Kissinger's objections.<ref name=\"Lazin\"/>\n\nIn 1973 Rep. Charles Vanik, chair of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means]] Subcommittee on Trade, introduced in the House of Representatives the legislation written with Jackson. The amendment would deny normal trade relations to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted freedom of emigration. The amendment was intended to allow primarily Jewish refugees and other religious minorities to escape from the [[Soviet Bloc]].  Vanik's aide, [[Mark E. Talisman]], is regarded as having played an instrumental role in securing passage.<ref name=\"BarnesObit\">{{cite news |last1=Barnes |first1=Bart |title=Mark Talisman, advocate for Jewish causes, dies at 77 (obit) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/mark-talisman-advocate-for-jewish-causes-dies-at-77/2019/07/16/b5d3caa8-a72a-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html |accessdate=21 July 2019 |publisher=Washington Post |date=16 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"JTAobit\">{{cite news |title=Mark Talisman, Champion Of Key Law In Fight For Soviet Jewry, Is Dead At 78 |url=https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/mark-talisman-champion-of-key-law-in-fight-for-soviet-jewry-is-dead-at-78/ |accessdate=21 July 2019 |agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |publisher=[[Jewish Week]] |date=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nJackson attached his amendment to legislation the Nixon administration badly wanted. In the House of Representatives, Vanik lined up House leaders as primary sponsors of the amendment. During this period, Jackson also expanded his base of support, adding other ethnic, economic, and ideological groups as supporters. Labor, ethnic groups originally from Eastern European and [[Baltic States]], human rights organizations and liberal intellectuals were the most significant additions to organized labor and Jewish activists. While building support, Jackson resisted compromise with the administration and the Soviet Union.<ref name=stern3>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 3.</ref>\n\nOnce the Nixon administration began to appreciate the threat Jackson presented to Detente and its policy of trade with the Soviet Union, it made a number of attempts to thwart Jackson. The administration tried to keep the amendment out of the committee version of the bill during the House Ways and Means Committee's markup sessions. When it became clear that this was impossible, delay was the administration's next option, along with the threat of a veto.<ref name=stern3 />\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in October 1973 further complicated Congressional views of the Soviet Union. Soviet involvement in the conflict may have stoked distrust of the USSR by some members of Congress, but there were other members who feared that pressure on the [[Nixon Administration]] to advance the goals of the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment complicated the emergency supply of American military weapons to [[Israel]]. Israel prevailed in the Yom Kippur War, and by December 11 the House of Representatives voted by an overwhelming 319-80 tally to include the entire Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment in the trade bill, which passed 272-140. With that, Congress recessed until January 1974.<ref name=stern3 />\n\nOn January 21, 1974, the second session of the [[Ninety-third United States Congress]] began, and the Jackson amendment entered the Senate. Having lost the legislative battle in the House of Representatives, the administration and Soviet authorities turned to negotiations with Jackson. Trilateral talks began in spring 1974 involving Congress, the [[Executive Branch]] and the Soviet Union. The prominent individuals involved were Jackson, Kissinger, and Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. [[Anatoly Dobrynin]], a skilled senior diplomat who had served in Washington for decades. Kissinger enjoyed a special status in these negotiations since he alone controlled the communications between Jackson and the Soviet Union. In effect, Kissinger was the only one of the three parties involved who knew what all sides were saying in secret, informal sessions, while he also conducted a long-standing \"back channel\" dialogue with Soviet authorities via Dobrynin. Kissinger's influence only grew as Nixon was increasingly consumed by the Watergate political scandal.<ref name=stern4>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 4.</ref>\n\nIn March 1974, Kissinger returned from Moscow with news that the Soviets were willing to cooperate with the members of Congress. Jackson, however, would complicate matters by making public the demands that had been accommodated in quiet diplomatic dialogue.<ref name=stern4 />\n\nJackson pursued negotiations with the administration and the Soviet Union on the terms of the amendment. The outline of an agreement was perceivable, but by summer the talks seemed to bog down as Watergate sapped the Executive Branch's political energy. Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.\n\nIn August 1974, when the national deadlock was broken by Nixon's resignation and [[President Ford|Ford]]'s appointment, Jackson had to decide whether or not to concur with an agreement that was not perfect or hold out longer and possibly sink the entire trade bill. Given the choice of having the bill with the Jackson amendment or doing away with both the bill and the Jackson amendment together, Kissinger was apparently willing to let the two die. So to compromise, Jackson had agreed to grant, at least temporarily, trade concessions, including extensions of credit, to the Soviet Union.<ref name=stern5>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 5.</ref>\n\nEventually, Jackson accepted less than perfect terms. Jackson was anxious to achieve a legislative victory after years of battle and apparently decided it best not to ask too many more questions nor press too hard for less ambiguous pledges lest he be left with nothing to show for his efforts.<ref name=stern5 />\n\nPresident Ford signed the 1972 Trade Agreement on January 3, 1975, with the Jackson amendment. On January 10, the Soviet government sent a letter that apparently indicated the Soviets' refusal to comply with the need to provide assurances on emigration or to make technical changes in the 1972 Trade agreement. On January 13, Kissinger met with Soviet officials and subsequently issued a statement \"that the 1972 Trade Agreement cannot be brought into force at this time and the President will therefore not take the steps required for this purpose by the Trade Agreement. The President does not plan at this time to exercise the waiver authority.\"<ref name=stern5 />\n\n===Business involvement===\nHarry Stone, vice president and his brother, Irving Stone, president of [[American Greetings]] based in Vanick's home turf, [[Cleveland, Ohio]], played a major role in gaining sponsorship for this amendment. Mr. Harry Stone served as campaign chairman to the late U.S. Representative Charles Vanik, a connection that gained significance when Vanik asked Mr. Stone and his brother Irving, then American Greetings president, to encourage congressman Wilbur Mills to schedule a floor vote on the Jackson-Vanik Amendment requiring the Soviet Union to allow Jewish emigration to the U.S. in order to qualify for \"most favored nation status\" for its exports. Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], chair of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] characterized the amendment as \"idealistic meddling\" in the amendment's attempts to use free Jews using trade and credit as levers against the Soviet Union. American Greetings was the largest employer in Mills's Arkansas district. Fulbright, apparently saw the same light as Mills, as American Greetings opened one of its largest printing plants in Fulbright's and Mills's state of Arkansas.\n\n\"The role that Harry Stone played in making the Jackson-Vanik bill a reality will go down as one of the most meaningful contributions that a Clevelander has ever made,\" says Vic Gelb, an honorary for life director of the Cleveland Jewish News. \"It made a world of difference in the history of events and enabled the exodus of Jews from the former Soviet Union.\"\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe difficulty faced by Senator Jackson in the three-way negotiation process that took place from August 1974 through January 1975, demonstrated some of the institutional constraints on congressional involvement in foreign policy making. The Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment is a case study of how domestic politics shapes American Foreign policy making. It exemplifies the fact that one cannot understand U.S. foreign policy if one does not understand the domestic politics in Congress and the White House that shape policy decisions.\n\n==Content==\nThe amendment denies [[most favored nation]] status to certain countries with non-market economies that restrict emigration, which is considered a [[Human rights|human right]]. Permanent normal trade relations can be extended to a country subject to the law only if the President determines that it complies with the freedom of emigration requirements of the amendment. However, the President has the authority to grant a yearly waiver to the provisions of Jackson-Vanik, and these waivers were granted to the [[People's Republic of China]] starting in the late 1970s and in later decades, to [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]].\n\nThe core provision of the amendment was codified as 19 U.S.C. 2432(a), Sec. 402 \"Freedom of Emigration in East-West Trade\" of the [[Trade Act of 1974]] ({{USStatute|93|618|88|1978}}), which was enacted January 3, 1975:\n\n<blockquote>(a) '''Actions of nonmarket economy countries making them ineligible for normal trade relations, programs of credits, credit guarantees, or investment guarantees, or commercial agreements''' To assure the continued dedication of the United States to fundamental human rights, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, on or after January 3, 1975, products from any nonmarket economy country shall not be eligible to receive nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations), such country shall not participate in any program of the Government of the United States which extends credits or credit guarantees or investment guarantees, directly or indirectly, and the President of the United States shall not conclude any commercial agreement with any such country, during the period beginning with the date on which the President determines that such country -\n:(1) denies its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate;\n:(2) imposes more than a nominal [[Departure tax|tax on emigration]] or on the visas or other documents required for emigration, for any purpose or cause whatsoever; or\n:(3) imposes more than a nominal tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge on any citizen as a consequence of the desire of such citizen to emigrate to the country of his choice, and ending on the date on which the President determines that such country is no longer in violation of paragraph (1), (2), or (3).</blockquote>\n\n==Effects==\n<!-- The list below is referred to OCTS.

Jackson|Henry Jackson]] (D-WA).<ref name=stern1>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 1.</ref>\n\nAfter the Soviet Union allowed a number of [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Soviet Jews]] to emigrate in the years after the 1967 [[Six-Day War|June War]] in the [[Middle East]], expectations of freer emigration were raised, but they were soon shattered as the 1972 [[Eastern Bloc emigration and defection|Soviet emigration]] head tax made emigration very difficult. This Soviet edict levied an additional exit tax on educated emigrants, which appeared to have the effect of singling out Jews most heavily. The education tax, imposed  after the 1972 Moscow summit of superpower leaders [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]], emboldened those who criticized the Nixon administration's policy of [[Detente]] for downplaying concerns for human rights.<ref name=stern1 /> Nixon's handling of the issue of Soviet Jewish emigration and US National Security Advisor [[Henry Kissinger]]'s reluctance to broach the subject disappointed US Jewish activists.<ref name=stern1 /> The Soviets announced the abolishing of the tax just before the introduction of the amendment in Congress, arguably in an attempt to prevent it.<ref name=sana>[http://forward.com/news/12254/declassified-kgb-study-illuminates-early-years-of-00966/ \"Declassified KGB Study Illuminates Early Years of Soviet Jewish Emigration\"], Sana Krasikov, December 12, 2007 (retrieved May 31, 2015)</ref>\n\nAt first, Jackson organized the political movement to link trade and emigration in America's relations with the Soviet Union in concert with Jewish activists, but he soon took matters into his own hands. Jackson drafted what would become the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment in the summer of 1972 and introduced it to the Ninety-second Congress on October 4, 1972. Jackson's efforts, rooted in his own domestic political calculations and ideological distrust of and antipathy toward the Soviet Union, complicated the Nixon White House's pursuit of Detente, which it had worked on since 1969.<ref name=stern2 /> However, three-quarters of the Senate co-sponsored the amendment, neutralizing opposition from President Nixon.<ref name=stern2>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nJackson's staffer [[Richard Perle]] said in an interview that the idea belonged to Jackson, who believed that the right to emigrate was the most powerful among the human rights in certain respects: \"if people could vote with their feet, governments would have to acknowledge that and governments would have to make for their citizens a life that would keep them there.\"<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/thinktank/transcript1017.html \"Richard Perle: The Making of a Neoconservative\"], a PBS transcript</ref> While there was some opposition, the American Jewish establishment on the whole and Soviet Jewry activists (particularly the Washington Committee for Soviet Jewry<ref>http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=384545</ref> and the [[National Conference on Soviet Jewry]]) supported the amendment over Nixon's and Kissinger's objections.<ref name=\"Lazin\"/>\n\nIn 1973 Rep. Charles Vanik, chair of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means]] Subcommittee on Trade, introduced in the House of Representatives the legislation written with Jackson. The amendment would deny normal trade relations to certain countries with non-market economies that restricted freedom of emigration. The amendment was intended to allow primarily Jewish refugees and other religious minorities to escape from the [[Soviet Bloc]].  Vanik's aide, [[Mark E. Talisman]], is regarded as having played an instrumental role in securing passage.<ref name=\"BarnesObit\">{{cite news |last1=Barnes |first1=Bart |title=Mark Talisman, advocate for Jewish causes, dies at 77 (obit) |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/mark-talisman-advocate-for-jewish-causes-dies-at-77/2019/07/16/b5d3caa8-a72a-11e9-86dd-d7f0e60391e9_story.html |accessdate=21 July 2019 |publisher=Washington Post |date=16 July 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"JTAobit\">{{cite news |title=Mark Talisman, Champion Of Key Law In Fight For Soviet Jewry, Is Dead At 78 |url=https://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/mark-talisman-champion-of-key-law-in-fight-for-soviet-jewry-is-dead-at-78/ |accessdate=21 July 2019 |agency=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |publisher=[[Jewish Week]] |date=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nJackson attached his amendment to legislation the Nixon administration badly wanted. In the House of Representatives, Vanik lined up House leaders as primary sponsors of the amendment. During this period, Jackson also expanded his base of support, adding other ethnic, economic, and ideological groups as supporters. Labor, ethnic groups originally from Eastern European and [[Baltic States]], human rights organizations and liberal intellectuals were the most significant additions to organized labor and Jewish activists. While building support, Jackson resisted compromise with the administration and the Soviet Union.<ref name=stern3>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 3.</ref>\n\nOnce the Nixon administration began to appreciate the threat Jackson presented to Detente and its policy of trade with the Soviet Union, it made a number of attempts to thwart Jackson. The administration tried to keep the amendment out of the committee version of the bill during the House Ways and Means Committee's markup sessions. When it became clear that this was impossible, delay was the administration's next option, along with the threat of a veto.<ref name=stern3 />\n\nThe outbreak of the [[Yom Kippur War]] in October 1973 further complicated Congressional views of the Soviet Union. Soviet involvement in the conflict may have stoked distrust of the USSR by some members of Congress, but there were other members who feared that pressure on the [[Nixon Administration]] to advance the goals of the Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment complicated the emergency supply of American military weapons to [[Israel]]. Israel prevailed in the Yom Kippur War, and by December 11 the House of Representatives voted by an overwhelming 319-80 tally to include the entire Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment in the trade bill, which passed 272-140. With that, Congress recessed until January 1974.<ref name=stern3 />\n\nOn January 21, 1974, the second session of the [[Ninety-third United States Congress]] began, and the Jackson amendment entered the Senate. Having lost the legislative battle in the House of Representatives, the administration and Soviet authorities turned to negotiations with Jackson. Trilateral talks began in spring 1974 involving Congress, the [[Executive Branch]] and the Soviet Union. The prominent individuals involved were Jackson, Kissinger, and Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. [[Anatoly Dobrynin]], a skilled senior diplomat who had served in Washington for decades. Kissinger enjoyed a special status in these negotiations since he alone controlled the communications between Jackson and the Soviet Union. In effect, Kissinger was the only one of the three parties involved who knew what all sides were saying in secret, informal sessions, while he also conducted a long-standing \"back channel\" dialogue with Soviet authorities via Dobrynin. Kissinger's influence only grew as Nixon was increasingly consumed by the Watergate political scandal.<ref name=stern4>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 4.</ref>\n\nIn March 1974, Kissinger returned from Moscow with news that the Soviets were willing to cooperate with the members of Congress. Jackson, however, would complicate matters by making public the demands that had been accommodated in quiet diplomatic dialogue.<ref name=stern4 />\n\nJackson pursued negotiations with the administration and the Soviet Union on the terms of the amendment. The outline of an agreement was perceivable, but by summer the talks seemed to bog down as Watergate sapped the Executive Branch's political energy. Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974.\n\nIn August 1974, when the national deadlock was broken by Nixon's resignation and [[President Ford|Ford]]'s appointment, Jackson had to decide whether or not to concur with an agreement that was not perfect or hold out longer and possibly sink the entire trade bill. Given the choice of having the bill with the Jackson amendment or doing away with both the bill and the Jackson amendment together, Kissinger was apparently willing to let the two die. So to compromise, Jackson had agreed to grant, at least temporarily, trade concessions, including extensions of credit, to the Soviet Union.<ref name=stern5>[[#CITEREFStern1979|Stern 1979]], Chapter 5.</ref>\n\nEventually, Jackson accepted less than perfect terms. Jackson was anxious to achieve a legislative victory after years of battle and apparently decided it best not to ask too many more questions nor press too hard for less ambiguous pledges lest he be left with nothing to show for his efforts.<ref name=stern5 />\n\nPresident Ford signed the 1972 Trade Agreement on January 3, 1975, with the Jackson amendment. On January 10, the Soviet government sent a letter that apparently indicated the Soviets' refusal to comply with the need to provide assurances on emigration or to make technical changes in the 1972 Trade agreement. On January 13, Kissinger met with Soviet officials and subsequently issued a statement \"that the 1972 Trade Agreement cannot be brought into force at this time and the President will therefore not take the steps required for this purpose by the Trade Agreement. The President does not plan at this time to exercise the waiver authority.\"<ref name=stern5 />\n\n===Business involvement===\nHarry Stone, vice president and his brother, Irving Stone, president of [[American Greetings]] based in Vanick's home turf, [[Cleveland, Ohio]], played a major role in gaining sponsorship for this amendment. Mr. Harry Stone served as campaign chairman to the late U.S. Representative Charles Vanik, a connection that gained significance when Vanik asked Mr. Stone and his brother Irving, then American Greetings president, to encourage congressman Wilbur Mills to schedule a floor vote on the Jackson-Vanik Amendment requiring the Soviet Union to allow Jewish emigration to the U.S. in order to qualify for \"most favored nation status\" for its exports. Senator [[J. William Fulbright]], chair of the [[Senate Foreign Relations Committee]] characterized the amendment as \"idealistic meddling\" in the amendment's attempts to use free Jews using trade and credit as levers against the Soviet Union. American Greetings was the largest employer in Mills's Arkansas district. Fulbright, apparently saw the same light as Mills, as American Greetings opened one of its largest printing plants in Fulbright's and Mills's state of Arkansas.\n\n\"The role that Harry Stone played in making the Jackson-Vanik bill a reality will go down as one of the most meaningful contributions that a Clevelander has ever made,\" says Vic Gelb, an honorary for life director of the Cleveland Jewish News. \"It made a world of difference in the history of events and enabled the exodus of Jews from the former Soviet Union.\"\n\n===Conclusion===\nThe difficulty faced by Senator Jackson in the three-way negotiation process that took place from August 1974 through January 1975, demonstrated some of the institutional constraints on congressional involvement in foreign policy making. The Jackson\u2013Vanik amendment is a case study of how domestic politics shapes American Foreign policy making. It exemplifies the fact that one cannot understand U.S. foreign policy if one does not understand the domestic politics in Congress and the White House that shape policy decisions.\n\n==Content==\nThe amendment denies [[most favored nation]] status to certain countries with non-market economies that restrict emigration, which is considered a [[Human rights|human right]]. Permanent normal trade relations can be extended to a country subject to the law only if the President determines that it complies with the freedom of emigration requirements of the amendment. However, the President has the authority to grant a yearly waiver to the provisions of Jackson-Vanik, and these waivers were granted to the [[People's Republic of China]] starting in the late 1970s and in later decades, to [[Vietnam]] and [[Laos]].\n\nThe core provision of the amendment was codified as 19 U.S.C. 2432(a), Sec. 402 \"Freedom of Emigration in East-West Trade\" of the [[Trade Act of 1974]] ({{USStatute|93|618|88|1978}}), which was enacted January 3, 1975:\n\n<blockquote>(a) '''Actions of nonmarket economy countries making them ineligible for normal trade relations, programs of credits, credit guarantees, or investment guarantees, or commercial agreements''' To assure the continued dedication of the United States to fundamental human rights, and notwithstanding any other provision of law, on or after January 3, 1975, products from any nonmarket economy country shall not be eligible to receive nondiscriminatory treatment (normal trade relations), such country shall not participate in any program of the Government of the United States which extends credits or credit guarantees or investment guarantees, directly or indirectly, and the President of the United States shall not conclude any commercial agreement with any such country, during the period beginning with the date on which the President determines that such country -\n:(1) denies its citizens the right or opportunity to emigrate;\n:(2) imposes more than a nominal [[Departure tax|tax on emigration]] or on the visas or other documents required for emigration, for any purpose or cause whatsoever; or\n:(3) imposes more than a nominal tax, levy, fine, fee, or other charge on any citizen as a consequence of the desire of such citizen to emigrate to the country of his choice, and ending on the date on which the President determines that such country is no longer in violation of paragraph (1), (2), or (3).</blockquote>\n\n==Effects==\n<!-- The list below is referred to OCTS. When adding more (if any), please DO NOT insert them in the middle or the list, but add in the end WITH THE CORRESPONDING REFERENCE\n-->\nThe countries subject to the amendment included the [[Soviet Union]] (and later the [[post-Soviet states]]), the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Romania]], [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Mongolia]], [[Albania]], [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], and [[Vietnam]].<ref name= octs/>\n\nOf Soviet Bloc countries, [[Poland]] was exempt from the amendment, but from 1982 to 1987 its unconditional MFN status was suspended due to its actions against [[Solidarno\u015b\u0107]].  [[Yugoslavia]] was also exempt; however, in 1991\u20131992, due to violent events in the [[former Yugoslavia]], the MFN status of [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] was suspended.<ref name= octs/>\n\n===Soviet Union===\n[[File:Soviet Exit Visa Forever.jpg|right|thumb|Exit USSR visa of the type 2.

Lazin (2005) states that scholars differ on how effective the amendment was in helping Soviet Jews. Some argue that it helped bring the plight of Soviet Jews to the world's attention, while others believe it hindered emigration and decreased America's diplomatic bargaining power.<ref name=\"Lazin\"/>\n\nSince 1975 more than 500,000 refugees, large numbers of whom were Jews, [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]], and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] from the former Soviet Union, have been resettled in the [[United States]]. An estimated one million Soviet Jews have [[Immigration to Israel|immigrated to Israel]] in that time.\n\nJackson-Vanik also led to great changes within the Soviet Union.  Other ethnic groups subsequently demanded the right to emigrate, and the ruling [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had to face the fact that there was widespread dissatisfaction with its governance.\n\nFormer Soviet dissident [[Natan Sharansky]] wrote in his 2004 book ''[[The Case for Democracy]]'' (p.&nbsp;3):\n\n{{quote|... [[Henry Kissinger|Kissinger]] saw Jackson's amendment as an attempt to undermine plans to smoothly carve up the geopolitical pie between the superpowers. It was. Jackson believed that the Soviets had to be confronted, not [[Appeasement|appeased]].\n\n[[Andrei Sakharov]] was another vociferous opponent of [[d\u00e9tente]]. He thought it swept the Soviet's human rights record under the rug in the name of improved superpower relations. ... One message he would consistently convey to these foreigners (the press) was that human rights must never be considered a humanitarian issue alone. For him, it was also a matter of international security. As he succinctly put it: \"A country that does not respect the rights of its own people will not respect the rights of its neighbors.\"}}\n\n===Lautenberg Amendment (1990)===\nEnacted on November 21, 1989, the [[Frank Lautenberg|Lautenberg]] Amendment, Public Law 101-167, took effect in 1990 which provided refugee status in the United States for nationals from the Soviet Union and later the former Soviet Union, Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania who are Jews, Evangelical Christians, Ukrainian Catholics or Ukrainian Orthodox; as well as nationals of Vietnam, Laos, or Cambodia; and Jews, Christians, Baha\u2019is and other religious minorities from Iran.<ref name=LautenbergActNovember1989>{{cite news|url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2013/06/06/the-lautenberg-amendment/|title=The Lautenberg Amendment|date=2013-06-13|work=Counter Punch|last=Perry|first=Jeffrey|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref><ref name=JTA2013-03-22>{{cite news|url=https://www.jta.org/2013/03/22/news-opinion/politics/congress-extends-lautenberg-amendment|title=Congress extends Lautenberg amendment|date=2013-03-22|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|last=Kampeas|first=Ron|author-link=Ron Kampeas|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref> The Lautenberg measure allowed refugee status to people from historically persecuted groups without requiring them to show that they had been singled out.<ref name=LautenbergActNovember1989/><ref name=JTA2013-03-22/><ref name=USNews>{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/boris-epshteyn/2013/06/06/what-senator-frank-lautenberg-did-for-my-jewish-family|title=Thank You Senator Lautenberg: The Lautenberg Amendment opened the door for more religious minorities to find a new life in America.|date=2013-06-06|work=[[US News]]|last=Epshteyn|first=Boris|author-link=Boris Epshteyn|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref> Under the Lautenberg Amendment, 350,000 to 400,000 Jews from the former Soviet Union which had not presented any form of evidence of persecution gained entry to the United States by October 2002 according to the [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]].<ref name=LautenbergActNovember1989/> Beginning in 2002, a special \"[[United States Citizenship and Immigration Services|Refugee Corps]]\" in the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] handled issues involving the Lautenberg Amendment.<ref name=JTA2002-12-12>{{cite news|url=https://www.jta.org/2002/12/12/archive/new-agents-to-handle-refugees-could-help-jews-from-fsu-iran|title=New Agents to Handle Refugees Could Help Jews from FSU, Iran|date=2012-12-12|work=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|access-date=2018-12-03}}</ref>\n\n===Post-soviet states===\n\n====Baltic states: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania====\n[[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] were subject to the amendment because they had been [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic States|forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union]].

A [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] of 20 [[Carthage (state)|Carthaginian]] ships commanded by [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]] surprised 17 [[Roman Republic|Roman]] ships under the senior [[Roman consul|consul]] for the year [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]] in [[Lipara]] harbour. The inexperienced Romans made a poor showing, with all 17 of their ships captured, along with their commander.\n\nThe Romans had recently built a fleet in order to contest the Carthaginian's maritime control of the western Mediterranean and Scipio had impetuously ventured to [[Aeolian Islands|the Liparas]] with the advance squadron. This was the first encounter between the Roman and Carthaginian fleets during the war. Scipio was ransomed after the battle and known thereafter as ''Asina'' (Latin for \"female donkey\"). The Romans went on to win the following two, larger, naval encounters and establish a rough sea-going parity.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}} 118&nbsp;BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167&nbsp;BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is best known for his work [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146&nbsp;BC, or about a century after the battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] have been recovered from the site of the [[Battle of the Aegates]], the final battle of the war, fought nineteen years later.

The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 260&nbsp;BC the war had lasted four years, and the Romans had pushed forward into Sicily, with a number of successes, including the [[battle of Agrigentum|capture of Agrigentum]], an important Carthaginian base. However, the Carthaginian navy repeatedly raided the Romans' rear areas and even the coast of Italy. Their control of the sea also made it impossible for the Romans to successfully [[blockade]] those Carthaginian cities which were on the coast. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}}\n\n===Ships===\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a trireme|{{center|Depiction of the position of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek [[trireme]]}}]]\n\nDuring this war the standard warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100&nbsp;[[long tons]] (110&nbsp;[[short tons]]; 100&nbsp;tonnes). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested they could maintain 7&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8&nbsp;mph; 13&nbsp;km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5&nbsp;knots (10&nbsp;mph; 16&nbsp;km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Vessels were built as [[cataphract]], or \"protected\", ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}}\n\nIn 260&nbsp;BC the Romans set out to construct a [[Roman navy|fleet]] and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which made them slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], so ubiquitous that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300, of which 280 were oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would normally also carry a complement of 40 marines,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} and if battle was thought to be imminent, this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n[[File:Greek Galleys.jpg|thumb|Recreation of a fleet of triremes]]\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, as well as execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a [[Naval ram|ram]], a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]] and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the [[Hellenistic-era warships|larger and heavier vessels]] adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram's effect even in the case of a successful attack.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}{{sfn|Wallinga|1956|pp=77\u201390}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead their military forces. The [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]], the year's [[consul|senior consul]], was given command of the fleet. He put to sea with the first 17 ships produced. As the first ever Roman warships they spent some time training in home waters before sailing to [[Messana]]. There they prepared for the main fleet's arrival and supported the logistics of the Roman army at the sea crossing to Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=183\u20134}}\n\n==Battle==\nWhile Scipio was at the [[Strait of Messina]] he received information that the garrison of [[Lipara]] was willing to defect to the Roman side. Lipara was the main port of the Lipari Islands and was a constant threat to Roman communications across the Strait. Though his crews were still inexperienced and the newly designed and built ships were still undergoing their sea trials, the consul could not resist the temptation of conquering an important city without a fight and sailed to Lipara. It has been suggested by some ancient sources that the offer to surrender Lipara was a ruse inspired by Carthage to encourage the Romans to commit their ships where they could be ambushed, but the sources do not give much detail and are usually pro-Roman.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}}\n\nThe Romans entered the harbour at Lipara. The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by [[Hannibal Gisco]], the general who had commanded the garrison at Agrigentum, and was based at Panormus (modern-day [[Palermo]]) some {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Lipari. When he heard of the Romans' advance to Lipara he despatched 20 ships under [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]], a Carthaginian aristocrat, to the town. The Carthaginians arrived at night and trapped the Romans in the harbour. Bo\u00f6des led his ships in an attack on the Romans inside the harbour the next morning. Scipio's men offered little resistance. The inexperienced crews were no match for the well-drilled Carthaginians and were rapidly outfought. Some Romans panicked and fled inland and the consul himself was taken prisoner, along with many of the other Roman senior officers. Some later accounts have Scipio treacherously captured while [[parley]]ing, but this is probably a Roman fabrication. All of the Roman ships were captured, most with little damage.{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=184\u20135}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u20136}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}} The battle was little more than a skirmish, and is mostly notable as the first naval encounter of the Punic Wars and the first time Roman warships had engaged in battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nScipio was later released, probably ransomed. His easy defeat earned him the pejorative ''[[Roman naming convention|cognomen]]'' Asina, which means ''donkey'' in Latin. This cognomen was all the more insulting because \"asina\" was the feminine form of the word donkey, as opposed to the masculine form \"asinus\". In spite of this Scipio's career prospered and he was consul for a second time in 254 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=181}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}}\n\nShortly after the Lipara victory, Hannibal Gisco was scouting with 50 Carthaginian ships when he encountered the full Roman fleet. He escaped, but lost most of his ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=67}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}} It was after this skirmish that the Romans installed the [[corvus (weapon)|''corvus'']] on their ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=68}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=182}} The {{lang|la|corvus}} was a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck. This allowed [[Roman legion|Roman legionaries]] acting as marines to [[Naval boarding|board enemy ships]] and capture them, rather than employing the previously [[Naval tactics in the Age of Galleys|traditional tactic]] of [[ramming]].{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}} Scipio's fellow consul, [[Gaius Duilius]], placed the Roman army units under subordinates and took command of the fleet. He promptly sailed, seeking battle. The two fleets met off the coast of [[Mylae]] in the [[Battle of Mylae]].

A [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]] of 20 [[Carthage (state)|Carthaginian]] ships commanded by [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]] surprised 17 [[Roman Republic|Roman]] ships under the senior [[Roman consul|consul]] for the year [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]] in [[Lipara]] harbour. The inexperienced Romans made a poor showing, with all 17 of their ships captured, along with their commander.\n\nThe Romans had recently built a fleet in order to contest the Carthaginian's maritime control of the western Mediterranean and Scipio had impetuously ventured to [[Aeolian Islands|the Liparas]] with the advance squadron. This was the first encounter between the Roman and Carthaginian fleets during the war. Scipio was ransomed after the battle and known thereafter as ''Asina'' (Latin for \"female donkey\"). The Romans went on to win the following two, larger, naval encounters and establish a rough sea-going parity.\n\n==Sources==\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the [[First Punic War]]{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the [[Latin]] word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa}} 118&nbsp;BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167&nbsp;BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now-lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is best known for his work [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146&nbsp;BC, or about a century after the battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the battle in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|pp=432\u2013433}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war exist, but in fragmentary or summary form,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} and they usually cover military operations on land in more detail than those at sea.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Modern historians usually also take into account the later histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\nOther sources include inscriptions, archaeological evidence, and empirical evidence from reconstructions such as the [[trireme]] [[Olympias (trireme)|''Olympias'']].{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=23, 98}} Since 2010 a number of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] have been recovered from the site of the [[Battle of the Aegates]], the final battle of the war, fought nineteen years later.

The immediate cause of the war was control of the Sicilian town of Messana (modern [[Messina]]). More broadly both sides wished to control [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], the most powerful city-state on Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=74\u201375}} By 260&nbsp;BC the war had lasted four years, and the Romans had pushed forward into Sicily, with a number of successes, including the [[battle of Agrigentum|capture of Agrigentum]], an important Carthaginian base. However, the Carthaginian navy repeatedly raided the Romans' rear areas and even the coast of Italy. Their control of the sea also made it impossible for the Romans to successfully [[blockade]] those Carthaginian cities which were on the coast. The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}}\n\n===Ships===\n[[Image:Trireme cut-fr.svg|thumb|upright=1|alt=A diagram depicting the positions of the rowers of the three different oars in a trireme|{{center|Depiction of the position of the rowers of the three different oars in a Greek [[trireme]]}}]]\n\nDuring this war the standard warship was the [[quinquereme]], meaning \"five-oared\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} The quinquereme was a [[galley]], {{circa}} {{convert|45|m|ft|sigfig=2}} long, {{circa}} {{convert|5|m|ft}} wide at water level, with its deck standing {{circa}} {{convert|3|m|ft|sigfig=1}} above the sea, and displacing around 100&nbsp;[[long tons]] (110&nbsp;[[short tons]]; 100&nbsp;tonnes). The galley expert [[John Coates (naval architect)|John Coates]] suggested they could maintain 7&nbsp;[[Knot (unit)|knots]] (8&nbsp;mph; 13&nbsp;km/h) for extended periods.{{sfn|Coates|2004|p=138}} The modern replica galley ''Olympias'' has achieved speeds of 8.5&nbsp;knots (10&nbsp;mph; 16&nbsp;km/h) and cruised at {{convert|4|kn|mph km/h|sigfig=2}} for hours on end.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=98}} Vessels were built as [[cataphract]], or \"protected\", ships, with a closed hull and a full deck able to carry marines and [[catapults]].{{sfn| de Souza|2008|p=358}}{{sfn|Meijer|1986|p=120}} They had a separate \"oar box\" attached to the main hull which contained the rowers. These features allowed the hull to be strengthened, increased carrying capacity and improved conditions for the rowers.{{sfn|Coates|2004|pp=129\u2013130, 138\u2013139}}\n\nIn 260&nbsp;BC the Romans set out to construct a [[Roman navy|fleet]] and used a shipwrecked Carthaginian quinquereme as a blueprint for their own.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=97, 99\u2013100}} As novice shipwrights, the Romans built copies that were heavier than the Carthaginian vessels, which made them slower and less manoeuvrable.{{sfn|Murray|2011|p=69}} The quinquereme was the workhorse of the Roman and Carthaginian fleets throughout the [[Punic Wars]], so ubiquitous that Polybius uses it as a shorthand for \"warship\" in general.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=104}} A quinquereme carried a crew of 300, of which 280 were oarsmen and 20 deck crew and officers;{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=100}} it would normally also carry a complement of 40 marines,{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=435}} and if battle was thought to be imminent, this would be increased to as many as 120.{{sfn|Casson|1995|p=121}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=102\u2013103}}\n[[File:Greek Galleys.jpg|thumb|Recreation of a fleet of triremes]]\n\nGetting the oarsmen to row as a unit, as well as execute more complex battle manoeuvres, required long and arduous training.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=278\u2013280}} At least half of the oarsmen would need to have had some experience if the ship was to be handled effectively.{{sfn|de Souza|2008|p=358}} As a result, the Romans were initially at a disadvantage against the more experienced Carthaginians. All warships were equipped with a [[Naval ram|ram]], a triple set of {{convert|60|cm|ft|sigfig=1|adj=mid |-wide }} bronze blades weighing up to {{convert|270|kg|lb|sigfig=2}} positioned at the waterline. They were made individually by the [[Lost-wax casting|lost-wax method]] to fit immovably to a galley's [[prow]] and secured with bronze spikes.{{sfn|Curry|2012|pp=35\u201336}}{{sfn|Tusa|Royal|2012|p=14}} In the century prior to the Punic Wars, boarding had become increasingly common and ramming had declined, as the [[Hellenistic-era warships|larger and heavier vessels]] adopted in this period lacked the speed and manoeuvrability necessary to ram, while their sturdier construction reduced the ram's effect even in the case of a successful attack.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=178}}{{sfn|Wallinga|1956|pp=77\u201390}}\n\nIt was the long-standing Roman procedure to appoint two men each year, known as consuls, to each lead their military forces. The [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] [[Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Asina|Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio]], the year's [[consul|senior consul]], was given command of the fleet. He put to sea with the first 17 ships produced. As the first ever Roman warships they spent some time training in home waters before sailing to [[Messana]]. There they prepared for the main fleet's arrival and supported the logistics of the Roman army at the sea crossing to Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=105}}{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=183\u20134}}\n\n==Battle==\nWhile Scipio was at the [[Strait of Messina]] he received information that the garrison of [[Lipara]] was willing to defect to the Roman side. Lipara was the main port of the Lipari Islands and was a constant threat to Roman communications across the Strait. Though his crews were still inexperienced and the newly designed and built ships were still undergoing their sea trials, the consul could not resist the temptation of conquering an important city without a fight and sailed to Lipara. It has been suggested by some ancient sources that the offer to surrender Lipara was a ruse inspired by Carthage to encourage the Romans to commit their ships where they could be ambushed, but the sources do not give much detail and are usually pro-Roman.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}}\n\nThe Romans entered the harbour at Lipara. The Carthaginian fleet was commanded by [[Hannibal Gisco]], the general who had commanded the garrison at Agrigentum, and was based at Panormus (modern-day [[Palermo]]) some {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Lipari. When he heard of the Romans' advance to Lipara he despatched 20 ships under [[Bodo (hypostrategos)|Bo\u00f6des]], a Carthaginian aristocrat, to the town. The Carthaginians arrived at night and trapped the Romans in the harbour. Bo\u00f6des led his ships in an attack on the Romans inside the harbour the next morning. Scipio's men offered little resistance. The inexperienced crews were no match for the well-drilled Carthaginians and were rapidly outfought. Some Romans panicked and fled inland and the consul himself was taken prisoner, along with many of the other Roman senior officers. Some later accounts have Scipio treacherously captured while [[parley]]ing, but this is probably a Roman fabrication. All of the Roman ships were captured, most with little damage.{{sfn|Harris|1979|pp=184\u20135}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u20136}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=61}} The battle was little more than a skirmish, and is mostly notable as the first naval encounter of the Punic Wars and the first time Roman warships had engaged in battle.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Corvus.svg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=A diagram showing the location and usage of a {{lang|la|corvus}} on a Roman galley.|{{center|The ''[[corvus (weapon)|corvus]]'', the Roman [[Naval boarding|ship boarding]] device}}]]\n\nScipio was later released, probably ransomed. His easy defeat earned him the pejorative ''[[Roman naming convention|cognomen]]'' Asina, which means ''donkey'' in Latin. This cognomen was all the more insulting because \"asina\" was the feminine form of the word donkey, as opposed to the masculine form \"asinus\". In spite of this Scipio's career prospered and he was consul for a second time in 254 BC.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=181}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}}\n\nShortly after the Lipara victory, Hannibal Gisco was scouting with 50 Carthaginian ships when he encountered the full Roman fleet. He escaped, but lost most of his ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=67}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=153}} It was after this skirmish that the Romans installed the [[corvus (weapon)|''corvus'']] on their ships.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=68}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=182}} The {{lang|la|corvus}} was a bridge {{convert|1.2|m|ft|sigfig=1}} wide and {{convert|11|m|ft}} long, with a heavy spike on the underside, which was designed to pierce and anchor into an enemy ship's deck.
