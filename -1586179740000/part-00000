The [[type species]], ''[[Harpactea hombergi|H. hombergi]]'', can grow up to a body length of {{convert|6|mm}}. Males and females are similar, but the female has no [[epigyne]].<ref name=british_spiders>{{cite book| last=Roberts| first=Michael J.| year=1985| title=The Spiders of Great Britain and Ireland| page=62| isbn=90-04-07658-1}}</ref>\n\nLike the rest of their family, they are [[nocturnal]]. Unlike them, ''Harpactea'' do not specialize on hunting [[woodlice]]. ''H. rubicunda'' also hunts ''[[Drassodes]]'' and other spiders, but most ''Harpactea'' feed on insects in addition to woodlice.\n\n==Species==\nAlmost all species of this genus appear to be [[endemism|endemic]] to small regions of the [[Mediterranean]].<ref name=rezac2008/> {{as of|2019|05}} it contains 181 species from [[Europe]] and [[Northern Africa]] to [[Turkmenistan]] and [[Iran]]:<ref name=NMBE>{{cite web| title=Gen.

The founders of this faculty were academicians [[Sergey Khristianovich]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Anatolii Dorodnitsyn|WD=Q4166843|lt=A.A. Dorodnitsyn}}, {{Interlanguage link multi|Oleg Belotserkovskii|WD=Q4082923|lt=O.M. Belotserkovskyii}}, ministers of education and aircraft industry V. Stoletov and P. Dementyev, chief designer [[V.M. Myasishchev]]. At the base of the DAFE there is [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Zhukovsky's]] school, one of the oldest Russian scientific schools. Before the establishment of the department there was the Aeromechanics Department of MIPT, which has divided into the DAFE and the Department of Aerophysics and Space Research (\u0424\u0410\u041a\u0418).

The CPUC released an order stating that they cannot begin the merger of their California operations until after the CPUC issues a final decision on the pending application, scheduled for the April 16 Voting Meeting. Mike Sievert, new T-Mobile's CEO, stated that he has the view that \u201cthe Commission lacks jurisdiction over this transaction\u201d and that T-Mobile believes that the FCC has exclusive authority to approve wireless deals. The company also has several objections to the PUC's conditions of closure, and may countersue if litigation happens or approval is under current conditions. Either way, T-Mobile has stated they are officially combined, whether or not the PUC litigates, and have warned investors of possible costs from litigation.

The conditions of approval include to provide 5G wireless service with speeds of at least 100 Mbps to 99 percent of California\u2019s population by the end of 2026; to provide 5G wireless service with speeds of at least 100 Mbps to 85 percent of California\u2019s rural population, and speeds of at least 50 Mbps available to 94 percent of California\u2019s rural population, by the end of 2026; to have fixed home Internet access available to at least 2.3 million California households, of which at least 123,000 are rural households, within six years of closing; for no retail price increases for at least three years; to offer the low-income California LifeLine program for as long as it operates in California, and enroll at least 300,000 new LifeLine customers; to increase jobs in California by at least 1,000 compared to the total number of current Sprint and T-Mobile employees; to establish the capability to serve all customers for at least 72 hours (i.e., have back-up power) after an emergency event or a utility Public Safety Power Shut-off; and finally other important commitments relating to diversity, reporting, and rural infrastructure deployment, among other topics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/03/california-public-utilities-commission-proposal-approve-t-mobile-sprint-merger/|title=California Public Utilities Commission issues proposal to approve the T-Mobile-Sprint merger|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> This is not a \"formal\" approval however, as that requires a vote.\n\n== Closure and aftermath ==\nThe deal officially closed on April 1, 2020. For now, both business' will remain separate to consumers. All retail stores, networks, rate plans, and websites will remain separate, with the merger mostly changing behind the scenes things for now. The companies have stated that, over time, the two brands will integrate into one to consumers, and they will release further information as that happens. Leadership, ownership, and stock trading for the two companies has changed immediately, however. This included CEO [[John Legere]] stepping down immediately at close, one month prior to when he was slated to exit the role, making [[Mike Sievert]] President and CEO of the combined company.<ref name=\":112\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-merger-complete/|title=T-Mobile and Sprint's merger is officially complete|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref><ref name=\":122\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.t-mobile.com/news/t-mobile-sprint-one-company|title=T-Mobile Completes Merger with Sprint to Create the New T-Mobile|last=Bellevue|last2=Washington|website=www.t-mobile.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=Overl|last4=Park|last5=April 1|first5=Kansas-|last6=2020 \u2013}}</ref><ref name=\":132\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.t-mobile.com/brand/t-mobile-sprint-merger-updates?icid=MGPO_TMO_C_20NEWTMO_J97FL0UY3YE116S1120231_HP|title=What the T-Mobile & Sprint Merger Means for You {{!}} T-Mobile|website=www.t-mobile.com|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n== Additional regulatory proceedings and litigation ==\nWhile the merger closed on April 1, the merger has not been approved by the [[California Public Utilities Commission]]. This could lead to several implications to the combined business, ranging from litigation to inability to combine operations in California. The CPUC released an order stating that they cannot begin the merger of their California operations until after the CPUC issues a final decision on the pending application, scheduled for the April 16 Voting Meeting. Mike Sievert, new T-Mobile's CEO, stated that he has the view that \u201cthe Commission lacks jurisdiction over this transaction\u201d and that T-Mobile believes that the FCC has exclusive authority to approve wireless deals. The company also has several objections to the PUC's conditions of closure, and may countersue if litigation happens or approval is under current conditions. Either way, T-Mobile has stated they are officially combined, whether or not the PUC litigates, and have warned investors of possible costs from litigation. However, they don't expect it to have significant harm on the value of the transaction or timeline of changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2020/04/california-puc-t-mobile-sprint-cant-merge-final-decision-deal/|title=California PUC says T-Mobile and Sprint can't merge until it makes a final decision on the deal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/04/t-mobile-sprint-took-a-risk-by-finishing-merger-without-calif-approval/|title=T-Mobile, Sprint took a risk by finishing merger without Calif. approval|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=2020-04-02|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n\n=== Support ===\nOn September 21, 2018, [[TracFone Wireless|Tracfone Wireless]] voiced it's support for the merger. They stated \"With the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, and the resulting more rapid deployment of a nationwide 5G network with broader coverage, greater capacity, higher throughput and lower latency, the wholesale market place will be more competitive with three full service competitors, rather than two. The increase in competition should have the greatest effect in rural areas. The resulting excess capacity would be available for MVNOs in these areas as a third option that has not been available in the current marketplace.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2018/09/tracfone-largest-mvno-u-s-fcc-supports-t-mobile-sprint-merger/|title=TracFone, largest MVNO in the U.S., tells FCC that it supports T-Mobile-Sprint merger|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nOn June 28, 2019, [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] [[Chairperson|Chairman]] [[Ajit Pai]] voiced his support for the merger. He talked about 5G and how the FCC is working to accelerate its deployment in the U.S. One of the pillars of T-Mobile and Sprint\u2019s merger is how they plan to use their combined spectrum to deploy a nationwide 5G network, and he said during his remarks that \u201cone of the most critical steps that the FCC can take is to approve the T-Mobile/Sprint transaction.\" He went on to say that Sprint has lots of mid-band spectrum, but that \u201cthe company standing alone does not have the capacity to deploy 5G in this spectrum throughout large parts of rural America.\u201d The combined T-Mobile-Sprint will have the capacity to do that, he claimed, pointing to a T-Mo and Sprint commitment to deploy mid-band 5G to 88 percent of the U.S. population, including two-thirds of rural consumers. \u201cWe should seize the opportunity to provide 5G to rural America and close the digital divide,\u201d he said.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2019/06/fcc-ajit-pai-t-mobile-sprint-merger-lawsuit-misguided/|title=FCC Chairman again voices support for T-Mobile-Sprint merger, calls lawsuit against it 'misguided'|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Opposition ===\nOn August 28, 2018, The Communication Workers of America (CWA) said that it opposed the merger between T-Mobile and Sprint as it\u2019s currently set up. The CWA, a union that represents 700,000 workers, claims that the merger would result in more than 28,000 jobs being lost, a number that it says it came to by performing an analysts based on location data for all of the retail locations involved in the proposed merger. They stated that the merger raises competitive and national security concerns, would lead to loss of jobs, and that both companies would be viable to build out nationwide 5G on their own.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmonews.com/2018/08/cwa-opposes-t-mobile-sprint-merger-28000-jobs-lost/|title=CWA argues against T-Mobile-Sprint merger, says more than 28,000 jobs will be lost|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nDish Network initially opposed the merger prior to it's deal to buy Boost Mobile and spectrum once the deal closed.

Another possibility is to build the sections unsealed, and after welding them together, pump the water out.\n\nThe [[ballast tank|ballast]] used is calculated so that the structure has approximate hydrostatic equilibrium (that is, the tunnel is roughly the same overall density as water), whereas immersed tube tunnels are ballasted more to weight them down to the sea bed. This, of course, means that a submerged floating tunnel must be anchored to the ground or to the water surface to keep it in place (which of these depends on which side of the equilibrium point the tunnel is).\n\n== Applications ==\n\n[[Image:Bridge types.svg|thumb|Water-spanning structures: '''1''': [[Suspension bridge]]  '''2''': '''Submerged floating tunnel'''  '''3''': [[Immersed tube]]  '''4''': [[Undersea tunnel]]]]\n\nSubmerged floating tubes allow construction of a tunnel in extremely deep water, where conventional bridges or tunnels are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive. They would be able to deal with [[Seismic wave|seismic disturbances]] and weather events easily (as they have some degree of freedom in regards to movement), and their structural performance is independent of length (that is, it can be very long without compromising its stability and resistance).\n\nOn the other hand, they may be vulnerable in regards to anchors or submarine traffic, which therefore has to be taken in consideration when building one.\n\nLikely applications include fjords, deep, narrow sea channels, and deep lakes.<ref>[[International Tunneling and Underground Space Association|ITA]]: [http://www.ita-aites.org/cms/404.html A New Development: The Submerged Floating Tunnel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205043257/http://www.ita-aites.org/cms/404.html |date=2008-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n== Proposals ==\n\nA submerged floating tunnel has never been built (as of 2016), but several proposals have been floated by different entities.\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Another possibility is to build the sections unsealed, and after welding them together, pump the water out.\n\nThe [[ballast tank|ballast]] used is calculated so that the structure has approximate hydrostatic equilibrium (that is, the tunnel is roughly the same overall density as water), whereas immersed tube tunnels are ballasted more to weight them down to the sea bed. This, of course, means that a submerged floating tunnel must be anchored to the ground or to the water surface to keep it in place (which of these depends on which side of the equilibrium point the tunnel is).\n\n== Applications ==\n\n[[Image:Bridge types.svg|thumb|Water-spanning structures: '''1''': [[Suspension bridge]]  '''2''': '''Submerged floating tunnel'''  '''3''': [[Immersed tube]]  '''4''': [[Undersea tunnel]]]]\n\nSubmerged floating tubes allow construction of a tunnel in extremely deep water, where conventional bridges or tunnels are technically difficult or prohibitively expensive. They would be able to deal with [[Seismic wave|seismic disturbances]] and weather events easily (as they have some degree of freedom in regards to movement), and their structural performance is independent of length (that is, it can be very long without compromising its stability and resistance).\n\nOn the other hand, they may be vulnerable in regards to anchors or submarine traffic, which therefore has to be taken in consideration when building one.\n\nLikely applications include fjords, deep, narrow sea channels, and deep lakes.<ref>[[International Tunneling and Underground Space Association|ITA]]: [http://www.ita-aites.org/cms/404.html A New Development: The Submerged Floating Tunnel] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205043257/http://www.ita-aites.org/cms/404.html |date=2008-02-05 }}</ref>\n\n== Proposals ==\n\nA submerged floating tunnel has never been built (as of 2016), but several proposals have been floated by different entities.\n\n{| class = \"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The budget was said to be around 15 billion US dollars for an undersea tunnel in the [[Sunda Strait]]; in the long term it would link up [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]] in an uninterrupted chain. The project was to begin construction in 2005 and be ready to use by 2018, and was a part of the [[AH2|Asian Highway]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0404/05/daerah/951188.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040504062851/http://www.kompas.com/kompas-cetak/0404/05/daerah/951188.htm |archivedate=2004-05-04 |language=id}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the bridge option was later favored.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kompas.com/index.php/read/xml/2008/05/19/11095316/jembatan.selat.sunda.bakal.terpanjang.di.dunia |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519180421/http://www.kompas.com/index.php/read/xml/2008/05/19/11095316/jembatan.selat.sunda.bakal.terpanjang.di.dunia |archivedate=2008-05-19 |language=id}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, Indonesian experts, led by Ir.

Wagner won his eighth (and final) [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]] in 1911, a [[National League]] record that remains unbroken to this day, and matched only once, in 1997, by [[Tony Gwynn]]. He also led the league in [[slugging percentage|slugging]] six times and [[stolen bases]] five times. Wagner was nicknamed '''\"The Flying Dutchman\"''' due to his superb speed and German heritage.

As a child, he was called Hans by his mother, which later evolved into Honus. \"Hans\" was also an alternate nickname during his major league career.

Wagner would play for five teams in that first year, in three different leagues over the course of 80 games.\n\nIn 1896 Edward Barrow, from the Wheeling, West Virginia, team that Wagner was playing on, decided to take Honus with him to his next team, the Paterson Silk Sox (Atlantic League). Barrow proved to be a good talent scout, as Wagner could play wherever he was needed, including all three bases and the outfield. Wagner would hit .313 for Paterson in 1896 and .375 in 74 games in 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/30b27632|title=Honus Wagner {{!}} Society for American Baseball Research|website=sabr.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n | quote = At shortstop there is only one candidate, the immortal Honus Wagner.

They were doing better in 1897 when Barrow persuaded club president [[Barney Dreyfuss]], club secretary [[Harry Pulliam]], and outfielder-manager [[Fred Clarke]] to go to Paterson to see Wagner play. Dreyfuss and Clarke were not impressed with the awkward-looking man, not surprising, as Wagner was oddly built \u2013 5-feet-11, 200 pounds, with a barrel chest, massive shoulders, heavily muscled arms, huge hands, and incredibly bowed legs that deprived him of any grace and several inches of height. Pulliam, though, persuaded Dreyfuss and Clarke to take a chance on him. Wagner debuted with Louisville on July 19, and hit .338 in 61 games.\n\nBy his second season, Wagner was already one of the best hitters in the [[National League]] although he came up short a percentage point from finishing the season at .300. Following the {{Baseball year|1899}} season, the NL contracted from twelve to eight teams, with the Colonels one of four teams eliminated. Owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]], who had purchased half ownership in the Pirates, took Wagner and many of his other top players with him to the Pittsburgh team.\n\n[[Tommy Leach]] recounted his impressions of joining the Louisville club in 1898 with hopes of winning the starting job at third base:\n\n{{quote|text=I hardly had time to get settled before it hits me that this guy the Louisville club had at third base was practically doing the impossible. I'm sitting on the bench the first day I reported, and along about the third inning an opposing batter smacks a line drive down the third-base line that looked like at least a sure double. Well, this big Louisville third baseman jumped over after it like he was on steel springs, slapped it down with his bare hand, scrambled after it at least ten feet, and fired a bullet over to first base. The runner was out by two or three steps.\n\nI'm sitting on the bench and my eyes are popping out. So I poked the guy sitting next to me, and asked him who the devil that big fellow was on third base.\n\n\"Why, that's Wagner,\" he says. \"He's the best third baseman in the league.\"\n\nAnd it also turned out that while Honus was the best third baseman in the league, he was also the best first baseman, the best second baseman, the best shortstop, and the best outfielder. That was in fielding. And since he led the league in batting eight times between 1900 and 1911, you know that he was the best hitter, too. As well as the best base runner.|author=Tommy Leach, as told to Lawrence Ritter|source=''[[The Glory of Their Times]]''}}\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates===\nThe move to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] signified Wagner's emergence as a premier hitter. In 1900, Wagner won his first batting championship with a .381 mark and also led the league in [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (45), [[triple (baseball)|triples]] (22), and [[slugging percentage]] (.573), all of which were career highs. For the next nine seasons, Wagner's average did not fall below .330.\n[[File:1905 Honus Wagner National Police Gazette.jpg|thumb|right|Honus Wagner in 1905]]\nIn {{Baseball year|1901}}, the [[American League]] began to sign National League players, creating a bidding war, which depleted the league of many talented players. Wagner was offered a $20,000 contract by the [[Chicago White Sox]], but turned it down and continued to play with the Pirates.\n\nPrior to 1904, Wagner had played several positions, but settled into the shortstop role full-time that season, where he became a skilled fielder. His biography on BaseballLibrary.com describes his gritty style:\n\n<blockquote>Bowlegged, barrel-chested, long-limbed ... he was often likened to an octopus. When he fielded grounders, his huge hands also collected large scoops of infield dirt, which accompanied his throws to first like the tail of a comet.<ref>[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=honus_wagner_1874 Discount Cialis Without Prescription \u2013 FDA APPROVED Drug Store<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322022652/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Honus_Wagner_1874 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1898, Wagner won a distance contest in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] by throwing a baseball more than 403 feet.<ref>[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=honus_wagner_1874&page=chronology The Ballplayers \u2013 Honus Wagner | BaseballLibrary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011044405/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Honus_Wagner_1874&page=chronology |date=2007-10-11 }}</ref>  In August 1899, he became the first player credited with stealing second base, third, and home in succession under the new rule differentiating between advanced bases and stolen bases.

Wagner retired with the National League record for most steals of home (27), which was broken by [[Greasy Neale]] in 1922.\n\nIn September 1905, Wagner signed a contract to produce the first bat with a player's signature, the [[Louisville Slugger]], becoming the first sportsperson to endorse a commercial product;<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Surowiecki |first=James |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2009/12/21/091221ta_talk_surowiecki |title=The Tiger Woods scandal and celebrity endorsements |magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date= December 21, 2009|accessdate=September 28, 2012}}</ref> the Honus Wagner was to become a best-seller for years. One month later, with one point separating him from Reds center fielder [[Cy Seymour]] for the batting title, Wagner fell short in a head-to-head matchup on the final day of the season, with Seymour collecting four hits to Wagner's two, as contemporary press reports stated that the fans were far more interested in the Seymour-Wagner battle than in the outcome of the games.\n\nShortly before the {{Baseball year|1908}} season, Wagner retired. Starting to panic, owner Barney Dreyfuss offered him $10,000, making him the highest paid Pirate for many years. He returned to the Pirates early in the 1908 season, and finished two home runs short of the league's [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], leading the league in hitting (for the sixth time)\u201a hits\u201a total bases\u201a doubles\u201a triples\u201a RBI\u201a and stolen bases. Wagner took over the batting lead from the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]' flamboyant outfielder [[Mike Donlin]] during a July 25 game against the Giants and their star pitcher [[Christy Mathewson]]. Wagner was 5-for-5 in the game; after each hit, he reportedly held up another finger to Donlin, who went hitless, and who had just beaten runner-up Wagner by a wide margin in a \"most popular player\" poll.\n\n[[Bill James]] cites Wagner's 1908 season as the greatest single season for any player in baseball history. He notes that the league ERA of 2.35 was the lowest of the dead ball era and about half of the ERAs of modern baseball. Since Wagner hit .354 with 109 RBI in an environment when half as many runs were scored as today, he asks, \"if you had a Gold Glove shortstop, like Wagner, who drove in 218 runs, what would he be worth?\"<ref>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, by Bill James, The Free Press, 2001, pp. 548\u2013549.</ref>\n\n===1903 and 1909 World Series===\n[[File:Honus Wagner by Conlon c1910-11.jpg|thumb|left|Wagner in 1910.]]\nIn {{Baseball year|1903}}, the Pirates played the [[Boston Americans]] in [[Major League Baseball]]'s inaugural [[World Series]]. Wagner, by this point, was an established star and much was expected of him, especially since the Pirates' starting rotation was decimated by injury. Wagner himself was not at full strength and hit only .222 for the series. The Americans, meanwhile, had some fans, called the \"[[Royal Rooters]]\" who, whenever Wagner came to bat, sang \"Honus, Honus, why do you hit so badly?\" to the tune of \"[[Tessie]]\", a popular song of the day. The Rooters, led by Boston bartender [[Michael T. McGreevy|Michael \"Nuf Ced\" McGreevy]], even travelled to Pittsburgh to continue their heckling. Pittsburgh lost in the best-of-nine series, five games to three, to a team led by pitchers [[Cy Young]] and [[Bill Dinneen]] and [[third baseman]]\u2013[[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Jimmy Collins]]. [[Christy Mathewson]], in his book \"Pitching in a Pinch\" wrote: \"For some time after \"Hans\" Wagner's poor showing in the world's series of 1903 ... it was reported that he was \"yellow\" (poor in the clutch). This grieved the Dutchman deeply, for I don't know a ball player in either league who would assay less quit to the ton than Wagner ... This was the real tragedy in Wagner's career.

The following spring, he refused to send his portrait to a \"Hall of Fame\" for batting champions, citing his play in the World Series.  \"I was too bum last year\", he wrote. \"I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch?

The Pirates faced [[Ty Cobb]]'s [[Detroit Tigers]]. The series was the only meeting of the two superior batsmen of the day, and the first time that the batting champions of each league faced one another (this later occurred thrice more, in the 1931, 1954 and 2012 World Series). Wagner was by this time 35 years old, Cobb just 22.\n\nThis time, Wagner could not be stifled as he outhit Cobb, .333 to .231, and [[stolen base|stole]] six bases, establishing the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: \"We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but [[Silk O'Loughlin]], the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], overruled it. We kept the squawk going for a minute or so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of course I was out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let's play ball.'\"<ref name=williams>{{Cite book | last=Williams | first=Joe | title=The Joe Williams Baseball Reader | publisher=Algonquin Books | year=1989 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/joewilliamsbaseb0000will/page/205 205 pgs] | isbn=0-945575-07-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/joewilliamsbaseb0000will/page/205 }}</ref>\n\nThere was also a story that was widely circulated over the years and famously recounted in Lawrence Ritter's ''The Glory of Their Times'', that at one point Cobb was on first; he bragged to Wagner that he was going to steal second and threatened to assault him physically doing it; Wagner defiantly dared him to try it and placed an especially rough tag to Cobb's mouth; and the two exchanged choice words. Cobb denied it in his autobiography, and the play-by-play of the 1909 World Series confirms that the event could not have happened as stated: Cobb was never tagged out by Wagner in a caught-stealing. The Pirates won the series in seven games behind the pitching of rookie [[Babe Adams]].\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Honus Wagner by Conlon, 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Wagner in 1914.]]\nIn 1910, Wagner's average fell to .320, his lowest average since {{Baseball year|1898}}. Nevertheless, he aged exceptionally well; the three highest [[OPS+]] seasons by any shortstop aged 35 or older belong to Wagner, and even his age-41 season ranks 8th on the list.\n\nWagner won the 1911 batting title by the narrowest of margins. He went hitless in a 1\u20130 win against the Cubs on May 30, but a successful league protest by the Cubs wiped out the result (and Wagner's at-bats). Wagner ended up edging the [[Boston Rustlers]]' [[Doc Miller]], .334 to .333. The Pirates were in contention into August, but an ankle injury sidelined Wagner for 25 games and the team slid from the race.\n\nOn June 9, {{Baseball year|1914}}, at age 40, Wagner recorded his 3,000th [[hit (baseball)|hit]], a double off Philadelphia's [[Erskine Mayer]], the second player in baseball history to reach the figure, after [[Cap Anson]], and [[Nap Lajoie]] joined them three months later. This accomplishment, however, came during a down period for Wagner and Pirates. Wagner hit only .252 in 1914, the lowest average of his career. In July 1915, he became the oldest player to hit a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], a record which stood for 70 years until topped by 43-year-old [[Tony P\u00e9rez]]. In 1916, Wagner became the oldest player to hit an inside-the-park home run.\n\nIn {{Baseball year|1917}}, following another retirement, Wagner returned for his final, abbreviated season. Returning in June, he was spiked in July and played only sparingly for the remainder of the year, batting .265. He briefly held the role of interim manager, but after going 1\u20134, Wagner told owner Dreyfuss the job was not for him. He retired as the NL's all-time hit leader, with 3,430.  (Subsequent research has since revised this total to 3,418.)  It took 45 years for St. Louis' [[Stan Musial]] to surpass Wagner's hit total.\n\nWagner has been considered one of the very best all-around players to ever play baseball since the day he retired in 1917. Baseball historian and statistician [[Bill James]] named Honus Wagner as the second best player of all time after Babe Ruth, rating him as the best major league player in 1900 and each year from 1902 to 1908.<ref>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Almanac, by Bill James, The Free Press, 2001</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bill James|title=The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Villard|year=1988|page=448}}</ref> Statisticians John Thorn and Pete Palmer rate Wagner as ninth all-time in their \"Total Player Ranking\".<ref name=ranking>{{Cite book| last=Thorn | first=John | title=Total Baseball | publisher=Penguin USA | year=1997 | pages=2464 pgs | isbn=0-670-87511-2 }}</ref> Many of the greats who played or managed against Wagner, including Babe Ruth, [[Ty Cobb]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], and [[Walter Johnson]], list him at shortstop on their All-Time teams.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Bill James|title=The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Villard|year=1988|page=157}}</ref>\n\n===Life after baseball===\n[[File:Honus Wagner 1940 Play Ball card.jpeg|thumb|Wagner as a Pirates coach, circa 1940]]\nWagner was not finished playing baseball after his retirement from major league baseball. He managed and played for a semi-pro team.<ref>\"The Old Boy Himself\", ''The Pittsburgh Press'', May 23, 1926, Sporting Section, p.7, c.4.</ref>\nAfter retirement, Wagner served the Pirates as a coach for 39 years, most notably as a hitting instructor from {{Baseball year|1933}} to {{Baseball year|1952}}. [[Arky Vaughan]], [[Ralph Kiner]], [[Pie Traynor]] ([[player-manager]] from {{Baseball year|1934}}\u2013{{Baseball year|1939}}), and [[Hank Greenberg]] (although Greenberg was in his final major league season in 1947, his only season with the Pirates, and very well established) all future Hall of Famers, were notable \"pupils\" of Wagner. During this time, he wore uniform number 14, but later changed it to his more famous 33, which was later the number retired for him. (His entire playing career was in the days before uniform numbers were worn.) His appearances at National League stadiums during his coaching years were always well received and Wagner remained a beloved ambassador of baseball. Wagner also coached baseball and basketball at Carnegie Institute of Technology, which is now part of [[Carnegie Mellon University]].\n\nIn 1928, Wagner ran for the office of [[Sheriff]] of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] but lost. He was appointed as a deputy of the [[Allegheny County Sheriff's Office]] in 1942. He also ran a well-known [[sports equipment|sporting goods]] company. A sporting goods store bearing the name \"Honus Wagner\" operated in downtown Pittsburgh for 93 years before closing permanently in 2011.<ref name=\"close\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11005/1115586-28.stm|title=Downtown Honus Wagner store has finally struck out|author=Mark Belko|date=January 5, 2011|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Pirates hosted the [[1944 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] at Forbes Field.

He died on December 6, 1955 at the age of 81, and he is buried at Jefferson Memorial Cemetery in the South Hills area of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].\n\n===Film legacy===\nWagner, along with his famous baseball card, was one of the earliest athletes to make the crossover into pop culture film. He starred as a sports hero in 1919's ''Spring Fever'' with [[Moe Howard]] and [[Shemp Howard]] of the [[Three Stooges]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ourgame.mlblogs.com/lost-and-found-baseball-part-2-12163c87037b |title=Lost (and Found) Baseball, Part 2}}</ref> More recently, he has been depicted as the subject of ''[[The Winning Season (2004 film)|The Winning Season]]'', as well as in a brief scene in the movie ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]''.\n\n===Baseball legacy===\n[[File:Honuswagnerstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Honus Wagner (Vittor)|Wagner statue]] at<br />[[PNC Park]]]]\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image  = Pirates_33HW.png\n|Name   = Honus Wagner\n|Number = 33\n|Team   = Pittsburgh Pirates\n|Year   = 1956\n|}}\n\nWhen the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] held its first election in 1936, Wagner tied for second in the voting with [[Babe Ruth]], trailing Cobb. A 1942 [[The Sporting News|''Sporting News'']] poll of 100 former players and managers confirmed this opinion, with Wagner finishing 43 votes behind Cobb and six ahead of Ruth. In 1969, on the 100th anniversary of professional baseball, a vote was taken to honor the greatest players ever, and Wagner was selected as the all-time shortstop. In 1999, 82 years after his last game and 44 years since his death, Wagner was voted Number 13 on ''The Sporting News''' list of the 100 Greatest Players, where he was again the highest-ranking shortstop. That same year, he was selected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] by the oversight committee, after losing out in the popular vote to [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] and [[Ernie Banks]].<ref name=century>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/limc100.shtml |title=All Century Team  |accessdate=2008-09-15 |work= |publisher=baseball-almanac.com |date= }}</ref>\n\n[[Christy Mathewson]] asserted that Wagner was the only player he faced that did not have a weakness. Mathewson felt the only way to keep Wagner from hitting was to not pitch to him.<ref>Mathewson, Christy. \"Pitching in a Pinch.\" Brunauer Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n\"A stirring march and two step\", titled \"Husky Hans\", and \"respectfully dedicated to Hans Wagner, Three time Champion Batsman of The National League\" was written by William J. Hartz in 1904.\n\n[[Bill James]] says that Wagner is easily the greatest shortstop of all time, noting that the difference between Wagner and the second greatest shortstop, in James' estimation [[Arky Vaughan]], is roughly the same as the gulf between Vaughan and the 20th greatest shortstop.\n\nWagner is mentioned in the poem ''[[Line-Up for Yesterday]]'' by [[Ogden Nash]].\n\n{{quote box |width= 18em |border= 4px |align= center|bgcolor= #FAF0E6 |qalign= center | title=''Line-Up for Yesterday''|quote=''W is for Wagner,''<br />''The bowlegged beauty;''<br />''Short was closed to all traffic''<br />''With Honus on duty.''\n|source=&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[Ogden Nash]]'', ''[[Sport (US magazine)|Sport]]'' magazine (January 1949)<ref name=nashpoem>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml |title=Line-Up For Yesterday by Ogden Nash |accessdate=2008-09-16 |work=Ogden Nash |publisher=Sport Magazine |date= }}</ref> }}\n\n[[File:HONUS WAGNER LOCKER.JPG|thumb|right|Honus Wagner's locker on display at the Hall of Fame]]\nA life-size [[Honus Wagner (Vittor)|statue of Wagner]] swinging a bat, atop a marble pedestal featuring admiring children, was forged by a local sculptor named [[Frank Vittor]], and placed outside the left field corner gate at [[Forbes Field]]. It was dedicated on April 30, 1955, and the then-frail Wagner was well enough to attend and wave to his many fans. The Pirates have relocated twice since then, and the statue has come along with them. It now stands outside the main gate of [[PNC Park]]. The statue roughly faces the site of the Pirates' original home, [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]], so in a sense Wagner has come full circle.\n\nWagner is honored in the form of a small stadium residing behind Carnegie Elementary School on Washington Avenue in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. The stadium serves as the home field for Carlynton High School varsity sports. The Historical Society of Carnegie History Center houses the Honus Wagner Sports Museum which includes many Wagner collectibles and memorabilia. Visitors receive replicas of the famous card.\n\nIn the 1992 episode [[Homer at the Bat]], the popular TV show [[The Simpsons]] made a reference to Wagner. The character [[Mr. Burns]] lists three ringers he wants for his company's baseball team, but they are Honus Wagner, [[Cap Anson]], and \"[[Mordecai 'Three Fingers' Brown]]\". His assistant has to point out that they are not only retired, but long-dead ... Anson having played in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 2000, Wagner was honored with a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. postage stamp]]. The stamp was issued as part of a \"Legends of Baseball\" series that honored twenty all-time greats in conjunction with MLB's All Century team.\n\n===T206 Baseball card===\n{{Main|T206 Honus Wagner}}\n[[File:HonusWagnerCard.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Honus Wagner card]]\nThe '''T206 Honus Wagner baseball card''' is one of the rarest and most expensive [[baseball card]]s in the world, as only 57 copies are known to exist.<ref>{{Cite book | last=James | first=Bill | authorlink=Bill James | title=[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract]] | publisher=Simon & Schuster | location=New York | year=2001 | isbn=0-684-80697-5 | page=[https://archive.org/details/newbilljameshist00jame/page/358 358] }} James, one of baseball's premier historians and statisticians, ranked Wagner as the second-best player of all time, behind [[Babe Ruth]].

Wagner won his eighth (and final) [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]] in 1911, a [[National League]] record that remains unbroken to this day, and matched only once, in 1997, by [[Tony Gwynn]]. He also led the league in [[slugging percentage|slugging]] six times and [[stolen bases]] five times. Wagner was nicknamed '''\"The Flying Dutchman\"''' due to his superb speed and German heritage.  This nickname was a nod to the [[Flying Dutchman|popular folk-tale]] made into a [[The Flying Dutchman (opera)|famous opera]] by another [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]].\n\nIn {{Baseball year|1936}}, the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] inducted Wagner as one of [[1936 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|the first five members]].

As a child, he was called Hans by his mother, which later evolved into Honus. \"Hans\" was also an alternate nickname during his major league career. Wagner dropped out of school at age 12 to help his father and brothers in the [[coal mines]]. In their free time, he and his brothers played sandlot baseball and developed their skills to such an extent that three of his brothers went on to become professionals as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Wagner__Honus.html |title=Honus Wagner |publisher=Pabook.libraries.psu.edu |accessdate=2015-02-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515184023/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Wagner__Honus.html |archivedate=2013-05-15 }}</ref>\n\nWagner's older brother, [[Butts Wagner|Albert \"Butts\" Wagner]], who had a brief major league career himself, is often credited with getting Honus his first tryout.

Albert suggested Honus in 1895 when his Inter-State League team was in need of help. Wagner would play for five teams in that first year, in three different leagues over the course of 80 games.\n\nIn 1896 Edward Barrow, from the Wheeling, West Virginia, team that Wagner was playing on, decided to take Honus with him to his next team, the Paterson Silk Sox (Atlantic League). Barrow proved to be a good talent scout, as Wagner could play wherever he was needed, including all three bases and the outfield. Wagner would hit .313 for Paterson in 1896 and .375 in 74 games in 1897.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sabr.org/bioproj/person/30b27632|title=Honus Wagner {{!}} Society for American Baseball Research|website=sabr.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n | quote = At shortstop there is only one candidate, the immortal Honus Wagner.

He was perhaps the greatest right-handed hitter of all time. He had remarkably long arms, hams for hands, and just drew the ball to him. Ed Barrow once told me he could have been as good in any position but he made his greatest name as shortstop. He led the National League seven times at bat and he was always up with the leaders when he was in his forties.\n|source=&nbsp;\u2014Babe Ruth<ref>{{Cite book|authors=Babe Ruth and Bob Considine|title=The Babe Ruth Story|publisher=Scholastic|year=1948|page=224}}</ref>\n| width = 40%\n| align = right\n}}\n\n===Louisville Colonels===\n[[File:1897 Honus Wagner.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Wagner in 1897]]\nRecognizing that Wagner should be playing at the highest level, Barrow contacted the Louisville Colonels, who had finished last in the National League in 1896 with a record of 38-93. They were doing better in 1897 when Barrow persuaded club president [[Barney Dreyfuss]], club secretary [[Harry Pulliam]], and outfielder-manager [[Fred Clarke]] to go to Paterson to see Wagner play. Dreyfuss and Clarke were not impressed with the awkward-looking man, not surprising, as Wagner was oddly built \u2013 5-feet-11, 200 pounds, with a barrel chest, massive shoulders, heavily muscled arms, huge hands, and incredibly bowed legs that deprived him of any grace and several inches of height. Pulliam, though, persuaded Dreyfuss and Clarke to take a chance on him. Wagner debuted with Louisville on July 19, and hit .338 in 61 games.\n\nBy his second season, Wagner was already one of the best hitters in the [[National League]] although he came up short a percentage point from finishing the season at .300. Following the {{Baseball year|1899}} season, the NL contracted from twelve to eight teams, with the Colonels one of four teams eliminated. Owner [[Barney Dreyfuss]], who had purchased half ownership in the Pirates, took Wagner and many of his other top players with him to the Pittsburgh team.\n\n[[Tommy Leach]] recounted his impressions of joining the Louisville club in 1898 with hopes of winning the starting job at third base:\n\n{{quote|text=I hardly had time to get settled before it hits me that this guy the Louisville club had at third base was practically doing the impossible. I'm sitting on the bench the first day I reported, and along about the third inning an opposing batter smacks a line drive down the third-base line that looked like at least a sure double. Well, this big Louisville third baseman jumped over after it like he was on steel springs, slapped it down with his bare hand, scrambled after it at least ten feet, and fired a bullet over to first base. The runner was out by two or three steps.\n\nI'm sitting on the bench and my eyes are popping out. So I poked the guy sitting next to me, and asked him who the devil that big fellow was on third base.\n\n\"Why, that's Wagner,\" he says. \"He's the best third baseman in the league.\"\n\nAnd it also turned out that while Honus was the best third baseman in the league, he was also the best first baseman, the best second baseman, the best shortstop, and the best outfielder. That was in fielding. And since he led the league in batting eight times between 1900 and 1911, you know that he was the best hitter, too. As well as the best base runner.|author=Tommy Leach, as told to Lawrence Ritter|source=''[[The Glory of Their Times]]''}}\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates===\nThe move to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] signified Wagner's emergence as a premier hitter. In 1900, Wagner won his first batting championship with a .381 mark and also led the league in [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (45), [[triple (baseball)|triples]] (22), and [[slugging percentage]] (.573), all of which were career highs. For the next nine seasons, Wagner's average did not fall below .330.\n[[File:1905 Honus Wagner National Police Gazette.jpg|thumb|right|Honus Wagner in 1905]]\nIn {{Baseball year|1901}}, the [[American League]] began to sign National League players, creating a bidding war, which depleted the league of many talented players. Wagner was offered a $20,000 contract by the [[Chicago White Sox]], but turned it down and continued to play with the Pirates.\n\nPrior to 1904, Wagner had played several positions, but settled into the shortstop role full-time that season, where he became a skilled fielder. His biography on BaseballLibrary.com describes his gritty style:\n\n<blockquote>Bowlegged, barrel-chested, long-limbed ... he was often likened to an octopus. When he fielded grounders, his huge hands also collected large scoops of infield dirt, which accompanied his throws to first like the tail of a comet.<ref>[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=honus_wagner_1874 Discount Cialis Without Prescription \u2013 FDA APPROVED Drug Store<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322022652/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Honus_Wagner_1874 |date=2009-03-22 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1898, Wagner won a distance contest in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] by throwing a baseball more than 403 feet.<ref>[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=honus_wagner_1874&page=chronology The Ballplayers \u2013 Honus Wagner | BaseballLibrary.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011044405/http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Honus_Wagner_1874&page=chronology |date=2007-10-11 }}</ref>  In August 1899, he became the first player credited with stealing second base, third, and home in succession under the new rule differentiating between advanced bases and stolen bases. He repeated the feat in 1902, 1907, and 1909. Wagner retired with the National League record for most steals of home (27), which was broken by [[Greasy Neale]] in 1922.\n\nIn September 1905, Wagner signed a contract to produce the first bat with a player's signature, the [[Louisville Slugger]], becoming the first sportsperson to endorse a commercial product;<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Surowiecki |first=James |url=http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2009/12/21/091221ta_talk_surowiecki |title=The Tiger Woods scandal and celebrity endorsements |magazine=[[The New Yorker]]|date= December 21, 2009|accessdate=September 28, 2012}}</ref> the Honus Wagner was to become a best-seller for years. One month later, with one point separating him from Reds center fielder [[Cy Seymour]] for the batting title, Wagner fell short in a head-to-head matchup on the final day of the season, with Seymour collecting four hits to Wagner's two, as contemporary press reports stated that the fans were far more interested in the Seymour-Wagner battle than in the outcome of the games.\n\nShortly before the {{Baseball year|1908}} season, Wagner retired. Starting to panic, owner Barney Dreyfuss offered him $10,000, making him the highest paid Pirate for many years. He returned to the Pirates early in the 1908 season, and finished two home runs short of the league's [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], leading the league in hitting (for the sixth time)\u201a hits\u201a total bases\u201a doubles\u201a triples\u201a RBI\u201a and stolen bases. Wagner took over the batting lead from the [[New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]]' flamboyant outfielder [[Mike Donlin]] during a July 25 game against the Giants and their star pitcher [[Christy Mathewson]]. Wagner was 5-for-5 in the game; after each hit, he reportedly held up another finger to Donlin, who went hitless, and who had just beaten runner-up Wagner by a wide margin in a \"most popular player\" poll.\n\n[[Bill James]] cites Wagner's 1908 season as the greatest single season for any player in baseball history. He notes that the league ERA of 2.35 was the lowest of the dead ball era and about half of the ERAs of modern baseball. Since Wagner hit .354 with 109 RBI in an environment when half as many runs were scored as today, he asks, \"if you had a Gold Glove shortstop, like Wagner, who drove in 218 runs, what would he be worth?\"<ref>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract, by Bill James, The Free Press, 2001, pp. 548\u2013549.</ref>\n\n===1903 and 1909 World Series===\n[[File:Honus Wagner by Conlon c1910-11.jpg|thumb|left|Wagner in 1910.]]\nIn {{Baseball year|1903}}, the Pirates played the [[Boston Americans]] in [[Major League Baseball]]'s inaugural [[World Series]]. Wagner, by this point, was an established star and much was expected of him, especially since the Pirates' starting rotation was decimated by injury. Wagner himself was not at full strength and hit only .222 for the series. The Americans, meanwhile, had some fans, called the \"[[Royal Rooters]]\" who, whenever Wagner came to bat, sang \"Honus, Honus, why do you hit so badly?\" to the tune of \"[[Tessie]]\", a popular song of the day. The Rooters, led by Boston bartender [[Michael T. McGreevy|Michael \"Nuf Ced\" McGreevy]], even travelled to Pittsburgh to continue their heckling. Pittsburgh lost in the best-of-nine series, five games to three, to a team led by pitchers [[Cy Young]] and [[Bill Dinneen]] and [[third baseman]]\u2013[[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Jimmy Collins]]. [[Christy Mathewson]], in his book \"Pitching in a Pinch\" wrote: \"For some time after \"Hans\" Wagner's poor showing in the world's series of 1903 ... it was reported that he was \"yellow\" (poor in the clutch). This grieved the Dutchman deeply, for I don't know a ball player in either league who would assay less quit to the ton than Wagner ... This was the real tragedy in Wagner's career. Notwithstanding his stolid appearance, he is a sensitive player, and this has hurt him more than anything else in his life ever has.\"<ref name=guide>{{Cite book| last=Mathewson | first=Christy | title=Pitching In A Pinch | publisher=Read Books | year=2008 | pages=324 pgs | isbn=1-4086-9102-7 }}</ref>\n\nWagner was distraught by his performance. The following spring, he refused to send his portrait to a \"Hall of Fame\" for batting champions, citing his play in the World Series.  \"I was too bum last year\", he wrote. \"I was a joke in that Boston-Pittsburgh Series. What does it profit a man to hammer along and make a few hits when they are not needed only to fall down when it comes to a pinch?  I would be ashamed to have my picture up now.\"<ref name=ashamed>{{Cite book| last=Valeria | first=Dennis and Jeanne Burke | title=Honus Wagner: A Biography | publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press | year=1995 | pages=85\u201386 | isbn=0-8229-5665-9 }}</ref>\n\nWagner and the Pirates were given a chance to prove that they were not \"yellow\" in {{Baseball year|1909}}. The Pirates faced [[Ty Cobb]]'s [[Detroit Tigers]]. The series was the only meeting of the two superior batsmen of the day, and the first time that the batting champions of each league faced one another (this later occurred thrice more, in the 1931, 1954 and 2012 World Series). Wagner was by this time 35 years old, Cobb just 22.\n\nThis time, Wagner could not be stifled as he outhit Cobb, .333 to .231, and [[stolen base|stole]] six bases, establishing the new Series record. The speed demon Cobb only managed two steals, one of which Cobb himself admitted was a botched call. Wagner recounted: \"We had him out at second. We put up a squawk, but [[Silk O'Loughlin]], the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], overruled it. We kept the squawk going for a minute or so, making no headway of course, and then Cobb spoke up. He turned to O'Loughlin, an American League umpire, by the way, and said, 'Of course I was out. They had me by a foot. You just booted the play, so come on, let's play ball.'\"<ref name=williams>{{Cite book | last=Williams | first=Joe | title=The Joe Williams Baseball Reader | publisher=Algonquin Books | year=1989 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/joewilliamsbaseb0000will/page/205 205 pgs] | isbn=0-945575-07-6 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/joewilliamsbaseb0000will/page/205 }}</ref>\n\nThere was also a story that was widely circulated over the years and famously recounted in Lawrence Ritter's ''The Glory of Their Times'', that at one point Cobb was on first; he bragged to Wagner that he was going to steal second and threatened to assault him physically doing it; Wagner defiantly dared him to try it and placed an especially rough tag to Cobb's mouth; and the two exchanged choice words. Cobb denied it in his autobiography, and the play-by-play of the 1909 World Series confirms that the event could not have happened as stated: Cobb was never tagged out by Wagner in a caught-stealing. The Pirates won the series in seven games behind the pitching of rookie [[Babe Adams]].\n\n===Later career===\n[[File:Honus Wagner by Conlon, 1914.jpg|thumb|right|Wagner in 1914.]]\nIn 1910, Wagner's average fell to .320, his lowest average since {{Baseball year|1898}}. Nevertheless, he aged exceptionally well; the three highest [[OPS+]] seasons by any shortstop aged 35 or older belong to Wagner, and even his age-41 season ranks 8th on the list.\n\nWagner won the 1911 batting title by the narrowest of margins. He went hitless in a 1\u20130 win against the Cubs on May 30, but a successful league protest by the Cubs wiped out the result (and Wagner's at-bats). Wagner ended up edging the [[Boston Rustlers]]' [[Doc Miller]], .334 to .333. The Pirates were in contention into August, but an ankle injury sidelined Wagner for 25 games and the team slid from the race.\n\nOn June 9, {{Baseball year|1914}}, at age 40, Wagner recorded his 3,000th [[hit (baseball)|hit]], a double off Philadelphia's [[Erskine Mayer]], the second player in baseball history to reach the figure, after [[Cap Anson]], and [[Nap Lajoie]] joined them three months later. This accomplishment, however, came during a down period for Wagner and Pirates. Wagner hit only .252 in 1914, the lowest average of his career. In July 1915, he became the oldest player to hit a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]], a record which stood for 70 years until topped by 43-year-old [[Tony P\u00e9rez]]. In 1916, Wagner became the oldest player to hit an inside-the-park home run.\n\nIn {{Baseball year|1917}}, following another retirement, Wagner returned for his final, abbreviated season. Returning in June, he was spiked in July and played only sparingly for the remainder of the year, batting .265. He briefly held the role of interim manager, but after going 1\u20134, Wagner told owner Dreyfuss the job was not for him. He retired as the NL's all-time hit leader, with 3,430.  (Subsequent research has since revised this total to 3,418.)  It took 45 years for St. Louis' [[Stan Musial]] to surpass Wagner's hit total.\n\nWagner has been considered one of the very best all-around players to ever play baseball since the day he retired in 1917. Baseball historian and statistician [[Bill James]] named Honus Wagner as the second best player of all time after Babe Ruth, rating him as the best major league player in 1900 and each year from 1902 to 1908.<ref>The New Bill James Historical Baseball Almanac, by Bill James, The Free Press, 2001</ref><ref>{{Cite book|author=Bill James|title=The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Villard|year=1988|page=448}}</ref> Statisticians John Thorn and Pete Palmer rate Wagner as ninth all-time in their \"Total Player Ranking\".<ref name=ranking>{{Cite book| last=Thorn | first=John | title=Total Baseball | publisher=Penguin USA | year=1997 | pages=2464 pgs | isbn=0-670-87511-2 }}</ref> Many of the greats who played or managed against Wagner, including Babe Ruth, [[Ty Cobb]], [[Rogers Hornsby]], and [[Walter Johnson]], list him at shortstop on their All-Time teams.<ref>{{Cite book|author=Bill James|title=The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|publisher=Villard|year=1988|page=157}}</ref>\n\n===Life after baseball===\n[[File:Honus Wagner 1940 Play Ball card.jpeg|thumb|Wagner as a Pirates coach, circa 1940]]\nWagner was not finished playing baseball after his retirement from major league baseball. He managed and played for a semi-pro team.<ref>\"The Old Boy Himself\", ''The Pittsburgh Press'', May 23, 1926, Sporting Section, p.7, c.4.</ref>\nAfter retirement, Wagner served the Pirates as a coach for 39 years, most notably as a hitting instructor from {{Baseball year|1933}} to {{Baseball year|1952}}. [[Arky Vaughan]], [[Ralph Kiner]], [[Pie Traynor]] ([[player-manager]] from {{Baseball year|1934}}\u2013{{Baseball year|1939}}), and [[Hank Greenberg]] (although Greenberg was in his final major league season in 1947, his only season with the Pirates, and very well established) all future Hall of Famers, were notable \"pupils\" of Wagner. During this time, he wore uniform number 14, but later changed it to his more famous 33, which was later the number retired for him. (His entire playing career was in the days before uniform numbers were worn.) His appearances at National League stadiums during his coaching years were always well received and Wagner remained a beloved ambassador of baseball. Wagner also coached baseball and basketball at Carnegie Institute of Technology, which is now part of [[Carnegie Mellon University]].\n\nIn 1928, Wagner ran for the office of [[Sheriff]] of [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] but lost. He was appointed as a deputy of the [[Allegheny County Sheriff's Office]] in 1942. He also ran a well-known [[sports equipment|sporting goods]] company. A sporting goods store bearing the name \"Honus Wagner\" operated in downtown Pittsburgh for 93 years before closing permanently in 2011.<ref name=\"close\">{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/11005/1115586-28.stm|title=Downtown Honus Wagner store has finally struck out|author=Mark Belko|date=January 5, 2011|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=January 20, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe Pirates hosted the [[1944 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]] at Forbes Field.

He died on December 6, 1955 at the age of 81, and he is buried at Jefferson Memorial Cemetery in the South Hills area of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]].\n\n===Film legacy===\nWagner, along with his famous baseball card, was one of the earliest athletes to make the crossover into pop culture film. He starred as a sports hero in 1919's ''Spring Fever'' with [[Moe Howard]] and [[Shemp Howard]] of the [[Three Stooges]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ourgame.mlblogs.com/lost-and-found-baseball-part-2-12163c87037b |title=Lost (and Found) Baseball, Part 2}}</ref> More recently, he has been depicted as the subject of ''[[The Winning Season (2004 film)|The Winning Season]]'', as well as in a brief scene in the movie ''[[Cobb (film)|Cobb]]''.\n\n===Baseball legacy===\n[[File:Honuswagnerstatue.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Honus Wagner (Vittor)|Wagner statue]] at<br />[[PNC Park]]]]\n{{MLBBioRet\n|Image  = Pirates_33HW.png\n|Name   = Honus Wagner\n|Number = 33\n|Team   = Pittsburgh Pirates\n|Year   = 1956\n|}}\n\nWhen the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] held its first election in 1936, Wagner tied for second in the voting with [[Babe Ruth]], trailing Cobb. A 1942 [[The Sporting News|''Sporting News'']] poll of 100 former players and managers confirmed this opinion, with Wagner finishing 43 votes behind Cobb and six ahead of Ruth. In 1969, on the 100th anniversary of professional baseball, a vote was taken to honor the greatest players ever, and Wagner was selected as the all-time shortstop. In 1999, 82 years after his last game and 44 years since his death, Wagner was voted Number 13 on ''The Sporting News''' list of the 100 Greatest Players, where he was again the highest-ranking shortstop. That same year, he was selected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] by the oversight committee, after losing out in the popular vote to [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] and [[Ernie Banks]].<ref name=century>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/legendary/limc100.shtml |title=All Century Team  |accessdate=2008-09-15 |work= |publisher=baseball-almanac.com |date= }}</ref>\n\n[[Christy Mathewson]] asserted that Wagner was the only player he faced that did not have a weakness. Mathewson felt the only way to keep Wagner from hitting was to not pitch to him.<ref>Mathewson, Christy. \"Pitching in a Pinch.\" Brunauer Press, 2008.</ref>\n\n\"A stirring march and two step\", titled \"Husky Hans\", and \"respectfully dedicated to Hans Wagner, Three time Champion Batsman of The National League\" was written by William J. Hartz in 1904.\n\n[[Bill James]] says that Wagner is easily the greatest shortstop of all time, noting that the difference between Wagner and the second greatest shortstop, in James' estimation [[Arky Vaughan]], is roughly the same as the gulf between Vaughan and the 20th greatest shortstop.\n\nWagner is mentioned in the poem ''[[Line-Up for Yesterday]]'' by [[Ogden Nash]].\n\n{{quote box |width= 18em |border= 4px |align= center|bgcolor= #FAF0E6 |qalign= center | title=''Line-Up for Yesterday''|quote=''W is for Wagner,''<br />''The bowlegged beauty;''<br />''Short was closed to all traffic''<br />''With Honus on duty.''\n|source=&nbsp;\u2014 ''[[Ogden Nash]]'', ''[[Sport (US magazine)|Sport]]'' magazine (January 1949)<ref name=nashpoem>{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml |title=Line-Up For Yesterday by Ogden Nash |accessdate=2008-09-16 |work=Ogden Nash |publisher=Sport Magazine |date= }}</ref> }}\n\n[[File:HONUS WAGNER LOCKER.JPG|thumb|right|Honus Wagner's locker on display at the Hall of Fame]]\nA life-size [[Honus Wagner (Vittor)|statue of Wagner]] swinging a bat, atop a marble pedestal featuring admiring children, was forged by a local sculptor named [[Frank Vittor]], and placed outside the left field corner gate at [[Forbes Field]]. It was dedicated on April 30, 1955, and the then-frail Wagner was well enough to attend and wave to his many fans. The Pirates have relocated twice since then, and the statue has come along with them. It now stands outside the main gate of [[PNC Park]]. The statue roughly faces the site of the Pirates' original home, [[Exposition Park (Pittsburgh)|Exposition Park]], so in a sense Wagner has come full circle.\n\nWagner is honored in the form of a small stadium residing behind Carnegie Elementary School on Washington Avenue in Carnegie, Pennsylvania. The stadium serves as the home field for Carlynton High School varsity sports. The Historical Society of Carnegie History Center houses the Honus Wagner Sports Museum which includes many Wagner collectibles and memorabilia. Visitors receive replicas of the famous card.\n\nIn the 1992 episode [[Homer at the Bat]], the popular TV show [[The Simpsons]] made a reference to Wagner. The character [[Mr. Burns]] lists three ringers he wants for his company's baseball team, but they are Honus Wagner, [[Cap Anson]], and \"[[Mordecai 'Three Fingers' Brown]]\". His assistant has to point out that they are not only retired, but long-dead ... Anson having played in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 2000, Wagner was honored with a [[United States Postal Service|U.S. postage stamp]]. The stamp was issued as part of a \"Legends of Baseball\" series that honored twenty all-time greats in conjunction with MLB's All Century team.\n\n===T206 Baseball card===\n{{Main|T206 Honus Wagner}}\n[[File:HonusWagnerCard.jpg|thumb|upright|left|150px|Honus Wagner card]]\nThe '''T206 Honus Wagner baseball card''' is one of the rarest and most expensive [[baseball card]]s in the world, as only 57 copies are known to exist.<ref>{{Cite book | last=James | first=Bill | authorlink=Bill James | title=[[The Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract|The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract]] | publisher=Simon & Schuster | location=New York | year=2001 | isbn=0-684-80697-5 | page=[https://archive.org/details/newbilljameshist00jame/page/358 358] }} James, one of baseball's premier historians and statisticians, ranked Wagner as the second-best player of all time, behind [[Babe Ruth]].

The [[Lebanese civil war]], which began in 1975, marks the most serious crisis the Grand Lyc\u00e9e ever faced. The buildings were badly damaged and due to their proximity to the [[Green Line (Lebanon)|Green Line]], access was difficult. From 1996 to 2003, the lyc\u00e9e undertook comprehensive renovations, where all the \"Ecochard\" buildings were rehabilitated and new structures were constructed. The [[stadium]] \"Stade du Chayla\" was inaugurated on 25 March 2005 and renovated in 2018.\n\nInitially located in the [[Sodeco]] neighborhood near the central Beirut district, it later moved to Beni Assaf Street, near the [[French embassy in Lebanon|French embassy]] and [[Saint Joseph University]] in the [[Badaro]] neighborhood. GLFL has ten buildings, five of which were conceived by the French planner [[Michel Ecochard]], and also added a new athletic [[stadium]] on Damascus street: \"Le stade de Chayla\".\n\n== Organisation ==\nBrice L\u00e9thier is the headmaster of the Grand Lyc\u00e9e since August 2016. The school offers classes to more than 3,600 students.

The [[Lebanese civil war]], which began in 1975, marks the most serious crisis the Grand Lyc\u00e9e ever faced. The buildings were badly damaged and due to their proximity to the [[Green Line (Lebanon)|Green Line]], access was difficult. From 1996 to 2003, the lyc\u00e9e undertook comprehensive renovations, where all the \"Ecochard\" buildings were rehabilitated and new structures were constructed. The [[stadium]] \"Stade du Chayla\" was inaugurated on 25 March 2005 and renovated in 2018.\n\nInitially located in the [[Sodeco]] neighborhood near the central Beirut district, it later moved to Beni Assaf Street, near the [[French embassy in Lebanon|French embassy]] and [[Saint Joseph University]] in the [[Badaro]] neighborhood. GLFL has ten buildings, five of which were conceived by the French planner [[Michel Ecochard]], and also added a new athletic [[stadium]] on Damascus street: \"Le stade de Chayla\".\n\n== Organisation ==\nBrice L\u00e9thier is the headmaster of the Grand Lyc\u00e9e since August 2016. The school offers classes to more than 3,600 students. It remains the flagship institution of the Mission La\u00efque Fran\u00e7aise organisation and leads its eight established schools in Lebanon.\n\nSchool departments include 3 libraries in which students can find a network of computers intended for educational resources, as well as 27,000 books and literary archives including newspapers, novels, and magazines. A secondary library known as the BCD is also available to younger students. \n\nAcross the street, the brand new Stade du Chayla comprises a track-and-field playground, along with tennis, badminton, basketball and mini-soccer courts. The building includes table tennis and squash halls as well as an indoor swimming pool.\n\n== Notable alumni ==\n* [[Marwan Hamadeh]], Minister of Telecommunications, Economy, Trade and Health\n* [[Gebran Tueni]], [[Editor-in-chief]] of [[An-Nahar]] and Member of Parliament\n* [[Fares Soueid]], General Secretary of the [[March 14 Coalition]] and Member of Parliament\n* [[Samir Kassir]], Journalist\n* [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]], author of ''[[The Black Swan (Taleb book)|The Black Swan]]''\n\n==See also==\n* [[Education in the Ottoman Empire]]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.glfl.edu.lb/ Grand Lyc\u00e9e] Official website (French)\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081013091259/http://www.racinesglfl.com/ Official alumni community]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\nFrench:\n* Jean-Pierre BEL ''Le Grand Lyc\u00e9e franco-libanais, 100 ans au service de la MLF et du Liban''.

The [[plateau]] remained a mostly rural area until suburban homes, shopping centers, and schools were built in the 1970s and 1980s. A vote in 1991 to join neighboring [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]] failed, as did a vote on incorporation the following year. A renewed movement to become a city, born of frustration with development policies set by the county government, met with voter approval in 1998.

The first settlers arrived in the late 19th century and established a trio of resorts by the 1930s. The [[plateau]] remained a mostly rural area until suburban homes, shopping centers, and schools were built in the 1970s and 1980s. A vote in 1991 to join neighboring [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]] failed, as did a vote on incorporation the following year. A renewed movement to become a city, born of frustration with development policies set by the county government, met with voter approval in 1998.

It was developed under contract to [[Edgewood Arsenal experiments|Edgewood Arsenal]] during the 1960s as part of the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons|US military chemical weapons program]], during research to improve upon the properties of earlier agents such as QNB. \n\nThe main advantages of EA-3443 were not only increased potency over QNB, but also a significantly improved central to peripheral effects ratio. Anticholinergic drugs produce both incapacitating deliriant effects through action in the brain, and a variety of distinctive physical symptoms such as dry mouth, dilated pupils, blurred vision and hot flushed skin, all of which together comprise the \"anticholinergic syndrome\" which is generally easy for doctors to diagnose. EA-3443 however is mainly selective for the brain, and when administered in a narrow dose range of around 0.3mg can produce the central effects of confusion, hallucinations and amnesia, but without producing significant physical symptoms, which was predicted to make poisoning with EA-3443 much more difficult to diagnose and treat. However despite these advantages, EA-3443 was never researched to the same extent as QNB or manufactured in bulk, and research into EA-3443 was discontinued along with the rest of the US chemical weapons program in the mid-1970s.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=740&page=189 Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents, Volume 1 (1982).

It was developed under contract to [[Edgewood Arsenal experiments|Edgewood Arsenal]] during the 1960s as part of the [[United States and weapons of mass destruction#Chemical weapons|US military chemical weapons program]], during research to improve upon the properties of earlier agents such as QNB. \n\nThe main advantages of EA-3443 were not only increased potency over QNB, but also a significantly improved central to peripheral effects ratio. Anticholinergic drugs produce both incapacitating deliriant effects through action in the brain, and a variety of distinctive physical symptoms such as dry mouth, dilated pupils, blurred vision and hot flushed skin, all of which together comprise the \"anticholinergic syndrome\" which is generally easy for doctors to diagnose. EA-3443 however is mainly selective for the brain, and when administered in a narrow dose range of around 0.3mg can produce the central effects of confusion, hallucinations and amnesia, but without producing significant physical symptoms, which was predicted to make poisoning with EA-3443 much more difficult to diagnose and treat. However despite these advantages, EA-3443 was never researched to the same extent as QNB or manufactured in bulk, and research into EA-3443 was discontinued along with the rest of the US chemical weapons program in the mid-1970s.<ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=740&page=189 Possible Long-Term Health Effects of Short-Term Exposure to Chemical Agents, Volume 1 (1982).
