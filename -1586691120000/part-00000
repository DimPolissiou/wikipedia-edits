Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the [[Dauphin of France]], Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes.

Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony.

He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession.

Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment. However, Robespierre is recognisable in [[Fran\u00e7ois-L\u00e9on Sicard]]\u2019s marble Altar of the [[National Convention]] (1913), originally intended for the gardens of the Tuileries and now in the [[Panth\u00e9on]]. \n* A stone bust by Albert S\u00e9raphin (1949) stands in the square Robespierre, opposite the theatre in [[Saint-Denis, Seine-Saint-Denis|Saint-Denis]], with the inscription: \u201cMaximilien Robespierre l'Incorruptible 1758-1794\u201d.<ref>See Ren\u00e9 & Peter van der Krogt, ''Statues \u2013 Hither & Thither'' for photographs: https://statues.vanderkrogt.net/object.php?webpage=ST&record=frif030</ref>\n* Charles Correia\u2019s 1980s bronze sculptural group at the Coll\u00e8ge Robespierre in [[\u00c9pinay-sur-Seine]] depicts him and [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just]] at a table, working on the 1793 Constitution and Declaration of Human Rights.<ref>See ''Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine''for photographs by Agn\u00e8s Paty: https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028036</ref>  A mural in the school also depicts him.<ref>See D\u00e9partement Seine-Saint-D\u00e9nis ''Atlas de l\u2019architecture et du patrimoine'': https://patrimoine.seinesaintdenis.fr/spip.php?page=document&id_document=1028019</ref>\n* In 1986, [[Claude-Andr\u00e9 Deseine]]\u2019s terracotta bust of 1791 was bought for the new [[Mus\u00e9e de la R\u00e9volution fran\u00e7aise]] at [[Vizille]].

This compulsion hardly belongs to the man who enunciates them; it belongs to universal reason and to all men who wish to listen to its voice. It belongs to my colleagues of the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|Constituent Assembly]], to the patriots of the Legislative Assembly, to all citizens who will invariably defend the cause of liberty. Experience has proven, despite Louis XVI and his allies, that the opinion of the Jacobins and the popular clubs were those of the French Nation; no citizen has made them, and I did nothing other than share in them.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=83\u201384|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}} }}\n\nTurning the accusations upon his accusers, Robespierre delivered one of the most famous lines of the French Revolution to the Assembly:\n\n{{quote|I will not remind you that the sole object of contention dividing us is that you have instinctively defended all acts of new ministers, and we, of principles; that you seemed to prefer power, and we equality...

Most Montagnards favoured judgment and execution, while the Girondins were more divided concerning how to proceed, with some arguing for royal inviolability, others for clemency, and others advocating lesser punishment or banishment.{{sfn|Kennedy|1988|pp=308\u201310}} On 13 November Robespierre stated in the Convention that a Constitution which Louis had violated himself, and which declared his inviolability, could not now be used in his defence.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|loc= in Tome IX, Discours|pp=104\u201305, [https://fr.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Page:\u0152uvres_compl\u00e8tes_de_Maximilien_de_Robespierre,_tome_9.djvu/122 120].}} Robespierre had been taken ill and had done little other than support [[Louis Antoine de Saint-Just|Saint-Just]], a former colonel in the National Guard, who gave his first major speech to address and argue against the king's inviolability.

Robespierre argued that the dethroned king could now function only as a threat to liberty and national peace and that the members of the Assembly were not to be impartial judges but rather statesmen with responsibility for ensuring public safety:\n\n{{quote|Louis was a king, and our republic is established; the critical question concerning you must be decided by these words alone. Louis was dethroned by his crimes; Louis denounced the French people as rebels; he appealed to chains, to the armies of tyrants who are his brothers; the victory of the people established that Louis alone was a rebel; Louis cannot, therefore, be judged; he already is judged. He is condemned, or the republic cannot be absolved. To propose to have a trial of Louis XVI, in whatever manner one may, is to retrogress to royal despotism and constitutionality; it is a counter-revolutionary idea because it places the revolution itself in litigation. In effect, if Louis may still be given a trial, he may be absolved, and innocent. What am I to say? He is presumed to be so until he is judged. But if Louis is absolved, if he may be presumed innocent, what becomes of the revolution? If Louis is innocent, all the defenders of liberty become slanderers. <!--Our enemies have been friends of the people and of truth and defenders of innocence oppressed; all the declarations of foreign courts are nothing more than the legitimate claims against an illegal faction. Even the detention that Louis has endured is, then, an unjust vexation; the f\u00e9d\u00e9r\u00e9s, the people of Paris, all the patriots of the French Empire are guilty; and this great trial in the court of nature judging between crime and virtue, liberty and tyranny, is at last decided in favour of crime and tyranny. Citizens, take warning; you are being fooled by false notions; you confuse positive, civil rights with the principles of the rights of mankind; you confuse the relationships of citizens amongst themselves with the connections between nations and an enemy that conspires against it; you confuse the situation of a people in revolution with that of a people whose government is affirmed; you confuse a nation that punishes a public functionary to conserve its form of government, and one that destroys the government itself. We are falling back upon ideas familiar to us, in an extraordinary case that depends upon principles we have never yet applied.-->{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=121\u201322|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nIn arguing for a judgment by the elected Convention without trial, Robespierre supported the recommendations of [[Jean-Baptiste Mailhe]], who headed the commission reporting on legal aspects of Louis's trial or judgment. Unlike some Girondins, Robespierre specifically opposed judgment by primary assemblies or a referendum, believing that this could cause a civil war.{{sfn|Soboul|2005|p=867|loc= in \"Proc\u00e8s du Roi\" by Dorigny, M}} While he called for a trial of Queen Marie-Antoinette and the imprisonment of the Dauphin, Robespierre advocated that the king be executed despite his opposition to capital punishment:\n\n{{quote|<!--As for myself, I abhor the death penalty administered by your laws, and for Louis I have neither love, nor hate; I hate only his crimes. I have demanded the abolition of the death penalty at your Constituent Assembly, and am not to blame if the first principles of reason appeared to you moral and political heresies. But if you will never reclaim these principles in favour of so much evil, the crimes of which belong less to you and more to the government, by what fatal error would you remember yourselves and plead for the greatest of criminals? You ask an exception to the death penalty for him alone who could legitimise it? -->Yes, the death penalty is, in general, crime, unjustifiable by the indestructible principles of nature, except in cases protecting the safety of individuals or the society altogether. Ordinary misdemeanours have never threatened public safety because society may always protect itself by other means, making those culpable powerless to harm it. But for a king dethroned in the bosom of a revolution, which is as yet cemented only by laws; a king whose name attracts the scourge of war upon a troubled nation; neither prison nor exile can render his existence inconsequential to public happiness; this cruel exception to the ordinary laws avowed by justice can be imputed only to the nature of his crimes. With regret, I pronounce this fatal truth: Louis must die so that the nation may live.{{sfn|Robespierre|1958|pp=129\u201330|loc= in Tome IX, Discours}}}}\n\nOn 4 December the Convention decreed all the royalist writings illegal.<ref>William J.

Accordingly, on 7 May, Robespierre delivered a long presentation to the Convention \u2018on the relation of religious and moral ideas to republican principles, and on national festivals\u2019.<ref name=\"auto11\"/> Robespierre supported a decree that the Convention passed to establish an official state religion called the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]]. The notion of the Supreme Being was based on the creed of the Savoy chaplain that Jean-Jacques Rousseau had outlined in Book IV of ''[[Emile, or On Education|Emile]]''.\n\nIn the afternoon of 8 June (also the Christian holiday of [[Pentecost]]) a \"Festival of the Supreme Being\" was held. Everything was arranged to the exact specifications that had been drawn up previously set before the ceremony. The ominous and symbolic guillotine had been moved to the original standing place of the [[Bastille]]. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers with their babies were specifically invited to walk in the procession which started at the [[Tuileries]].{{sfn | Moore | 2007 | p=291}} ([[Joachim Vilate]] had invited Robespierre to have lunch in the Pavillon de Flore, but he ate little.)\n\nThe festival was also Robespierre's first appearance in the public eye as a leader for the people, and also as president of the Convention, to which he had been elected only four days earlier.{{sfn|Andress|2006|p=308}} Witnesses state that throughout the \"Festival of the Supreme Being\", Robespierre beamed with joy. He was able to speak of the things about which he was truly passionate, including virtue, nature, deist beliefs and his disagreements with atheism. He dressed elaborately, wearing feathers on his hat and holding fruit and flowers in his hands, and walked first in the festival procession. According to Michelet: \"Robespierre, as usual, walked quickly, with an agitated air. The Convention did not move nearly so fast. The leaders, perhaps maliciously and out of perfidious deference, remained well behind him, thereby isolating him.\"<ref>Michelet, J.

Robespierre delivered two speeches in which he emphasized his concept of a Supreme Being:\n\n<blockquote>Is it not He whose immortal hand, engraving on the heart of man the code of justice and equality, has written there the death sentence of tyrants? Is it not He who, from the beginning of time, decreed for all the ages and for all peoples liberty, good faith, and justice? He did not create kings to devour the human race. He did not create priests to harness us, like vile animals, to the chariots of kings and to give to the world examples of baseness, pride, perfidy, avarice, debauchery and falsehood. He created the universe to proclaim His power. He created men to help each other, to love each other mutually, and to attain to happiness by the way of virtue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/mod/robespierre-supreme.asp|title=Robespierre, M. \"The Cult of the Supreme Being\", in Modern History Sourcebook, 1997|website=sourcebooks.fordham.edu}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nRobespierre came down the mountain in a way that resembled [[Moses]] as the leader of the people.

His goal in the Terror was to use the guillotine to create what he called a \"republic of virtue\", wherein virtue would be combined with terror.<ref name=\"chnm.gmu.edu\"/> <blockquote>Robespierre's main ideal was to ensure the virtue and sovereignty of the people. He disapproved of any acts which could be seen as exposing the nation to counter-revolutionaries and traitors and became increasingly fearful of the defeat of the Revolution. He instigated the Terror and the deaths of his peers as a measure of ensuring the Republic of Virtue but his ideals went beyond the needs and wants of the people of France. He became a threat to what he had wanted to ensure and the result was his downfall.{{sfn|Scurr|2006}}</blockquote>\n\nSoboul argues that Robespierre and Saint-Just \"were too preoccupied in defeating the interest of the bourgeoisie to give their total support to the sans-culottes, and yet too attentive to the needs of the sans-culottes to get support from the middle class.\"{{sfn|Ishay|1995|p=65}} According to [[R.R.

At the liberation, the municipal council (elected on 29 April 1945 with 27 communists, 12 socialists and 4 radicals out of 48 members), decided on 13 April 1946, to rename the Place du March\u00e9-Saint-Honor\u00e9  \u2018Place Robespierre\u2019, a decision approved at prefectorial level on 8 June. However in the wake of political changes in 1947, it reverted to its original name on 6 November 1950. Streets in the so-called \u2018Red belt\u2019 bear his name, e.g. at [[Montreuil, Seine-Saint-Denis|Montreuil]]. There is also a [[Robespierre (Paris M\u00e9tro)|Metro station \u2018Robespierre\u2019]] on Line 9 (Mairie de Montreuil - Pont de S\u00e8vres), in the commune of Montreuil, named during the era of the [[Popular Front (France)|\nPopular Front]].\nThere are, however, numerous streets, roads and squares named for him elsewhere in France.<ref>See https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximilien_de_Robespierre#Voies_publiques</ref>\n\n==== Plaques and monuments ====\n===== Arras =====\n\n* On 14 Octobre 1923, a plaque was placed on the house at 9 Rue Maximilien Robespierre (formerly Rue des Rapporteurs) rented by the three Robespierre siblings in 1787-1789, in the presence of the mayor Gustave Lemelle, Albert Mathiez and Louis Jacob, president of the [[Rosati]]. Built in 1730, the house has had a varied history as a typing school, and a craftsmen\u2019s museum, but is now being developed as a Robespierre Museum.  \n* In 1994, a plaque was unveiled by ARBR on the fa\u00e7ade of the Carrauts\u2019 brewery on the Rue Ronville, where Maximilien and Augustin were brought up by their grandparents.\n* An [[Art Deco]] marble bust by Maurice Cladel was intended to be displayed in the gardens of the former [[Abbey of Saint-Vaast]]. A mixture of politics and concerns about weathering led to it being placed in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Arras|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. After many years in a tribunal room, it can now be seen in the Salle Robespierre. Bronze casts of the bust were made for the bicentenary and are displayed in his former home on Rue Maximilien Robespierre and at the Lyc\u00e9e Robespierre, unveiled in 1990.\n\n===== Paris and elsewhere =====\n* Robespierre is commemorated by two plaques in Paris, one on the exterior of the Duplays\u2019 house, now 398 [[rue Saint-Honor\u00e9]], the other, erected by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des \u00e9tudes robespierristes in the [[Conciergerie]].\n* In 1909, a committee presided over by [[Ren\u00e9 Viviani]] and [[Georges Clemenceau]] proposed erecting a statue in the garden of the [[Tuileries]], but press hostility and failure to garner enough public subscriptions led to its abandonment.

The story follows a young boxer named Joe Yabuki, who lives in the [[Tokyo]] slums. \n\n''Ashita no Joe'' was first serialized by [[Kodansha]] in ''[[Weekly Shonen Magazine]]'' from January 1st, 1968 to May 13th, 1973 and was later collected into 20 [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes.  During its serialization, it was popular with [[working-class]] people and college students who were involved in the [[New Left]] in Japan. It has been adapted into various media, including ''[[Megalo Box]]'', an anime that was made as a part of the 50th anniversary of ''Ashita no Joe''.\n\nThe manga has been considered to be one of the most influental manga, with many anime and manga referencing it.\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Ashita no Joe characters}}\n\nJoe Yabuki is 15-year-old drifter who meets Danpei Tange, a former boxing trainer while wandering through Doya, a fictional slum near Tokyo. Several months later, Joe is arrested for fraud and is thrown into a temporary jail where he fights Nishi Kanichi, the leader of a group of hooligans.  He and Nishi then go to the {{nihongo|T\u014dk\u014d High-Security Juvenile Prison|\u6771\u5149\u7279\u7b49\u5c11\u5e74\u9662|T\u014dk\u014d Tokut\u014d Sh\u014dnen'in}}, a [[juvenile detention center]] miles away from Tokyo. There Joe meets T\u014dru Rikiishi, a former boxing prodigy, and a rivalry develops between them. They attempt to resolve the rivalry by facing each other in a boxing match in which T\u014dru dominates Joe until the latter hits him with a [[cross-counter]], resulting in both being knocked out. Feeling that the outcome did not resolve anything, Joe and T\u014dru vow to fight again. As T\u014dru learns he is meant to leave the prison, he challenges Joe to a fight in the future, and the two promise to meet again, this time as professional boxers. \n\nUpon his release from prison, Joe initially has trouble gaining a boxing license due to his lack of formal education but succeeds in his second attempt with the help of Danpei and Nishi. Joe manages to go up to [[Bantamweight]], after provoking a champion boxer named Wolf Kanagushi. Joe quickly rises in the ranks and gains popularity for his brawling style, and trademark cross-counter KO wins. Joe manages to perform a triple-cross counter on Wolf. Joe then earns the right to fight T\u014dru in the professional ring.\n\nAlthough T\u014dru is assured a promising career, he is intent in settling his score with Joe, whom he feels stands in his path. Because T\u014dru is three weight classes above Joe, he has to cut down a massive amount of weight and undergoes an incredibly taxing weight loss program which includes severe dehydration. T\u014dru defeats Joe in the 8th round, but collapses as he is about to shake Joe's hand due to an extremely hard blow to the temple two rounds before and his landing his head on the ropes. He dies from the combined effects of the extreme weight loss on his body and brain hemorrhage that he sustained during the fight.\n\nJoe is still shaken up from that match, both mentally and physically. Soon after, during matches, his trainer Danpei realizes that Joe is having a serious problem with boxing: he is unable to give headshots to his opponents, T\u014dru's accidental death having traumatized him. It takes Joe quite some time to get over it and costs him three straight losses. But then he finally conquers his fears when he faces the globally #6 ranked Carlos Rivera. The fight ends with a draw, yet it gives Joe tremendous fame and respect around the world, especially since Carlos was going to face the World Champion Jos\u00e9 Mendoza in his next match.\n\nJoe starts to climb up the boxing ladder, but struggles with maintaining bantamweight due to a late growth spurt, forcing him to undergo strenuous training similar to what Rikiishi had to. He defeats the Asian\u2013Pacific Champion, Kim Yong-bi, a [[South Korea]]n boxer and survivor of the Korean War, dedicating the win to T\u014dru. After winning the title match, Joe defends his title. He wins all defenses, ultimately defending it against the [[Malaysia]]n fighter Harimau. He is now given the chance to face the World Champion Jos\u00e9 Mendoza, who defeated Carlos Rivera with a KO punch in the first round, ending his boxing career. It is later revealed that Carlos had developed permanent brain damage from his fight.\n\nThe fight is held in a packed stadium, and is attended by many of Joe's friends and former rivals, including Wolf and the now sickly and haggard Carlos. Joe faces Mendoza, even though he is at a disadvantage since it was revealed he was [[Dementia pugilistica|punch-drunk]], and has lost vision in one eye. The match is a brutal back-and-forth with Joe able to knock down the Champion more than once. Though originally composed, Jos\u00e9 starts losing his mind as Joe keeps getting up no matter how much damage he takes, to the point that he wonders if he's trapped in a nightmare. The match goes all of its fifteen rounds, with Mendoza barely gaining a win by points, but much to the shock of the audience, Jos\u00e9 has seemingly aged decades in minutes from the toll the fight has taken on his body, with [[Marie Antoinette syndrome|his hair turned snow white from the trauma he has experienced]]. Danpei turns to console Joe only to find him unresponsive, but with a smile on his face. It has been debated among fans whether Joe died or not and Chiba even said that he drew the ending scene at the last minute.<ref>http://www.manga-audition.com/tetsuya-chiba-interview/</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n''Ashita no Joe'' originally serialized in Japan in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from January 1st, 1968 to May 13th, 1973.

The story follows a young boxer named Joe Yabuki, who lives in the [[Tokyo]] slums. \n\n''Ashita no Joe'' was first serialized by [[Kodansha]] in ''[[Weekly Shonen Magazine]]'' from January 1st, 1968 to May 13th, 1973 and was later collected into 20 [[tank\u014dbon]] volumes.  During its serialization, it was popular with [[working-class]] people and college students who were involved in the [[New Left]] in Japan. It has been adapted into various media, including ''[[Megalo Box]]'', an anime that was made as a part of the 50th anniversary of ''Ashita no Joe''.\n\nThe manga has been considered to be one of the most influental manga, with many anime and manga referencing it.\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Ashita no Joe characters}}\n\nJoe Yabuki is 15-year-old drifter who meets Danpei Tange, a former boxing trainer while wandering through Doya, a fictional slum near Tokyo. Several months later, Joe is arrested for fraud and is thrown into a temporary jail where he fights Nishi Kanichi, the leader of a group of hooligans.  He and Nishi then go to the {{nihongo|T\u014dk\u014d High-Security Juvenile Prison|\u6771\u5149\u7279\u7b49\u5c11\u5e74\u9662|T\u014dk\u014d Tokut\u014d Sh\u014dnen'in}}, a [[juvenile detention center]] miles away from Tokyo. There Joe meets T\u014dru Rikiishi, a former boxing prodigy, and a rivalry develops between them. They attempt to resolve the rivalry by facing each other in a boxing match in which T\u014dru dominates Joe until the latter hits him with a [[cross-counter]], resulting in both being knocked out. Feeling that the outcome did not resolve anything, Joe and T\u014dru vow to fight again. As T\u014dru learns he is meant to leave the prison, he challenges Joe to a fight in the future, and the two promise to meet again, this time as professional boxers. \n\nUpon his release from prison, Joe initially has trouble gaining a boxing license due to his lack of formal education but succeeds in his second attempt with the help of Danpei and Nishi. Joe manages to go up to [[Bantamweight]], after provoking a champion boxer named Wolf Kanagushi. Joe quickly rises in the ranks and gains popularity for his brawling style, and trademark cross-counter KO wins. Joe manages to perform a triple-cross counter on Wolf. Joe then earns the right to fight T\u014dru in the professional ring.\n\nAlthough T\u014dru is assured a promising career, he is intent in settling his score with Joe, whom he feels stands in his path. Because T\u014dru is three weight classes above Joe, he has to cut down a massive amount of weight and undergoes an incredibly taxing weight loss program which includes severe dehydration. T\u014dru defeats Joe in the 8th round, but collapses as he is about to shake Joe's hand due to an extremely hard blow to the temple two rounds before and his landing his head on the ropes. He dies from the combined effects of the extreme weight loss on his body and brain hemorrhage that he sustained during the fight.\n\nJoe is still shaken up from that match, both mentally and physically. Soon after, during matches, his trainer Danpei realizes that Joe is having a serious problem with boxing: he is unable to give headshots to his opponents, T\u014dru's accidental death having traumatized him. It takes Joe quite some time to get over it and costs him three straight losses. But then he finally conquers his fears when he faces the globally #6 ranked Carlos Rivera. The fight ends with a draw, yet it gives Joe tremendous fame and respect around the world, especially since Carlos was going to face the World Champion Jos\u00e9 Mendoza in his next match.\n\nJoe starts to climb up the boxing ladder, but struggles with maintaining bantamweight due to a late growth spurt, forcing him to undergo strenuous training similar to what Rikiishi had to. He defeats the Asian\u2013Pacific Champion, Kim Yong-bi, a [[South Korea]]n boxer and survivor of the Korean War, dedicating the win to T\u014dru. After winning the title match, Joe defends his title. He wins all defenses, ultimately defending it against the [[Malaysia]]n fighter Harimau. He is now given the chance to face the World Champion Jos\u00e9 Mendoza, who defeated Carlos Rivera with a KO punch in the first round, ending his boxing career. It is later revealed that Carlos had developed permanent brain damage from his fight.\n\nThe fight is held in a packed stadium, and is attended by many of Joe's friends and former rivals, including Wolf and the now sickly and haggard Carlos. Joe faces Mendoza, even though he is at a disadvantage since it was revealed he was [[Dementia pugilistica|punch-drunk]], and has lost vision in one eye. The match is a brutal back-and-forth with Joe able to knock down the Champion more than once. Though originally composed, Jos\u00e9 starts losing his mind as Joe keeps getting up no matter how much damage he takes, to the point that he wonders if he's trapped in a nightmare. The match goes all of its fifteen rounds, with Mendoza barely gaining a win by points, but much to the shock of the audience, Jos\u00e9 has seemingly aged decades in minutes from the toll the fight has taken on his body, with [[Marie Antoinette syndrome|his hair turned snow white from the trauma he has experienced]]. Danpei turns to console Joe only to find him unresponsive, but with a smile on his face. It has been debated among fans whether Joe died or not and Chiba even said that he drew the ending scene at the last minute.<ref>http://www.manga-audition.com/tetsuya-chiba-interview/</ref>\n\n==Publication history==\n''Ashita no Joe'' originally serialized in Japan in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from January 1st, 1968 to May 13th, 1973.

The UK arm of [[Poale Zion]], a Jewish workers movement, called ''Poale Zion (Great Britain)'', later the [[Jewish Labour Movement]], affiliated to the Labour Party in 1920.{{efn|There was a division of labour between Poale Zion and [[Chaim Weizmann]], the leader of the general Zionist movement, who lobbied in Britain for support for a Jewish state on the grounds that the latter would conform to the liberal capitalist model that would serve the interests of the British Empire: 'The British, he wrote in 1924, \"have come to realize that they have very little to lean on for protection of the jugular vein of the British Empire, except a Palestine peacefully developed and economically and politically stable. They begin to realize that such a Palestine can only be brought into effect if Jewish enterprise is allowed free course in that country\".'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=3}}}} Many prominent Labour leaders had an affinity with the goals of [[Labour Zionism]], but were initially reluctant to press for parliamentary support for relieving obstacles to Jewish immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], given the party's commitment to an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialistic policy]]. In 1920, they gave unqualified support to both the [[Balfour Declaration]] and the British [[Mandate for Palestine]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|pp=26\u201328}} The basic principles that evolved stressed (a) gradual growth of a Jewish homeland through selective immigration; (b) the formation of a [[One-state solution|binational society]] and (c) criticism of Zionism's [[Separatism|separatist agenda]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|p=89}}\n\n===Support for Israel===\nGenerally, Labour support for Israel continued, in the expectancy that the Labour Zionist strand in Jewish state-building would lead to socialism and development in the Middle East generally. [[Ernest Bevin]], Britain's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1945 to 1951, was critical of Zionist goals; he argued that Jews should be convinced to resettle in Europe, and said that Americans supported Jewish immigration to Palestine because \"they did not want too many Jews in New York\". Bevin also voiced antisemitic canards between Jews and finance, as well as communism. There is no evidence that this affected his political decisions.{{sfn|Weiler|2016|pp=75,170ff}}{{efn|British officials of the Mandatory administration dealing with the conflicting demands of the Arab and Jewish communities were conscious of the potential international reverberation of their decisions particularly in the US and in Muslim countries. They were inclined to see the Zionists as more troublesome, endlessly petitioning with new demands and calling the administration to account on the basis of the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration. If the Zionist movement's demand in Palestine was turned down at the first port of call its representatives were likely to raise the matter at a higher level, if necessary all the way up the chain of command to ministers in London. With antisemitism endemic among colonial officials, as among all sections of British society, they often expressed their resentment at attempts to outmanoeuvre them in racist terms. Yet, if this was an overtly hostile form of racism by comparison with the apparently more benign, paternalistic and version directed at the Arabs, British rule nonetheless maintained the political and economic framework that favoured Jewish nation-building at the expense of Arab interests.'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=5}}}}\n\n===Growing sympathy for Palestine===\n[[Aberystwyth University]]'s James R. Vaughn says the rise of a radical [[anti-Zionism]] in the Labour Party started with the creation of the Labour Middle East Council in 1969 by [[Christopher Mayhew]].{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|pp=1\u201325}}{{efn|Both Bevin and Mayhew (the latter later defected to the Liberal Party), had been subject to death threats by the [[Stern Gang]] in the 1940s.{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|p=4}}}} [[Dave Rich]] concurs that Mayhew founded the council in order to change the \"pro-Israel\" position of the Labour Party{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=26}} and references the influence of pro-Palestinian activists within the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]].{{sfn|Rich|2018|p=98}}\n\nBy the 1980s, with the election of [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party, the emergence of [[Religious nationalism|messianic nationalism]], [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economic reforms]], the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupation of the West Bank]] and of the [[Gaza Strip]], and the decline of the [[Israeli Labor Party]], socialism declined in Israel. These factors contributed to falling Labour support for Israel, at the same time as there was growing sympathy for Palestinian aspirations for statehood.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=2}} According to June Edmunds, Lecturer in Sociology of the [[University of Sussex]], the party's leadership was initially supportive of Israel but shifted to support Palestine in the early 1980s, although the membership did not; later challenges to this shift eventually resulted in a more balanced view of both sides and broad support for a [[two-state solution]].<ref name=EdmundsJune>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/11/1/23/1647783|title=The Evolution of British Labour Party Policy on Israel from 1967 to the Intifada|first=June|last=Edmunds|date=1 January 2000|journal=Twentieth Century British History|volume=11|issue=1|pages=23\u201341|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/tcbh/11.1.23}}</ref> Edmunds credits the shift towards Palestine aspirations to more moderate appeals by Palestinians, a sharp shift to the right in Israeli politics and an increase in anti-colonial politics among the left.<ref name=EdmundsJune />\n\n[[Richard Seymour (writer)|Richard Seymour]] wrote in 2018 that \"Palestinian rights have been a growing concern in the British Left since the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]]\"{{sfn|Seymour|2018b}} when \"the British trade union movement and the Labour Party began to break with Israel in response\".{{sfn|Seymour|2018a}} The Labour Committee on Palestine was formed in June 1982 to challenge the Labour Middle East Council, which supported a two-state solution, and to oppose the \"Zionist state as racist, exclusivist, expansionist and a direct agency of imperialism\". Labour politicians [[Ken Livingstone]] of the [[Greater London Council]] and [[Ted Knight (politician)|Ted Knight]] of the [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] were early supporters; the chair was former British Anti-Zionist Organization (BAZO) activist Tony Greenstein.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=143}} The new Committee backed a resolution at the 1982 [[Labour Party Conference (UK)|Labour Party Conference]] to recognise the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\", which passed at the Conference, \"embarrassing\" the Party leadership.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=144}}\n\nAntisemitic attitudes are said to have been rare in the Labour Party in the 1980s.{{sfn|Rich|2018}}{{sfn|Hirsh|2017}} In his 2012 book, ''The British Left and Zionism: History of a Divorce'', [[Manchester University]]'s Paul Kelemen ascribed the shift in Labour's views to Israel's increasingly right-leaning politics and to the left's opposition to the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza]]. He found no evidence that antisemitism played a role in the left's changing perceptions of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in that period.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=185}}{{sfn|Kolpinskaya|2014|p=450}} Daniel L. Staetsky, a senior research fellow for the [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]], stated in his 2017 study ''Antisemitism in Contemporary Great Britain: A Study of Attitudes Towards Jews and Israel'' that, in the 1980s, parts of the political left assumed strong pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel positions, and faced accusations of antisemitism within the Labour Party.{{sfn|Staetsky|2017|p=42}} He found that anti-Israeli positions did not correlate generally with antisemitism, since the majority of those surveyed who were critical of Israel did not espouse an antisemitic attitude<ref>{{harvnb|Staetsky|2017|p=66}} \"We have discovered that anti-Israel attitudes are not, as a general rule, antisemitic. This is to say that a significant proportion of those who hold anti-Israel attitudes, a majority in fact, do not espouse any antisemitic attitudes\"</ref> and that antisemitism on the left was no higher than that of the general population.<ref>{{harvnb|Staetsky|2017|p=6}} 'Levels of antisemitism among those on the left-wing of the political spectrum, including the far-left, are indistinguishable from those found in the general population. Yet, all parts of those on the left of the political spectrum \u2013 including the 'slightly left-of-centre,' the 'fairly left-wing' and the 'very left-wing' \u2013 exhibit higher levels of anti-Israelism than average. The most antisemitic group on the political spectrum consists of those who identify as very right-wing: the presence of antisemitic attitudes in this group is two to four times higher compared to the general population.

The UK arm of [[Poale Zion]], a Jewish workers movement, called ''Poale Zion (Great Britain)'', later the [[Jewish Labour Movement]], affiliated to the Labour Party in 1920.{{efn|There was a division of labour between Poale Zion and [[Chaim Weizmann]], the leader of the general Zionist movement, who lobbied in Britain for support for a Jewish state on the grounds that the latter would conform to the liberal capitalist model that would serve the interests of the British Empire: 'The British, he wrote in 1924, \"have come to realize that they have very little to lean on for protection of the jugular vein of the British Empire, except a Palestine peacefully developed and economically and politically stable. They begin to realize that such a Palestine can only be brought into effect if Jewish enterprise is allowed free course in that country\".'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=3}}}} Many prominent Labour leaders had an affinity with the goals of [[Labour Zionism]], but were initially reluctant to press for parliamentary support for relieving obstacles to Jewish immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], given the party's commitment to an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialistic policy]]. In 1920, they gave unqualified support to both the [[Balfour Declaration]] and the British [[Mandate for Palestine]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|pp=26\u201328}} The basic principles that evolved stressed (a) gradual growth of a Jewish homeland through selective immigration; (b) the formation of a [[One-state solution|binational society]] and (c) criticism of Zionism's [[Separatism|separatist agenda]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|p=89}}\n\n===Support for Israel===\nGenerally, Labour support for Israel continued, in the expectancy that the Labour Zionist strand in Jewish state-building would lead to socialism and development in the Middle East generally. [[Ernest Bevin]], Britain's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1945 to 1951, was critical of Zionist goals; he argued that Jews should be convinced to resettle in Europe, and said that Americans supported Jewish immigration to Palestine because \"they did not want too many Jews in New York\". Bevin also voiced antisemitic canards between Jews and finance, as well as communism. There is no evidence that this affected his political decisions.{{sfn|Weiler|2016|pp=75,170ff}}{{efn|British officials of the Mandatory administration dealing with the conflicting demands of the Arab and Jewish communities were conscious of the potential international reverberation of their decisions particularly in the US and in Muslim countries. They were inclined to see the Zionists as more troublesome, endlessly petitioning with new demands and calling the administration to account on the basis of the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration. If the Zionist movement's demand in Palestine was turned down at the first port of call its representatives were likely to raise the matter at a higher level, if necessary all the way up the chain of command to ministers in London. With antisemitism endemic among colonial officials, as among all sections of British society, they often expressed their resentment at attempts to outmanoeuvre them in racist terms. Yet, if this was an overtly hostile form of racism by comparison with the apparently more benign, paternalistic and version directed at the Arabs, British rule nonetheless maintained the political and economic framework that favoured Jewish nation-building at the expense of Arab interests.'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=5}}}}\n\n===Growing sympathy for Palestine===\n[[Aberystwyth University]]'s James R. Vaughn says the rise of a radical [[anti-Zionism]] in the Labour Party started with the creation of the Labour Middle East Council in 1969 by [[Christopher Mayhew]].{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|pp=1\u201325}}{{efn|Both Bevin and Mayhew (the latter later defected to the Liberal Party), had been subject to death threats by the [[Stern Gang]] in the 1940s.{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|p=4}}}} [[Dave Rich]] concurs that Mayhew founded the council in order to change the \"pro-Israel\" position of the Labour Party{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=26}} and references the influence of pro-Palestinian activists within the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]].{{sfn|Rich|2018|p=98}}\n\nBy the 1980s, with the election of [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party, the emergence of [[Religious nationalism|messianic nationalism]], [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economic reforms]], the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupation of the West Bank]] and of the [[Gaza Strip]], and the decline of the [[Israeli Labor Party]], socialism declined in Israel. These factors contributed to falling Labour support for Israel, at the same time as there was growing sympathy for Palestinian aspirations for statehood.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=2}} According to June Edmunds, Lecturer in Sociology of the [[University of Sussex]], the party's leadership was initially supportive of Israel but shifted to support Palestine in the early 1980s, although the membership did not; later challenges to this shift eventually resulted in a more balanced view of both sides and broad support for a [[two-state solution]].<ref name=EdmundsJune>{{Cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/tcbh/article/11/1/23/1647783|title=The Evolution of British Labour Party Policy on Israel from 1967 to the Intifada|first=June|last=Edmunds|date=1 January 2000|journal=Twentieth Century British History|volume=11|issue=1|pages=23\u201341|via=academic.oup.com|doi=10.1093/tcbh/11.1.23}}</ref> Edmunds credits the shift towards Palestine aspirations to more moderate appeals by Palestinians, a sharp shift to the right in Israeli politics and an increase in anti-colonial politics among the left.<ref name=EdmundsJune />\n\n[[Richard Seymour (writer)|Richard Seymour]] wrote in 2018 that \"Palestinian rights have been a growing concern in the British Left since the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]]\"{{sfn|Seymour|2018b}} when \"the British trade union movement and the Labour Party began to break with Israel in response\".{{sfn|Seymour|2018a}} The Labour Committee on Palestine was formed in June 1982 to challenge the Labour Middle East Council, which supported a two-state solution, and to oppose the \"Zionist state as racist, exclusivist, expansionist and a direct agency of imperialism\". Labour politicians [[Ken Livingstone]] of the [[Greater London Council]] and [[Ted Knight (politician)|Ted Knight]] of the [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] were early supporters; the chair was former British Anti-Zionist Organization (BAZO) activist Tony Greenstein.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=143}} The new Committee backed a resolution at the 1982 [[Labour Party Conference (UK)|Labour Party Conference]] to recognise the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\", which passed at the Conference, \"embarrassing\" the Party leadership.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=144}}\n\nAntisemitic attitudes are said to have been rare in the Labour Party in the 1980s.{{sfn|Rich|2018}}{{sfn|Hirsh|2017}} In his 2012 book, ''The British Left and Zionism: History of a Divorce'', [[Manchester University]]'s Paul Kelemen ascribed the shift in Labour's views to Israel's increasingly right-leaning politics and to the left's opposition to the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza]]. He found no evidence that antisemitism played a role in the left's changing perceptions of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in that period.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=185}}{{sfn|Kolpinskaya|2014|p=450}} Daniel L. Staetsky, a senior research fellow for the [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]], stated in his 2017 study ''Antisemitism in Contemporary Great Britain: A Study of Attitudes Towards Jews and Israel'' that, in the 1980s, parts of the political left assumed strong pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel positions, and faced accusations of antisemitism within the Labour Party.{{sfn|Staetsky|2017|p=42}} He found that anti-Israeli positions did not correlate generally with antisemitism, since the majority of those surveyed who were critical of Israel did not espouse an antisemitic attitude<ref>{{harvnb|Staetsky|2017|p=66}} \"We have discovered that anti-Israel attitudes are not, as a general rule, antisemitic.

Yet, all parts of those on the left of the political spectrum \u2013 including the 'slightly left-of-centre,' the 'fairly left-wing' and the 'very left-wing' \u2013 exhibit higher levels of anti-Israelism than average. The most antisemitic group on the political spectrum consists of those who identify as very right-wing: the presence of antisemitic attitudes in this group is two to four times higher compared to the general population.

On August 21, 1997 at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXXV]]'', Raven defeated Stevie Richards in an \"unsanctioned\" match and then took a seat in the front row. The storyline continued that Raven would frequently appear in the front row for the next few months with his lackeys, slowly forming what would be known as The Flock. Raven was an \"unsigned [[free agent]]\", but eventually accepted a contract with WCW Commissioner [[James J.

The Flock was a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] of [[wikt:misfit|misfit]]s in the same vein as the Raven's Nest group in ECW. With The Flock, however, Raven was more openly abusive and controlling, which eventually led to dissension and rebellion.

The former reign lasted only a day as Raven defeated [[Diamond Dallas Page]] at [[Spring Stampede (1998)|Spring Stampede]] and lost the belt the following night to [[Bill Goldberg]] on ''Nitro''. He blamed The Flock and Saturn in particular for his loss. This led to a series of matches, culminating in a match at [[Fall Brawl (1998)|Fall Brawl]] that if Raven lost, The Flock would be able to disband. Saturn won with the help of [[Billy Kidman|Kidman]], who also wanted to leave Raven's abuses.\n\n==== The Dead Pool (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{see also|Raven's Nest#Necro Ward/Dead Pool/Dark Carnival|l1=The Dead Pool}}\nWithout The Flock, Raven began a series of depressing interviews and walked out on several matches. In October at [[Halloween Havoc (1998)|Halloween Havoc]], Raven refused to wrestle [[Chris Jericho]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW Television Championship]], but eventually was convinced to return to the ring. He lost the match and was not seen until 1999. On his return, a series of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] were shown in which a camera crew followed Raven to his supposed childhood home, where he had led a privileged [[American upper class|upper class]] lifestyle. He was also reunited with his former valet Chastity, who WCW claimed was his sister.\n\nHe later joined with [[Vampiro]] and the [[Insane Clown Posse]] in a short-lived stable called [[Raven's Nest#Dead Pool/Dark Carnival|The Dead Pool]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> In a backstage meeting in August 1999, which involved every contracted WCW wrestler, [[Eric Bischoff]] offered anyone their release right then and there. Levy was the only one to stand up and walk out, as he was dissatisfied with WCW's creative direction. Levy was granted his release and left the company.<ref name=\"Reynolds2004\">{{cite book|author=R. D.

Wrestling|date=September 25, 2000|accessdate=February 11, 2010}}</ref> His previous run in the WWF as Johnny Polo was [[Retroactive continuity|ignored by the company]]. He then started teaming with Tazz before they went their separate ways. He then moved on to the Hardcore division, where he would often bring out a shopping cart full of trash cans and other potential weapons during his entrances. On December 22, 2000 in Chattanooga, he defeated [[Steve Blackman]] for the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]], his first of a record 27 title reigns, though most of Raven's title reigns were short-lived. The Hardcore title at the time was contested under the \"[[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 Rules|24/7]]\" defense rule, leading to segments where one wrestler would win the title only to immediately lose it to another wrestler. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], he competed in his only [[WrestleMania]] match, losing the Hardcore Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a triple threat match that also included [[Big Show]]. At [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], he lost to Hardcore Champion [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] in a hardcore match. A brief angle had an anonymous Black Ninja, who was later revealed to be his old valet from his Pacific Northwest days, [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]], aiding Raven in retaining the Hardcore Championship.<ref name=\"Milner\"/>\n\nWhen the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion]] storyline began, he found himself in the new [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|WCW/ECW Alliance]]. His most notable storyline during this time was when he was managed by [[Terri Runnels]] and destroyed the love interest of Saturn, his mop called \"Moppy.\" He also started teaming with [[Justin Credible]] in late July 2001. By the end of the year, Raven was not seen on WWE programs, as the Alliance lost the \"Winner Take All\" match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]].\n\nIn March 2002, when the [[WWE brand extension]] was announced, Raven was [[WWE brand extension#Superstar selections|drafted]] to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]. On the final ''SmackDown!'' before the split began, he defeated [[Maven Huffman|Maven]] to once again win the Hardcore Championship, thus bringing the title to ''Raw''. He lost the title that Monday to [[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]]. At that time, Levy decided to spend some time announcing, and Raven became the new color commentator for ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' and ''[[List of former World Wrestling Entertainment programming#Excess (2001\u20132002)|Excess]]''. This role lasted a couple of months, as he later quit the show to resume his wrestling career on ''Raw''. This did not last long either, as he was banished from ''Raw'' after losing a match to former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] alumni Tommy Dreamer on June 24, 2002. Raven was forced to spend the rest of the year on ''Heat''. Levy was then given creative control to develop a storyline related to the [[seven deadly sins]], [[wikt:a la|\u00e0 la]] the film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'', with Raven becoming a sort of \"puppet master\" using ''Heat'' as his playground. It started to play out; however, it was determined by management that it was not over enough, and the angle was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Abort|aborted]]. Although he won his way back onto the ''Raw'' roster, he lost to [[Jeff Hardy]] in a [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]] qualifier match in what would be his final match in the WWE. He was released from the promotion the following week on January 20, 2003.\n\n=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===\n==== The Gathering (2003\u20132004) ====\n{{see also|Raven's Nest#The Gathering|l1=The Gathering}}\n[[File:Raven in tna.jpg|thumb|right|Raven in [[Impact Wrestling|TNA]]]]\nRaven debuted for [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) on January 22, 2003, two days after his release from WWE, attacking and hitting his finisher on [[Jeff Jarrett]] and stealing the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Title]] from him. Raven then embarked upon a long-running storyline in which he claimed it was his \"destiny\" to win the NWA World Heavyweight Title. Raven began playing mind games with the roster, starting with his former nemesis Sandman, and debuted his trademark ''Clockwork Orange'' House of Fun match, which Levy devised himself. On April 30, 2003 Raven got his first shot at Jarrett's NWA World Heavyweight title, yet Jarrett won the match.\n\n[[File:Raven20041212.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Raven in December 2004]]\nOn September 17, 2003, Raven lost his trademark long hair after he was defeated by [[Shane Douglas]] in a hair versus hair match, thanks to the surprise interference of [[Vampiro]]. Vampiro and Raven would grow to be bitter rivals which resulted in a backstage brawl which Vampiro ended up with a torn \"ACL.\" While in TNA, he formed a stable known as [[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]], which included ROH rival CM Punk, as well as [[Julio Dinero]] and [[Mickie James|Alexis Laree]], though they would later turn on him. He created matches involving old friends and brought in former colleagues from ECW such as [[New Jack]], Perry Saturn, [[Mikey Whipwreck]], and Justin Credible, all of whom Raven beat in matches. Later in the year these superstars overturned [[Sports Entertainment Xtreme]] (SEX). In 2003, Raven feuded with [[James Mitchell (manager)|James Mitchell]] and the Disciples of the New Church. Raven took them all out one by one just like he said, but with interferences from The Gathering and ECW counterparts. Raven ended his feud with James Mitchell in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Last Man Standing match]], which was won by Raven. This led to a long undefeated run and the beginning of Raven's attempts to fulfill his destiny. In 2004, Raven teamed up with The Sandman to go against The Gathering. The Gathering won due to interference from James Mitchell, who had aligned himself with The Gathering. Raven then teamed with [[Terry Funk]] to defeat the Gathering, even though James Mitchell tried to interfere.\n\nAlso in 2004, Raven's old friend [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] returned to TNA. Raven teamed with Sabu to defeat The Gathering one last time. Raven and Sabu then feuded with [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] and \"The Alpha Male\" [[Monty Brown]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> Abyss and Brown outnumbered Sabu on many occasions, when Raven failed to watch Sabu's back. Raven waged a campaign against Sabu, disrespecting the memory of his uncle and assaulting Sabu's mouthpiece, [[Sonjay Dutt]], until Sabu finally broke and attacked him on July 23. Raven defeated Sabu in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]] on August 4, and a scheduled return match on August 18 was canceled after Sabu suffered a legitimate back injury. He also competed in the very first [[Monster's Ball match]], with Abyss and Brown.<ref name=\"Milner\"/>\n\n==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (2005\u20132006) ====\nOn June 19, 2005, Raven turned face and fulfilled his self-proclaimed destiny when he won the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Slammiversary (2005)|Slammiversary]] (by taking Jeff Jarrett's place after Jarrett attacked a fan from the crowd earlier that night and got arrested), defeating [[A.J. Styles]], Abyss, [[Sean Waltman]] and Monty Brown in a five way [[King of the Mountain match]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> He successfully defended the title in two defenses over the following months against Abyss at [[No Surrender (2005)|No Surrender]], and Rhino two months later at [[Unbreakable (2005)|Unbreakable]]. Against Rhino he showed his full array of moves and peeled back the years looking like the Raven in ECW and early WCW. He not only defeated Rhino but hit a Raven Effect DDT on Jeff Jarrett, with the assistance of Jeff Hardy running to the ringside. He also had a tag team match with Sabu against Jeff Jarrett and Rhino.\n\n[[File:Raven en la esquina.jpg|thumb|left|Raven in the corner, a signature pose]]\nOn September 15, Raven lost the NWA Title to Jeff Jarrett in Oldcastle, Ontario, Canada, at a special event of [[Border City Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] ([[Chris Harris (wrestler)|\"Wildcat\" Chris Harris]] and [[James Storm|\"Cowboy\" James Storm]]) came out and interfered on Jarrett's behalf.

This led to Raven feuding with Larry Zbyszko, who brought in wrestlers like [[Justin Credible|PJ Polaco]] and [[Chris Kanyon|Chris K]] to wrestle Raven.<ref name=\"Milner\"/> This culminated in a match at [[Final Resolution (2006)|Final Resolution]] where Raven wrestled Sean Waltman with the stipulation that if Raven lost he would have to leave TNA. Raven lost the match and went on hiatus as a result.\n\nRaven returned to TNA on April 23, 2006 at the [[Lockdown (2006)|Lockdown]] pay-per-view, and reignited his feud with Zbyszko. They would end their feud at [[Victory Road (2006)|Victory Road]] in a [[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair vs. Hair match]] which Raven won.\n\n==== Serotonin (2006\u20132008) ====\n{{see also|Raven's Nest#Serotonin|l1=Serotonin}}\nHe next feuded with Abyss and [[Spike Dudley|Brother Runt]], losing to the former in a Hangman's Horror match on Impact after the latter turned on him. Subsequent to this, his coverage in major televised angles has dropped considerably. While he was off-air, an alliance was teased between [[Kazarian (wrestler)|Kazarian]], [[Johnny Devine]], and [[Matt Bentley]]. On the TNA Primetime Special before Genesis 2006, the three came out in goth, addressing a new movement in TNA. After a loss at the pay-per-view, sporting a new look (often with a mask), Raven revealed himself as their leader, caning the loser of the match. This stable became known as [[Raven's Nest#Serotonin|Serotonin]]. The direction of this stable was very hard to place, although they lost the majority of their televised matches. Regardless of the outcome, Raven would hit the Serotonin competitor with a cane. After a long hiatus, Raven returned to the ring, losing to [[Christopher Daniels]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#First Blood match|First Blood Invitational]] then losing to [[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] after interference from [[Kazarian (wrestler)|Kaz]]. On ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact]]'', Raven came out after Kaz's win over Havok and Martyr and hit Kaz in the back with a Kendo Stick, breaking it over Kaz's back. Raven, Havok, and Martyr then attacked Kaz with kendo sticks. On the July 19 episode of ''Impact!'', Raven and the rest of Serotonin took on the reuniting [[Triple X (professional wrestling)|Triple X]]. Raven had very little time in the match and Serotonin lost after Skipper hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving leg drop|diving leg drop]], Daniels hit a [[Christopher Daniels#In wrestling|Best Moonsault Ever]], and Senshi hit a [[Low Ki#In wrestling|Warrior's Way]] on Havok.<ref name=\"Milner\"/>\n\nRaven won a House of Fun match, on the August 9 episode of ''Impact!''. He teamed with [[Bobby Roode|Robert Roode]] and James Storm against the team of Chris Harris, Rhino, and Kazarian. Raven lost to Kaz, who had rebelled against him, at [[Hard Justice (2007)|Hard Justice]] despite having the remaining members of Serotonin involve themselves in the match. He then issued a challenge to Abyss and Rhino at [[Bound for Glory (2007)|Bound for Glory]]. Abyss later had Black Reign added to the match and made it a Monsters Ball. Raven briefly formed an alliance with [[Johnny Devine|Havok]], [[Dustin Rhodes|Black Reign]], [[Ricky Banderas|Judas Mesias]], and James Mitchell with the purpose of defeating Abyss.<ref name=\"Milner\"/> At Bound for glory, Raven would go on to lose the match after Abyss gave him a black hole slam on to tacks and glass. On the November 15 episode of ''Impact'', Havok was revealed to be [[Dudley Boyz|Team 3D]]'s [[X Division]] traitor, effectively ending Serotonin. At [[Turning Point (2007 wrestling)|Turning Point]], Raven substituted for Rhino in the \"Match of 10,000 Thumbtacks\" and teamed with Abyss to defeat [[Goldust|Black Reign]] and [[Jon Hugger|Rellik]]. Raven was officially released from TNA, and his profile was removed from the roster on March 7, 2008.\n\n==== Alliance with Dr. Stevie (2009\u20132010) ====\nAfter an absence of more than a year, Raven surprised fans by returning to TNA on May 28, 2009. He returned as a heel by attacking Abyss with a Kendo stick with [[Stevie Richards|Dr. Stevie]] assisting him. He then aligned himself with Dr. Stevie and [[Daffney]]. On the June 18 episode of ''Impact!'' he won a Clockwork Orange House of Fun match against [[William Mueller|Jethro Holliday]]. At [[Slammiversary (2009)|Slammiversary]], Abyss and [[Shantelle Malawski|Taylor Wilde]] defeated Raven and Daffney in the first-ever mixed tag team Monster's Ball match. After the pay-per-view, Raven's name was taken down from the TNA website.\n\n[[File:Raven vs. Douglas.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Raven in a match against Shane Douglas]]\nOn the November 12, 2009, episode of ''Impact!'', Raven returned again to TNA attacking Abyss and throwing a fireball at [[Mick Foley]]'s face, aligning himself again with Dr. Stevie and Daffney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_36725.shtml|title=WILKENFELD'S TNA IMPACT REPORT: Ongoing \"virtual time\" coverage of Spike TV broadcast|last=Wilkenfeld|first=Daniel|date=November 12, 2009|work=PWTorch|accessdate=November 13, 2009}}</ref> At [[Final Resolution (2009)|Final Resolution]], Abyss and Foley defeated Stevie and Raven in a \"Foley's Funhouse\" tag team match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_37540.shtml|title=CALDWELL'S TNA FINAL RESOLUTION PPV REPORT: Ongoing \"virtual time\" coverage of A.J.

He was seen sitting in the front row at ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'' where the commentators acknowledged him as \"a man who has been a champion with other organizations\". On August 21, 1997 at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXXV]]'', Raven defeated Stevie Richards in an \"unsanctioned\" match and then took a seat in the front row. The storyline continued that Raven would frequently appear in the front row for the next few months with his lackeys, slowly forming what would be known as The Flock. Raven was an \"unsigned [[free agent]]\", but eventually accepted a contract with WCW Commissioner [[James J. Dillon]] which stipulated that he could wrestle only when he wanted and under his own rules. The Flock was a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]] of [[wikt:misfit|misfit]]s in the same vein as the Raven's Nest group in ECW. With The Flock, however, Raven was more openly abusive and controlling, which eventually led to dissension and rebellion. The group's matches were held under ''Raven's Rules'', which meant no disqualifications \u2014 weapon usage, double teaming, and outside interference were rampant.\n\nRaven made his in-ring ''Nitro'' debut on October 27 defeating [[Scott Antol|Scotty Riggs]], he would first offer Riggs to become a member of The Flock which Riggs would refuse. On November 23 at [[World War 3 (1997)|World War 3]], Raven met Riggs again in a match, and later joined The Flock. With The Flock's help, Raven won the [[WWE United States Championship|WCW United States Heavyweight Championship]] as well as the [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]] with [[Perry Saturn]]. The former reign lasted only a day as Raven defeated [[Diamond Dallas Page]] at [[Spring Stampede (1998)|Spring Stampede]] and lost the belt the following night to [[Bill Goldberg]] on ''Nitro''. He blamed The Flock and Saturn in particular for his loss. This led to a series of matches, culminating in a match at [[Fall Brawl (1998)|Fall Brawl]] that if Raven lost, The Flock would be able to disband. Saturn won with the help of [[Billy Kidman|Kidman]], who also wanted to leave Raven's abuses.\n\n==== The Dead Pool (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{see also|Raven's Nest#Necro Ward/Dead Pool/Dark Carnival|l1=The Dead Pool}}\nWithout The Flock, Raven began a series of depressing interviews and walked out on several matches. In October at [[Halloween Havoc (1998)|Halloween Havoc]], Raven refused to wrestle [[Chris Jericho]] for the [[WCW World Television Championship|WCW Television Championship]], but eventually was convinced to return to the ring. He lost the match and was not seen until 1999. On his return, a series of [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] were shown in which a camera crew followed Raven to his supposed childhood home, where he had led a privileged [[American upper class|upper class]] lifestyle. He was also reunited with his former valet Chastity, who WCW claimed was his sister.\n\nHe later joined with [[Vampiro]] and the [[Insane Clown Posse]] in a short-lived stable called [[Raven's Nest#Dead Pool/Dark Carnival|The Dead Pool]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> In a backstage meeting in August 1999, which involved every contracted WCW wrestler, [[Eric Bischoff]] offered anyone their release right then and there.

He then started teaming with Tazz before they went their separate ways. He then moved on to the Hardcore division, where he would often bring out a shopping cart full of trash cans and other potential weapons during his entrances. On December 22, 2000 in Chattanooga, he defeated [[Steve Blackman]] for the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]], his first of a record 27 title reigns, though most of Raven's title reigns were short-lived. The Hardcore title at the time was contested under the \"[[WWE Hardcore Championship#24/7 Rules|24/7]]\" defense rule, leading to segments where one wrestler would win the title only to immediately lose it to another wrestler. At [[WrestleMania X-Seven]], he competed in his only [[WrestleMania]] match, losing the Hardcore Championship to [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] in a triple threat match that also included [[Big Show]]. At [[Backlash (2001)|Backlash]], he lost to Hardcore Champion [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] in a hardcore match. A brief angle had an anonymous Black Ninja, who was later revealed to be his old valet from his Pacific Northwest days, [[Tori (wrestler)|Tori]], aiding Raven in retaining the Hardcore Championship.<ref name=\"Milner\"/>\n\nWhen the [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion]] storyline began, he found himself in the new [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|WCW/ECW Alliance]]. His most notable storyline during this time was when he was managed by [[Terri Runnels]] and destroyed the love interest of Saturn, his mop called \"Moppy.\" He also started teaming with [[Justin Credible]] in late July 2001. By the end of the year, Raven was not seen on WWE programs, as the Alliance lost the \"Winner Take All\" match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]].\n\nIn March 2002, when the [[WWE brand extension]] was announced, Raven was [[WWE brand extension#Superstar selections|drafted]] to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]]. On the final ''SmackDown!'' before the split began, he defeated [[Maven Huffman|Maven]] to once again win the Hardcore Championship, thus bringing the title to ''Raw''. He lost the title that Monday to [[Mark LoMonaco|Bubba Ray Dudley]]. At that time, Levy decided to spend some time announcing, and Raven became the new color commentator for ''[[WWE Heat|Sunday Night Heat]]'' and ''[[List of former World Wrestling Entertainment programming#Excess (2001\u20132002)|Excess]]''. This role lasted a couple of months, as he later quit the show to resume his wrestling career on ''Raw''. This did not last long either, as he was banished from ''Raw'' after losing a match to former [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] alumni Tommy Dreamer on June 24, 2002. Raven was forced to spend the rest of the year on ''Heat''. Levy was then given creative control to develop a storyline related to the [[seven deadly sins]], [[wikt:a la|\u00e0 la]] the film ''[[Seven (1995 film)|Se7en]]'', with Raven becoming a sort of \"puppet master\" using ''Heat'' as his playground. It started to play out; however, it was determined by management that it was not over enough, and the angle was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Abort|aborted]]. Although he won his way back onto the ''Raw'' roster, he lost to [[Jeff Hardy]] in a [[Royal Rumble (2003)|Royal Rumble]] qualifier match in what would be his final match in the WWE. He was released from the promotion the following week on January 20, 2003.\n\n=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===\n==== The Gathering (2003\u20132004) ====\n{{see also|Raven's Nest#The Gathering|l1=The Gathering}}\n[[File:Raven in tna.jpg|thumb|right|Raven in [[Impact Wrestling|TNA]]]]\nRaven debuted for [[Impact Wrestling|Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) on January 22, 2003, two days after his release from WWE, attacking and hitting his finisher on [[Jeff Jarrett]] and stealing the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Heavyweight Title]] from him. Raven then embarked upon a long-running storyline in which he claimed it was his \"destiny\" to win the NWA World Heavyweight Title. Raven began playing mind games with the roster, starting with his former nemesis Sandman, and debuted his trademark ''Clockwork Orange'' House of Fun match, which Levy devised himself. On April 30, 2003 Raven got his first shot at Jarrett's NWA World Heavyweight title, yet Jarrett won the match.\n\n[[File:Raven20041212.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Raven in December 2004]]\nOn September 17, 2003, Raven lost his trademark long hair after he was defeated by [[Shane Douglas]] in a hair versus hair match, thanks to the surprise interference of [[Vampiro]]. Vampiro and Raven would grow to be bitter rivals which resulted in a backstage brawl which Vampiro ended up with a torn \"ACL.\" While in TNA, he formed a stable known as [[Raven's Nest#The Gathering|The Gathering]], which included ROH rival CM Punk, as well as [[Julio Dinero]] and [[Mickie James|Alexis Laree]], though they would later turn on him. He created matches involving old friends and brought in former colleagues from ECW such as [[New Jack]], Perry Saturn, [[Mikey Whipwreck]], and Justin Credible, all of whom Raven beat in matches. Later in the year these superstars overturned [[Sports Entertainment Xtreme]] (SEX). In 2003, Raven feuded with [[James Mitchell (manager)|James Mitchell]] and the Disciples of the New Church. Raven took them all out one by one just like he said, but with interferences from The Gathering and ECW counterparts. Raven ended his feud with James Mitchell in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Last Man Standing match]], which was won by Raven. This led to a long undefeated run and the beginning of Raven's attempts to fulfill his destiny. In 2004, Raven teamed up with The Sandman to go against The Gathering. The Gathering won due to interference from James Mitchell, who had aligned himself with The Gathering. Raven then teamed with [[Terry Funk]] to defeat the Gathering, even though James Mitchell tried to interfere.\n\nAlso in 2004, Raven's old friend [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] returned to TNA. Raven teamed with Sabu to defeat The Gathering one last time. Raven and Sabu then feuded with [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] and \"The Alpha Male\" [[Monty Brown]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> Abyss and Brown outnumbered Sabu on many occasions, when Raven failed to watch Sabu's back. Raven waged a campaign against Sabu, disrespecting the memory of his uncle and assaulting Sabu's mouthpiece, [[Sonjay Dutt]], until Sabu finally broke and attacked him on July 23. Raven defeated Sabu in a [[Professional wrestling match types#No Disqualification match|No Holds Barred match]] on August 4, and a scheduled return match on August 18 was canceled after Sabu suffered a legitimate back injury. He also competed in the very first [[Monster's Ball match]], with Abyss and Brown.<ref name=\"Milner\"/>\n\n==== NWA World Heavyweight Champion (2005\u20132006) ====\nOn June 19, 2005, Raven turned face and fulfilled his self-proclaimed destiny when he won the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] at [[Slammiversary (2005)|Slammiversary]] (by taking Jeff Jarrett's place after Jarrett attacked a fan from the crowd earlier that night and got arrested), defeating [[A.J. Styles]], Abyss, [[Sean Waltman]] and Monty Brown in a five way [[King of the Mountain match]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> He successfully defended the title in two defenses over the following months against Abyss at [[No Surrender (2005)|No Surrender]], and Rhino two months later at [[Unbreakable (2005)|Unbreakable]]. Against Rhino he showed his full array of moves and peeled back the years looking like the Raven in ECW and early WCW. He not only defeated Rhino but hit a Raven Effect DDT on Jeff Jarrett, with the assistance of Jeff Hardy running to the ringside. He also had a tag team match with Sabu against Jeff Jarrett and Rhino.\n\n[[File:Raven en la esquina.jpg|thumb|left|Raven in the corner, a signature pose]]\nOn September 15, Raven lost the NWA Title to Jeff Jarrett in Oldcastle, Ontario, Canada, at a special event of [[Border City Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Milner\"/> [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] ([[Chris Harris (wrestler)|\"Wildcat\" Chris Harris]] and [[James Storm|\"Cowboy\" James Storm]]) came out and interfered on Jarrett's behalf.

This led to Raven feuding with Larry Zbyszko, who brought in wrestlers like [[Justin Credible|PJ Polaco]] and [[Chris Kanyon|Chris K]] to wrestle Raven.<ref name=\"Milner\"/> This culminated in a match at [[Final Resolution (2006)|Final Resolution]] where Raven wrestled Sean Waltman with the stipulation that if Raven lost he would have to leave TNA. Raven lost the match and went on hiatus as a result.\n\nRaven returned to TNA on April 23, 2006 at the [[Lockdown (2006)|Lockdown]] pay-per-view, and reignited his feud with Zbyszko. They would end their feud at [[Victory Road (2006)|Victory Road]] in a [[Lucha libre#Luchas de Apuestas|Hair vs. Hair match]] which Raven won.\n\n==== Serotonin (2006\u20132008) ====\n{{see also|Raven's Nest#Serotonin|l1=Serotonin}}\nHe next feuded with Abyss and [[Spike Dudley|Brother Runt]], losing to the former in a Hangman's Horror match on Impact after the latter turned on him. Subsequent to this, his coverage in major televised angles has dropped considerably. While he was off-air, an alliance was teased between [[Kazarian (wrestler)|Kazarian]], [[Johnny Devine]], and [[Matt Bentley]]. On the TNA Primetime Special before Genesis 2006, the three came out in goth, addressing a new movement in TNA. After a loss at the pay-per-view, sporting a new look (often with a mask), Raven revealed himself as their leader, caning the loser of the match. This stable became known as [[Raven's Nest#Serotonin|Serotonin]]. The direction of this stable was very hard to place, although they lost the majority of their televised matches. Regardless of the outcome, Raven would hit the Serotonin competitor with a cane. After a long hiatus, Raven returned to the ring, losing to [[Christopher Daniels]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#First Blood match|First Blood Invitational]] then losing to [[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] after interference from [[Kazarian (wrestler)|Kaz]]. On ''[[Impact Wrestling (TV series)|Impact]]'', Raven came out after Kaz's win over Havok and Martyr and hit Kaz in the back with a Kendo Stick, breaking it over Kaz's back. Raven, Havok, and Martyr then attacked Kaz with kendo sticks. On the July 19 episode of ''Impact!'', Raven and the rest of Serotonin took on the reuniting [[Triple X (professional wrestling)|Triple X]]. Raven had very little time in the match and Serotonin lost after Skipper hit a [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Diving leg drop|diving leg drop]], Daniels hit a [[Christopher Daniels#In wrestling|Best Moonsault Ever]], and Senshi hit a [[Low Ki#In wrestling|Warrior's Way]] on Havok.<ref name=\"Milner\"/>\n\nRaven won a House of Fun match, on the August 9 episode of ''Impact!''. He teamed with [[Bobby Roode|Robert Roode]] and James Storm against the team of Chris Harris, Rhino, and Kazarian. Raven lost to Kaz, who had rebelled against him, at [[Hard Justice (2007)|Hard Justice]] despite having the remaining members of Serotonin involve themselves in the match.
