The magazine and its website feature journalism from the ''Times'', as well as material produced by ''Upfront''\u2019s editorial staff.\n\nEdited with a high school audience in mind, ''Upfront'' covers a wide array of topics of interest to teenagers, explaining how news events relate to them, their communities, and their futures.\n\nThe magazine and its accompanying resources, including videos and skills activities, are designed to teach students how to think critically, form their own opinions and become informed and engaged citizens. ''Upfront'' is also intended to boost students' non-fiction reading skills. It brings current events into the classroom while connecting with high school curricula by meeting rigorous national and state standards in social studies and English/Language Arts.\n\nAlthough ''Upfront'' is targeted at a high school audience, some teachers also use it for a younger, gifted audience. More than 15,000 [[Social Studies]] and English/Language Arts teachers nationwide subscribe to ''Upfront'' for their students.\n\nPublished 13 times during the school year, ''Upfront'' has a [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of approximately 453,000, with a readership of over 1.3 million students\u2014since teachers generally use the magazine with more than one class and often share it with other teachers (the pass along rate is estimated at 3).\n\nEach issue comes with a teacher's edition that includes in-depth lesson plans, quizzes and skills activities.

The idea was to combine the journalistic resources of the ''Times'' and the reporting from its news bureaus around the world with Scholastic's ability to create magazines that meet the curricular needs of high school teachers.

He got to know well many leading people at the Russian Court.  He first travelled to Moscow as an agent for the [[Muscovy Company|Russia Company]], and later acted as an [[diplomat|envoy]] of Tsar Ivan to [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] and then from the [[Noble court|English court]] under Queen Elizabeth to Ivan. After returning to England, Horsey served in the [[Unreformed House of Commons|House of Commons]], sitting on many committees including the Committee for Returns, Elections, and Privileges. [[Knight Bachelor|Knighted]] in 1603, he wrote accounts of his time in Russia which have been published several times, and was the subject of two novels.\n\n==Family background==\nJerome was the son of William Horsey, a merchant at [[Exeter]], by Elinor Peryam. He was the grandson of Sir John Horsey II of Sherborne, Dorset and nephew of Sir [[Edward Horsey]] who was Captain of the [[Isle of Wight]] in the period leading up to the [[Spanish Armada]]. Jerome probably married three times:\n#Elizabeth Hampden whom he married in January 1592, by whom he had 2 sons and 3 daughters.  She died in 1607.\n#Isabella Brocket whom he married  about October 1609.\n#Elizabeth North (uncertain - not mentioned in will)\n\n==At the court of Ivan IV==\nJerome was apprenticed to the Russia Company in 1571, but the latter was prevented from trading in Russia for a period and his first experience was of trading with the [[Seventeen Provinces|Dutch]]. Initially he went to Russia in May 1573 on the resumption of trade and was an interpreter. On his way to Moscow he was given gold and jewels by the gentry and clergy of [[Kostroma]] for saving the town from the Tsar.\n\nOn arriving in Moscow he supposedly rescued [[Madelyn van Uxell]] from being sent to a brothel by the Tsar,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} an act which served him well later. The Russia Company asked Jerome to negotiate a new charter and to use his influence to get extra land for the English compound (which still stands on [[Varvarka]] Street in [[Zaryadye]]). Part of this land was set aside for his own house, where he entertained Russian noblemen and had personal servants.\n\nHe later boasted of saving a number of German prisoners taken when the colony was supposedly massacred.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} The merchants of [[Hamburg]] later gave him a [[damask]] tablecloth and napkins while those of [[L\u00fcbeck]] gave him a \"great silver loving cup\". He also befriended the 1200 Scots (and a few English) prisoners that were in Moscow. He arranged for them to get paid employment in the Russian Army and got permission for them to build a church.\n\nDuring his time in Moscow, Jerome seems to have carried out private trading on behalf of members of the English Court, such as [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Leicester]] and [[Francis Walsingham|Walsingham]], which was against the rules of the Russia Company. This later caused a dispute with the company, but eventually the problem was resolved by his giving up the property he owned in Moscow, and it was found that they owed him money rather than the other way around.\n\n==At the court of Ivan's successors==\n[[File:Ivan the Terrible and Harsey.jpg|{{largethumb}}|''[[Ivan IV of Russia]] Showing His Treasury to Jerome Horsey'' (from a 1875 Russian painting by [[Alexander Litovchenko]])]]\n\nJerome seems to have spent considerable time at the Russian Court, being invited by Tsar Ivan into the Treasury and attending the coronation of his successor [[Fyodor I of Russia|Tsar Theodore]]. The Russian Court was very divided. Jerome says that \"my most implacable enemy\" was [[Vasily Shchelkanov]] but [[Boris Godunov]] was a friend.\n\nAnother friend, whom he seems later to have wanted to marry, was Princess [[Maria of Livonia|Maria Vladimirovna]]. Maria first became the wife of [[Magnus of Livonia|Magnus the Dane]] but after Magnus's death Horsey was asked by Boris to persuade her to return to Russia where she was imprisoned. Jerome later said that this was the worst thing he ever did. However, the marriage with Maria was not allowed as he was a commoner, and she was placed in a nunnery.\n\nIn late November 1581 Jerome was asked by Ivan to take letters, hidden in a flask, to Queen Elizabeth. He had to travel overland as the sea was frozen. This journey was very difficult and included being arrested at the Danish island of [[Saaremaa|Oesel]], but the wife of the governor happened to be Madelyn van Uxel whom he had saved earlier. Jerome also had to pass through [[Pilten]] where he met Maria the Russian princess.\n\n==Second visit to Russia==\nOn arrival in London, Jerome had several meetings with Queen Elizabeth, translating the papers he had carried into English. Horsey returned to Russia with nine ships loaded with cargo, partly supplied by adventurers outside the Russia Company.\n\nHe later returned to England with letters from the Tsar asking for help, as the wife of the Tsar was having difficulty conceiving. But this was misunderstood, and Jerome returned with a midwife, which did not go down well at the Russian court. The English at this time also lost favour as it was thought that the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] would conquer England. When the Russians learned that the [[Spanish Armada]] was scattered, the English had half their customs duty removed.\n\nJerome again returned to England in 1587, having apparently agreed with Boris Godunov that he would marry Maria on his return. He was then accused of fraud. However, his friends at the English Court stood by him. He was asked to return to Russia in 1591, but the Tsar would not see him and asked Elizabeth never to permit him to come to Russia again. He was accused of being \"a well known spy\". Boris Godunov arranged for his journey back to England and gave him a large present of money.\n\n==Return to England==\nIn 1595 Jerome Horsey was accused of High Treason by Finch, whom he had caused to be sent home from Moscow. It is thought that Finch was put up to this by Sir [[Jeremy Bowes]], the ex-ambassador to Moscow, who thought that Horsey had caused him to be sent home by the Russians. Among other things, Horsey was stated to have said \"Our Virgin Quene is no more a virgin than I am\".{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The Queen had no choice but to sign a warrant for his arrest, but she said \"I still believe Jerome Horsey will prove himself honest\". The case came before the [[Privy Council]] in April 1597 but was dismissed, and Finch was proved to be a liar by witnesses.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nJerome was a Servant of the Russia Company from 1572 to about 1585. He was made an [[Esquire of the Body]] to Queen Elizabeth in 1580, was knighted on 23 July 1603 and Receiver of Crown Lands in nine counties in June 1604. He was a [[Justice of the Peace]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] from about 1601 and [[High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire]] in 1611\u201312. He represented various places, [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]] (1593), [[Camelford (UK Parliament constituency)|Camelford]] (1597), [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney]] (1601, 1604 and 1614) and [[East Looe (UK Parliament constituency)|East Looe]] (1621), in [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], serving over 30 years. He translated the [[Slavic translations of the Bible|Slavonic Bible]] and was responsible for introducing the term \"White Russia\" into England for [[Belarus]].\n\nHe died in January 1626 and was buried at [[Great Kimble]]. Horsey is occasionally cited as a contemporary authority on Eastern Europe, Russia, and the reign of [[Ivan the Terrible]].\n\n==References==\n*Horsey, Jerome: ''The ...   coronation of Theodore Iuanowich, emperour of Russia'' (in Hakuyt R, ''The Principal Navigations'' Vol 1, 1598).\n*Horsey, Jerome: ''Extracts out of Sir J H's Observations in seventeene yeares travels and experience in Russia'' (in Purchas P, Purchas' ''Pilgrimages'', 1626).\n*Bond: ''Russia at the Close of the Sixteenth Century''.

The first standard in this series was ISO/IEC 17799:2000; this was a fast-tracking of the existing British standard [[BS 7799|BS&nbsp;7799]] part 1:1999<ref>{{cite web|title=ISO27K timeline|url=http://www.iso27001security.com/html/timeline.html|website=ISO27001security.com|publisher=IsecT Ltd.|access-date=1 April 2016|ref=timeline}}</ref> The initial release of [[BS 7799|BS&nbsp;7799]] was based, in part, on an information security policy manual developed by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  In 1993, what was then the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)]] convened a team to review existing practice in information security, with the goal of producing a standards document.  In 1995, the [[BSI Group]] published the first version of [[BS 7799]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Information Technology Risk Management in Enterprise Environments : a Review of Industry Practices and a Practical Guide to Risk Management Teams| author=Jake Kouns, Daniel Minoli|publisher=Somerset: Wiley|year=2011}}</ref> One of the principal authors of BS 7799 recalls that, at the beginning of 1993, \"The DTI decided to quickly assemble a group of industry representatives from seven different sectors: Shell ([David Lacey] and Les Riley), BOC Group (Neil Twist), BT (Dennis Willets), Marks & Spencer (Steve Jones), Midland Bank (Richard Hackworth), Nationwide (John Bowles) and Unilever (Rolf Moulton).\"<ref>{{cite web|title=David Lacey on the Origins of ISO27K|url=http://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/regulatory-compliance/david-lacey-on-the-origins-of-iso27K/|date=18 October 2013|publisher=Tripwire.com}}</ref>  David Lacey credits [[Donn B.
