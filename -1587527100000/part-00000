The first two league titles were won under legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]], who also led the club to an [[FA Cup]] win in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]]. In the late 1950s the club was managed by [[Bill Shankly]] and featured [[Denis Law]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]]. Following relegation from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1972, Huddersfield spent 45 years in the second, third and fourth tiers of English football, before returning to the top flight in 2017. They were relegated back to the [[Championship]] at the end of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Huddersfield Town A.F.C.}}\n\n[[File:Huddersfield Town FC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|250px|Chart showing the progress of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. through the [[English football league system]].]]In 1910, just three years after being founded, Huddersfield entered [[the Football League]] for the first time. In November 1919 a fund-raising campaign was needed to avoid a move to [[Leeds]]. Citizens of Huddersfield were asked to buy shares in the club for \u00a31 each, and the club staved off the proposed merger. The team went on to reach the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] and win promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]].\n\nHuddersfield became the first English team to win three successive [[List of English football champions|English League titles]] in 1926 \u2013 a feat that only three other clubs ([[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) have been able to match \u2013 and was achieved under the leadership of legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]] and his successor [[Cecil Potter]]. Huddersfield Town also won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]] and the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] the same year and have been runners-up on four other occasions in the FA Cup. During the club's heyday in the 1920s and 1930s, they achieved a record attendance of 67,037 on 27 February 1932 during their FA Cup 6th round tie against Arsenal at [[Leeds Road]]. This attendance has been bettered by only 13 other clubs in the history of the Football League.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the club began a gradual decline, losing its [[Football League First Division|First Division]] status in [[1951\u201352 Football League|1952]]. They came straight back up, but were relegated again three seasons later. Before the start of the [[1969\u201370 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|1969\u201370]] season, Huddersfield Town adopted the nickname \"''The Terriers''\". They won the Second Division title that season, spending the next two seasons in the top flight. After that they moved up and down through the lower three divisions for 45 years.\n\nIn 1998, the club attracted the attention of local businessman Barry Rubery and, after protracted takeover talks, he took over the running of the club, promising significant investment as the club sought [[Premier League|Premiership]] status. However, the club did not make it back to the top flight and fell two divisions. The club was sold by Rubery to David Taylor and under Taylor's ownership, slipped into administration. In the summer of 2003, the Terriers came out of administration under the new ownership of [[Ken Davy]].\n\nIn [[2010\u201311 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|2010\u201311]], Huddersfield went 43 games unbeaten, the second-highest in the league after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] 49-match run of 2003\u201304.<ref>{{cite news |title=Huddersfield's record run ends after 43 matches |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-huddersfield/huddersfields-record-run-ends-after-43-matches-idUKTRE7AS0HS20111129 |website=Reuters |agency=Reuters |accessdate=19 December 2018|date=29 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn 26 May 2012, following a penalty shoot-out in the [[2012 Football League One play-off Final]] victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], Huddersfield were promoted to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. The shoot-out was the longest contested in the current League One play-offs format.  After eleven rounds, the final score was 8\u20137 to Huddersfield, with the winning goal being scored by goalkeeper [[Alex Smithies]]. Huddersfield missed the first three penalties became the first team to win an football league play-off penalty shootout after doing so.\n\nIn November 2015, German-born ex-[[United States men's national soccer team|US international]] [[David Wagner (soccer)|David Wagner]] was appointed head coach, becoming the first person born outside the [[British Isles]] to manage the club in their 107-year history.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Wagner named new Huddersfield Town head coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34733422 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018|date=5 November 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 2017, the club successfully earned promotion to the [[Premier League]] for the first time (since the rebranding in 1992) and the English top flight for the first time since [[1971\u201372 Football League|1972]], beating [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 4\u20133 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw after extra time in the [[2017 EFL Championship play-off Final|Championship play-off Final]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Huddersfield Town 0 -0 Reading (4-3 Pens) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39995791 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 May 2018, the club secured safety from relegation, earning another season in the Premier League, following a 1\u20131 draw against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and went on to place 16th.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Chelsea 1\u20131 Huddersfield Town | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 9 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 May 2018 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180508144829/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-date = 8 May 2018 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> However, the club suffered a very poor start to the 2018-19 season, taking just 2 wins in their first 22 matches.

It ranged from [[salmon pink]] to plain white or all-blue to white with blue [[yoke]]. Eventually in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1913\u201314|1913]], the club adopted the blue-and-white jersey that remains to this day.\n\nThe club badge is based on the [[coat of arms]] of Huddersfield. Town first used a badge on its shirts for the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] based on the local Huddersfield Corporation coat of arms. It appeared again with a [[Yorkshire Rose]] for the [[1922 FA Cup Final]] and again for the finals of [[1928 FA Cup Final|1928]], [[1930 FA Cup Final|1930]] and [[1938 FA Cup Final|1938]]. The club's main [[color|colours]] (blue and white) are evident throughout the badge both in the [[mantling]] and in the [[shield]], in the form of stripes. Two Yorkshire White Roses and [[Castle Hill, Huddersfield|Castle Hill]] form part of the history of the club and the area.\n\nTown stuck with the same principal design (blue and white stripes) until [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966\u201367|1966]], when [[Scotland|Scottish]] manager [[Tom Johnston (footballer)|Tom Johnston]] introduced all-blue shirts. The next badge did not feature until the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966\u201367|1966\u201367 season]], when the simple \"HTFC\" adorned the Town's all-blue shirts.\n\nWhen the club adopted the nickname \"The Terriers\" for the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1969\u201370|1969\u201370 season]], the blue and white stripes returned and with it a red terrier with the words \"The Terriers\", just in time for their promotion to the big time, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The [[Yorkshire terrier|terrier]] sits on top of the crest with a [[ball]] on a blanket of blue and white stripes. The Terriers was introduced to the badge shortly after \"The Terriers\" was adopted as the nickname and [[mascot]] of the club.\n\nAfter relegation to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], Town returned to all-blue shirts with the return of Tom Johnston in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975\u201376|1975]]. This time they only lasted two seasons and the return of simply \"HTFC\" badge. This lasted from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975\u201376|1975]]\u2013[[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1976\u201377|1977]]. Stripes returned from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1977\u201378|the 1977\u201378 season]] and has been the club's home kit ever since. The red Terrier returned to the shirt for [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1978\u201379|the 1978\u201379 season]]. In 1980, Town adopted what remains their badge today based on the coat of arms of Huddersfield. This is both the club badge and playing shirt badge and is held in high esteem by Town fans.\n\nIn 2000, Town changed badge to a circular design, but that was never popular and following a change of board, returned to the heraldic-style badge. The badge was further redeveloped with a small but significant adaptation in February 2005. The club took the decision to remove \"A.F.C.\" from the text leaving only the wording 'Huddersfield Town'. The current board said that this was in keeping with the time and to make merchandise easier to produce and to make slicker looking promotional material.\n\nTo mark Town's promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2017-18, the club adopted a Terriers logo to replace the historic crest on the shirts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/huddersfield-town-mascot-terry-terrier-13433906|title=Town mascot Terry the Terrier gets a makeover in time for Premier League debut|first=Tony|last=Earnshaw|date=5 August 2017|website=huddersfieldexaminer}}</ref>\n\nTo mark Town's relegation from the [[Premier League]] in 2019, the club agreed to have [[Paddy Power]] shirt sponsorship in a striking beauty queen style diagonal sash design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/htafc/status/1151401159011315718|title=#htafc's new home kit for the upcoming 2019/20 season has today been revealed!

The first two league titles were won under legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]], who also led the club to an [[FA Cup]] win in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]]. In the late 1950s the club was managed by [[Bill Shankly]] and featured [[Denis Law]] and [[Ray Wilson (English footballer)|Ray Wilson]]. Following relegation from the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in 1972, Huddersfield spent 45 years in the second, third and fourth tiers of English football, before returning to the top flight in 2017. They were relegated back to the [[Championship]] at the end of the 2018\u201319 season.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of Huddersfield Town A.F.C.}}\n\n[[File:Huddersfield Town FC League Performance.svg|thumb|right|250px|Chart showing the progress of Huddersfield Town A.F.C. through the [[English football league system]].]]In 1910, just three years after being founded, Huddersfield entered [[the Football League]] for the first time. In November 1919 a fund-raising campaign was needed to avoid a move to [[Leeds]]. Citizens of Huddersfield were asked to buy shares in the club for \u00a31 each, and the club staved off the proposed merger. The team went on to reach the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] and win promotion to [[Football League First Division|Division One]].\n\nHuddersfield became the first English team to win three successive [[List of English football champions|English League titles]] in 1926 \u2013 a feat that only three other clubs ([[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]) have been able to match \u2013 and was achieved under the leadership of legendary manager and pioneer [[Herbert Chapman]] and his successor [[Cecil Potter]]. Huddersfield Town also won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1922 FA Cup Final|1922]] and the [[FA Community Shield|Charity Shield]] the same year and have been runners-up on four other occasions in the FA Cup. During the club's heyday in the 1920s and 1930s, they achieved a record attendance of 67,037 on 27 February 1932 during their FA Cup 6th round tie against Arsenal at [[Leeds Road]]. This attendance has been bettered by only 13 other clubs in the history of the Football League.\n\nAfter the [[Second World War]], the club began a gradual decline, losing its [[Football League First Division|First Division]] status in [[1951\u201352 Football League|1952]]. They came straight back up, but were relegated again three seasons later. Before the start of the [[1969\u201370 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|1969\u201370]] season, Huddersfield Town adopted the nickname \"''The Terriers''\". They won the Second Division title that season, spending the next two seasons in the top flight. After that they moved up and down through the lower three divisions for 45 years.\n\nIn 1998, the club attracted the attention of local businessman Barry Rubery and, after protracted takeover talks, he took over the running of the club, promising significant investment as the club sought [[Premier League|Premiership]] status. However, the club did not make it back to the top flight and fell two divisions. The club was sold by Rubery to David Taylor and under Taylor's ownership, slipped into administration. In the summer of 2003, the Terriers came out of administration under the new ownership of [[Ken Davy]].\n\nIn [[2010\u201311 Huddersfield Town A.F.C. season|2010\u201311]], Huddersfield went 43 games unbeaten, the second-highest in the league after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal's]] 49-match run of 2003\u201304.<ref>{{cite news |title=Huddersfield's record run ends after 43 matches |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-huddersfield/huddersfields-record-run-ends-after-43-matches-idUKTRE7AS0HS20111129 |website=Reuters |agency=Reuters |accessdate=19 December 2018|date=29 November 2011 }}</ref>\n\nOn 26 May 2012, following a penalty shoot-out in the [[2012 Football League One play-off Final]] victory over [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]], Huddersfield were promoted to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]]. The shoot-out was the longest contested in the current League One play-offs format.  After eleven rounds, the final score was 8\u20137 to Huddersfield, with the winning goal being scored by goalkeeper [[Alex Smithies]]. Huddersfield missed the first three penalties became the first team to win an football league play-off penalty shootout after doing so.\n\nIn November 2015, German-born ex-[[United States men's national soccer team|US international]] [[David Wagner (soccer)|David Wagner]] was appointed head coach, becoming the first person born outside the [[British Isles]] to manage the club in their 107-year history.<ref>{{cite news |title=David Wagner named new Huddersfield Town head coach |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/34733422 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018|date=5 November 2015 }}</ref>\n\nOn 29 May 2017, the club successfully earned promotion to the [[Premier League]] for the first time (since the rebranding in 1992) and the English top flight for the first time since [[1971\u201372 Football League|1972]], beating [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] 4\u20133 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw after extra time in the [[2017 EFL Championship play-off Final|Championship play-off Final]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Huddersfield Town 0 -0 Reading (4-3 Pens) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39995791 |website=BBC Sport |publisher=BBC |accessdate=19 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 9 May 2018, the club secured safety from relegation, earning another season in the Premier League, following a 1\u20131 draw against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and went on to place 16th.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Chelsea 1\u20131 Huddersfield Town | publisher = BBC Sport | date = 9 May 2018 | accessdate = 9 May 2018 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180508144829/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43971368 | archive-date = 8 May 2018 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref> However, the club suffered a very poor start to the 2018-19 season, taking just 2 wins in their first 22 matches.

It ranged from [[salmon pink]] to plain white or all-blue to white with blue [[yoke]]. Eventually in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1913\u201314|1913]], the club adopted the blue-and-white jersey that remains to this day.\n\nThe club badge is based on the [[coat of arms]] of Huddersfield. Town first used a badge on its shirts for the [[1920 FA Cup Final]] based on the local Huddersfield Corporation coat of arms. It appeared again with a [[Yorkshire Rose]] for the [[1922 FA Cup Final]] and again for the finals of [[1928 FA Cup Final|1928]], [[1930 FA Cup Final|1930]] and [[1938 FA Cup Final|1938]]. The club's main [[color|colours]] (blue and white) are evident throughout the badge both in the [[mantling]] and in the [[shield]], in the form of stripes. Two Yorkshire White Roses and [[Castle Hill, Huddersfield|Castle Hill]] form part of the history of the club and the area.\n\nTown stuck with the same principal design (blue and white stripes) until [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966\u201367|1966]], when [[Scotland|Scottish]] manager [[Tom Johnston (footballer)|Tom Johnston]] introduced all-blue shirts. The next badge did not feature until the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1966\u201367|1966\u201367 season]], when the simple \"HTFC\" adorned the Town's all-blue shirts.\n\nWhen the club adopted the nickname \"The Terriers\" for the [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1969\u201370|1969\u201370 season]], the blue and white stripes returned and with it a red terrier with the words \"The Terriers\", just in time for their promotion to the big time, the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]. The [[Yorkshire terrier|terrier]] sits on top of the crest with a [[ball]] on a blanket of blue and white stripes. The Terriers was introduced to the badge shortly after \"The Terriers\" was adopted as the nickname and [[mascot]] of the club.\n\nAfter relegation to the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], Town returned to all-blue shirts with the return of Tom Johnston in [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975\u201376|1975]]. This time they only lasted two seasons and the return of simply \"HTFC\" badge. This lasted from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1975\u201376|1975]]\u2013[[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1976\u201377|1977]]. Stripes returned from [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1977\u201378|the 1977\u201378 season]] and has been the club's home kit ever since. The red Terrier returned to the shirt for [[Huddersfield Town F.C. season 1978\u201379|the 1978\u201379 season]]. In 1980, Town adopted what remains their badge today based on the coat of arms of Huddersfield. This is both the club badge and playing shirt badge and is held in high esteem by Town fans.\n\nIn 2000, Town changed badge to a circular design, but that was never popular and following a change of board, returned to the heraldic-style badge. The badge was further redeveloped with a small but significant adaptation in February 2005. The club took the decision to remove \"A.F.C.\" from the text leaving only the wording 'Huddersfield Town'. The current board said that this was in keeping with the time and to make merchandise easier to produce and to make slicker looking promotional material.\n\nTo mark Town's promotion to the [[Premier League]] in 2017-18, the club adopted a Terriers logo to replace the historic crest on the shirts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/news/huddersfield-town-mascot-terry-terrier-13433906|title=Town mascot Terry the Terrier gets a makeover in time for Premier League debut|first=Tony|last=Earnshaw|date=5 August 2017|website=huddersfieldexaminer}}</ref>\n\nTo mark Town's relegation from the [[Premier League]] in 2019, the club agreed to have [[Paddy Power]] shirt sponsorship in a striking beauty queen style diagonal sash design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/htafc/status/1151401159011315718|title=#htafc's new home kit for the upcoming 2019/20 season has today been revealed!

Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as \"Hogarthian\".<ref>  According to Elizabeth Einberg, \"by the time he died in October 1764 he had left so indelible a mark on the history of British painting that the term 'Hogarthian' remains instantly comprehensible even today as a valid description of a wry, satirical perception of the human condition.\" ''Hogarth the Painter'', London: Tate Gallery, 1997, p. 17.</ref>\n\nHogarth was born in [[London]] to a lower-middle-class family. In his youth he took up an [[apprenticeship]] with an  [[engraver]], but did not complete the apprenticeship. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of outstanding debts, an event that is thought to have informed William's paintings and prints with a hard edge.<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth, vol. 1: The 'Modern Moral Subject', 1697\u20131732'' (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26\u201337.</ref>\n\nInfluenced by French and Italian painting and engraving,<ref>[[Frederick Antal]], ''Hogarth and His Place in European Art'' (London 1962); Robin Simon, ''Hogarth, France and British Art: The rise of the arts in eighteenth-century Britain'' (London 2007).</ref> Hogarth's works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual,<ref>Bernd W.

They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation. [[Charles Lamb]] deemed Hogarth's images to be books, filled with \"the teeming, fruitful, suggestive meaning of words. Other pictures we look at; his pictures we read.\"<ref>Lamb, Charles, The Works of Charles and Mary Lamb, E.V.

In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in [[Leicester Fields]], where he learned to engrave [[trade card]]s and similar products.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=6193 Ellis Gamble Biographical Details].

Black, Plymouth, 1894)</ref>\n\nYoung Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw.  Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking [[coffee house]] at [[St John's Gate]], was [[debtor prison|imprisoned for debt]] in the [[Fleet Prison]] for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment.<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1 (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26\u201337.</ref>\n\nHogarth became a member of the [[Rose and Crown Club]], with [[Peter Tillemans]], [[George Vertue]], [[Michael Dahl]], and other artists and connoisseurs.<ref>Coombs, Katherine, 'Lens [Laus] family (per. c. 1650\u20131779), artists' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n{{See also|List of works by William Hogarth}}\n\nBy April 1720, Hogarth was an [[engraver]] in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms, shop bills, and designing plates for booksellers.\n\nIn 1727 he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the ''Element of Earth''. Morris heard that he was \"an engraver, and no painter\", and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the [[Westminster Hall#Westminster Hall|Westminster Court]], where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728. In 1757 he was appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] to the King.<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 3 (New Brunswick 1993), pp. 213\u2013216.</ref>\n\n===Early works===\n[[File:HogarthWanstead.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''[[The Assembly at Wanstead House]]''. [[Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney|Earl Tylney]] and family in foreground]]\nEarly satirical works included an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows [[Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is \"Who'l Ride\". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the [[South Sea Company]], which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.<ref>See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.</ref>\n\nOther early works include ''The Lottery'' (1724); ''The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons'' (1724);  ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print ''Masquerades and Operas'' (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] of the Swiss impresario [[John James Heidegger]], the popular Italian [[Opera|opera singers]], [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]'s pantomimes at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and the exaggerated popularity of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the architect and painter [[William Kent]]. He continued that theme in 1727, with the ''Large Masquerade Ticket''. In 1726 Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings illustrating [[Samuel Butler (1612\u20131680)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''. \n[[File:William Hogarth - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self-Portrait'' by Hogarth, ca. 1735, [[Yale Center for British Art]].]] These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best book illustrations.\n\nIn the following years he turned his attention to the production of small \"[[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]]s\" (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from {{convert|12|to|15|in}} high). Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were ''The Fountaine Family'' (c.1730), ''The Assembly at Wanstead House'', ''The House of Commons examining Bambridge'', and several pictures of the chief actors in [[John Gay]]'s popular ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.<ref>Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1, pp. 172\u2013185, 206\u2013215.</ref> One of his real-life subjects was [[Sarah Malcolm]], whom he sketched two days before her execution.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/hogarth/hogarth-room-guide-room-8 Sarah Malcolm], The Hogarth Room, The Tate, retrieved 7 August 2014</ref>\n\nOne of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of [[John Dryden]]'s ''The Indian Emperor, or The Conquest of Mexico'' (1732\u20131735) at the home of [[John Conduitt]], master of the mint, in [[Hanover Square, London|St George's Street, Hanover Square]].<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 2 (New Brunswick 1992), pp. 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nHogarth's other works in the 1730s include ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'' (1733), ''Southwark Fair'' (1733), ''The Sleeping Congregation'' (1736), [[Before and After (Hogarth)|''Before'' and ''After'']] (1736), ''Scholars at a Lecture'' (1736), ''The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks)'' (1736), ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'' (1736), ''[[The Four Times of the Day]]'' (1738), and ''[[Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn]]'' (1738). He might also have printed ''Burlington Gate'' (1731), evoked by [[Alexander Pope]]'s Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.<ref>See Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', p. 35.</ref>\n\n===Moralizing art===\n\n====''Harlot's Progress'' and ''Rake's Progress''====\n[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem<ref>[[#JBN1833|J.

The original paintings of ''A Harlot's Progress'' were destroyed in the fire at [[Fonthill Abbey|Fonthill House]] in 1755; the oil paintings of ''A Rake's Progress'' (1733\u201334) are displayed in the gallery room at [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London, UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Rake's Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nWhen the success of ''A Harlot's Progress'' and ''A Rake's Progress'' resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734|Engravers' Copyright Act]] (known as 'Hogarth's Act'), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Verhoogt|first1=Robert|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-century Prints After Lawrence Alma-tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|date=2007|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9053569138|pages=15\u201316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=13 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n====''Marriage A-la-Mode''====\n[[Image:Marriage A-la-Mode 2, The T\u00eate \u00e0 T\u00eate - William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[Marriage \u00e0-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage \u00e0-la-mode]]'', ''[[Marriage \u00e0-la-mode: 2.

This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.\n\nMarital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire \u2013 a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey \u2013 of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] for murdering her husband.\n\n[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote: <blockquote>This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl ... The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counselor, who kills him, and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London), where the counselor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral: don\u2019t listen to evil silver-tongued counselors; don't marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money; don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband; don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.<ref>Thackeray, William Makepeace, ''The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century''.</ref></blockquote>\n{{Clear}}\n\n====''Industry and Idleness''====\n[[Image:William Hogarth - Industry and Idleness, Plate 1; The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms.png|thumb|right|''Industry and Idleness'' Plate 1, The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms]]\nIn the twelve prints of ''[[Industry and Idleness]]'' (1747)<ref>Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 168\u2013179.</ref> Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes [[Sheriff of London|Sheriff]] (plate 8), [[Alderman]] (plate 10), and finally the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins \"at play in the church yard\" (plate 3), holes up \"in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute\" after turning [[highwayman]] (plate 7) and \"executed at Tyburn\" (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the [[gallows]] by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, most from the [[Book of Proverbs]], such as for the first plate of \"Industry and Idleness, shown here, \"Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4 The hand of the diligent maketh rich.\"\n\n====''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane''====\n[[Image:GinLane.jpg|''[[Gin Lane]]''|thumb]]\n\nLater prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']] (1751).<ref>Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 185\u2013186.</ref> Hogarth engraved ''Beer Street'' to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage, English [[beer]], in contrast to ''Gin Lane'', in which the effects of drinking gin are shown \u2013 as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society.<ref>See Mark Hallett, ''The Spectacle of Difference'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), pp.198\u2013222.</ref> People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in ''Beer Street'', while in ''Gin Lane'' they are scrawny, lazy and careless.

In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled ''Reward of Cruelty'', the murderer is shown being dissected by scientists after his execution. The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 [[Act of Parliament]] allowing for the dissection of executed criminals who had been convicted for murder.\n\n===Portraits===\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Richard III, 1745]]\n[[File:Hogarth, William - Portrait of a Man - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a Man, 1741]]\n\nHogarth was also a popular [[portrait painter]].

He was seized and carried to the governor, where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several [[caricatures]] of the French; particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the ''Lion d'argent'', the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it. They were much diverted with his drawings, and dismissed him.</blockquote>\nBack home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the [[French people|Frenchmen]], as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a \"soldier's hand upon my shoulder\", running him in.<ref>[[#JBN1833|J. B.

Bentley. pp. 57\u201358.</ref>\n\n===Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects===\nHogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, [[tavern]]s, and public buildings, and sold in [[old master print|printshop]]s. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the [[ballad opera]], the [[bourgeois tragedy]], and especially, a new form of [[fiction]] called the [[novel]] with which authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: \"painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage\", as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.\n\nHe drew from the highly moralizing [[Protestant]] tradition of Dutch [[genre painting]], and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English [[broadsheet]] and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.\n\n===Parodic borrowings from Old Masters===\nWhen analysing the work of the artist as a whole, [[Ronald Paulson]] says, \"In ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', every single plate but one is based on [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]]'s images of the story of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] and the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].\" In other works, he parodies [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent [[God]] who intervenes in the lives of people and produces [[miracle]]s. Indeed, Hogarth was a [[Deist]], a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a \"comic history painter\", he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, \"beaten\" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s then-current ideal of the [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classical Greek]] male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, \"Who but a bigot, even to the [[antiques]], will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] doth but coarsely imitate.\"\n\n==Personal life==\n\nOn 23 March 1729 Hogarth married Jane Thornhill, daughter of artist Sir [[James Thornhill]].\n\nHogarth was initiated as a [[Freemason]] before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards' Lodge; the latter still possesses the 'Hogarth Jewel' which Hogarth designed for the Lodge's Master to wear.<ref>See references in [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner11.html this biography].</ref> Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth's work, most notably 'Night', the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''.\n\n[[File:Hogarth%27s_house,_Chiswick.jpg|thumb|William Hogarth's house in [[Chiswick]]]]\n\nHis main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in [[Chiswick]] in 1749, the house now known as [[Hogarth's House]] and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123103341/http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 January 2018|title=Hogarth\u2019s House {{!}} Hounslow.info|date=23 January 2018|access-date=3 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/031005/n031005_24.htm |title=Camden New Journal |author=Joel Taylor |work=camdennewjournal.co.uk |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>\nThe Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children.

He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth's influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.\n\nHogarth's paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, [[Gavin Gordon (composer)|Gavin Gordon]]'s 1935 ballet ''[[The Rake's Progress (ballet)|The Rake's Progress]]'', to choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]], was based directly on Hogarth's series of paintings of that title. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1951 [[opera]] ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', with libretto by [[W. H. Auden]], was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth's engravings also inspired the [[BBC radio]] play ''The Midnight House'' by Jonathan Hall, based on the [[M. R. James]] ghost story \"[[The Mezzotint]]\" and first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2006.\n\n[[Russell Banks]]' short story \"Indisposed\" is a fictional account of Hogarth's infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in [[Nick Dear]]'s play ''[[The Art of Success]]'', whilst he is played by [[Toby Jones]] in the 2006 television film ''[[A Harlot's Progress (film)|A Harlot's Progress]]''.\n\n[[Hogarth's House]] in [[Chiswick]], west London, is now a museum; the major [[road junction]] next to it is named the [[Hogarth Roundabout]]. In 2014 both Hogarth's House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hogarth's House |url=https://www.museumslondon.org/museum/114/hogarths-house |publisher=Museums London |accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Progress  06 Jun 2014 \u2014 07 Sep 2014  {{!}}  Exhibitions & Displays |url=https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/progress-2014/ |publisher=[[Foundling Museum]] |accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> \nIn 2019, [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], which owns both ''The Rake's Progress'' and ''[[Humours of an Election|The Humours of an Election]]'', held an exhibition which assembled all Hogarth's series of paintings, and his series of engravings, in one place for the first time.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=Hogarth: Place and Progress review \u2013 a heartbreaking epic of London squalor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/09/hogarth-place-and-progress-review-a-heartbreaking-epic-of-london-squalour |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n{{Clear}} <!-- DON*T REMOVE TECHNICAL -->\n;''Paintings''\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"188\" caption=\"William Hogarth's paintings\">\nFile:William Hogarth - Before - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Before and After (Hogarth)|''Before'']], 1731\nFile:William Hogarth - After - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Before and After (Hogarth)|''After'']], 1731\nFile:PortraitInigoJones.jpg|''Portrait of [[Inigo Jones]], English Architect''\nFile:Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox, 1729 by William Hogarth.jpg| ''The Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox'', 1729\nFile:William Hogarth 016.jpg|''[[The Beggar's Opera]] VI'', 1731, Tate Britain's version (22.5 x 30 ins.)\nFile:William Jones, the Mathematician.jpg|''William Jones, the Mathematician'', 1740\nFile:Hogarth coram.jpg|Hogarth's Portrait of Captain [[Thomas Coram]], 1740\nFile:Miss Mary Edwards - Hogarth 1742.jpg|''Miss Mary Edwards'' 1742\nFile:William Hogarth - The Shrimp Girl - WGA11467.jpg|''[[The Shrimp Girl]]'' 1740\u20131745\nFile:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' (also known as, ''O the [[Roast Beef]] of [[Merry England|Old England]]''), 1749\nFile:William Hogarth 007.jpg|''[[March of the Guards to Finchley]]'' (1750), a satirical depiction of troops mustered to defend London from the [[1745 Jacobite rebellion]]\nFile:William Hogarth by William Hogarth.jpg|''[[Hogarth Painting the Comic Muse]]''.

Knowledge of his work is so pervasive that satirical political illustrations in this style are often referred to as \"Hogarthian\".<ref>  According to Elizabeth Einberg, \"by the time he died in October 1764 he had left so indelible a mark on the history of British painting that the term 'Hogarthian' remains instantly comprehensible even today as a valid description of a wry, satirical perception of the human condition.\" ''Hogarth the Painter'', London: Tate Gallery, 1997, p. 17.</ref>\n\nHogarth was born in [[London]] to a lower-middle-class family. In his youth he took up an [[apprenticeship]] with an  [[engraver]], but did not complete the apprenticeship. His father underwent periods of mixed fortune, and was at one time imprisoned in lieu of outstanding debts, an event that is thought to have informed William's paintings and prints with a hard edge.<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth, vol. 1: The 'Modern Moral Subject', 1697\u20131732'' (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26\u201337.</ref>\n\nInfluenced by French and Italian painting and engraving,<ref>[[Frederick Antal]], ''Hogarth and His Place in European Art'' (London 1962); Robin Simon, ''Hogarth, France and British Art: The rise of the arts in eighteenth-century Britain'' (London 2007).</ref> Hogarth's works are mostly satirical caricatures, sometimes bawdily sexual,<ref>Bernd W.

They became widely popular and mass-produced via prints in his lifetime, and he was by far the most significant English artist of his generation. [[Charles Lamb]] deemed Hogarth's images to be books, filled with \"the teeming, fruitful, suggestive meaning of words. Other pictures we look at; his pictures we read.\"<ref>Lamb, Charles, The Works of Charles and Mary Lamb, E.V.

In his youth he was apprenticed to the engraver Ellis Gamble in [[Leicester Fields]], where he learned to engrave [[trade card]]s and similar products.<ref>[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=6193 Ellis Gamble Biographical Details].

Black, Plymouth, 1894)</ref>\n\nYoung Hogarth also took a lively interest in the street life of the metropolis and the London fairs, and amused himself by sketching the characters he saw.  Around the same time, his father, who had opened an unsuccessful Latin-speaking [[coffee house]] at [[St John's Gate]], was [[debtor prison|imprisoned for debt]] in the [[Fleet Prison]] for five years. Hogarth never spoke of his father's imprisonment.<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1 (New Brunswick 1991), pp. 26\u201337.</ref>\n\nHogarth became a member of the [[Rose and Crown Club]], with [[Peter Tillemans]], [[George Vertue]], [[Michael Dahl]], and other artists and connoisseurs.<ref>Coombs, Katherine, 'Lens [Laus] family (per. c. 1650\u20131779), artists' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004)</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n{{See also|List of works by William Hogarth}}\n\nBy April 1720, Hogarth was an [[engraver]] in his own right, at first engraving coats of arms, shop bills, and designing plates for booksellers.\n\nIn 1727 he was hired by Joshua Morris, a tapestry worker, to prepare a design for the ''Element of Earth''. Morris heard that he was \"an engraver, and no painter\", and consequently declined the work when completed. Hogarth accordingly sued him for the money in the [[Westminster Hall#Westminster Hall|Westminster Court]], where the case was decided in his favour on 28 May 1728. In 1757 he was appointed [[Serjeant Painter]] to the King.<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 3 (New Brunswick 1993), pp. 213\u2013216.</ref>\n\n===Early works===\n[[File:HogarthWanstead.jpg|thumb|280px|left|''[[The Assembly at Wanstead House]]''. [[Richard Child, 1st Earl Tylney|Earl Tylney]] and family in foreground]]\nEarly satirical works included an ''[[Emblematical Print on the South Sea Scheme]]'' (c.1721, published 1724), about the disastrous stock market crash of 1720 known as the [[South Sea Bubble]], in which many English people lost a great deal of money. In the bottom left corner, he shows [[Protestant]], [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], and [[Jewish]] figures gambling, while in the middle there is a huge machine, like a merry-go-round, which people are boarding. At the top is a goat, written below which is \"Who'l Ride\". The people are scattered around the picture with a sense of disorder, while the progress of the well dressed people towards the ride in the middle shows the foolishness of the crowd in buying stock in the [[South Sea Company]], which spent more time issuing stock than anything else.<ref>See Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'' (3rd edition, London 1989), no. 43.</ref>\n\nOther early works include ''The Lottery'' (1724); ''The Mystery of Masonry brought to Light by the Gormagons'' (1724);  ''[[A Just View of the British Stage]]'' (1724); some book illustrations; and the small print ''Masquerades and Operas'' (1724). The latter is a satire on contemporary follies, such as the [[masquerade ball|masquerades]] of the Swiss impresario [[John James Heidegger]], the popular Italian [[Opera|opera singers]], [[John Rich (producer)|John Rich]]'s pantomimes at [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]], and the exaggerated popularity of [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]]'s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the architect and painter [[William Kent]]. He continued that theme in 1727, with the ''Large Masquerade Ticket''. In 1726 Hogarth prepared twelve large engravings illustrating [[Samuel Butler (1612\u20131680)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Hudibras]]''. \n[[File:William Hogarth - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self-Portrait'' by Hogarth, ca. 1735, [[Yale Center for British Art]].]] These he himself valued highly, and they are among his best book illustrations.\n\nIn the following years he turned his attention to the production of small \"[[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]]s\" (i.e., groups in oil of full-length portraits from {{convert|12|to|15|in}} high). Among his efforts in oil between 1728 and 1732 were ''The Fountaine Family'' (c.1730), ''The Assembly at Wanstead House'', ''The House of Commons examining Bambridge'', and several pictures of the chief actors in [[John Gay]]'s popular ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]''.<ref>Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 1, pp. 172\u2013185, 206\u2013215.</ref> One of his real-life subjects was [[Sarah Malcolm]], whom he sketched two days before her execution.<ref>[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/hogarth/hogarth-room-guide-room-8 Sarah Malcolm], The Hogarth Room, The Tate, retrieved 7 August 2014</ref>\n\nOne of Hogarth's masterpieces of this period is the depiction of an amateur performance by children of [[John Dryden]]'s ''The Indian Emperor, or The Conquest of Mexico'' (1732\u20131735) at the home of [[John Conduitt]], master of the mint, in [[Hanover Square, London|St George's Street, Hanover Square]].<ref>Ronald Paulson, ''Hogarth'', vol. 2 (New Brunswick 1992), pp. 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nHogarth's other works in the 1730s include ''A Midnight Modern Conversation'' (1733), ''Southwark Fair'' (1733), ''The Sleeping Congregation'' (1736), [[Before and After (Hogarth)|''Before'' and ''After'']] (1736), ''Scholars at a Lecture'' (1736), ''The Company of Undertakers (Consultation of Quacks)'' (1736), ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'' (1736), ''[[The Four Times of the Day]]'' (1738), and ''[[Strolling Actresses Dressing in a Barn]]'' (1738). He might also have printed ''Burlington Gate'' (1731), evoked by [[Alexander Pope]]'s Epistle to [[Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington|Lord Burlington]], and defending Lord Chandos, who is therein satirized. This print gave great offence, and was suppressed. However, modern authorities such as Ronald Paulson no longer attribute it to Hogarth.<ref>See Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', p. 35.</ref>\n\n===Moralizing art===\n\n====''Harlot's Progress'' and ''Rake's Progress''====\n[[File:The Rake's Progress 8.jpg|thumb|''[[A Rake's Progress]]'', Plate 8, 1735, and retouched by Hogarth in 1763 by adding the Britannia emblem<ref>[[#JBN1833|J.

The original paintings of ''A Harlot's Progress'' were destroyed in the fire at [[Fonthill Abbey|Fonthill House]] in 1755; the oil paintings of ''A Rake's Progress'' (1733\u201334) are displayed in the gallery room at [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], London, UK.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Rake's Progress|url=http://www.soane.org/collections_legacy/the_soane_hogarths/rakes_progress|work=Sir John Soane's Museum|publisher=Sir John Soane's Museum|accessdate=13 December 2013|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nWhen the success of ''A Harlot's Progress'' and ''A Rake's Progress'' resulted in numerous pirated reproductions by unscrupulous printsellers, Hogarth lobbied in parliament for greater legal control over the reproduction of his and other artists' work. The result was the [[Engraving Copyright Act 1734|Engravers' Copyright Act]] (known as 'Hogarth's Act'), which became law on 25 June 1735 and was the first copyright law to deal with visual works as well as the first to recognize the authorial rights of an individual artist.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Verhoogt|first1=Robert|title=Art in Reproduction: Nineteenth-century Prints After Lawrence Alma-tadema, Jozef Israels and Ary Scheffer|date=2007|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=9053569138|pages=15\u201316|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jSDnRo7YrWwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=13 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n====''Marriage A-la-Mode''====\n[[Image:Marriage A-la-Mode 2, The T\u00eate \u00e0 T\u00eate - William Hogarth.jpg|thumb|''[[Marriage \u00e0-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage \u00e0-la-mode]]'', ''[[Marriage \u00e0-la-mode: 2.

This moralistic warning shows the miserable tragedy of an ill-considered marriage for money. This is regarded by many as his finest project and may be among his best-planned story serials.\n\nMarital ethics were the topic of much debate in 18th-century Britain. The many marriages of convenience and their attendant unhappiness came in for particular criticism, with a variety of authors taking the view that love was a much sounder basis for marriage. Hogarth here painted a satire \u2013 a genre that by definition has a moral point to convey \u2013 of a conventional marriage within the English upper class. All the paintings were engraved and the series achieved wide circulation in print form. The series, which is set in a Classical interior, shows the story of the fashionable marriage of Viscount Squanderfield, the son of bankrupt Earl Squander, to the daughter of a wealthy but miserly city merchant, starting with the signing of a marriage contract at the Earl's mansion and ending with the murder of the son by his wife's lover and the suicide of the daughter after her lover is hanged at [[Tyburn, London|Tyburn]] for murdering her husband.\n\n[[William Makepeace Thackeray]] wrote: <blockquote>This famous set of pictures contains the most important and highly wrought of the Hogarth comedies. The care and method with which the moral grounds of these pictures are laid is as remarkable as the wit and skill of the observing and dexterous artist. He has to describe the negotiations for a marriage pending between the daughter of a rich citizen Alderman and young Lord Viscount Squanderfield, the dissipated son of a gouty old Earl ... The dismal end is known. My lord draws upon the counselor, who kills him, and is apprehended while endeavouring to escape. My lady goes back perforce to the Alderman of the City, and faints upon reading Counsellor Silvertongue's dying speech at Tyburn (place of execution in old London), where the counselor has been 'executed for sending his lordship out of the world. Moral: don\u2019t listen to evil silver-tongued counselors; don't marry a man for his rank, or a woman for her money; don't frequent foolish auctions and masquerade balls unknown to your husband; don't have wicked companions abroad and neglect your wife, otherwise you will be run through the body, and ruin will ensue, and disgrace, and Tyburn.<ref>Thackeray, William Makepeace, ''The English Humourists of the Eighteenth Century''.</ref></blockquote>\n{{Clear}}\n\n====''Industry and Idleness''====\n[[Image:William Hogarth - Industry and Idleness, Plate 1; The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms.png|thumb|right|''Industry and Idleness'' Plate 1, The Fellow 'Prentices at their Looms]]\nIn the twelve prints of ''[[Industry and Idleness]]'' (1747)<ref>Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 168\u2013179.</ref> Hogarth shows the progression in the lives of two apprentices, one of whom is dedicated and hard working, while the other, who is idle, commits crime and is eventually executed. This shows the work ethic of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] England, where those who worked hard were rewarded, such as the industrious apprentice who becomes [[Sheriff of London|Sheriff]] (plate 8), [[Alderman]] (plate 10), and finally the [[Sheriffs of the City of London|Lord Mayor]] of London in the last plate in the series. The idle apprentice, who begins \"at play in the church yard\" (plate 3), holes up \"in a Garrett with a Common Prostitute\" after turning [[highwayman]] (plate 7) and \"executed at Tyburn\" (plate 11). The idle apprentice is sent to the [[gallows]] by the industrious apprentice himself. For each plate, there is at least one passage from the Bible at the bottom, most from the [[Book of Proverbs]], such as for the first plate of \"Industry and Idleness, shown here, \"Proverbs Ch:10 Ver:4 The hand of the diligent maketh rich.\"\n\n====''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane''====\n[[Image:GinLane.jpg|''[[Gin Lane]]''|thumb]]\n\nLater prints of significance include his pictorial warning of the consequences of alcoholism in [[Beer Street and Gin Lane|''Beer Street'' and ''Gin Lane'']] (1751).<ref>Paulson, ''Hogarth's Graphic Works'', 3rd edition, nos. 185\u2013186.</ref> Hogarth engraved ''Beer Street'' to show a happy city drinking the 'good' beverage, English [[beer]], in contrast to ''Gin Lane'', in which the effects of drinking gin are shown \u2013 as a more potent liquor, gin caused more problems for society.<ref>See Mark Hallett, ''The Spectacle of Difference'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), pp.198\u2013222.</ref> People are shown as healthy, happy and prosperous in ''Beer Street'', while in ''Gin Lane'' they are scrawny, lazy and careless.

In the first picture there are scenes of torture of dogs, cats and other animals. The second shows one of the characters from the first painting, Tom Nero, has now become a coach driver, and his cruelty to his horse has caused it to break its leg. In the third painting Tom is shown as a murderer, with the woman he killed lying on the ground, while in the fourth, titled ''Reward of Cruelty'', the murderer is shown being dissected by scientists after his execution. The method of execution, and the dissection, reflect the 1752 [[Act of Parliament]] allowing for the dissection of executed criminals who had been convicted for murder.\n\n===Portraits===\n[[File:William Hogarth - David Garrick as Richard III - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[David Garrick]] as Richard III, 1745]]\n[[File:Hogarth, William - Portrait of a Man - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a Man, 1741]]\n\nHogarth was also a popular [[portrait painter]].

He was seized and carried to the governor, where he was forced to prove his vocation by producing several [[caricatures]] of the French; particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the ''Lion d'argent'', the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it. They were much diverted with his drawings, and dismissed him.</blockquote>\nBack home, he immediately executed a painting of the subject in which he unkindly represented his enemies, the [[French people|Frenchmen]], as cringing, emaciated and superstitious people, while an enormous sirloin of beef arrives, destined for the English inn as a symbol of British prosperity and superiority. He claimed to have painted himself into the picture in the left corner sketching the gate, with a \"soldier's hand upon my shoulder\", running him in.<ref>[[#JBN1833|J. B.

Bentley. pp. 57\u201358.</ref>\n\n===Painter and engraver of modern moral subjects===\nHogarth lived in an age when artwork became increasingly commercialized, being viewed in shop windows, [[tavern]]s, and public buildings, and sold in [[old master print|printshop]]s. Old hierarchies broke down, and new forms began to flourish: the [[ballad opera]], the [[bourgeois tragedy]], and especially, a new form of [[fiction]] called the [[novel]] with which authors such as [[Henry Fielding]] had great success. Therefore, by that time, Hogarth hit on a new idea: \"painting and engraving modern moral subjects ... to treat my subjects as a dramatic writer; my picture was my stage\", as he himself remarked in his manuscript notes.\n\nHe drew from the highly moralizing [[Protestant]] tradition of Dutch [[genre painting]], and the very vigorous satirical traditions of the English [[broadsheet]] and other types of popular print. In England the fine arts had little comedy in them before Hogarth. His prints were expensive, and remained so until early 19th-century reprints brought them to a wider audience.\n\n===Parodic borrowings from Old Masters===\nWhen analysing the work of the artist as a whole, [[Ronald Paulson]] says, \"In ''[[A Harlot's Progress]]'', every single plate but one is based on [[Albrecht D\u00fcrer|D\u00fcrer]]'s images of the story of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin]] and the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]].\" In other works, he parodies [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|Last Supper]]. According to Paulson, Hogarth is subverting the religious establishment and the orthodox belief in an immanent [[God]] who intervenes in the lives of people and produces [[miracle]]s. Indeed, Hogarth was a [[Deist]], a believer in a God who created the universe but takes no direct hand in the lives of his creations. Thus, as a \"comic history painter\", he often poked fun at the old-fashioned, \"beaten\" subjects of religious art in his paintings and prints. Hogarth also rejected [[Anthony Ashley Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]]'s then-current ideal of the [[Art in ancient Greece#Classical|classical Greek]] male in favour of the living, breathing female. He said, \"Who but a bigot, even to the [[antiques]], will say that he has not seen faces and necks, hands and arms in living women, that even the Grecian [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]] doth but coarsely imitate.\"\n\n==Personal life==\n\nOn 23 March 1729 Hogarth married Jane Thornhill, daughter of artist Sir [[James Thornhill]].\n\nHogarth was initiated as a [[Freemason]] before 1728 in the Lodge at the Hand and Apple Tree Tavern, Little Queen Street, and later belonged to the Carrier Stone Lodge and the Grand Stewards' Lodge; the latter still possesses the 'Hogarth Jewel' which Hogarth designed for the Lodge's Master to wear.<ref>See references in [http://www.freemasons-freemasonry.com/beresiner11.html this biography].</ref> Today the original is in storage and a replica is worn by the Master of the Lodge. Freemasonry was a theme in some of Hogarth's work, most notably 'Night', the fourth in the quartet of paintings (later released as engravings) collectively entitled the ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''.\n\n[[File:Hogarth%27s_house,_Chiswick.jpg|thumb|William Hogarth's house in [[Chiswick]]]]\n\nHis main home was in Leicester Square (then known as Leicester Fields), but he bought a country retreat in [[Chiswick]] in 1749, the house now known as [[Hogarth's House]] and preserved as a museum, and spent time there for the rest of his life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180123103341/http://www.hounslow.info/arts-culture/historic-houses-museums/hogarth-house/|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 January 2018|title=Hogarth\u2019s House {{!}} Hounslow.info|date=23 January 2018|access-date=3 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.camdennewjournal.co.uk/031005/n031005_24.htm |title=Camden New Journal |author=Joel Taylor |work=camdennewjournal.co.uk |date=11 March 2005 |accessdate=21 May 2013}}</ref>\nThe Hogarths had no children, although they fostered foundling children.

He also influenced many caricaturists of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. Hogarth's influence lives on today as artists continue to draw inspiration from his work.\n\nHogarth's paintings and prints have provided the subject matter for several other works. For example, [[Gavin Gordon (composer)|Gavin Gordon]]'s 1935 ballet ''[[The Rake's Progress (ballet)|The Rake's Progress]]'', to choreography by [[Ninette de Valois]], was based directly on Hogarth's series of paintings of that title. [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1951 [[opera]] ''[[The Rake's Progress]]'', with libretto by [[W. H. Auden]], was less literally inspired by the same series. Hogarth's engravings also inspired the [[BBC radio]] play ''The Midnight House'' by Jonathan Hall, based on the [[M. R. James]] ghost story \"[[The Mezzotint]]\" and first broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in 2006.\n\n[[Russell Banks]]' short story \"Indisposed\" is a fictional account of Hogarth's infidelity as told from the viewpoint of his wife, Jane. Hogarth was the lead character in [[Nick Dear]]'s play ''[[The Art of Success]]'', whilst he is played by [[Toby Jones]] in the 2006 television film ''[[A Harlot's Progress (film)|A Harlot's Progress]]''.\n\n[[Hogarth's House]] in [[Chiswick]], west London, is now a museum; the major [[road junction]] next to it is named the [[Hogarth Roundabout]]. In 2014 both Hogarth's House and the Foundling Museum held special exhibitions to mark the 250th anniversary of his death.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hogarth's House |url=https://www.museumslondon.org/museum/114/hogarths-house |publisher=Museums London |accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Progress  06 Jun 2014 \u2014 07 Sep 2014  {{!}}  Exhibitions & Displays |url=https://foundlingmuseum.org.uk/events/progress-2014/ |publisher=[[Foundling Museum]] |accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref> \nIn 2019, [[Sir John Soane's Museum]], which owns both ''The Rake's Progress'' and ''[[Humours of an Election|The Humours of an Election]]'', held an exhibition which assembled all Hogarth's series of paintings, and his series of engravings, in one place for the first time.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jones |first1=Jonathan |title=Hogarth: Place and Progress review \u2013 a heartbreaking epic of London squalor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/oct/09/hogarth-place-and-progress-review-a-heartbreaking-epic-of-london-squalour |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\n{{Clear}} <!-- DON*T REMOVE TECHNICAL -->\n;''Paintings''\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"188\" caption=\"William Hogarth's paintings\">\nFile:William Hogarth - Before - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Before and After (Hogarth)|''Before'']], 1731\nFile:William Hogarth - After - Google Art Project.jpg|[[Before and After (Hogarth)|''After'']], 1731\nFile:PortraitInigoJones.jpg|''Portrait of [[Inigo Jones]], English Architect''\nFile:Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox, 1729 by William Hogarth.jpg| ''The Wedding of Stephen Beckingham and Mary Cox'', 1729\nFile:William Hogarth 016.jpg|''[[The Beggar's Opera]] VI'', 1731, Tate Britain's version (22.5 x 30 ins.)\nFile:William Jones, the Mathematician.jpg|''William Jones, the Mathematician'', 1740\nFile:Hogarth coram.jpg|Hogarth's Portrait of Captain [[Thomas Coram]], 1740\nFile:Miss Mary Edwards - Hogarth 1742.jpg|''Miss Mary Edwards'' 1742\nFile:William Hogarth - The Shrimp Girl - WGA11467.jpg|''[[The Shrimp Girl]]'' 1740\u20131745\nFile:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England ('The Gate of Calais') - Google Art Project.jpg|''[[The Gate of Calais]]'' (also known as, ''O the [[Roast Beef]] of [[Merry England|Old England]]''), 1749\nFile:William Hogarth 007.jpg|''[[March of the Guards to Finchley]]'' (1750), a satirical depiction of troops mustered to defend London from the [[1745 Jacobite rebellion]]\nFile:William Hogarth by William Hogarth.jpg|''[[Hogarth Painting the Comic Muse]]''.

Because many of the early franchisees were already in the restaurant business when joining Big Boy, \"Big Boy\" was added to the franchisee name just as the Big Boy hamburger was added to the franchisee's menu. In this sense it is confusing when referring to a chain, as each named franchisee was itself a chain and Big Boy could be considered a chain of chains. People tend to know Big Boy not simply as Big Boy but as the franchise from where they lived such as Bob's Big Boy in California, Shoney's Big Boy in the south or Frisch's Big Boy in much of Ohio, Marc's Big Boy in the Upper Midwest, among the many others.\n\nEach regional franchisee typically operated a central commissary which prepared or processed foods and sauces to be shipped fresh to their restaurants.<ref name=\"Advertisement April 1956\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15088408/new_bobs_1_900_colorado_glendale/ | title=New 'Bob's' Opens Tuesday: California's Fanciest Hamburger Joint newest 'Home of the Big Boy' | author=Advertisement | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=April 15, 1956 | page=G8 | via=Newspapers.com | quote=His original capital was $300...}} {{free access}} ''Note: Shows image of new McAllister designed drive-in, describes Commissary, employee Pension Plan</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/behind-the-scenes-tour-of-frischs-commissary-provides-tasty-preview-of-chains-founders-day|title=Behind-the-scenes tour of Frisch's Commissary provides tasty preview of chain's Founder's Day|last=Cunningham|first=Libby|date=April 25, 2013|newspaper=WCPO TV-9|access-date=February 10, 2017|work=|language=en-US|quote=That sense of pride fills the Frisch's Commissary, where workers prepare everything from pie crusts to sandwich spices and fresh hamburgers that will be shipped out to Frisch's 93 restaurants in Columbus, Dayton, Louisville, Lexington and of course, Cincinnati.|via=}}</ref><ref>{{cite court | litigants =Elias Bros.

Most adopted a common graphic design of [[menu]]s and promotional items, offered by Big Boy but personalized to the franchise. Stock plans of restaurant designs were provided by Los Angeles architects [[Armet and Davis]] or Chicago architectural designer Robert O. Burton, and modified as needed.\n\nIn the 1960s, Big Boy and other drive-in restaurants could not compete with the spreading fast food restaurants such as [[McDonald's]] and [[Burger King]].

Thus persons of modest assets could become Big Boy operators. It was the profits from these operations which allowed not only additional drive-ins, but operators to build modern restaurants with large pleasant dining rooms. Many of the early successful franchisees would probably not have assets (converted to present value) sufficient to join Big Boy today.\n\nBy 1979, there were more than a thousand Big Boy restaurants in the U.S. and Canada, and about 20 franchisees. Shoney's, Elias Brothers and Frisch's\u2014charter franchisees\u2014controlled the vast majority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/Pugwm/familynews.html |title=[Big Boy Progress Image at] Janies's Big Boy Webpage: Big Boy Family Newsletter |last1=Glassett |first1=Janie |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719175955/http://members.aol.com/Pugwm/familynews.html |archivedate=July 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> These mega franchisees paid practically no fees, e.g., Frisch paid $1 per year for its core four state territory. After Bob's, the four original franchisees (in order) were Frisch's, Eat'n Park, Shoney's (originally called \"Parkette\") and Elias Brothers, all clustered near the state of Ohio. All, including Bob's, remain in operation today, albeit Elias Brothers is simply known as Big Boy, and Eat'n Park and Shoney's dropped Big Boy affiliation in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBig Boy developed named franchisees in several ways. Very quickly the Big Boy name and even the Big Boy character were being widely used without permission. Bob Wian, needing Big Boy restaurants operating in multiple states to maintain national (U.S.) trademark protection, offered very generous [[franchise agreement]]s to Frisch's, Eat'n Park and Parkette (Shoney's). In 1952, Wian instituted a formal franchise process and Elias Brothers became the first such \"official\" franchisee paying Wian 1% of sales. Bob Wian also settled trademark infringements allowing the rogue operator to become a licensed franchisee, such as [[#McDowells|McDowell's Big Boy]] in North Dakota.<ref name=\"mcdowellsuit\" /> Franchisees were permitted to subfranchise; these early subfranchisees often used their own name and operated independently: Frisch's licensed [[#Azars|Azar's]], and Manners; Shoney's licensed [[#Adlers|Adler's]], [[#Arnolds|Arnold's]], [[#Beckers|Becker's]], Elby's, [[#Lendys|Lendy's]], [[#Shaps|Shap's]], [[#Tunes|Tune's]], and [[#Yodas|Yoda's]].<ref name=\"ShoneysFranchisees\" /><ref name=\"ShoneysMenu1959\" /> (An eastern Pennsylvania Elby's franchisee briefly operated as [[#Franklins|Franklin's Big Boy]] before dropping Big Boy.) \n\nAcquisitions and mergers also occurred. In the early 1970s, Frisch's acquired [[#Kips|Kip's Big Boy]]; JB's acquired [[#Vips|Vip's]], [[#Kebos|Kebo's]], [[#Leos|Leo's]] and [[#Buds|Bud's]] which were rebranded JB's. Shoney's acquired the Missouri territory previously assigned to [[Totes|Tote's]]. After buying Big Boy, Elias Brothers bought Elby's and [[#TJs|TJ's]]. Elby's was unique in leaving and rejoining the Big Boy system. When Marriott purchased Big Boy (Wian Enterprises) in 1967, this included Bob's Big Boy. The name \"Bob's\" would be used by all Marriott owned Big Boys and became common in parts of the eastern U.S. and elsewhere, far away from Bob's historic territory.\n\nFrisch's now owns the \"Big Boy\" name in a defined four-state region, and Azar's and Bob's are licensed by Frisch's Big Boy and Big Boy Restaurant Group, respectively.

Because many of the early franchisees were already in the restaurant business when joining Big Boy, \"Big Boy\" was added to the franchisee name just as the Big Boy hamburger was added to the franchisee's menu. In this sense it is confusing when referring to a chain, as each named franchisee was itself a chain and Big Boy could be considered a chain of chains. People tend to know Big Boy not simply as Big Boy but as the franchise from where they lived such as Bob's Big Boy in California, Shoney's Big Boy in the south or Frisch's Big Boy in much of Ohio, Marc's Big Boy in the Upper Midwest, among the many others.\n\nEach regional franchisee typically operated a central commissary which prepared or processed foods and sauces to be shipped fresh to their restaurants.<ref name=\"Advertisement April 1956\">{{cite news | url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/15088408/new_bobs_1_900_colorado_glendale/ | title=New 'Bob's' Opens Tuesday: California's Fanciest Hamburger Joint newest 'Home of the Big Boy' | author=Advertisement | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=April 15, 1956 | page=G8 | via=Newspapers.com | quote=His original capital was $300...}} {{free access}} ''Note: Shows image of new McAllister designed drive-in, describes Commissary, employee Pension Plan</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/behind-the-scenes-tour-of-frischs-commissary-provides-tasty-preview-of-chains-founders-day|title=Behind-the-scenes tour of Frisch's Commissary provides tasty preview of chain's Founder's Day|last=Cunningham|first=Libby|date=April 25, 2013|newspaper=WCPO TV-9|access-date=February 10, 2017|work=|language=en-US|quote=That sense of pride fills the Frisch's Commissary, where workers prepare everything from pie crusts to sandwich spices and fresh hamburgers that will be shipped out to Frisch's 93 restaurants in Columbus, Dayton, Louisville, Lexington and of course, Cincinnati.|via=}}</ref><ref>{{cite court | litigants =Elias Bros.

Most adopted a common graphic design of [[menu]]s and promotional items, offered by Big Boy but personalized to the franchise.

Burton, and modified as needed.\n\nIn the 1960s, Big Boy and other drive-in restaurants could not compete with the spreading fast food restaurants such as [[McDonald's]] and [[Burger King]].

Thus persons of modest assets could become Big Boy operators. It was the profits from these operations which allowed not only additional drive-ins, but operators to build modern restaurants with large pleasant dining rooms. Many of the early successful franchisees would probably not have assets (converted to present value) sufficient to join Big Boy today.\n\nBy 1979, there were more than a thousand Big Boy restaurants in the U.S. and Canada, and about 20 franchisees. Shoney's, Elias Brothers and Frisch's\u2014charter franchisees\u2014controlled the vast majority.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/Pugwm/familynews.html |title=[Big Boy Progress Image at] Janies's Big Boy Webpage: Big Boy Family Newsletter |last1=Glassett |first1=Janie |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719175955/http://members.aol.com/Pugwm/familynews.html |archivedate=July 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |accessdate=February 11, 2013}}</ref> These mega franchisees paid practically no fees, e.g., Frisch paid $1 per year for its core four state territory. After Bob's, the four original franchisees (in order) were Frisch's, Eat'n Park, Shoney's (originally called \"Parkette\") and Elias Brothers, all clustered near the state of Ohio. All, including Bob's, remain in operation today, albeit Elias Brothers is simply known as Big Boy, and Eat'n Park and Shoney's dropped Big Boy affiliation in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nBig Boy developed named franchisees in several ways. Very quickly the Big Boy name and even the Big Boy character were being widely used without permission. Bob Wian, needing Big Boy restaurants operating in multiple states to maintain national (U.S.) trademark protection, offered very generous [[franchise agreement]]s to Frisch's, Eat'n Park and Parkette (Shoney's). In 1952, Wian instituted a formal franchise process and Elias Brothers became the first such \"official\" franchisee paying Wian 1% of sales. Bob Wian also settled trademark infringements allowing the rogue operator to become a licensed franchisee, such as [[#McDowells|McDowell's Big Boy]] in North Dakota.<ref name=\"mcdowellsuit\" /> Franchisees were permitted to subfranchise; these early subfranchisees often used their own name and operated independently: Frisch's licensed [[#Azars|Azar's]], and Manners; Shoney's licensed [[#Adlers|Adler's]], [[#Arnolds|Arnold's]], [[#Beckers|Becker's]], Elby's, [[#Lendys|Lendy's]], [[#Shaps|Shap's]], [[#Tunes|Tune's]], and [[#Yodas|Yoda's]].<ref name=\"ShoneysFranchisees\" /><ref name=\"ShoneysMenu1959\" /> (An eastern Pennsylvania Elby's franchisee briefly operated as [[#Franklins|Franklin's Big Boy]] before dropping Big Boy.) \n\nAcquisitions and mergers also occurred. In the early 1970s, Frisch's acquired [[#Kips|Kip's Big Boy]]; JB's acquired [[#Vips|Vip's]], [[#Kebos|Kebo's]], [[#Leos|Leo's]] and [[#Buds|Bud's]] which were rebranded JB's. Shoney's acquired the Missouri territory previously assigned to [[Totes|Tote's]]. After buying Big Boy, Elias Brothers bought Elby's and [[#TJs|TJ's]]. Elby's was unique in leaving and rejoining the Big Boy system. When Marriott purchased Big Boy (Wian Enterprises) in 1967, this included Bob's Big Boy.
