Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the [[Middle Ages]] it referred to the right to ''pull up'' fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\n\nThe municipality had a total population of {{Swiss populations|CH-ZG|1711}} in {{Swiss populations date|CH-ZG}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-ZG}} The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stumpf-Chronik-Zug.png|thumb|View of Zug before 1547]]\n[[File:Zug - Unterstadt - Zugersee IMG 2606.JPG|thumb|''Unterstadt'' (lower town) as seen from [[Lake Zug]] harbour]]\n[[File:Zug - Oberstadt IMG 2611.jpg|thumb|''Oberstadt'' (upper town) in the [[Altstadt]]]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.<ref>[http://www.zug-tourismus.ch/en/welcome.cfm Zug Tourism]</ref>\n\nThe [[IG Culture Zug society]] currently has some 200 members.\n\n===Heritage sites===\nThere are a number of Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]] in Zug. These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the [[parish church]] of St. Michael. One archeological site, the ''Sumpf'' a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the ''Burg'' (Castle museum), ''Kunsthaus'' (Art museum) and ''Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; ''B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug'' (Citizen's archive of Zug), ''Staatsarchiv Zug'' (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the ''Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG'' (Landis & Gyr AG company archives).

Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the [[Middle Ages]] it referred to the right to ''pull up'' fishing nets and hence to the right to fish.\n\nThe municipality had a total population of {{Swiss populations|CH-ZG|1711}} in {{Swiss populations date|CH-ZG}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-ZG}} The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard [[Swiss Standard German|German]], but the main spoken language is the local variant of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] [[Swiss German (linguistics)|Swiss German]] dialect.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stumpf-Chronik-Zug.png|thumb|View of Zug before 1547]]\n[[File:Zug - Unterstadt - Zugersee IMG 2606.JPG|thumb|''Unterstadt'' (lower town) as seen from [[Lake Zug]] harbour]]\n[[File:Zug - Oberstadt IMG 2611.jpg|thumb|''Oberstadt'' (upper town) in the [[Altstadt]]]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as [[pile dwellings]], on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the [[Neolithic]] period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the \u00c4geri valley. The well-known, historically-researched lake-shore village '' 'Sumpf' '' (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.\n\n===Kyburg foundation===\nIn around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes immigrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with \u2018- ikon\u2019 endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space{{why|date=March 2018}}. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. \nThe first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King [[Ludwig the German]] giving the farm ''Chama'' (Cham) to the Z\u00fcrich Fraum\u00fcnster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.\n\nIn the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of [[County of Kyburg|Kyburg]]. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an \"[[oppidum]]\" in 1242 and a \"[[castrum]]\" in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolph of Habsburg]] from Anna, the heiress of [[House of Kyburg|Kyburg]] and wife of Eberhard, head of the [[cadet branch|cadet line]] of [[Habsburg]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}  Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg [[bailiff]]. The ''Aeusser Amt'' or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own ''[[Landsgemeinde]]n'' but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the [[Habsburg]] district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.\n\n===Joining the Swiss Confederation===\nOn 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the ''Aeusser Amt'' entered the [[Swiss Confederation]], the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of [[Schwyz]], and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Wenceslaus, Holy Roman Emperor|Wenceslaus]] exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their ''[[landammann]]'' was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]].{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe alliance of the four forest cantons of [[Uri (canton)|Uri]], [[Schwyz (canton)|Schwyz]], [[Unterwalden]] and [[Lucerne]] with the city of Z\u00fcrich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Z\u00fcrich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of [[Z\u00fcrich]]. Z\u00fcrich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Z\u00fcrich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Z\u00fcrich's saw this \u2018Zugerbund\u2019 (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.\n\nSimultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks ([[Walchwil]], [[Cham (Switzerland)|Cham]], Gangolfswil [Risch] [[H\u00fcnenberg]] and [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]], and Oberr\u00fcti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself - with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (\u2018free\u2019) municipalities, [[\u00c4geri]], [[Menzingen]] (with [[Neuheim]]) and [[Baar, Switzerland|Baar]]. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.\n\n===Growth of the town===\nIn 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against [[Leopold III of Austria (Habsburg)|Leopold III of Austria]] and shared in the victory of [[Battle of Sempach|Sempach]], as well as in the various [[Aargau|Argovian]] (1415) and [[Thurgau|Thurgovian]] (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d'Ossola. Between 1379 ([[Walchwil]]) and 1477 ([[Cham, Switzerland|Cham]]), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nIn 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold - the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period \u2013 something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.\n\n===The Reformation and Early Modern Era===\nDuring the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the ''Christliche Vereinigung'' of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.{{sfn|Coolidge|1911|p=1048}}\n\nThe period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldst\u00e4tten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today's federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.\n\n===Industrialization and internationalization===\nUntil well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unter\u00e4geri. This was followed by the two companies in Neu\u00e4geri and Baar.\nIn 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with [[Nestl\u00e9]]. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company [[Landis+Gyr]], founded in 1896, and now owned by [[Toshiba]]. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading center, aided by its proximity to Z\u00fcrich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, \u2018a compass of the global economy\u2019.\n\n===Today===\nZug is a [[tax haven|low tax region]], and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The town's best known agricultural product is [[Kirsch]].\n\nOn 27 September 2001, an angry, unstable gunman, [[Friedrich Leibacher]], shot and killed 15 people including himself in the cantonal parliament of Zug. The event became known as the [[Zug Massacre]].<ref name=bericht>[http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf Untersuchungsrichterlicher Schlu\u00dfbericht] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006042522/http://serien-killer.com/downloads/schlussberichtattentat.pdf |date=6 October 2011 }} (German)</ref>\n\n[[File:Sunset over Zug.jpg|thumb|center|750px|Night view of Zug and its [[Lake Zug|lake]]]]\n\n==Geography==\n===Topography===\n[[File:City of zug oldtown aerial view \u8001\u9547.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Zug]]\nZug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of {{Swiss area|1711|mi=on}}.{{Swiss area data|1711|QUELLE}}  Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested.

Towards its northerly end, a monument marks the spot where a part of the shore slipped into the lake in 1887.\n\nThe older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.\n\nThe most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to [[Oswald of Bernicia|St Oswald]], king of [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]] (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.\n\nThe business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls' school and several other educational establishments.\n\nThe ''Museum of Prehistory Zug'' houses an important collection of archaeological remains, especially from the late [[Bronze Age]] ([[urnfield culture]]) settlement of [[Zug-Sumpf]]. Many of [[Catharine II of Russia]]'s relatives descended from Zug and became known as the [[Volga German]]s.\n\n===Museums===\nThere are three museums in the town: the Museum of Prehistory, which displays archaeological finds from Canton Zug; the castle houses the Museum of Cultural History of the town and Canton Zug, and the Zug Art Gallery attracts visitors with its exhibitions.<ref>[http://www.museenzug.ch Museums of Zug]</ref>\nSeveral municipalities also have their own local museum. The Casino Theatre in Zug and the Zug ''Burgbachkeller'', along with the ''Chollerhalle'' cultural center, are the most famous establishments. The event centers in Baar, Cham and Rotkreuz and the Zug youth scene (Galvanik, Podium Industrie 45) enrich the range of cultural events.\n\nZug is surrounded with mountains, rivers and lakes including the mountains Zugerberg and the Walchwilerberg Oberallmig, the H\u00f6hronen and the river Sihl. The Choller nature reserve is also near Lake Zug.\n\nSights within the town include the late Gothic church of St. Wolfgang, near H\u00fchnenberg, or St. Oswald in Zug, the old town of Zug with the Town Hall and the [[Zytturm, Zug|Zytturm]] (clock tower), the [[Huwiler Tower]], the Zurlaubenhof, feudal estate of the family Zurlauben, on the outskirts of the town.\n\nZug's culture also includes the famous Zuger cherry liqueur cake. Local specialties, in addition to the cherry and the cherry liqueur cake, include the Zug \u2018R\u00f6tel\u2019, a fine lake charfish, found on many menus.<ref>[http://www.zug-tourismus.ch/en/welcome.cfm Zug Tourism]</ref>\n\nThe [[IG Culture Zug society]] currently has some 200 members.\n\n===Heritage sites===\nThere are a number of Swiss [[Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance|heritage sites of national significance]] in Zug. These include two libraries, the Library of the former Capuchin monastery and the library of the [[parish church]] of St. Michael. One archeological site, the ''Sumpf'' a late Bronze Age lake shore settlement, is included, as are three museums; the ''Burg'' (Castle museum), ''Kunsthaus'' (Art museum) and ''Museum f\u00fcr Urgeschichte'' (Museum for ancient history). There are three archives that are included in the list; ''B\u00fcrgerarchiv Zug'' (Citizen's archive of Zug), ''Staatsarchiv Zug'' (State/Canton of Zug archive) and the ''Unternehmensarchiv der Landis & Gyr AG'' (Landis & Gyr AG company archives). The rest of the sites are the Catholic Church of St. Oswald with [[Charnel house]], the [[Seminary]] of St. Michael, the town walls and several buildings in the old town of Zug.<ref>[http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501142322/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/de/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar.html |date=1 May 2009 }} 21.11.2008 version, {{in lang|de}} accessed 22-Sep-2009</ref>\n\nThe prehistoric settlements at Oterswil/Insel Eielen, Riedmatt and Sumpf are part of the [[Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]] a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site|World Heritage Site]].<ref name=UNESCO>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1363/ UNESCO World Heritage Site - Prehistoric Pile dwellings around the Alps]</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Zug education system is based on equal abilities and includes compulsory primary and secondary school, with optional secondary education and vocational training. Two thirds of young people go into vocational education, connected to an apprenticeship, joining the professional world after the 9th grade of secondary school. The international business community of Zug offers many and varied apprenticeships along with the Zug technical and industrial college, GIBZ, and the business college, KBZ, provide the academic knowledge and skills.\n\nZug has a long tradition of education. Private schools, like the Montana Institute Zug, on Zugerberg, or the Dr. Pfister Institute AG, Ober\u00e4geri supplement the range available. In addition, there are the three former non-state teacher training colleges in Menzingen, Holy Cross in Cham and St. Michael in Zug.\n\n===Tertiary education===\nCanton Zug has two high schools: the Canton High School in the town of Zug, and the Cantonal School in Menzingen. Also at higher secondary level, is the Vocational School Zug and the Business Studies School, incorporated within the Canton School. Zug is one of the university cantons, with, on the one hand, the University of Teacher Training, PHZ Zug, on the other, a polytechnic for financial services.\n\nThere are also six technical colleges (for business, computer science, engineering design, naturopathy and homeopathy, child education, and rescue services).\n\n===International Schools===\nThe range of educational institutions is a key factor for location in the globalized world of competition, especially for foreign employees, the so-called \u2018Expats\u2019. The four international schools have been developed accordingly, and report a high student intake. 1300 children from more than 50 countries attend the [[International School of Zug and Luzern]] alone, at its two campuses in H\u00fcnenberg and Baar.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Bahnhof Zug.jpg|thumb|The railway station]]\n[[File:MS Zug Schiffsstation Bahnhof Einsteigen.jpg|thumb|''MS Zug'']]\nZug acts as an important transportation node.\n\nAn extensive bus network within the town and canton is provided by [[Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe|ZVB Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe]].<ref name=ZVB>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvb.ch |title=Zugerland Verkehrsbetriebe |publisher=Zug Town |accessdate=2015-12-26}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Swiss Federal Railways]] link at [[Zug railway station]] for Cham - [[Horgen]] - [[Z\u00fcrich]], [[Steinhausen, Switzerland|Steinhausen]] - [[Affoltern am Albis]], [[Arth-Goldau]] - [[Gotthard Rail Tunnel|St. Gotthard]] - [[Ticino]] and Italy, and [[Risch-Rotkreuz|Rotkreuz]] - [[Luzern]].

Late in the match, Kanellis climbed on the ring apron to break up a pinfall. ACH confronted Kanellis, but managed to duck out of the way of a Bennett [[Professional wrestling attacks#Spear|spear]], which hit her instead. After a missed [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#450\u00b0 splash|450\u00b0 splash]] by ACH, Bennett hit him with another spear, before going for his finishing submission hold, ''[[Professional wrestling holds#Anaconda vise|Go Back to Japan]]''. ACH, however, slipped out of the hold and climbed the ropes, but was crotched, when Bennett pushed the referee of the match to the ring ropes. Bennett then dropped ACH down to the mat with a ''[[Powerbomb#Inverted powerbomb|Dominator]]'', before pinning him for the win.

In the finish of the match, Strong went for his finishing maneuver, the ''[[Roderick Strong#In wrestling|End of Heartache]]'', which Alexander countered into a [[Pin (professional wrestling)#Small package|small package]] for a three count and a win.

Tanahashi, however, managed to put his foot on the ring rope to force the referee to break up the hold. Jado then hit Tanahashi with the ''[[DDT (professional wrestling)#Elevated DDT|Green Killer]]'', but missed a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Punt|punt]] and was hit with a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Palm strike|palm strike]] by Liger.

The match was built around Taven trying to get his hands on Martini. However, when he finally did manage to grab Martini, Lethal saved his manager by hitting Taven with a ''[[Jay Lethal#In wrestling|Lethal Injection]]'' to score the pinfall and retain his title. Post-match, ROH [[Professional wrestling authority figures|matchmaker]] [[Nigel McGuinness]], who had been doing commentary for the past two matches, left his position to reprimand the referee of the match for allowing Martini's interference.<ref name=ResultsPWI/><ref name=ResultsPWT/><ref name=ResultsWON/><ref name=ResultsWV/>\n\n===Main event matches===\nThe final NJPW match of the pay-per-view featured Bullet Club's A.J.

In the finish of the match, Bullet Club separated Gedo from his partner with Anderson hitting him with his finishing maneuver, the ''[[Cutter (professional wrestling)#Jumping cutter|Gun Stun]]''. Styles then dropped Gedo with the ''[[DDT (professional wrestling)#Single underhook DDT|Bloody Sunday]]'', before planting him with the ''[[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]]''. While Anderson held Okada back, Styles pinned Gedo for the win. After the match, Michael Elgin, who had been doing commentary for the match, entered the ring to confront Styles, building up their match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at War of the Worlds.

Cole then hit Steen with a superkick and a [[Suplex#German suplex|German suplex]], followed by the ''[[Suplex#X-Plex|Florida Key]]'', but Steen kicked out of the resulting pinfall attempt. Cole then went for another one of his finishing maneuvers, the ''[[Adam Cole#In wrestling|Panama Sunrise]]'', but it was countered into a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|sharpshooter]]. Cole managed to force the referee to break the hold after reaching the ring ropes. Steen then stopped Cole on the top turnbuckle, before dropping him onto it with a [[brainbuster]], a move commonly associated with his former tag team partner [[El Generico]]. Cole, however, managed to kick out of the following pinfall attempt.

ACH, however, slipped out of the hold and climbed the ropes, but was crotched, when Bennett pushed the referee of the match to the ring ropes.

The match was built around Taven trying to get his hands on Martini. However, when he finally did manage to grab Martini, Lethal saved his manager by hitting Taven with a ''[[Jay Lethal#In wrestling|Lethal Injection]]'' to score the pinfall and retain his title.

Styles then dropped Gedo with the ''[[DDT (professional wrestling)#Single underhook DDT|Bloody Sunday]]'', before planting him with the ''[[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]]''. While Anderson held Okada back, Styles pinned Gedo for the win. After the match, Michael Elgin, who had been doing commentary for the match, entered the ring to confront Styles, building up their match for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at War of the Worlds.

Cole then went for another one of his finishing maneuvers, the ''[[Adam Cole#In wrestling|Panama Sunrise]]'', but it was countered into a [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|sharpshooter]].
