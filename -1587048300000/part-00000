These [[Textile manufacturing|textile mill]]s, run by the Sanfords, Shuttleworths and others, employed thousands of new immigrants, made superior floor covering products, and generated tremendous wealth for their shareholders.  They were the building blocks of what is now known as [[Mohawk Industries]] of [[Calhoun, Georgia]].  This wealth generation and concentration in a small city of upstate New York resulted in the [[Fulton County, New York|Fulton]]-Montgomery County region having the largest number of [[millionaire]]s on a per capita basis in the U.S. during the early 1900s.\n\nWytrwal was one of the founding members and initial investors in forming the Amsterdam Federal Savings and Loan Association, a privately owned bank also known as the \"Polish Bank\" on Church Street.

Roosevelt]] in implementing various [[economic relief]] programs during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and was known as the \"Polish Mayor\" of Amsterdam.\n\nIn one of those assignments, he served as the Chairman, Montgomery County of the National Recovery Act (NRA).  The NRA was a component of the New Deal's National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933.  Wytrwal was well known for enjoying \"welfare peanut butter\" - he bought many jars from destitute people in the Mohawk Valley, those that could not find employment and were too proud to ask for a handout.\n\n==Early life==\nWytrwal was born on September 12, 1882 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Prussia, and attended public schools there through the age of 14.  In 1896, he sought out adventure and opportunity, immigrated to the US through [[Liberty Island]], initially settling in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].  He stayed there for six months and then moved north to Amsterdam, New York.\n\n==Family and personal life==\nWytrwal was married twice \u2014 first to Ms. Mamie Brudzdowski on October 26, 1904, who died on February 26, 1906.  He was remarried on May 24, 1907 to Ms. Josephine Bruzdowski.  He had a total of 7 children \u2014 one son from his first marriage, and another son and five daughters in his second marriage.\n\nWytrwal died on January 21, 1970 at the age of 87 in Amsterdam, NY.  He is survived by 5 generations of offspring.\n\nNotable descendants of Michael Wytrwal include the late Dr. Raymond Wytrwal of St. Johnsville, NY; former New York Lieutenant Governor [[Mary Anne Krupsak]], an attorney and entrepreneur, who was one of the leading pioneers of women's rights in the 1970s; and Army Colonel [[Edmund Luzine]], a veteran of operations in former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, finance professor and global emerging markets investment banker.\n\nWytrwal Industries, LLC \u2014 is a consulting and advisory firm focused on finance, economics, natural resources, and the global emerging markets with offices in upstate New York and Miami-Dade County.

The NRA was a component of the New Deal's National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933.  Wytrwal was well known for enjoying \"welfare peanut butter\" - he bought many jars from destitute people in the Mohawk Valley, those that could not find employment and were too proud to ask for a handout.\n\n==Early life==\nWytrwal was born on September 12, 1882 in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Prussia, and attended public schools there through the age of 14.  In 1896, he sought out adventure and opportunity, immigrated to the US through [[Liberty Island]], initially settling in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]].  He stayed there for six months and then moved north to Amsterdam, New York.\n\n==Family and personal life==\nWytrwal was married twice \u2014 first to Ms. Mamie Brudzdowski on October 26, 1904, who died on February 26, 1906.  He was remarried on May 24, 1907 to Ms. Josephine Bruzdowski.  He had a total of 7 children \u2014 one son from his first marriage, and another son and five daughters in his second marriage.\n\nWytrwal died on January 21, 1970 at the age of 87 in Amsterdam, NY.  He is survived by 5 generations of offspring.\n\nNotable descendants of Michael Wytrwal include the late Dr. Raymond Wytrwal of St. Johnsville, NY; former New York Lieutenant Governor [[Mary Anne Krupsak]], an attorney and entrepreneur, who was one of the leading pioneers of women's rights in the 1970s; and Army Colonel [[Edmund Luzine]], a veteran of operations in former Yugoslavia, Afghanistan and Iraq, finance professor and global emerging markets investment banker.\n\nWytrwal Industries, LLC \u2014 is a consulting and advisory firm focused on finance, economics, natural resources, and the global emerging markets with offices in upstate New York and Miami-Dade County.  It is managed by Ed Luzine, Michael Wytrwal's great-grandson.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n;Sources\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Green, Nelson (ed.) (1925).

Even prior to learning he was the Avatar, Aang distinguished himself by becoming one of the youngest Airbending Masters in history by inventing a new technique. As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples.<ref name=\"The Storm\">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref><ref name=\"The Southern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|airdate=2005-02-25|season=1|number=3|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan, Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among [[iceberg]]s, where he remained suspended for a century.

While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered [[middle age]] in his 50s, the strain of this exertion increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into [[Korra]] of the Southern Water Tribe. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist [[Zaheer]]) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.\n\n====Book One: Air====\n[[File:Legend of Korra Aang.png|thumb|Avatar Aang's spirit with [[Korra]] in ''The Legend of Korra''.]]\nIn the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, [[Amon (The Legend of Korra)|Amon]] and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.\n\n====Book Two: Spirits====\nThe sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her.

The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style; each of these styles philosophies and set movements corresponds to a specific \"bending arts\".<ref name=\"Kisu\">{{cite web | title=Kisu - Filmography by TV Series | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457467/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_msc_1#tt0417299 |publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\nThe creators made bending a natural extension of consistent limitations and rules of the world. Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending. The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies. The Water Tribes were a naval superpower: their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates. Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation. The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master [[metallurgy]] with their bending of fire and lightning.\n\nAt the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend them with ease since he was a young child. Through the teaching Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom. Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favor's airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his [[pacifism]] principles.\n\n*'''Airbending''': the martial art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a ''Southern Temple Style'' based on an \"[[Neijia|internal]]\" [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] called [[Baguazhang]]. Aang is the only person in [[living memory]] to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, [[Tenzin]], who with the aid of [[Korra]], would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Due to the genocide of his people, all other \"styles of airbending arts\" have been forever lost to history. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders.<ref name=\"NickAv\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/| title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site| accessdate = 2006-12-02| publisher = Nick.com}}</ref> Airbending represents the element of freedom,<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\">Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director).

Airbending involves \"smooth coiling and uncoiling actions\"; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the \"intangibility and explosive power of wind\". These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow\u2014allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury\u2014a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people. Airbending lacks \"finishing moves\" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents.\n*'''Waterbending''': the martial art Katara teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[Chinese martial arts]] techniques of \"[[Neijia|internal style]]\" [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Jeet Kune Do]]. When Aang traveled north, he learned ''Northern Tribe Yin-style''. During the [[Legend of Korra]], Katara is the only Master of \"[[Yang-style t'ai chi ch'uan|Southern Tribe Yang-style]]\", forced to reconstruct the style from surviving manuscripts; all other masters were killed, their collective knowledge [[Book burning|confiscated or destroyed]] by the Fire Nation.<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Water, page 31 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\">http://www.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=1038</ref><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\">{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|airdate=April 7, 2006|season=2|number=3|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep23}}</ref> Waterbending represents the element of change - a shapeshifter constantly changing forms -<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\"/> and is categorized as the most adaptive or pliable of the \"four bending arts\".

Despite these advantages, Waterbending is almost entirely dependent on inertia; it is essential for practitioners to not be rigid, but to be fluid and able to adapt to any situation.\n*'''Earthbending''': the martial art Toph teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Hung Ga|H\u00f3ng Qu\u00e1n]] and [[Southern Praying Mantis|Chu Gar N\u00e1n P\u00e0i T\u00e1ngl\u00e1ng]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully). Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n*'''Firebending''': the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Changquan]], [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolinquan]], [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu|L\u00f3ng X\u00edng M\u00f3 Qi\u00e1o]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\"/><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles \"regressed\" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered ''Dancing Dragon Style'' from the last surviving dragons.\n*'''Energybending''': Aang learned energybending from his desire not to kill. He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n===The Avatar State===\n[[File:Avatar reincarnations.png|thumb|right|alt=The Avatars standing in line, including Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen, in that order.|The Avatars (from right to left): Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen, and other previous Avatars.]]\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.\n\nHis most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout that of his predecessors. In addition, he also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on. The form is activated by Aang being in a predicament that he will either not be able to combat with his current skills or when his life is in mortal danger. While speaking in the Avatar State, Aang's voice becomes in-sync with that of Raava's as a testament to their connection. His weaknesses in the state is that he is vulnerable, and if killed, then this would cause the Avatar to cease being reincarnated.\n\n==Critical reception==\nAang was received exceptionally by critics and fans.

As a result of Fire Lord Sozin's increasingly hostile attitude towards the other nations, the senior monks decided to reveal Aang's nature as the Avatar four years before the traditional age (Avatars are usually told of their status once they turn 16) and relocate him to one of the other Air Temples.<ref name=\"The Storm\">{{cite episode|title=The Storm|airdate=2005-06-03|season=1|number=12|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref><ref name=\"The Southern Air Temple\">{{cite episode|title=The Southern Air Temple|airdate=2005-02-25|season=1|number=3|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan, Writer: Michael Dante DiMartino|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}</ref> Learning that he was to be taken from Gyatso caused Aang to flee the monastery on his flying bison, Appa, before being caught by a storm; the life-or-death conditions triggered the Avatar State, encasing the young Avatar and his bison in an air-pocket among [[iceberg]]s, where he remained suspended for a century.

While he did not feel the effects for many years, after he entered [[middle age]] in his 50s, the strain of this exertion increasingly weighed upon his body. Ultimately, it resulted in Aang dying at the relatively young biological age of 66, in 153 AG. Aang was survived by his wife, Katara, and his three children, but he did not live to see his grandchildren, all of whom would become powerful Airbenders. Prior to his death, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus with finding and guiding the new Avatar after him. When Aang died, the Avatar spirit reincarnated into [[Korra]] of the Southern Water Tribe. Aang intended for the Order to simply guide and guard Korra, but several mishaps in the aftermath of Aang's death (including a kidnapping attempt by the anarchist [[Zaheer]]) and the still-fragile state of relations between the now-Five Nations resulted in Katara and Tenzin sequestering Korra in a compound at the South Pole, bringing teachers to her instead of allowing her to seek out her own.\n\n====Book One: Air====\n[[File:Legend of Korra Aang.png|thumb|Avatar Aang's spirit with [[Korra]] in ''The Legend of Korra''.]]\nIn the sequel series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit occasionally serves as the spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra glimpses of his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, [[Amon (The Legend of Korra)|Amon]] and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself to listen to her past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.\n\n====Book Two: Spirits====\nThe sequel series' second season reveals that Avatar Aang apparently treated Tenzin as his favorite child, due to his son's Airbender status; Kya and Bumi mentioned to Tenzin that Aang always took Tenzin on vacations with him, but never them. Aang's Air Acolytes also were unaware that Aang had two other children besides Tenzin. Tenzin himself insists that Aang loved all his children equally, but that Aang took more precedence in raising him since Tenzin would have to take care of future generations of airbenders. Aang himself later appears, along with Roku, Kyoshi and Kuruk, before Korra in a vision and encourages her to learn the origins of Wan (the first Avatar) and Raava. Aang, or possibly a vision of him, later appears in the Spirit World, encouraging Tenzin to move past the enormous legacy of being Aang's son and find his own path. Korra's connection to Aang and the other preceding Avatars is severed when Vaatu extracts and subsequently kills Raava, the divine Avatar Spirit entity within her. Even though Raava is reborn and fused again with Korra, she discovers, to her dismay, that her spiritual connection to Aang and all past Avatars is gone forever.\n\n====Book Three: Change====\nWhen Zaheer gave an ultimatum: Surrender to him or lose the new airbenders, Korra mediated into the spirit realm, she expressed her wish to call upon Aang's spirit and ask his advice in saving the new Air Nomads. Iroh's spirit assured her that, even though Aang was no longer able to guide her, she could ask one of Aang's closest friends: [[Zuko|Lord Zuko]].\n\n===Appearances in other media===\n====Games====\nAang's character appeared in the ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender Trading Card Game]]'' on a multitude of cards.<ref name=\"Trading Cards\"/><ref name=\"Trading Cards 2\"/> He appeared in the [[Avatar: The Last Airbender (video game)|''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' video game]] as one of the four [[Player character|playable characters]].<ref name=\"AvatarVideoGame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|title=Avatar: The Last Airbender Video Game|accessdate=2008-03-22|work=Nick.com|publisher=Nickelodeon|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206045806/http://www.nick.com/games/avatar-games|archive-date=2013-02-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two sequels were made: ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 The Burning Earth]]'',<ref name=\"The Burning Earth\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|title=IGN.com: Avatar: The Burning Earth|accessdate=2008-03-13|publisher=IGN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925154305/http://wii.ign.com/objects/905/905219.html|archive-date=2008-09-25|url-status=dead}}</ref> followed by ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender&nbsp;\u2013 Into the Inferno]]''.\n\nAang also appeared in ''Escape from the Spirit World'', an online video game that can be found on Nickelodeon's official website.

The series' creators consulted a professional martial artist in the design of the show's fighting style; each of these styles philosophies and set movements corresponds to a specific \"bending arts\".<ref name=\"Kisu\">{{cite web | title=Kisu - Filmography by TV Series | url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0457467/filmoseries?ref_=nm_flmg_msc_1#tt0417299 |publisher=IMDb | accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>\n\nThe creators made bending a natural extension of consistent limitations and rules of the world. Everything in Avatar's world, whether it be clothing, culture or infrastructure, is influenced by bending. The City of Omashu uses a complex system of gravity and earthbending to transport supplies. The Water Tribes were a naval superpower: their buildings are made of ice and used waterbending as mechanisms for their walls and gates. Airbenders built temples atop high mountains and cliffs that could only be easily reached by Airbending and they have a hermetic ideology to reflect this isolation. The Fire Nation were the first to industrialize due to their ability to generate power and master [[metallurgy]] with their bending of fire and lightning.\n\nAt the start of the series, Aang is initially only proficient in air, having been able to bend them with ease since he was a young child. Through the teaching Katara and Zuko, he gradually learns waterbending and firebending; but struggles with Toph's teachings of earthbending due to its rigid nature conflicting with his desire for freedom. Aang utilizes all elements equally, but heavily favor's airbending for crowd control and non-lethal purposes, in accordance with his [[pacifism]] principles.\n\n*'''Airbending''': the martial art Aang primarily uses in the entire franchise, is a ''Southern Temple Style'' based on an \"[[Neijia|internal]]\" [[Chinese martial arts|Chinese martial art]] called [[Baguazhang]]. Aang is the only person in [[living memory]] to have mastered this form of airbending, and would later pass down this knowledge to his son, [[Tenzin]], who with the aid of [[Korra]], would prove instrumental in the reconstruction and preservation of Air Nomad oral and [[intangible cultural heritage]]. Due to the genocide of his people, all other \"styles of airbending arts\" have been forever lost to history. This fighting style focuses on circular movements, and does not have many finishing moves; traits meant to represent the unpredictability of air and the peaceful character of Airbenders.<ref name=\"NickAv\">{{cite web| url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar/| title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site| accessdate = 2006-12-02| publisher = Nick.com}}</ref> Airbending represents the element of freedom,<ref name=\"Ehasz, Aaron 2006\">Ehasz, Aaron (writer) & Spaulding, Ethan (director).

Airbending involves \"smooth coiling and uncoiling actions\"; dynamic footwork, throws, and open-handed techniques; and swift, evasive maneuvers designed to evoke the \"intangibility and explosive power of wind\". These techniques are intended to increase the difficulty for opponents to attack directly or land a lethal blow\u2014allowing airbenders to defend themselves while also protecting their attacker from injury\u2014a pacifist-philosophy that is prevalent among the Air Nomad people. Airbending lacks \"finishing moves\" or effective methods for permanently disabling foes, a weakness frequently exploited by opponents.\n*'''Waterbending''': the martial art Katara teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[Chinese martial arts]] techniques of \"[[Neijia|internal style]]\" [[T'ai chi ch'uan]] and [[Jeet Kune Do]]. When Aang traveled north, he learned ''Northern Tribe Yin-style''.

Earthbending utilizes ''[[Jing (Chinese medicine)|neutral jing]]'', which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to act decisively. Earthbending involves enduring attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself, emphasizes \"heavily rooted stances and strong blows that evoke the mass and power of earth\", and demands precise [[Footwork (martial arts)|stepping footwork]] to maintain constant contact with the ground. Earthbending parallels [[Five Animals]] movements (such as the tiger's hard blows and the crane's affinity to landing gracefully). Earthbending is at its strongest when the feet or hand are in direct contact with the ground, enabling earthbenders to transfer their kinetic energies into their bending for fast and powerful moves. This reliance on direct contact with the earth is a literal [[Achilles' heel]]; separating earthbenders from any contact with the earth renders them ineffective.\n*'''Firebending''': the martial art Zuko teaches Aang in the series, is based on [[chinese martial arts]] techniques of [[Changquan]], [[Shaolin Kung Fu|Shaolinquan]], [[Southern Dragon Kung Fu|L\u00f3ng X\u00edng M\u00f3 Qi\u00e1o]] and [[Xing Yi Quan]].<ref>The Lost Scrolls: Fire, page 159 of The Lost Scrolls Collection.</ref><ref name=\"kungfumagazine.com\"/><ref name=\"NickAv\"/><ref name=\"Return To Omashu\"/> A century of warfare have corrupted the Fire Nation's rich culture, and with it, their firebending-styles \"regressed\" into militarized format based on hatred and raw aggression; Zuko and Aang sought to learn firebending in its purest and most harmonious form, and rediscovered ''Dancing Dragon Style'' from the last surviving dragons.\n*'''Energybending''': Aang learned energybending from his desire not to kill. He is able to use energybending to connect with his inner spirit and gain cosmic energy from the universe.\n\n===The Avatar State===\n[[File:Avatar reincarnations.png|thumb|right|alt=The Avatars standing in line, including Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, and Yangchen, in that order.|The Avatars (from right to left): Aang, Roku, Kyoshi, Kuruk, Yangchen, and other previous Avatars.]]\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang is as a bridge between \"[[Nature|Material World]]\" and the \"[[Spirit world (Spiritualism)|Spirit World]]\", the plane of existence where the universe's disembodied spirits dwell. His spirituality training progressed swiftly, granting visions and access to the various memories from his past lives.\n\nHis most powerful ability is the [[Avatar State]], which allows him to access bending techniques he would not have learned during his own lifetime but throughout that of his predecessors. In addition, he also receives a massive boost in raw power, enabling him to easily overcome any opponent that tries to fight him head on. The form is activated by Aang being in a predicament that he will either not be able to combat with his current skills or when his life is in mortal danger.

From that time on, until the script was supplanted by an early version of Coptic (about the 3rd and 4th centuries AD), the system remained virtually unchanged. Even the number of signs used remained constant at about 700 for more than 2,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hieroglyph {{!}} writing character |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/265009/hieroglyph |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=5 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Egyptian===\n\nMiddle Egyptian was spoken for about 700 years, beginning around 2000 BC.<ref name=\"l5\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=5}}</ref> As the classical variant of Egyptian, Middle Egyptian is the best-documented variety of the language, and has attracted the most attention by far from [[Egyptology]].

The first grammar of Middle Egyptian was published by [[Adolf Erman]] in 1894, surpassed in 1927 by [[Alan Gardiner]]'s  work. Middle Egyptian has been well-understood since then, although certain points of the [[Egyptian verb|verb]]al inflection remained open to revision until the mid-20th century, notably due to the contributions of [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]].<ref>Polotsky, H.

This transition was taking place in the later period of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] (known as the [[Amarna Period]]). \nMiddle Egyptian was retained as a literary [[standard language]], and in this usage survived until the Christianisation of [[Roman Egypt]] in the 4th century.\n\n===Late Egyptian===\n[[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], appearing around 1350 BC, is represented by a large body of religious and secular [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], comprising such examples as the ''[[Story of Wenamun]]'', the love poems of the Chester\u2013Beatty I  papyrus, and the ''[[Instruction of Any]]''. [[Sebayt|Instructions]] became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom, which took the form of advice on proper behavior.

It survived into the medieval period, but by the 16th century was dwindling rapidly due to the persecution of Coptic Christians under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that.  Coptic survives as the liturgical language of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]] and, still, as the mother tongue of several families in [[Cairo]].<ref>https://wwww.dailynewssegypt.com/2005/12/10/coptic-languages-last-survivors/</ref>\n==Dialects==\nPre-Coptic Egyptian does not show great dialectal differences in the written language because of the centralised nature of Egyptian society.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"l8\" /> However, a letter from c. 1200&nbsp;BC attests to difference in speech as the writer complains that the language of a correspondent is as unintelligible as the speech of a northern Egyptian to a southerner.<ref name=\"a2\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=2}}</ref><ref name=\"l8\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=8}}</ref>\n\nRecently, some evidence of internal dialects has been found in pairs of similar words in Egyptian that, based on similarities with later dialects of Coptic, may be derived from northern and southern dialects of Egyptian.<ref name=\"s99\">{{Harvcoltxt|Satzinger|2008|p=10}}</ref> Written Coptic has five major dialects, which differ mainly in graphic conventions, most notably the southern Saidic dialect, the main classical dialect, and the northern Bohairic dialect, currently used in Coptic Church services.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"l8\" />\n\n==Writing systems==\nMost surviving texts in the Egyptian language are written on stone in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]].

There was also a form of [[cursive hieroglyphs]], used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of [[typographic ligature#History|ligatures]]. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as \"lapidary hieratic\".{{cn|date=January 2019}}\nIn the language's final stage of development, the [[Coptic alphabet]] replaced the older writing system.\n\nHieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as [[ideogram]]s to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] to represent their [[phonetics|phonetic]] value.\n\nAs the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of [[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliteration]] to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.<ref name=\"a13\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=13}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Further|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian}}\nWhile the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact [[phonetics]] are unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates [[Old Latin]] from [[Italian language|Modern Italian]], significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.\n\nPhonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and [[emphatic consonant]]s, as in many Semitic languages, or one of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[ejective consonant]]s, as in many [[Cushitic languages]].<ref>See ''Egyptian Phonology'', by Carsten Peust, for a review of the history of thinking on the subject; his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.</ref>\n\nSince vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems. Also, scribal errors provide evidence of changes in pronunciation over time.\n\nThe actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686\u20132181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Early Egyptian consonants'''<ref name=\"l33\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=33}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n!

Two consonants, alef and ayin, are generally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}. Yodh is pronounced {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, ''w'' {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Between other consonants, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is then inserted. Thus, for example, the name of an Egyptian king is most accurately transliterated as ''R\ua725-ms-sw'' and transcribed as \"R\u0251m\u025bssu\"; it means \"[[Ra]] has Fashioned (literally, \"Borne\") Him\".\n\nIn [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|u}} all represent consonants; for example, the name [[Tutankhamun]] (1341\u20131323 BC) was written in Egyptian as ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn''. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. For example, the name ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn'' is conventionally pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|u\u02d0|t|\u0259n|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|m|\u0259|n}} in English, but, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *{{IPA-sem|ta\u02c8wa\u02d0t \u02c8\u0295a\u02d0nxu \u0294a\u02c8ma\u02d0n|}}.<ref>Fecht, Gerhard, ''Wortakzent und Silbenstruktur: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache'', J.

Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: ''s\u1e2bd\u1e2bd'' \"be upside-down\".\n\nVowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic {{angbr|stp}} \"to choose\", for example, can represent the [[stative]] (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the [[imperfective]] forms or even a [[verbal noun]] (\"a choosing\").\n\n===Nouns===\nEgyptian [[noun]]s can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ''-t'') and singular or plural (''-w / -wt''), or dual (''-wy / -ty'').\n\n[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.\n\n===Pronouns===\nEgyptian has three different types of [[personal pronoun]]s: suffix, [[clitic|enclitic]] (called \"dependent\" by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the [[infinitive]] to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=65}}</ref> as a \"fourth\" set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!\n!Suffix\n!Dependent\n!Independent\n|-\n!1st sg.\n|''-\u0131\u0357''\n|''w\u0131\u0357''\n|''\u0131\u0357nk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. m.\n|''-k''\n|''tw''\n|''ntk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. f.\n|''-t''\n|''tn''\n|''ntt''\n|-\n!3rd sg. m.\n|''-f''\n|''sw''\n|''ntf''\n|-\n!3rd sg. f.\n|''-s''\n|''sy''\n|''nts''\n|-\n!1st pl.\n|''-n''\n|''n''\n|''\u0131\u0357nn''\n|-\n!2nd pl.\n|''-tn''\n|''tn''\n|''nttn''\n|-\n!3rd pl.\n|''-sn''\n|''sn''\n|''ntsn''\n|}\n\nDemonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Mas.\n!Fem.\n!Plu.\n!Meaning\n|-\n|''pn''\n|''tn''\n|''nn''\n|this, that, these, those\n|-\n|''pf''\n|''tf''\n|''nf''\n|that, those\n|-\n|''pw''\n|''tw''\n|''nw''\n|this, that, these, those (archaic)\n|-\n|''p\ua723''\n|''t\ua723''\n|''n\ua723''\n|this, that, these, those (colloquial [earlier] & Late Egyptian)\n|}\n\nFinally are interrogative pronouns. They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and [[Berber language|Berber]] counterparts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Pronoun\n!Meaning\n!Dependency\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|who / what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''ptr''\n|who / what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''i\u1e2b''\n|what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357\u0161st''\n|what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''z\u0131\u0357''\n|which\n|Independent & Dependent\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\nEgyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.\n\nFinite verbs convey [[Grammatical person|person]], tense/[[Lexical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Each is indicated by a set of [[affix]]al morphemes attached to the verb: the basic conjugation is ''s\u1e0fm.f'' \"he hears\".\n\nNon-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the [[participle]]s and the negative infinitive, which ''[[Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs]]'' calls \"negatival complement\". There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: [[past tense|past]] and temporally-unmarked [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[aorist]] forms. The latter are determined from their [[syntax|syntactic]] context.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s agree in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and number with the nouns they modify: ''s nfr''  \"(the) good man\" and ''st nfrt''  \"(the) good woman\".\n\nAttributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: \"(the) great god\" (''n\u1e6fr \ua725\ua723'').\n\nHowever, when they are used independently as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in an [[adjectival phrase]], as \"(the) god (is) great\"  (''\ua725\ua723 n\u1e6fr'') (literally, \"great (is the) god\"), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.\n\n===Prepositions===\nEgyptian uses [[preposition]]s, as in English and many other Indo-European languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''m''\n|\"in, as, with, from\"\n|-\n|''n''\n|\"to, for\"\n|-\n|''r''\n|\"to, at\"\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357n''\n|\"by\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25n\ua725''\n|\"with\"\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"like\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25r''\n|\"on, upon\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25\ua723''\n|\"behind, around\"\n|-\n|''\u1e96r''\n|\"under\"\n|-\n|''tp''\n|\"atop\"\n|-\n|''\u1e0fr''\n|\"since\"\n|}\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: in ''z\u0131\u0357.n n\u1e6fr \u0131\u0357m'' \"the god went there\", \"there\" (''\u0131\u0357m'') is the adverb. Here are some other common Egyptian adverbs:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''\ua725\ua723''\n|\"here\"\n|-\n|''\u1e6fn\u0131\u0357''\n|\"where\"\n|-\n|''zy-nw''\n|\"when\" (lit. \"what moment\")\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357-\u0131\u0357\u1e2b''\n|\"how\"  (lit. \"like-what\")\n|-\n|''r-m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"why\"  (lit. \"for what\")\n|-\n|''\u1e2bnt''\n|\"before\"\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have [[verb-subject-object]] as the basic [[word order]]. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.\n\nThe equivalent to \"the man opens the door\" would be a sentence that would correspond, in the language's earlier stages, to \"opens the man the door\" (''wn s \ua725\ua723''). The so-called [[status constructus|construct state]] combines two or more nouns to express the [[genitive]], as in Semitic and [[Berber languages]].\n\nThe early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use ''p\ua723'', ''t\ua723'' and ''n\ua723''. As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see|Coptic language#Influence on other languages}}\n\nThe Egyptian language survived into the early modern period in the form of the [[Coptic language]]. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular.\n\nHowever, in antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on [[Classical Greek]], so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include \n''[[:wikt:ebony|ebony]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\udf41\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udfed\ud80c\uddb1 ''hbny'', via Greek and then Latin), \n''[[:wikt:ivory|ivory]]'' (Egyptian ''\ua723bw'', literally \"ivory, elephant\"),\n''[[:wikt:natron|natron]]'' (via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:lily|lily]]'' (Coptic ''hl\u0113ri'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:ibis|ibis]]'' (Egyptian ''hbj'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:oasis|oasis]]'' (Demotic ''w\u1e25j'', via Greek),\nperhaps ''[[:wikt:barge|barge]]'' (Greek [[Wikt:\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2|\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2]] ''baris'' \"Egyptian boat\" from Coptic \u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89 ''ba\u0294r\u0259'' \"small boat\" from Egyptian [[Wikt:b\ua723jr|b\ua723jr]] ),\nand possibly ''[[:wikt:cat|cat]]'';<ref>Often assumed to represent the precursor of Coptic \u03e3\u2c81\u2ca9 (''\u0161au'' \"tomcat\") suffixed with feminine ''-t'', but some authorities dispute this, e.g. John Huehnergard, \"Qitta: Arabic Cats\", ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'' (2007).</ref> and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with [[Ancient Egypt]], such as\n''[[:wikt:pharaoh|pharaoh]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\ude50\ud80c\ude7b ''pr-\ua725\ua723'', literally \"great house\", transmitted via Hebrew and Greek).

From that time on, until the script was supplanted by an early version of Coptic (about the 3rd and 4th centuries AD), the system remained virtually unchanged. Even the number of signs used remained constant at about 700 for more than 2,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hieroglyph {{!}} writing character |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/265009/hieroglyph |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |accessdate=5 December 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n===Middle Egyptian===\n\nMiddle Egyptian was spoken for about 700 years, beginning around 2000 BC.<ref name=\"l5\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=5}}</ref> As the classical variant of Egyptian, Middle Egyptian is the best-documented variety of the language, and has attracted the most attention by far from [[Egyptology]].

The first grammar of Middle Egyptian was published by [[Adolf Erman]] in 1894, surpassed in 1927 by [[Alan Gardiner]]'s  work. Middle Egyptian has been well-understood since then, although certain points of the [[Egyptian verb|verb]]al inflection remained open to revision until the mid-20th century, notably due to the contributions of [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]].<ref>Polotsky, H.

This transition was taking place in the later period of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt]] (known as the [[Amarna Period]]). \nMiddle Egyptian was retained as a literary [[standard language]], and in this usage survived until the Christianisation of [[Roman Egypt]] in the 4th century.\n\n===Late Egyptian===\n[[Late Egyptian language|Late Egyptian]], appearing around 1350 BC, is represented by a large body of religious and secular [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], comprising such examples as the ''[[Story of Wenamun]]'', the love poems of the Chester\u2013Beatty I  papyrus, and the ''[[Instruction of Any]]''. [[Sebayt|Instructions]] became a popular literary genre of the New Kingdom, which took the form of advice on proper behavior.

It survived into the medieval period, but by the 16th century was dwindling rapidly due to the persecution of Coptic Christians under the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]]. It probably survived in the Egyptian countryside as a spoken language for several centuries after that.  Coptic survives as the liturgical language of the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria]] and the [[Coptic Catholic Church]] and, still, as the mother tongue of several families in [[Cairo]].<ref>https://wwww.dailynewssegypt.com/2005/12/10/coptic-languages-last-survivors/</ref>\n==Dialects==\nPre-Coptic Egyptian does not show great dialectal differences in the written language because of the centralised nature of Egyptian society.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"l8\" /> However, a letter from c. 1200&nbsp;BC attests to difference in speech as the writer complains that the language of a correspondent is as unintelligible as the speech of a northern Egyptian to a southerner.<ref name=\"a2\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=2}}</ref><ref name=\"l8\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=8}}</ref>\n\nRecently, some evidence of internal dialects has been found in pairs of similar words in Egyptian that, based on similarities with later dialects of Coptic, may be derived from northern and southern dialects of Egyptian.<ref name=\"s99\">{{Harvcoltxt|Satzinger|2008|p=10}}</ref> Written Coptic has five major dialects, which differ mainly in graphic conventions, most notably the southern Saidic dialect, the main classical dialect, and the northern Bohairic dialect, currently used in Coptic Church services.<ref name=\"a2\" /><ref name=\"l8\" />\n\n==Writing systems==\nMost surviving texts in the Egyptian language are written on stone in [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]].

There was also a form of [[cursive hieroglyphs]], used for religious documents on papyrus, such as the ''[[Book of the Dead]]'' of the [[Twentieth Dynasty of Egypt|Twentieth Dynasty]]; it was simpler to write than the hieroglyphs in stone inscriptions, but it was not as cursive as hieratic and lacked the wide use of [[typographic ligature#History|ligatures]]. Additionally, there was a variety of stone-cut hieratic, known as \"lapidary hieratic\".{{cn|date=January 2019}}\nIn the language's final stage of development, the [[Coptic alphabet]] replaced the older writing system.\n\nHieroglyphs are employed in two ways in Egyptian texts: as [[ideogram]]s to represent the idea depicted by the pictures and, more commonly, as [[phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] to represent their [[phonetics|phonetic]] value.\n\nAs the phonetic realisation of Egyptian cannot be known with certainty, Egyptologists use a system of [[Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian|transliteration]] to denote each sound that could be represented by a uniliteral hieroglyph.<ref name=\"a13\">{{Harvcoltxt|Allen|2000|p=13}}</ref>\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Further|Transliteration of Ancient Egyptian}}\nWhile the consonantal phonology of the Egyptian language may be reconstructed, the exact [[phonetics]] are unknown, and there are varying opinions on how to classify the individual phonemes. In addition, because Egyptian is recorded over a full 2000 years, the Archaic and Late stages being separated by the amount of time that separates [[Old Latin]] from [[Italian language|Modern Italian]], significant phonetic changes must have occurred during that lengthy time frame.\n\nPhonologically, Egyptian contrasted labial, alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal consonants. Egyptian also contrasted voiceless and emphatic consonants, as with other Afroasiatic languages, but exactly how the emphatic consonants were realised is unknown. Early research had assumed that the opposition in stops was one of voicing, but it is now thought to be either one of [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]] and [[emphatic consonant]]s, as in many Semitic languages, or one of [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] and [[ejective consonant]]s, as in many [[Cushitic languages]].<ref>See ''Egyptian Phonology'', by Carsten Peust, for a review of the history of thinking on the subject; his reconstructions of words are nonstandard.</ref>\n\nSince vowels were not written until Coptic, reconstructions of the Egyptian vowel system are much more uncertain and rely mainly on evidence from Coptic and records of Egyptian words, especially proper nouns, in other languages/writing systems. Also, scribal errors provide evidence of changes in pronunciation over time.\n\nThe actual pronunciations reconstructed by such means are used only by a few specialists in the language. For all other purposes, the Egyptological pronunciation is used, but it often bears little resemblance to what is known of how Egyptian was pronounced.\n\n===Consonants===\nThe following consonants are reconstructed for Archaic (before 2600 BC) and Old Egyptian (2686\u20132181 BC), with IPA equivalents in square brackets if they differ from the usual transcription scheme:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ '''Early Egyptian consonants'''<ref name=\"l33\">{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=33}}</ref>\n|-\n! colspan=2 |\n!

Two consonants, alef and ayin, are generally pronounced {{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}}. Yodh is pronounced {{IPA|/i\u02d0/}}, ''w'' {{IPA|/u\u02d0/}}. Between other consonants, {{IPA|/\u025b/}} is then inserted. Thus, for example, the name of an Egyptian king is most accurately transliterated as ''R\ua725-ms-sw'' and transcribed as \"R\u0251m\u025bssu\"; it means \"[[Ra]] has Fashioned (literally, \"Borne\") Him\".\n\nIn [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]], {{angbr|a}}, {{angbr|i}}, and {{angbr|u}} all represent consonants; for example, the name [[Tutankhamun]] (1341\u20131323 BC) was written in Egyptian as ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn''. Experts have assigned generic sounds to these values as a matter of convenience, which is an artificial pronunciation and should not be mistaken for how Egyptian was ever pronounced at any time. For example, the name ''twt-\ua725n\u1e2b-\u0131\u0357mn'' is conventionally pronounced {{IPAc-en|t|u\u02d0|t|\u0259n|\u02c8|k|\u0251\u02d0|m|\u0259|n}} in English, but, in his lifetime, it was likely to be pronounced something like *{{IPA-sem|ta\u02c8wa\u02d0t \u02c8\u0295a\u02d0nxu \u0294a\u02c8ma\u02d0n|}}.<ref>Fecht, Gerhard, ''Wortakzent und Silbenstruktur: Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der \u00e4gyptischen Sprache'', J.

Larger roots are also common and can have up to five consonants: ''s\u1e2bd\u1e2bd'' \"be upside-down\".\n\nVowels and other consonants are added to the root to derive different meanings, as Arabic, Hebrew, and other Afroasiatic languages still do. However, because vowels and sometimes glides are not written in any Egyptian script except Coptic, it can be difficult to reconstruct the actual forms of words. Thus, orthographic {{angbr|stp}} \"to choose\", for example, can represent the [[stative]] (whose endings can be left unexpressed), the [[imperfective]] forms or even a [[verbal noun]] (\"a choosing\").\n\n===Nouns===\nEgyptian [[noun]]s can be masculine or feminine (the latter is indicated, as with other Afroasiatic languages, by adding a ''-t'') and singular or plural (''-w / -wt''), or dual (''-wy / -ty'').\n\n[[Article (grammar)|Article]]s, both definite and indefinite, do not occur until Late Egyptian but are used widely thereafter.\n\n===Pronouns===\nEgyptian has three different types of [[personal pronoun]]s: suffix, [[clitic|enclitic]] (called \"dependent\" by Egyptologists) and independent pronouns. There are also a number of verbal endings added to the [[infinitive]] to form the stative and are regarded by some linguists<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Loprieno|1995|p=65}}</ref> as a \"fourth\" set of personal pronouns. They bear close resemblance to their Semitic counterparts. The three main sets of personal pronouns are as follows:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!\n!Suffix\n!Dependent\n!Independent\n|-\n!1st sg.\n|''-\u0131\u0357''\n|''w\u0131\u0357''\n|''\u0131\u0357nk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. m.\n|''-k''\n|''tw''\n|''ntk''\n|-\n!2nd sg. f.\n|''-t''\n|''tn''\n|''ntt''\n|-\n!3rd sg. m.\n|''-f''\n|''sw''\n|''ntf''\n|-\n!3rd sg. f.\n|''-s''\n|''sy''\n|''nts''\n|-\n!1st pl.\n|''-n''\n|''n''\n|''\u0131\u0357nn''\n|-\n!2nd pl.\n|''-tn''\n|''tn''\n|''nttn''\n|-\n!3rd pl.\n|''-sn''\n|''sn''\n|''ntsn''\n|}\n\nDemonstrative pronouns have separate masculine and feminine singular forms and common plural forms for both genders:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Mas.\n!Fem.\n!Plu.\n!Meaning\n|-\n|''pn''\n|''tn''\n|''nn''\n|this, that, these, those\n|-\n|''pf''\n|''tf''\n|''nf''\n|that, those\n|-\n|''pw''\n|''tw''\n|''nw''\n|this, that, these, those (archaic)\n|-\n|''p\ua723''\n|''t\ua723''\n|''n\ua723''\n|this, that, these, those (colloquial [earlier] & Late Egyptian)\n|}\n\nFinally are interrogative pronouns. They bear a close resemblance to their Semitic and [[Berber language|Berber]] counterparts:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable Unicode\"\n|-\n!Pronoun\n!Meaning\n!Dependency\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|who / what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''ptr''\n|who / what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''i\u1e2b''\n|what\n|Dependent\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357\u0161st''\n|what\n|Independent\n|-\n|''z\u0131\u0357''\n|which\n|Independent & Dependent\n|}\n\n===Verbs===\nEgyptian verbs have finite and non-finite forms.\n\nFinite verbs convey [[Grammatical person|person]], tense/[[Lexical aspect|aspect]], [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[Grammatical voice|voice]]. Each is indicated by a set of [[affix]]al morphemes attached to the verb: the basic conjugation is ''s\u1e0fm.f'' \"he hears\".\n\nNon-finite verbs occur without a subject and are the infinitive, the [[participle]]s and the negative infinitive, which ''[[Egyptian Grammar: Being an Introduction to the Study of Hieroglyphs]]'' calls \"negatival complement\". There are two main tenses/aspects in Egyptian: [[past tense|past]] and temporally-unmarked [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] and [[aorist]] forms. The latter are determined from their [[syntax|syntactic]] context.\n\n===Adjectives===\n[[Adjective]]s agree in [[Grammatical gender|gender]] and number with the nouns they modify: ''s nfr''  \"(the) good man\" and ''st nfrt''  \"(the) good woman\".\n\nAttributive adjectives in phrases are after the nouns they modify: \"(the) great god\" (''n\u1e6fr \ua725\ua723'').\n\nHowever, when they are used independently as a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] in an [[adjectival phrase]], as \"(the) god (is) great\"  (''\ua725\ua723 n\u1e6fr'') (literally, \"great (is the) god\"), adjectives precede the nouns they modify.\n\n===Prepositions===\nEgyptian uses [[preposition]]s, as in English and many other Indo-European languages.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''m''\n|\"in, as, with, from\"\n|-\n|''n''\n|\"to, for\"\n|-\n|''r''\n|\"to, at\"\n|-\n|''\u0131\u0357n''\n|\"by\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25n\ua725''\n|\"with\"\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"like\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25r''\n|\"on, upon\"\n|-\n|''\u1e25\ua723''\n|\"behind, around\"\n|-\n|''\u1e96r''\n|\"under\"\n|-\n|''tp''\n|\"atop\"\n|-\n|''\u1e0fr''\n|\"since\"\n|}\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs, in Egyptian, are at the end of a sentence: in ''z\u0131\u0357.n n\u1e6fr \u0131\u0357m'' \"the god went there\", \"there\" (''\u0131\u0357m'') is the adverb. Here are some other common Egyptian adverbs:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|''\ua725\ua723''\n|\"here\"\n|-\n|''\u1e6fn\u0131\u0357''\n|\"where\"\n|-\n|''zy-nw''\n|\"when\" (lit. \"what moment\")\n|-\n|''m\u0131\u0357-\u0131\u0357\u1e2b''\n|\"how\"  (lit. \"like-what\")\n|-\n|''r-m\u0131\u0357''\n|\"why\"  (lit. \"for what\")\n|-\n|''\u1e2bnt''\n|\"before\"\n|}\n\n==Syntax==\nOld Egyptian, Classical Egyptian, and Middle Egyptian have [[verb-subject-object]] as the basic [[word order]]. However, that changed in the later stages of the language, including Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic.\n\nThe equivalent to \"the man opens the door\" would be a sentence that would correspond, in the language's earlier stages, to \"opens the man the door\" (''wn s \ua725\ua723''). The so-called [[status constructus|construct state]] combines two or more nouns to express the [[genitive]], as in Semitic and [[Berber languages]].\n\nThe early stages of Egyptian have no articles, but the later forms use ''p\ua723'', ''t\ua723'' and ''n\ua723''. As with other Afroasiatic languages, Egyptian uses two grammatical genders: masculine and feminine. It also uses three grammatical numbers: singular, dual and plural. However, later Egyptian has a tendency to lose the dual as a productive form.\n\n==Legacy==\n{{see|Coptic language#Influence on other languages}}\n\nThe Egyptian language survived into the early modern period in the form of the [[Coptic language]]. Coptic survived past the 16th century only as an isolated vernacular.\n\nHowever, in antiquity, Egyptian exerted some influence on [[Classical Greek]], so that a number of Egyptian loanwords into Greek survive into modern usage. Examples include \n''[[:wikt:ebony|ebony]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\udf41\ud80c\ude16\ud80c\udfed\ud80c\uddb1 ''hbny'', via Greek and then Latin), \n''[[:wikt:ivory|ivory]]'' (Egyptian ''\ua723bw'', literally \"ivory, elephant\"),\n''[[:wikt:natron|natron]]'' (via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:lily|lily]]'' (Coptic ''hl\u0113ri'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:ibis|ibis]]'' (Egyptian ''hbj'', via Greek),\n''[[:wikt:oasis|oasis]]'' (Demotic ''w\u1e25j'', via Greek),\nperhaps ''[[:wikt:barge|barge]]'' (Greek [[Wikt:\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2|\u03b2\u1fb6\u03c1\u03b9\u03c2]] ''baris'' \"Egyptian boat\" from Coptic \u2c83\u2c81\u2c81\u2ca3\u2c89 ''ba\u0294r\u0259'' \"small boat\" from Egyptian [[Wikt:b\ua723jr|b\ua723jr]] ),\nand possibly ''[[:wikt:cat|cat]]'';<ref>Often assumed to represent the precursor of Coptic \u03e3\u2c81\u2ca9 (''\u0161au'' \"tomcat\") suffixed with feminine ''-t'', but some authorities dispute this, e.g. John Huehnergard, \"Qitta: Arabic Cats\", ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'' (2007).</ref> and of course a number of terms and proper names directly associated with [[Ancient Egypt]], such as\n''[[:wikt:pharaoh|pharaoh]]'' (Egyptian \ud80c\ude50\ud80c\ude7b ''pr-\ua725\ua723'', literally \"great house\", transmitted via Hebrew and Greek). The [[Name of Egypt|name ''Egypt'']] itself is etymologically identical to that of the ''[[Copts]]'', ultimately from the [[Late Egyptian]] name of [[Memphis (Egypt)|Memphis]], ''Hikuptah'', a continuation of Middle Egyptian ''{{transl|egy|[[wikt:\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25|\u1e25wt-k\ua723-pt\u1e25]]}}''  \"temple of the [[Egyptian soul|ka (soul)]] of [[Ptah]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last= Hoffmeier|first =James K|title =Rameses of the Exodus narratives is the 13th B.C.
