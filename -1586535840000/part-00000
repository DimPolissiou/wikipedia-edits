After the massive commercial success of their previous album ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' (1994), the band entered the studio in the middle of 1996 to record a new album. The title combines [[Pig Latin]] (\"[[:wikt:ixnay|Ixnay]]\" is the  version of the word \"[[:wikt:nix|nix]]\", familiar in 1940s Hollywood movies) and Spanish (\"[[:wikt:hombre|hombre]]\", \"man\") to convey the message \"fuck [[The Man]]\", as in \"fuck authority\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lollipop.com/article.php3?content=issue35/35-1-10.html |title=The Offspring - an Interview with Noodles (guitar/vocals |accessdate=2008-05-31|publisher=Lollipop|author=Heflon, Scott}}</ref>\n\n''Ixnay on the Hombre'' was a moderate commercial success upon its release, debuting at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], and was well-received by both critics and fans.

Following the widespread commercial success of the band's previous album, ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'', frontman [[Dexter Holland]] wanted The Offspring to release more albums on Epitaph, or remain on the label for a long time. However, tensions were encountered when Epitaph founder and [[Bad Religion]] guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] decided to sell ''Smash'' to a major label in \"return for a royalty override on it,\"<ref name=\"holland mailing list\">{{cite web|title=Dexter Holland on The Offspring leaving Epitaph and joining Columbia |publisher=archive.is |url=http://members.aol.com/delirium4u/offspring/letter1.txt |accessdate=2013-06-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990504085010/http://members.aol.com/delirium4u/offspring/letter1.txt |archivedate=May 4, 1999 }}</ref> an action that the band did not like.

Hombre''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by American [[punk rock]] band [[the Offspring]], released on February 4, 1997 by [[Columbia Records]]. After the massive commercial success of their previous album ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' (1994), the band entered the studio in the middle of 1996 to record a new album. The title combines [[Pig Latin]] (\"[[:wikt:ixnay|Ixnay]]\" is the  version of the word \"[[:wikt:nix|nix]]\", familiar in 1940s Hollywood movies) and Spanish (\"[[:wikt:hombre|hombre]]\", \"man\") to convey the message \"fuck [[The Man]]\", as in \"fuck authority\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lollipop.com/article.php3?content=issue35/35-1-10.html |title=The Offspring - an Interview with Noodles (guitar/vocals |accessdate=2008-05-31|publisher=Lollipop|author=Heflon, Scott}}</ref>\n\n''Ixnay on the Hombre'' was a moderate commercial success upon its release, debuting at number nine on the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]], and was well-received by both critics and fans. It was later [[RIAA certification|certified platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for shipments of over one million copies in the United States, and has sold over three million copies worldwide.<ref name=\"Offspring TheHistory\">[http://offspring.com/thehistory/ THE OFFSPRING HISTORY] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309014232/http://offspring.com/thehistory/ |date=March 9, 2015 }} offspring.com/thehistory.

Following the widespread commercial success of the band's previous album, ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'', frontman [[Dexter Holland]] wanted The Offspring to release more albums on Epitaph, or remain on the label for a long time. However, tensions were encountered when Epitaph founder and [[Bad Religion]] guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] decided to sell ''Smash'' to a major label in \"return for a royalty override on it,\"<ref name=\"holland mailing list\">{{cite web|title=Dexter Holland on The Offspring leaving Epitaph and joining Columbia |publisher=archive.is |url=http://members.aol.com/delirium4u/offspring/letter1.txt |accessdate=2013-06-23 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19990504085010/http://members.aol.com/delirium4u/offspring/letter1.txt |archivedate=May 4, 1999 }}</ref> an action that the band did not like. Gurewitz had approached several major labels, such as [[Geffen Records|Geffen]], [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]], in attempt to sign The Offspring.<ref name=\"holland mailing list\"/> The band eventually signed to Columbia, and Holland recalled that they \"took less money\" with the label and the signing \"was not to try and make more money.\"<ref name=\"holland mailing list\"/> Holland also claimed that The Offspring signed to Columbia because they would not \"record for someone who thinks [Gurewitz] can force [them] to\" and would not \"record for a guy who's worse than a major label.\"<ref name=\"holland mailing list\"/> Recording sessions for ''Ixnay on the Hombre'' took place from June to October 1996 at [[Eldorado Recording Studios]] with producer [[Dave Jerden]] ([[Alice in Chains]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[Social Distortion]]).\n\nOn the recording process of the album, guitarist [[Noodles (musician)|Noodles]] stated:\n{{cquote|We recorded a few more songs than we needed, and if we had used some of the other ones that were left off, it would have ended up a little more risky.

She studied music in Moscow with [[Alexander Pirumov]], [[Yuri Kholopov]], [[Edison Denisov]] and [[Philip Herschkowitz]]. In 1979 she was blacklisted as one of the \"[[Khrennikov's Seven]]\" at the Sixth Congress of the [[Union of Soviet Composers]] for unapproved participation in some festivals of Soviet music in the West. She was married to the composer [[Dmitri Smirnov (composer)|Dmitri Smirnov]] and currently lives in the United Kingdom. Their children are [[Philip Firsov]] (an artist and sculptor), and [[Alissa Firsova]] (a composer, pianist and conductor).\n\nShe composed more than a hundred compositions in many different genres including chamber opera ''[[The Nightingale and the Rose (Firsova)|The Nightingale and the Rose]]'' after [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Christina Rossetti]] (premiered at the 1994 [[Almeida Opera Festival]], London), an orchestra work ''Augury'', (premiered at the 1992 BBC [[Proms]]) that includes a choral setting of [[William Blake]]'s famous lines 'To see the world in a grain of sand...' and ''Requiem'' to [[Anna Akhmatova]]'s poem for soprano, chorus and orchestra (premiered at the Berlin Konzerthouse in September 2003).\n\nHer favourite genre is a chamber cantata for solo voice and ensemble (or orchestra). Some of them are written to the poems by [[Alexander Pushkin]], [[Marina Tsvetaeva]], [[Boris Pasternak]] and [[Oleg Prokofiev]]. However, the most of them are setting the poems by her favourite poet [[Osip Mandelstam]] that include ''Earthly Life'',  ''Tristia'', ''The Stone'', ''Forest Walks'', ''Before the Thunderstorm'', ''Stygian Song'', ''Secret Way'',  ''Seashell'', ''Whirlpool'', ''Silentium'', ''Winter Songs'', and ''[[Petrarch]]'s Sonnets'' (in Russian translation by Osip Mandelstam).\n\nShe received commissions from many music festivals, orchestras and ensembles including the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra|Concertgebouw Orchestra]], [[Brodsky Quartet]], Manchester Wind Orchestra, Schubert Ensemble, Freden Festival, BBC [[Proms]], Asiago Festival, and [[Expo 2000]] (Hanover).

Heavily influenced by classic rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s (particularly [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Def Leppard]] and [[AC/DC]]), Hawkins is noted for his [[falsetto]] singing voice and on-stage persona. He was also the lead singer and guitarist for the band [[Hot Leg]], formed in 2008, and now on hiatus.\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Darkness===\n{{main|The Darkness (band)}}\nHawkins began playing clubs and pubs with the Darkness until they were signed by record label [[Atlantic Records]]. Their debut album, ''[[Permission to Land]]'', went straight to number two in the UK charts upon its release on 7 July 2003, before going to number one and staying there for four weeks, eventually going on to sell 1.5 million copies in the UK. 3.5m copies over all.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/20/popandrock5|title=Rock on'|author=Alexis Petridis|work=the Guardian|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The Darkness took inspiration for some of their work from the local north Suffolk area, including \"Black Shuck\" which mentions the nearby village of [[Blythburgh]]. The success of this album led to heavy touring for the band, including European portions of [[Metallica]]'s Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003. They then went on to headline the [[Carling Festival]] in 2004. The band won three [[BRIT Awards]] in 2004 in response to the album, ''Best Group'', ''Best Rock Group'' and ''Best Album''. They also won two [[Kerrang!]] awards in 2004 for ''Best Live Act'' and ''Best British Band''. The third single from the album, \"[[I Believe in a Thing Called Love]]\", was a substantial hit in the UK as was their tilt at the Christmas 2003 number 1, \"[[Christmas Time (Don't Let the Bells End)]]\", which only just fell short, both singles reaching No.2 in 2003.  The band also appeared in the video \"Band Aid 20\" with Justin singing a number of lines.\n\n[[File:DarknessLive.jpg|right|200px|thumb|upright|left|Justin Hawkins performs live with the Darkness]]\nBy late 2004 the band's constant media coverage had started to lead to a general public backlash, and Hawkins and the band themselves seemed to show signs that they were disillusioned with their constant media appearances, infamously walking off of an episode of the U.S.-nationally syndicated radio talk show ''[[Loveline]]'' on 19 April 2004.\n\nIn October 2005, a month before the album ''[[One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back]]'' was to be officially released, Hawkins won an [[eBay]] auction for a copy of ''One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back'' for \u00a3350 under the username 'turbogunhawk'. He claimed he did this so that he could track down whoever sold the digitally-marked advance copy of the album and try to prevent it from happening again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theage.com.au/news/breaking/band-buys-own-album-from-ebay/2005/11/10/1131578152968.html|title=UK band buys own album from eBay|publisher=Theage.com.au|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n\"One Way Ticket\", the first single from their second album, was released on 14 November 2005, debuting and peaking at number 8 on the UK Singles chart.<ref> https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/12440/darkness/ </ref> The album itself was released on 28 November 2005, to somewhat mixed reviews. The album was produced by rock producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]], best known for his work with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Early sales figures in the UK showed the album had not sold as well its predecessor, ''[[Permission to Land]]''. The album debuted at no. 11, and fell to number 34 in the second week of its release. Although it went on to achieve platinum status, this was in stark contrast with their debut's five times platinum status.\n[[File:The Darkness Glasgow SECC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Darkness live in [[Glasgow]], February 2006]]\nThe second single taken from their second album was \"Is It Just Me?\", released on 20 February 2006. The single gained a preliminary position of No. 6 all that week, but finally charted at number 8. Hawkins announced when on stage that their third single to be released from the album was \"[[Girlfriend (The Darkness single)|Girlfriend]]\". Released 22 May, \"Girlfriend\" charted at number 39.\n\nThe band followed up their second album with a tour of the UK and Ireland, consisting of 12 dates in the major cities. The tour opened in Dublin's [[Point Theatre|Point Depot]] on 4 February and closed in the Nottingham Arena on 20 February. Few of the venues sold out, their appeal seemingly having become more selective. Their world tour, which followed, arrived in Australia and Japan after touring Scandinavia and Continental Europe in March.\n\nIn October 2006, Hawkins left the Darkness.<ref>{{cite news |title=Justin Hawkins quits The Darkness |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-darkness/24662 |work=NME |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2006 }}</ref> Although drug and alcohol problems were initially cited as the main reason, later on national television, Hawkins would claim that he had grown tired of the constant routine of the band, recording and promoting an album, going on tours for months, back in the studio, etc. which he considered \"monotonous and boring\" and \"could not understand how bands like the [[Rolling Stones]] could sustain it\".<ref>''This Morning'', ITV, 2007</ref> For his time with the Darkness, Hawkins placed at number 35 on ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'s}} list of the greatest [[frontmen]] of all time.\n\nIn 2011 the band reunited and toured [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]] throughout 2011 and 2012 in support of their new album ''[[Hot Cakes]]''. They then released ''[[Last of Our Kind|Last Of Our Kind]]'' in 2015.\n\nThe band returned in 2017 with ''[[Pinewood Smile]],'' their first album to come through [[Cooking Vinyl]]. Ahead of the album's announcement, The Darkness toured Europe in support of Guns N' Roses and are playing a number of festivals in the UK and Europe during the summer. In 2018, they released their ''Live At Hammersmith'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cookingvinyl.com/artists/the-darkness/|title=The Darkness|website=Cooking Vinyl|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\n2019 saw The Darkness release their latest album [[Easter Is Cancelled]] on October 4th. Easter Is Cancelled became the band's fourth Top 10 album and topped the Official Charts Top 40 Rock And Metal Chart and the iTunes Rock Chart, while the record has achieved over 3 million streams on Spotify alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedarknesslive.com/2020/01/the-darkness-release-in-another-life-video-ft-abbey-clancy/|title=The Darkness release 'In Another Life' video ft.

The hilarious video for \u2018''Rock And Roll Deserves To Die''\u2019 has also individually surpassed 1 million views.\n\nIn January 2020, The Darkness released a new video for '''In Another Life''<nowiki/>' which featured model [[Abbey Clancy]]. The track then made the [[BBC Radio 2]] B-List.\n\n<br />\n\n===Other projects===\nIn 2005, Hawkins set up a solo project, called '''British Whale'''. His debut single, \"[[This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us]]\", a cover of the 1974 hit by [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], was released on 15 August, reached No. 6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and featured multiple World Darts Champion [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] in the video. In 2006 Hawkins released a second single, available only to download, an unofficial [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] anthem called \"England\".\n\nHawkins sang backing vocals on [[The Sweet|Sweet]]'s song \"Hell Raiser\" for [[Def Leppard]]'s 2006 covers album ''[[Yeah!

This saw him performing [[Billy Ocean]]'s \"Red Light Spells Danger\" with the three [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] presenters.\n\nLater that month, on 29 March, Hawkins created a new MySpace profile featuring songs that were planned to be included on his upcoming solo album entitled ''Panther''. The songs are titled \"You Can't Hurt Me Anymore\", \"I've Met Jesus\" and \"Whichever\". On 12 May, Hawkins added a further song to his profile, \"Gay in the 80's\", to appear on the same album. Later, on 13 July, he removed all the songs, and mentioned \"You'll just have to wait\".{{clarify|reason=Is this a song title or a statement?|date=December 2011}}  He later announced a new band line-up and name: [[Hot Leg]]. The aforementioned songs featured on the Hot Leg album ''[[Red Light Fever (Hot Leg album)|Red Light Fever]]''.\n[[File:Hot Leg Dundee Doghouse 2008.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hawkins with new band [[Hot Leg]], October 2008]]\nHawkins also announced that he had been participating in the recording of two Magnet Watch albums entitled ''Nude Horizon'' and ''Party Party Time Time''. On 8 November 2007, at 3:00&nbsp;am, Hawkins posted a MySpace blog containing directions to Do the Green Thing, an organisation for which he has composed a new song, \"Do It in the Dark\", to accompany a short film that encourages people to switch off and save energy.

He also lent his \"truth larynx\" to the track \"Party All Day (Fuck All Night)\" guesting on the 2009 [[Steel Panther]] release, ''[[Feel the Steel]]''. Hawkins recently worked with [[Adam Lambert]] on the track \"Music Again\" off his debut album.\n\nJustin played the role of Josh, a burned out rockstar in the 2010 movie ''[[Psychosis (film)|Psychosis]]''. The movie also featured three Hot Leg songs.\n\nHawkins also appeared on the [[Meat Loaf]] album ''[[Hang Cool Teddy Bear]]'', where he co-wrote two songs (\"Love Is Not Real\" and \"California Isn't Big Enough\"). He also provided guitar on \"California Isn't Big Enough\" and backing vocals on \"Love Is Not Real\" and \"Los Angeloser\".\n\nIn 2012, Hawkins appeared in a [[Samsung]] commercial for their [[Samsung Galaxy Note (original)|Galaxy Note]] smartphone during [[Super Bowl XLVI]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Darkness in Super Bowl Commercial |url=http://hardrockhideout.com/2012/02/05/the-darkness-in-superbowl-commercial/ |publisher=Hard Rock Hideout |accessdate=16 March 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724113814/http://hardrockhideout.com/2012/02/05/the-darkness-in-superbowl-commercial/ |archivedate=24 July 2012 |date=5 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, Hawkins appeared on the De La Soul album ''[[and the Anonymous Nobody...]]'' providing vocals on the track \"Lord Intended\".\n\nIn 2020, Hawkins participated in the [[The Masked Singer (British TV series)|UK version]] of ''[[The Masked Singer]]'', appearing as Chameleon.

He is most commonly seen playing an alpine white model which he used with the Darkness (as seen in the \"[[I Believe in a Thing Called Love]]\" & \"[[Love is Only a Feeling]]\" music videos), and with Hot Leg. It is rare to see him use another guitar, although he can be seen playing a custom [[Ibanez Jem]] for the song \"Bald\". He has also been seen using an ebony Gibson Les Paul Custom, a one-off Gibson \"Less Paul\" custom sculpted to resemble a shell, and a custom finished blue Les Paul standard airbrushed with the mythical dog Black Shuck and Blythburgh church. In 2004 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] issued a limited run of Justin Hawkins signature Les Paul Customs based on the '68 RI with abalone and mother of pearl \"flame\" inlays on the fretboard, a sparkle finish in either Silverburst or Pinkburst (a Blueburst and Redburst have also been pictured, as well as a one-off Gold Mirror finish produced by SimS Custom Guitars). These have become highly valuable because of their scarcity and unique features.\n\nHawkins used [[Mesa Boogie]] dual and triple rectifier amplifiers rather than [[Marshall Amplification]] when performing with the Darkness. The stacks he was using had custom-made speaker cabs coated in red leather.

Heavily influenced by classic rock bands of the 1970s and 1980s (particularly [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Aerosmith]], [[Def Leppard]] and [[AC/DC]]), Hawkins is noted for his [[falsetto]] singing voice and on-stage persona. He was also the lead singer and guitarist for the band [[Hot Leg]], formed in 2008, and now on hiatus.\n\n==Music career==\n\n===The Darkness===\n{{main|The Darkness (band)}}\nHawkins began playing clubs and pubs with the Darkness until they were signed by record label [[Atlantic Records]]. Their debut album, ''[[Permission to Land]]'', went straight to number two in the UK charts upon its release on 7 July 2003, before going to number one and staying there for four weeks, eventually going on to sell 1.5 million copies in the UK. 3.5m copies over all.<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/20/popandrock5|title=Rock on'|author=Alexis Petridis|work=the Guardian|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref> The Darkness took inspiration for some of their work from the local north Suffolk area, including \"Black Shuck\" which mentions the nearby village of [[Blythburgh]]. The success of this album led to heavy touring for the band, including European portions of [[Metallica]]'s Summer Sanitarium Tour 2003. They then went on to headline the [[Carling Festival]] in 2004. The band won three [[BRIT Awards]] in 2004 in response to the album, ''Best Group'', ''Best Rock Group'' and ''Best Album''. They also won two [[Kerrang!]] awards in 2004 for ''Best Live Act'' and ''Best British Band''. The third single from the album, \"[[I Believe in a Thing Called Love]]\", was a substantial hit in the UK as was their tilt at the Christmas 2003 number 1, \"[[Christmas Time (Don't Let the Bells End)]]\", which only just fell short, both singles reaching No.2 in 2003.  The band also appeared in the video \"Band Aid 20\" with Justin singing a number of lines.\n\n[[File:DarknessLive.jpg|right|200px|thumb|upright|left|Justin Hawkins performs live with the Darkness]]\nBy late 2004 the band's constant media coverage had started to lead to a general public backlash, and Hawkins and the band themselves seemed to show signs that they were disillusioned with their constant media appearances, infamously walking off of an episode of the U.S.-nationally syndicated radio talk show ''[[Loveline]]'' on 19 April 2004.\n\nIn October 2005, a month before the album ''[[One Way Ticket to Hell... And Back]]'' was to be officially released, Hawkins won an [[eBay]] auction for a copy of ''One Way Ticket to Hell... and Back'' for \u00a3350 under the username 'turbogunhawk'. He claimed he did this so that he could track down whoever sold the digitally-marked advance copy of the album and try to prevent it from happening again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theage.com.au/news/breaking/band-buys-own-album-from-ebay/2005/11/10/1131578152968.html|title=UK band buys own album from eBay|publisher=Theage.com.au|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\n\"One Way Ticket\", the first single from their second album, was released on 14 November 2005, debuting and peaking at number 8 on the UK Singles chart.<ref> https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/12440/darkness/ </ref> The album itself was released on 28 November 2005, to somewhat mixed reviews. The album was produced by rock producer [[Roy Thomas Baker]], best known for his work with [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. Early sales figures in the UK showed the album had not sold as well its predecessor, ''[[Permission to Land]]''. The album debuted at no. 11, and fell to number 34 in the second week of its release. Although it went on to achieve platinum status, this was in stark contrast with their debut's five times platinum status.\n[[File:The Darkness Glasgow SECC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Darkness live in [[Glasgow]], February 2006]]\nThe second single taken from their second album was \"Is It Just Me?\", released on 20 February 2006. The single gained a preliminary position of No. 6 all that week, but finally charted at number 8. Hawkins announced when on stage that their third single to be released from the album was \"[[Girlfriend (The Darkness single)|Girlfriend]]\". Released 22 May, \"Girlfriend\" charted at number 39.\n\nThe band followed up their second album with a tour of the UK and Ireland, consisting of 12 dates in the major cities. The tour opened in Dublin's [[Point Theatre|Point Depot]] on 4 February and closed in the Nottingham Arena on 20 February. Few of the venues sold out, their appeal seemingly having become more selective. Their world tour, which followed, arrived in Australia and Japan after touring Scandinavia and Continental Europe in March.\n\nIn October 2006, Hawkins left the Darkness.<ref>{{cite news |title=Justin Hawkins quits The Darkness |url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-darkness/24662 |work=NME |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=11 October 2006 }}</ref> Although drug and alcohol problems were initially cited as the main reason, later on national television, Hawkins would claim that he had grown tired of the constant routine of the band, recording and promoting an album, going on tours for months, back in the studio, etc. which he considered \"monotonous and boring\" and \"could not understand how bands like the [[Rolling Stones]] could sustain it\".<ref>''This Morning'', ITV, 2007</ref> For his time with the Darkness, Hawkins placed at number 35 on ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'s}} list of the greatest [[frontmen]] of all time.\n\nIn 2011 the band reunited and toured [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and [[North America]] throughout 2011 and 2012 in support of their new album ''[[Hot Cakes]]''. They then released ''[[Last of Our Kind|Last Of Our Kind]]'' in 2015.\n\nThe band returned in 2017 with ''[[Pinewood Smile]],'' their first album to come through [[Cooking Vinyl]]. Ahead of the album\u2019s announcement, The Darkness toured Europe in support of Guns N\u2019 Roses and are playing a number of festivals in the UK and Europe during the summer. In 2018, they released their ''Live At Hammersmith'' album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cookingvinyl.com/artists/the-darkness/|title=The Darkness|website=Cooking Vinyl|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref>\n\n2019 saw The Darkness release their latest album [[Easter Is Cancelled]] on October 4th. Easter Is Cancelled became the band\u2019s fourth Top 10 album and topped the Official Charts Top 40 Rock And Metal Chart and the iTunes Rock Chart, while the record has achieved over 3 million streams on Spotify alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedarknesslive.com/2020/01/the-darkness-release-in-another-life-video-ft-abbey-clancy/|title=The Darkness release 'In Another Life' video ft.

The hilarious video for \u2018''Rock And Roll Deserves To Die''\u2019 has also individually surpassed 1 million views.\n\nIn January 2020, The Darkness released a new video for '''In Another Life''<nowiki/>' which featured model [[Abbey Clancy]]. The track then made the [[BBC Radio 2]] B-List.\n\n<br />\n\n===Other projects===\nIn 2005, Hawkins set up a solo project, called '''British Whale'''. His debut single, \"[[This Town Ain't Big Enough for Both of Us]]\", a cover of the 1974 hit by [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], was released on 15 August, reached No. 6 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and featured multiple World Darts Champion [[Phil Taylor (darts player)|Phil Taylor]] in the video. In 2006 Hawkins released a second single, available only to download, an unofficial [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] anthem called \"England\".\n\nHawkins sang backing vocals on [[The Sweet|Sweet]]'s song \"Hell Raiser\" for [[Def Leppard]]'s 2006 covers album ''[[Yeah!

This saw him performing [[Billy Ocean]]'s \"Red Light Spells Danger\" with the three [[Top Gear (current format)|Top Gear]] presenters.\n\nLater that month, on 29 March, Hawkins created a new MySpace profile featuring songs that were planned to be included on his upcoming solo album entitled ''Panther''. The songs are titled \"You Can't Hurt Me Anymore\", \"I've Met Jesus\" and \"Whichever\". On 12 May, Hawkins added a further song to his profile, \"Gay in the 80's\", to appear on the same album. Later, on 13 July, he removed all the songs, and mentioned \"You'll just have to wait\".{{clarify|reason=Is this a song title or a statement?|date=December 2011}}  He later announced a new band line-up and name: [[Hot Leg]]. The aforementioned songs featured on the Hot Leg album ''[[Red Light Fever (Hot Leg album)|Red Light Fever]]''.\n[[File:Hot Leg Dundee Doghouse 2008.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Hawkins with new band [[Hot Leg]], October 2008]]\nHawkins also announced that he had been participating in the recording of two Magnet Watch albums entitled ''Nude Horizon'' and ''Party Party Time Time''. On 8 November 2007, at 3:00&nbsp;am, Hawkins posted a MySpace blog containing directions to Do the Green Thing, an organisation for which he has composed a new song, \"Do It in the Dark\", to accompany a short film that encourages people to switch off and save energy.

He is most commonly seen playing an alpine white model which he used with the Darkness (as seen in the \"[[I Believe in a Thing Called Love]]\" & \"[[Love is Only a Feeling]]\" music videos), and with Hot Leg. It is rare to see him use another guitar, although he can be seen playing a custom [[Ibanez Jem]] for the song \"Bald\". He has also been seen using an ebony Gibson Les Paul Custom, a one-off Gibson \"Less Paul\" custom sculpted to resemble a shell, and a custom finished blue Les Paul standard airbrushed with the mythical dog Black Shuck and Blythburgh church. In 2004 [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] issued a limited run of Justin Hawkins signature Les Paul Customs based on the '68 RI with abalone and mother of pearl \"flame\" inlays on the fretboard, a sparkle finish in either Silverburst or Pinkburst (a Blueburst and Redburst have also been pictured, as well as a one-off Gold Mirror finish produced by SimS Custom Guitars). These have become highly valuable because of their scarcity and unique features.\n\nHawkins used [[Mesa Boogie]] dual and triple rectifier amplifiers rather than [[Marshall Amplification]] when performing with the Darkness. The stacks he was using had custom-made speaker cabs coated in red leather. During his time in [[Hot Leg]] he was exclusively seen using Cornford MK50H II's in white vinyl with two Cornford, 16-ohm, 4x12 cabinets loaded with Celestion \"Vintage 30s\".

He was the [[guitarist]] of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands [[Pantera]] and [[Damageplan]], both of which he co-founded alongside his brother [[Vinnie Paul]]. As one of the driving forces behind the development of [[groove metal]], he is considered among the most influential guitarists in heavy metal history.\n\nA son of [[country music]] producer [[Jerry Abbott]], Abbott began playing guitar at age 12, and Pantera released its debut album, ''[[Metal Magic]]'' (1983), when he was 16. Originally a [[glam metal]] musician, Abbott went by the stage name '''Diamond Darrell''' at the time. Two further albums in the glam metal style followed in [[Projects in the Jungle|1984]] and [[I Am the Night (album)|1985]], before original vocalist [[Terry Glaze]] was replaced by [[Phil Anselmo]] in 1986 and ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]'' (1988) was released. The band's major-label debut, ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'' (1990), introduced a groove metal sound to which Abbott's guitar playing was central. This sound was refined on ''[[Vulgar Display of Power]]'' (1992), and the group's third major-label record, ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'', debuted at No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' in 1994.  \n\nTensions within Pantera reduced its output after the release of ''[[The Great Southern Trendkill]]'' in 1996, and ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]'' (2000) was the band's final studio album before its acrimonious separation in 2003. Abbott subsequently formed Damageplan with his brother Vinnie Paul and released ''[[New Found Power]]'', the band's debut and only album, in 2004. Other works by Abbott included a collaboration with [[David Allan Coe]] titled ''[[Rebel Meets Rebel]]'' (2006) and numerous guest [[guitar solo]]s for bands such as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. Abbott was [[Columbus nightclub shooting|shot and killed]] by a deranged fan on December 8, 2004, while on stage with Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. Three others were murdered in the shooting before the perpetrator was killed by police. \n\nAbbott was ranked at No. 92 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2011, and No. 19 on ''[[Metal Hammer|Louder]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 50 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2018. He placed at No. 5 on [[Gibson]]'s list of \"The Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time\" in 2015, and the same year was ranked as the most influential metal guitarist of the past 25 years by [[VH1]].\n\n==Childhood==\n\nDarrell Lance Abbott was born in [[Ennis, Texas]],{{sfn|Daniels|2013|p=2}} on August 20, 1966, the second son to Carolyn and [[Jerry Abbott]], a [[country music]] producer.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=3}} His elder brother [[Vinnie Paul]] was born on March 11, 1964. Abbott's parents divorced in 1979, after seventeen years of marriage,{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=4}} but his family life remained happy.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=16}} The brothers lived with their mother Carolyn, in a [[ranch-style house]] on Monterrey Street in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=8}} Carolyn was supportive of her sons' musical endeavors.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=5}}\n\nAbbott took up the guitar when he was twelve. His first guitar was a [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]]-style [[Hondo (guitar company)|Hondo]], which he received along with a [[Pignose]] amplifier on his twelfth birthday.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=10}} Influenced by [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Van Halen]],{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=11}} he would initially spend time in his room standing in front of a mirror holding the guitar while wearing [[Ace Frehley]]-style makeup, though he was unable to play the instrument at the time.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=8}}<ref name=vinnie2016>{{cite web|url =https://www.loudersound.com/features/he-was-the-wild-life-of-the-party-vinnie-paul-remembers-dimebag-darrell|title ='He was the wild life of the party' - Vinnie Paul remembers Dimebag Darrell|website =Louder|first =Jerry|last =Ewing|date =December 8, 2016}}</ref> Jerry learned Kiss songs on guitar in order to teach Darrell how to play them.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=11}} Darrell also learned from country musicians who recorded at Jerry's studio, such as [[Bugs Henderson]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=12}}\n\nVinnie had begun playing the drums before Darrell received his first guitar. Darrell had previously tried to play the drums; Vinnie later said: \"I just got better than him and wouldn't let him play them anymore.\"<ref name=vinnie2016/> The Abbott brothers' first [[jam session]] consisted of six hours of \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\".<ref name=vinnie2016/>{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=12}} They took inspiration from [[Alex Van Halen|Alex]] and [[Eddie Van Halen]],{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=217}} and Vinnie said in a 2016 interview that he and Darrell were \"inseparable\" after they began playing music together.<ref name=vinnie2016/>\n\nAt age 14, Abbott entered a guitar contest at the Agora Ballroom in [[Dallas]], in which [[Dean Zelinsky]], founder of [[Dean Guitars]], was one of the judges.<ref name=reinventingsqueal/> Abbott's mother accompanied him to the club because he was not old enough to enter on his own.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=26}} He won the competition; Zelinsky recalled that \"[Abbott] blew everyone away.\"<ref name=reinventingsqueal>{{cite web|url =https://www.guitarworld.com/features/dimebag-darrell-reinventing-squeal|title =Dimebag Darrell: Reinventing the Squeal|website =Guitar World|first =Chris|last =Gill|date =January 2010}}</ref> Abbott won many other guitar contests in the area, and was eventually asked not to compete and instead judge the competitions so others could win.<ref name=australianguitar/>{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=111}}\n\n==Music career==\n===Pantera===\n{{Further|Pantera}}\n====Early glam metal years====\n\n[[Pantera]] was formed in 1981. Vinnie was asked to join a band alongside his high school classmates [[Terry Glaze]] (guitar), Tommy Bradford (bass) and Donny Hart (vocals). Vinnie accepted the invitation, but on the condition that Darrell would also join the band.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=13}} Glaze later recalled that they were unsure about this request, as Darrell \"wasn't very good\" and, two years their junior, \"was a little skinny, scrawny dude\",{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=13}} but they ultimately agreed. In 1989, Darrell made the same request when [[Dave Mustaine]] asked him to join [[Megadeth]]. As Mustaine had already recruited drummer [[Nick Menza]] and would not hire Vinnie, Darrell decided to stay with Pantera.<ref name=\"Sharpe-Young\">{{cite book|last =Sharpe-Young|first =Garry|title =New Wave of American Heavy Metal|date =November 2005|publisher =Zonda Books|location =New Zealand|page =232|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=uIIf03bGyAAC}}</ref>{{sfn|Crain|2009|pp=14, 71}}<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.billboard.com/articles/dimebag-darrell/6363759/dave-mustaine-on-dimebag-darrell-he-would-want-us-to-remember-him|title =Dave Mustaine on 'Dimebag' Darrell: 'He Would Want Us to Remember Him by Celebrating and Not Mourn'|website =Billboard|first =Dan|last =Epstein|date =December 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine =Guitar World|date =October 2004|url =https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/dave_mustaine_kerry_king_hates_my_guts.html|title =Dave Mustaine: Kerry King Hates My Guts|quote =That's true.

I told him I already had a drummer, and he said, 'Ah, then fuck it. Good luck, brother!'}}</ref>\n\nBy 1982, Hart left the band and was replaced by Glaze on vocals, while [[Rex Brown]] took Bradford's place as bassist.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=14}} Abbott originally shared lead guitar with Glaze, but soon took permanent status as lead guitarist. Glaze said: \"[Abbott] just morphed over a six-month period. ... When he came out, he could play, like, \"[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]\" and \"[[Crazy Train]]\".\"{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=16}} Abbott adopted the stage name \"Diamond Darrell\",{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=20}} in reference to the Kiss song \"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\".{{sfn|Daniels|2013|p=32}}\n\nInspired by Kiss, Van Halen and Judas Priest, Pantera originally had a [[glam metal]] style and was image conscious: the members wore [[spandex]], makeup and hairspray when on stage.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=20}} The band signed to Metal Magic Records, which was created by \"Jerry Eld'n\", an alias of Abbott's father Jerry. Pantera released its first album, ''[[Metal Magic]]'', in 1983, when Abbott was 16.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=20}} A review in the November 1983 issue of Texas-based music magazine ''Buddy'' said Abbott's [[guitar solo|solos]] \"tend to be asymmetrical in that the old theory of musical thought consisting of statements alternating with appropriate responses is ignored and replaced by authoritative delivery of the player's own concept of what should happen\".{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=21}}\n\nPantera released ''[[Projects in the Jungle]]'' and ''[[I Am the Night (album)|I Am the Night]]'' in 1984 and 1985, respectively. Both albums followed on in the glam metal style, and were comparable to ''[[Shout at the Devil]]''-era [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]],{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=43}} though ''I Am the Night'' had a slightly heavier sound than previous releases.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=44}} Around this time, the Abbott brothers began listening to bands such as [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=44}} Darrell was particularly taken by Metallica's ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'' (1984).{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=48}} Glaze was unhappy with the Abbott brothers' desire to move towards a heavier sound; he later said he \"didn't want to go that heavy. I didn't like it as well if the guitar was the main thing, like the Metallica songs.\"{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=49}} This conflict, along with a contractual dispute, led to his departure in 1986.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=50}}\n\nGlaze was replaced by [[Phil Anselmo]] in late 1986.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=52}} This new lineup briefly signed with [[Gold Mountain Records]], but released ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]'' (1988) on Metal Magic. Abbott said Gold Mountain \"wanted to change our style and make us sound like [[Bon Jovi]], which is not quite up our alley\".{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=53}} Anselmo did not write any of the lyrics for ''Power Metal'', and the band was still in the process of distancing themselves from glam metal,{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=54}} but the album evidenced a stylistic change.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=69}} A retrospective [[AllMusic]] album review by Bradley Torreano said Abbott's \"speedy riffs\" were one of the \"more charming elements\" of the band's sound.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.allmusic.com/album/power-metal-mw0000858526|title =Power Metal - Pantera|website =AllMusic|first =Bradley|last =Torreano}}</ref> Brown said in a 1988 interview that \"Darrell has always been chunking those riffs out from the start. But now with Phil in the band we've got a chance to make those riffs fully happen instead of having some gay singer over the top of them!\"{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=54}}\n\n====Development of groove metal====\n\nAfter the release of ''Power Metal'', Pantera formed a relationship with Walter O'Brien and Andy Gould of [[Concrete Marketing|Concrete Management]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=69}} As Concrete managed other bands that were signed to [[Metal Blade Records]], Gould contacted [[Brian Slagel]] of Metal Blade and asked him to sign Pantera.

Darrell''', was an American musician and songwriter. He was the [[guitarist]] of the [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands [[Pantera]] and [[Damageplan]], both of which he co-founded alongside his brother [[Vinnie Paul]]. As one of the driving forces behind the development of [[groove metal]], he is considered among the most influential guitarists in heavy metal history.\n\nA son of [[country music]] producer [[Jerry Abbott]], Abbott began playing guitar at age 12, and Pantera released its debut album, ''[[Metal Magic]]'' (1983), when he was 16. Originally a [[glam metal]] musician, Abbott went by the stage name '''Diamond Darrell''' at the time. Two further albums in the glam metal style followed in [[Projects in the Jungle|1984]] and [[I Am the Night (album)|1985]], before original vocalist [[Terry Glaze]] was replaced by [[Phil Anselmo]] in 1986 and ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]'' (1988) was released. The band's major-label debut, ''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'' (1990), introduced a groove metal sound to which Abbott's guitar playing was central. This sound was refined on ''[[Vulgar Display of Power]]'' (1992), and the group's third major-label record, ''[[Far Beyond Driven]]'', debuted at No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard 200]]'' in 1994.  \n\nTensions within Pantera reduced its output after the release of ''[[The Great Southern Trendkill]]'' in 1996, and ''[[Reinventing the Steel]]'' (2000) was the band's final studio album before its acrimonious separation in 2003. Abbott subsequently formed Damageplan with his brother Vinnie Paul and released ''[[New Found Power]]'', the band's debut and only album, in 2004. Other works by Abbott included a collaboration with [[David Allan Coe]] titled ''[[Rebel Meets Rebel]]'' (2006) and numerous guest [[guitar solo]]s for bands such as [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]. Abbott was [[Columbus nightclub shooting|shot and killed]] by a deranged fan on December 8, 2004, while on stage with Damageplan at the Alrosa Villa nightclub in Columbus, Ohio. Three others were murdered in the shooting before the perpetrator was killed by police. \n\nAbbott was ranked at No. 92 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2011, and No. 19 on ''[[Metal Hammer|Louder]]''{{'}}s list of \"The 50 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\" in 2018. He placed at No. 5 on [[Gibson]]'s list of \"The Top 10 Metal Guitarists of All Time\" in 2015, and the same year was ranked as the most influential metal guitarist of the past 25 years by [[VH1]].\n\n==Childhood==\n\nDarrell Lance Abbott was born in [[Ennis, Texas]],{{sfn|Daniels|2013|p=2}} on August 20, 1966, the second son to Carolyn and [[Jerry Abbott]], a [[country music]] producer.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=3}} His elder brother [[Vinnie Paul]] was born on March 11, 1964. Abbott's parents divorced in 1979, after seventeen years of marriage,{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=4}} but his family life remained happy.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=16}} The brothers lived with their mother Carolyn, in a [[ranch-style house]] on Monterrey Street in [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=8}} Carolyn was supportive of her sons' musical endeavors.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=5}}\n\nAbbott took up the guitar when he was twelve. His first guitar was a [[Gibson Les Paul|Les Paul]]-style [[Hondo (guitar company)|Hondo]], which he received along with a [[Pignose]] amplifier on his twelfth birthday.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=10}} Influenced by [[Black Sabbath]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Van Halen]],{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=11}} he would initially spend time in his room standing in front of a mirror holding the guitar while wearing [[Ace Frehley]]-style makeup, though he was unable to play the instrument at the time.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=8}}<ref name=vinnie2016>{{cite web|url =https://www.loudersound.com/features/he-was-the-wild-life-of-the-party-vinnie-paul-remembers-dimebag-darrell|title ='He was the wild life of the party' - Vinnie Paul remembers Dimebag Darrell|website =Louder|first =Jerry|last =Ewing|date =December 8, 2016}}</ref> Jerry learned Kiss songs on guitar in order to teach Darrell how to play them.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=11}} Darrell also learned from country musicians who recorded at Jerry's studio, such as [[Bugs Henderson]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=12}}\n\nVinnie had begun playing the drums before Darrell received his first guitar. Darrell had previously tried to play the drums; Vinnie later said: \"I just got better than him and wouldn't let him play them anymore.\"<ref name=vinnie2016/> The Abbott brothers' first [[jam session]] consisted of six hours of \"[[Smoke on the Water]]\".<ref name=vinnie2016/>{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=12}} They took inspiration from [[Alex Van Halen|Alex]] and [[Eddie Van Halen]],{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=217}} and Vinnie said in a 2016 interview that he and Darrell were \"inseparable\" after they began playing music together.<ref name=vinnie2016/>\n\nAt age 14, Abbott entered a guitar contest at the Agora Ballroom in [[Dallas]], in which [[Dean Zelinsky]], founder of [[Dean Guitars]], was one of the judges.<ref name=reinventingsqueal/> Abbott's mother accompanied him to the club because he was not old enough to enter on his own.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=26}} He won the competition; Zelinsky recalled that \"[Abbott] blew everyone away.\"<ref name=reinventingsqueal>{{cite web|url =https://www.guitarworld.com/features/dimebag-darrell-reinventing-squeal|title =Dimebag Darrell: Reinventing the Squeal|website =Guitar World|first =Chris|last =Gill|date =January 2010}}</ref> Abbott won many other guitar contests in the area, and was eventually asked not to compete and instead judge the competitions so others could win.<ref name=australianguitar/>{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=111}}\n\n==Music career==\n===Pantera===\n{{Further|Pantera}}\n====Early glam metal years====\n\n[[Pantera]] was formed in 1981. Vinnie was asked to join a band alongside his high school classmates [[Terry Glaze]] (guitar), Tommy Bradford (bass) and Donny Hart (vocals). Vinnie accepted the invitation, but on the condition that Darrell would also join the band.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=13}} Glaze later recalled that they were unsure about this request, as Darrell \"wasn't very good\" and, two years their junior, \"was a little skinny, scrawny dude\",{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=13}} but they ultimately agreed. In 1989, Darrell made the same request when [[Dave Mustaine]] asked him to join [[Megadeth]]. As Mustaine had already recruited drummer [[Nick Menza]] and would not hire Vinnie, Darrell decided to stay with Pantera.<ref name=\"Sharpe-Young\">{{cite book|last =Sharpe-Young|first =Garry|title =New Wave of American Heavy Metal|date =November 2005|publisher =Zonda Books|location =New Zealand|page =232|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=uIIf03bGyAAC}}</ref>{{sfn|Crain|2009|pp=14, 71}}<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.billboard.com/articles/dimebag-darrell/6363759/dave-mustaine-on-dimebag-darrell-he-would-want-us-to-remember-him|title =Dave Mustaine on 'Dimebag' Darrell: 'He Would Want Us to Remember Him by Celebrating and Not Mourn'|website =Billboard|first =Dan|last =Epstein|date =December 8, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine =Guitar World|date =October 2004|url =https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/dave_mustaine_kerry_king_hates_my_guts.html|title =Dave Mustaine: Kerry King Hates My Guts|quote =That's true.

I told him I already had a drummer, and he said, 'Ah, then fuck it. Good luck, brother!'}}</ref>\n\nBy 1982, Hart left the band and was replaced by Glaze on vocals, while [[Rex Brown]] took Bradford's place as bassist.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=14}} Abbott originally shared lead guitar with Glaze, but soon took permanent status as lead guitarist. Glaze said: \"[Abbott] just morphed over a six-month period. ... When he came out, he could play, like, \"[[Eruption (instrumental)|Eruption]]\" and \"[[Crazy Train]]\".\"{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=16}} Abbott adopted the stage name \"Diamond Darrell\",{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=20}} in reference to the Kiss song \"[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]\".{{sfn|Daniels|2013|p=32}}\n\nInspired by Kiss, Van Halen and Judas Priest, Pantera originally had a [[glam metal]] style and was image conscious: the members wore [[spandex]], makeup and hairspray when on stage.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=20}} The band signed to Metal Magic Records, which was created by \"Jerry Eld'n\", an alias of Abbott's father Jerry. Pantera released its first album, ''[[Metal Magic]]'', in 1983, when Abbott was 16.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=20}} A review in the November 1983 issue of Texas-based music magazine ''Buddy'' said Abbott's [[guitar solo|solos]] \"tend to be asymmetrical in that the old theory of musical thought consisting of statements alternating with appropriate responses is ignored and replaced by authoritative delivery of the player's own concept of what should happen\".{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=21}}\n\nPantera released ''[[Projects in the Jungle]]'' and ''[[I Am the Night (album)|I Am the Night]]'' in 1984 and 1985, respectively. Both albums followed on in the glam metal style, and were comparable to ''[[Shout at the Devil]]''-era [[M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce]],{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=43}} though ''I Am the Night'' had a slightly heavier sound than previous releases.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=44}} Around this time, the Abbott brothers began listening to bands such as [[Metallica]] and [[Slayer]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=44}} Darrell was particularly taken by Metallica's ''[[Ride the Lightning]]'' (1984).{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=48}} Glaze was unhappy with the Abbott brothers' desire to move towards a heavier sound; he later said he \"didn't want to go that heavy. I didn't like it as well if the guitar was the main thing, like the Metallica songs.\"{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=49}} This conflict, along with a contractual dispute, led to his departure in 1986.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=50}}\n\nGlaze was replaced by [[Phil Anselmo]] in late 1986.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=52}} This new lineup briefly signed with [[Gold Mountain Records]], but released ''[[Power Metal (album)|Power Metal]]'' (1988) on Metal Magic. Abbott said Gold Mountain \"wanted to change our style and make us sound like [[Bon Jovi]], which is not quite up our alley\".{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=53}} Anselmo did not write any of the lyrics for ''Power Metal'', and the band was still in the process of distancing themselves from glam metal,{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=54}} but the album evidenced a stylistic change.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=69}} A retrospective [[AllMusic]] album review by Bradley Torreano said Abbott's \"speedy riffs\" were one of the \"more charming elements\" of the band's sound.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.allmusic.com/album/power-metal-mw0000858526|title =Power Metal - Pantera|website =AllMusic|first =Bradley|last =Torreano}}</ref> Brown said in a 1988 interview that \"Darrell has always been chunking those riffs out from the start. But now with Phil in the band we've got a chance to make those riffs fully happen instead of having some gay singer over the top of them!\"{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=54}}\n\n====Development of groove metal====\n\nAfter the release of ''Power Metal'', Pantera formed a relationship with Walter O'Brien and Andy Gould of [[Concrete Marketing|Concrete Management]].{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=69}} As Concrete managed other bands that were signed to [[Metal Blade Records]], Gould contacted [[Brian Slagel]] of Metal Blade and asked him to sign Pantera. The $75,000 requested for the production of a new album was too much for Slagel, who rejected the offer.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=70}} The Metal Blade rejection was one of many major-label rejections for the band.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=71}} Pantera eventually attained a major-label deal with [[Atco Records]], after Atco's talent scout Mark Ross was impressed by one of the band's live performances.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=75}}\n\n''[[Cowboys from Hell]]'' was released on July 24, 1990. The album was produced by [[Terry Date]]; [[Max Norman]] was the original choice for producer but he opted to produce [[Lynch Mob]]'s ''[[Wicked Sensation]]'' instead. Date also served as producer for Pantera's next three albums.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=77}} ''Cowboys from Hell'' marked the development of what would become Pantera's familiar sound,<ref name=loudwire28/> to which Abbott's guitar playing was central.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=84}} Self-described as \"power groove\",<ref name=loudwire28>{{cite web|url =http://loudwire.com/pantera-cowboys-from-hell-album-anniversary/|title =28 Years Ago: Pantera Find Their Voice With 'Cowboys From Hell'|website =Loudwire|first =Jon|last =Wiederhorn|date =July 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title =Music of the 1990s|first =Thomas|last =Harrison|publisher =ABC-CLIO|date =2011|isbn =9780313379437|page =101}}</ref> the album became a \"blueprint-defining\" work for [[groove metal]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/projects-in-the-jungle-mw0000909464 |title=Projects in the Jungle - Pantera |website =AllMusic|first =Eduardo|last =Rivadavia}}</ref> a sub-genre with the heaviness and intensity of [[thrash metal]] but played at a slower tempo.<ref name=loudwire28/><ref>{{cite book|title =Historical Dictionary of Popular Music|first =Norman|last =Abjorensen|publisher =Rowman & Littlefield|date =2017|isbn =9781538102152|page =384}}</ref> [[Southern rock]] elements were incorporated into the sound;<ref name=loudwire28/> Pantera's \"groove\" is commonly attributed to the Abbott brothers' fondness for [[ZZ Top]].<ref name=louderfeature>{{cite web|url =https://www.loudersound.com/features/how-pantera-went-from-a-glam-band-to-redefining-metal|title =Pantera: how an ex-glam band from Texas redefined metal|website =Louder|first =Dom|last =Lawson|date =December 21, 2018}}</ref> ''Cowboys from Hell'' was certified gold in 1993, and platinum in 1997.<ref name=loudwire28/>\n\nPantera played close to 200 shows supporting ''Cowboys from Hell'', as it toured for nearly two years.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=97}} Aside from breaks to develop new material, the band spent most of the 1990s touring;{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=78}} Abbott gained a reputation as a wild figure on tour and a heavy drinker.{{sfn|Crain|2009|p=88}} Pantera recorded its second major-label album in the space of two months.

He also used drop D down one step, down 1 \u00bd steps and drop D down 1 \u00bd steps tunings.
