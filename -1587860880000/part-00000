{"title_page": "Q&A software", "text_new": "{{short description|Online question and answer software}}\n'''Q&A software''' is [[online software]] that attempts to answer questions asked by users (Q&A stands for \"question and answer\"). Q&A software is frequently integrated by large and specialist [[corporation]]s and tends to be implemented as a [[Online community|community]] that allows users in similar fields to discuss questions and provide answers to common and specialist questions.\n\nThere are numerous examples of Q&A software in both [[open-source model|open source]] and [[SaaS]] formats, including [[Qhub]], [[OSQA]], [https://www.tistip.com Tistip] Question2Answer, and [[Stack Exchange]]. Standalone Q&A communities such as [[Quora]] or [[Yahoo!

This kind of software is particularly useful for responding to questions regarding specific industries. Users may learn by regularly answering questions or exchanging views with other industry specialists using the website.\n\nIn the late 1990s, a free online service called Answer Point provided by Ask Jeeves, was launched, allowing users to ask questions and with the help of other people, have them answered. The slogan of the service, \"The Ask Jeeves Answer Point is the place where you can ask and answer questions. Have a question? Post it! Know the answer? Post it!\",<ref name=\"searchenginewatch.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/news/2060212/web-search-history-before-google-answers-yahoo-answers-there-was-answer-point-from-ask-jeeves|title=Web Search History: Before Google Answers and Yahoo Answers There Was \"Answer Point\" From Ask Jeeves {{!}} Search Engine Watch|website=searchenginewatch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-04}}</ref> indicated the main function of it, which inspired the creation of later Q&A sites. The last archived version of the Ask Point was from late 2001 when it still allowed registration.\n\nSince then, more and more sites have begun to offer Q&A services. Google launched its Q&A service called [[Google Questions and Answers]] in August 2001 which used Google staffers to answer questions by e-mail. A flat fee (US$3.00) was involved for an answer. In April 2002, Google launched Google Answers, which allowed users to post answers to questions, to replace its predecessor. Google Answers cost askers $2 to $200 for an accepted answer. By late December 2006, it was fully closed to new activity.\n\nIn early 2000s, Yahoo! launched its online Q&A service called [[Ask Yahoo!]], which was later replaced by the beta version of Yahoo! Answers on December 8, 2005. Ask Yahoo! was discontinued in March 2006. Yahoo! Answers give members the chance to earn points, thus encouraging user participation. To support countries using non-English characters, [[Yahoo! Answers]] operate different platforms in some Asian countries, such as Yahoo! Chiebukuro (Yahoo!\u77e5\u6075\u888b[[Help:Installing Japanese character sets|?]]) in Japan and as Yahoo! Knowledge in Korea, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong.\n\n[[Quora]] was founded in June 2009, while the website was made available to the public on June 21, 2010. Users can collaborate by editing questions and suggesting edits to other users' answers.\n\nFrom 2010 with the widespread use of smartphones and tablets, there is an increasing number of Q&A sites that decide to launch mobile applications. Popular Q&A sites like Yahoo! Answers and Quora have launched their own mobile applications. There is also a booming of new Q&A software such as Canvass which purely rely on mobile applications as their service channel.\n\n==Motivation==\nBased on the characteristics of an online Q&A community, which including no reputation-ranking mechanism and no financial reward for users\u2019 knowledge-contribution behaviors, and no mutual interest or conflict between users, people are wondering about the reason that motivates users to contribute their knowledge on the Q&A software. Feeling safe and trusting the software and the Internet environment provides a foundation for users to share their knowledge. People who trust the software more tend to be involved more in question and answer activities. The knowledge contribution from others leads to even more people to share their knowledge. Users who read more contributed knowledge tend to contribute more generally. Users are also seeking recognition when they contribute knowledge on the Q&A software. Social rewards such as approval, status, and respect play a very important role in motivating people to contribute to the Q&A software. User's eagerness of showing their knowledge and expertise and the potential chance of being noticed by recruiters also play a role in motivating people to answer questions and contribute questions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Jiahua|last2=Li|first2=Yijun|last3=Zhong|first3=Xiaojia|last4=Zhai|first4=Li|date=2015-11-01|title=Why users contribute knowledge to online communities: An empirical study of an online social Q&A community|journal=Information & Management|series=Novel applications of social media analytics|volume=52|issue=7|pages=840\u2013849|doi=10.1016/j.im.2015.07.005}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n== Classification ==\nAn online Q&A service serves the public with its ease of getting access without temporal and spatial constraints. The mechanism over all Q&A services is the same: Questioners express their information needs in the form of a question, and people (experts, or other users in the system) answer those questions based on their knowledge. Online Q&A service can be classified into several types in terms of who answer questions, and how services maintain and control the quality of information. Shah et al. (2009)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Chirag|last2=Oh|first2=Sanghee|last3=Oh|first3=Jung Sun|title=Research agenda for social Q&A|journal=Library & Information Science Research|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=205\u2013209|doi=10.1016/j.lisr.2009.07.006|year=2009}}</ref> classified online Q&A service into three categories:\n* [[Digital reference services]]: Also known as virtual reference, it is an extended version of traditional reference service where users in the library can get help from librarians with identifying desired materials. The advantage comes from the fact that users can have access anytime without physical constraints. The current services in this type include Ask an IPL Librarian of the Internet Public Library, and the Educators\u2019 Reference Desk\n* Expert services: Organizations other than libraries offer Q&A service where experts in a specific area answer questions. Some are fee-based (e.g., NetWellness (<nowiki>http://www.netwellness.org</nowiki>), whereas others offer free-service (e.g., PickAnswer (<nowiki>http://pickanswer.com</nowiki>)\n* Social Q&A (community Q&A): In social Q&A services, any user in the community can ask or answer questions. Since a question can receive attention from many people unlike expert service, questioners are likely to benefit from the wisdom of crowds. The set of answers made by a large number of people often surpasses answers from experts in a traditional Q&A service. Harper, Raban, Rafaeli, and Konstan (2008)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motivations for Answering Questions Online Abstract|last=Raban|first=Daphne R.|last2=Harper|first2=F. Maxwell|citeseerx = 10.1.1.119.1962}}</ref> proved that a social Q&A system ended up with a better quality of answers than those of library reference services by comparing existing services.\n\n== Online community ==\n'''The change of Q&A community features:''' Early definition described three types of Q&A Sites: \"digital reference services\", \"ask an expert service\", and \"community Q&A sites.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Harper|year=2008|title=Predictors of answer quality in online Q&A sites|url=|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \"Ask an expert service\" represents a technological and social way of providing quality question answering service. This service is staffed by domain experts. In comparison, community Q&A sites involved everyday users in answering questions \u2013 it largely increased the number of contributors. Established examples of community Q&A sites are [[Yahoo! Answers]] and [[Quora]]. One of the problems of these communities is that it is hard to control the quality of answers compared with \"ask an expert service\".\n\nHowever, in recent years, community Q&A sites tend to embrace newer interaction designs than the other types of Q&A sites, by providing features like tagging and rating interfaces, RSS feeds, and highly interactive browsing and searching capabilities. These features used the crowd power to evaluate the quality of answers and also the reliability of the contributors. Some communities as [[Zhihu]] tags the users received highest votes in a given domain as \"Excellent answer provider\". These new features generally integrate expert verification and service into Q&A community sites.\n\n'''Social and information structure:''' Originally, Q&A communities have little structural or role-based organization. In recent years, we found that some communities started to form social and information structures. This is driven by the increasing number of contributors and the adoption of new features as mentioned above. Research shows that there are three different connection networks (or graphs) inside communities such as [[Quora]]. A graph connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related questions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Gang|year=2013|title=Wisdom in the social crowd: an analysis of quora|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web. ACM|volume=|pages=1341\u20131352|doi=10.1145/2488388.2488506|isbn=9781450320351}}</ref> These connections help users find the topic that they are looking for and build a social connection with people sharing the same interests. Also, as contributors gather according to a common theme, their votes help to screen out the domain expert and the high quality questions in that field. Also, the heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant contributors to the quality of the community's knowledge base.\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n===Motivations===\nThe social capital theory, social exchange theory, and social cognitive theory<ref name=\":0\" /> explain why users continuously contribute knowledge to online social Q&A communities. On the other hand, many feel hesitant to contribute due to fear of criticism or of misleading the online community members<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ardichvili|first=Alexander|last2=Page|first2=Vaughn|last3=Wentling|first3=Tim|date=2003-03-01|title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge\u2010sharing communities of practice|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=64\u201377|doi=10.1108/13673270310463626|issn=1367-3270}}</ref> The contributors can have intrinsic or extrinsic motivation to contribute. Further, the motivations to share knowledge can be categorized into and individual-based and organization or website based motivations. Website based motivations (extrinsic) include rewards and incentives to the contributions like upvotes or coupons.<ref name=\":0\" /> Individual-based motivations (intrinsic) would constitute factors like a belief in knowledge ownership, individual characteristics, interpersonal trust, and will for justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> Specifically, two kinds of motivations drive people to participate in online Q&A: Why do people ask questions, and answer questions?\n\n'''Motivation for asking:''' While there are other ways of fulfilling information needs, more people have been asking questions in online Q&A services. What motivates people to take advantage of those systems? And what do users expect from using systems? Choi (2014) surveyed 200 people who actively asked questions on Yahoo! Answers, and asked them the motivations and expectations of asking behaviors in online Q&A system. The five most significant factors of asking behaviors in the survey are:\n* Learning; Self-education through acquiring information\n* Having fun asking a question\n* Seeking advice or opinions for making decisions\n* Finding relevant information\n* Gaining a sense of security through knowledge\n'''Expectation from askers:''' The next step regarding the cycle of question and answering behaviors is for askers to assess answers to see if answers meet their expectations from information needs. In the same survey examined by Choi (2014),<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Erik|date=|title=Motivations and Expectations for Asking Questions Within Online Q&A|url=http://www.ieee-tcdl.org/Bulletin/v9n2/papers/choi.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> the most desired factor was \u201cAdditional or alternative information (4.03 / 5)\u201d, followed by \u201cAccurate and complete information\u201d. It is interesting that factors related to information itself surpassed \u201csocial and emotional support (2.47 / 5)\u201d which is related to affective needs.\n\n'''Motivation for answering:''' Answering behaviors have raised the curiosity among researchers, because there will be no explicit compensations against the activity. Raban and Harper (2008)<ref name=\":1\" /> asked people who answered questions on social Q&A about the motivation of their answering behavior as well in the same survey. The top ranked motivations are:\n* Reputation enhancement\n* Enjoyment in helping others\n* Reciprocity\n* Knowledge self-efficacy\n* Satisfaction\n* Confirmation\n* Continuance intention\n\n===Crowdsourcing===\nQ&A software uses a sourcing model called [[crowdsourcing]] to obtain answers to the questions that are posted.[[Q&A software#cite note-8|<sup>[8]</sup>]] Crowdsourcing is the act of outsourcing work to an undefined, networked labor using an open call for participation,<ref name=\":3\">Mao, Ke; Capra, Licia; Harman, Mark; Jia, Yue; A survey of the use of crowdsourcing in software engineering.

This technique allows the user to obtain answers from a large community, with lower costs and defect rates to the developers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe user asks their question which can be answered by any member of that online community. The answers then go through an assessment, wherein the good answers are upvoted and the bad answers are downvoted by the users (or a similar parallel on different platforms).<ref>Yao, Tong, et al. \u201cDetecting high-quality posts in community question answering sites\u201d</ref> The members of the online community can find a question that needs answering to and answer that question.\n\nThis type of crowd participation in a Q&A platform has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual users, thus improving and speeding up their work process.<ref name=\":4\">Vasilescu, Bogdan, et al. \u201cStackOverflow and GitHub: Associations Between Software Development and Crowdsourced Knowledge.\u201d</ref> The abundance of information to which users are exposed through this system is effectively changing the way people collaborate, communicate and learn in online communities.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nSome other defining features of a Q&A software includes:\n* differentiation of questions and answers (features that affect answers should not affect the question)\n* differentiation of answers (replies to the question) and comments (replies to an answer)\n* user voting of answers\n* sorting of answers by votes and questions by answered status\n* approval of an answer\n* question tagging and tag search\n* marking a question as a duplicate of another one (if the event occurs)\n\n==Impact==\nQ&A sites and software as a way of coordinating development and user support activities, compared to the traditional mail list, have a significant impact on the user behavior.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Vasilescu|first=Bogdan|last2=Serebrenik|first2=Alexander|last3=Devanbu|first3=Prem|last4=Filkov|first4=Vladimir|date=2014|title=How Social Q&A Sites Are Changing Knowledge Sharing in Open Source Software Communities|journal=Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing|series=CSCW '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=342\u2013354|doi=10.1145/2531602.2531659|isbn=9781450325400}}</ref>\n\nA large number of users shift from the mail list to the Q&A software. The number of the user of Q&A significantly increased and the number of activities of the traditional mail list decreased. In addition, users of the Q&A software tend to provide answer faster.

By late December 2006, it was fully closed to new activity.\n\nIn early 2000s, Yahoo! launched its online Q&A service called [[Ask Yahoo!]], which was later replaced by the beta version of Yahoo! Answers on December 8, 2005. Ask Yahoo! was discontinued in March 2006. Yahoo! Answers give members the chance to earn points, thus encouraging user participation. To support countries using non-English characters, [[Yahoo! Answers]] operate different platforms in some Asian countries, such as Yahoo! Chiebukuro (Yahoo!\u77e5\u6075\u888b[[Help:Installing Japanese character sets|?]]) in Japan and as Yahoo! Knowledge in Korea, Taiwan, China, and Hong Kong.\n\n[[Quora]] was founded in June 2009, while the website was made available to the public on June 21, 2010. Users can collaborate by editing questions and suggesting edits to other users' answers.\n\nFrom 2010 with the widespread use of smartphones and tablets, there is an increasing number of Q&A sites that decide to launch mobile applications. Popular Q&A sites like Yahoo! Answers and Quora have launched their own mobile applications. There is also a booming of new Q&A software such as Canvass which purely rely on mobile applications as their service channel.\n\n==Motivation==\nBased on the characteristics of an online Q&A community, which including no reputation-ranking mechanism and no financial reward for users\u2019 knowledge-contribution behaviors, and no mutual interest or conflict between users, people are wondering about the reason that motivates users to contribute their knowledge on the Q&A software. Feeling safe and trusting the software and the Internet environment provides a foundation for users to share their knowledge. People who trust the software more tend to be involved more in question and answer activities. The knowledge contribution from others leads to even more people to share their knowledge. Users who read more contributed knowledge tend to contribute more generally. Users are also seeking recognition when they contribute knowledge on the Q&A software. Social rewards such as approval, status, and respect play a very important role in motivating people to contribute to the Q&A software. User's eagerness of showing their knowledge and expertise and the potential chance of being noticed by recruiters also play a role in motivating people to answer questions and contribute questions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Jin|first=Jiahua|last2=Li|first2=Yijun|last3=Zhong|first3=Xiaojia|last4=Zhai|first4=Li|date=2015-11-01|title=Why users contribute knowledge to online communities: An empirical study of an online social Q&A community|journal=Information & Management|series=Novel applications of social media analytics|volume=52|issue=7|pages=840\u2013849|doi=10.1016/j.im.2015.07.005}}</ref>{{verify source|date=December 2017}}\n\n== Classification ==\nAn online Q&A service serves the public with its ease of getting access without temporal and spatial constraints. The mechanism over all Q&A services is the same: Questioners express their information needs in the form of a question, and people (experts, or other users in the system) answer those questions based on their knowledge. Online Q&A service can be classified into several types in terms of who answer questions, and how services maintain and control the quality of information. Shah et al. (2009)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Shah|first=Chirag|last2=Oh|first2=Sanghee|last3=Oh|first3=Jung Sun|title=Research agenda for social Q&A|journal=Library & Information Science Research|language=en|volume=31|issue=4|pages=205\u2013209|doi=10.1016/j.lisr.2009.07.006|year=2009}}</ref> classified online Q&A service into three categories:\n* [[Digital reference services]]: Also known as virtual reference, it is an extended version of traditional reference service where users in the library can get help from librarians with identifying desired materials. The advantage comes from the fact that users can have access anytime without physical constraints. The current services in this type include Ask an IPL Librarian of the Internet Public Library, and the Educators\u2019 Reference Desk\n* Expert services: Organizations other than libraries offer Q&A service where experts in a specific area answer questions. Some are fee-based (e.g., NetWellness (<nowiki>http://www.netwellness.org</nowiki>), whereas others offer free-service (e.g., PickAnswer (<nowiki>http://pickanswer.com</nowiki>)\n* Social Q&A (community Q&A): In social Q&A services, any user in the community can ask or answer questions. Since a question can receive attention from many people unlike expert service, questioners are likely to benefit from the wisdom of crowds. The set of answers made by a large number of people often surpasses answers from experts in a traditional Q&A service. Harper, Raban, Rafaeli, and Konstan (2008)<ref>{{Cite book|title=Motivations for Answering Questions Online Abstract|last=Raban|first=Daphne R.|last2=Harper|first2=F. Maxwell|citeseerx = 10.1.1.119.1962}}</ref> proved that a social Q&A system ended up with a better quality of answers than those of library reference services by comparing existing services.\n\n== Online community ==\n'''The change of Q&A community features:''' Early definition described three types of Q&A Sites: \"digital reference services\", \"ask an expert service\", and \"community Q&A sites.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Maxwell|first=Harper|year=2008|title=Predictors of answer quality in online Q&A sites|url=|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems.|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> \"Ask an expert service\" represents a technological and social way of providing quality question answering service. This service is staffed by domain experts. In comparison, community Q&A sites involved everyday users in answering questions \u2013 it largely increased the number of contributors. Established examples of community Q&A sites are [[Yahoo! Answers]] and [[Quora]]. One of the problems of these communities is that it is hard to control the quality of answers compared with \"ask an expert service\".\n\nHowever, in recent years, community Q&A sites tend to embrace newer interaction designs than the other types of Q&A sites, by providing features like tagging and rating interfaces, RSS feeds, and highly interactive browsing and searching capabilities. These features used the crowd power to evaluate the quality of answers and also the reliability of the contributors. Some communities as [[Zhihu]] tags the users received highest votes in a given domain as \"Excellent answer provider\". These new features generally integrate expert verification and service into Q&A community sites.\n\n'''Social and information structure:''' Originally, Q&A communities have little structural or role-based organization. In recent years, we found that some communities started to form social and information structures. This is driven by the increasing number of contributors and the adoption of new features as mentioned above. Research shows that there are three different connection networks (or graphs) inside communities such as [[Quora]]. A graph connecting topics to users, a social graph connecting users, and a graph connecting related questions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=Gang|year=2013|title=Wisdom in the social crowd: an analysis of quora|url=|journal=Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on World Wide Web. ACM|volume=|pages=1341\u20131352|doi=10.1145/2488388.2488506|isbn=9781450320351}}</ref> These connections help users find the topic that they are looking for and build a social connection with people sharing the same interests. Also, as contributors gather according to a common theme, their votes help to screen out the domain expert and the high quality questions in that field. Also, the heterogeneity in the user and question graphs are significant contributors to the quality of the community's knowledge base.\n\n==Mechanics==\n\n===Motivations===\nThe social capital theory, social exchange theory, and social cognitive theory<ref name=\":0\" /> explain why users continuously contribute knowledge to online social Q&A communities. On the other hand, many feel hesitant to contribute due to fear of criticism or of misleading the online community members<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ardichvili|first=Alexander|last2=Page|first2=Vaughn|last3=Wentling|first3=Tim|date=2003-03-01|title=Motivation and barriers to participation in virtual knowledge\u2010sharing communities of practice|journal=Journal of Knowledge Management|volume=7|issue=1|pages=64\u201377|doi=10.1108/13673270310463626|issn=1367-3270}}</ref> The contributors can have intrinsic or extrinsic motivation to contribute. Further, the motivations to share knowledge can be categorized into and individual-based and organization or website based motivations. Website based motivations (extrinsic) include rewards and incentives to the contributions like upvotes or coupons.<ref name=\":0\" /> Individual-based motivations (intrinsic) would constitute factors like a belief in knowledge ownership, individual characteristics, interpersonal trust, and will for justice.<ref name=\":0\" /> Specifically, two kinds of motivations drive people to participate in online Q&A: Why do people ask questions, and answer questions?\n\n'''Motivation for asking:''' While there are other ways of fulfilling information needs, more people have been asking questions in online Q&A services. What motivates people to take advantage of those systems? And what do users expect from using systems? Choi (2014) surveyed 200 people who actively asked questions on Yahoo! Answers, and asked them the motivations and expectations of asking behaviors in online Q&A system. The five most significant factors of asking behaviors in the survey are:\n* Learning; Self-education through acquiring information\n* Having fun asking a question\n* Seeking advice or opinions for making decisions\n* Finding relevant information\n* Gaining a sense of security through knowledge\n'''Expectation from askers:''' The next step regarding the cycle of question and answering behaviors is for askers to assess answers to see if answers meet their expectations from information needs. In the same survey examined by Choi (2014),<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Choi|first=Erik|date=|title=Motivations and Expectations for Asking Questions Within Online Q&A|url=http://www.ieee-tcdl.org/Bulletin/v9n2/papers/choi.pdf|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> the most desired factor was \u201cAdditional or alternative information (4.03 / 5)\u201d, followed by \u201cAccurate and complete information\u201d. It is interesting that factors related to information itself surpassed \u201csocial and emotional support (2.47 / 5)\u201d which is related to affective needs.\n\n'''Motivation for answering:''' Answering behaviors have raised the curiosity among researchers, because there will be no explicit compensations against the activity. Raban and Harper (2008)<ref name=\":1\" /> asked people who answered questions on social Q&A about the motivation of their answering behavior as well in the same survey. The top ranked motivations are:\n* Reputation enhancement\n* Enjoyment in helping others\n* Reciprocity\n* Knowledge self-efficacy\n* Satisfaction\n* Confirmation\n* Continuance intention\n\n===Crowdsourcing===\nQ&A software uses a sourcing model called [[crowdsourcing]] to obtain answers to the questions that are posted.[[Q&A software#cite note-8|<sup>[8]</sup>]] Crowdsourcing is the act of outsourcing work to an undefined, networked labor using an open call for participation,<ref name=\":3\">Mao, Ke; Capra, Licia; Harman, Mark; Jia, Yue; A survey of the use of crowdsourcing in software engineering. (2016, September 20)</ref> and it is used to support the activities on most Q&A software (such as [[Stack Exchange]], Quora, etc.). This technique allows the user to obtain answers from a large community, with lower costs and defect rates to the developers.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe user asks their question which can be answered by any member of that online community. The answers then go through an assessment, wherein the good answers are upvoted and the bad answers are downvoted by the users (or a similar parallel on different platforms).<ref>Yao, Tong, et al. \u201cDetecting high-quality posts in community question answering sites\u201d</ref> The members of the online community can find a question that needs answering to and answer that question.\n\nThis type of crowd participation in a Q&A platform has the potential to increase the knowledge of individual users, thus improving and speeding up their work process.<ref name=\":4\">Vasilescu, Bogdan, et al. \u201cStackOverflow and GitHub: Associations Between Software Development and Crowdsourced Knowledge.\u201d</ref> The abundance of information to which users are exposed through this system is effectively changing the way people collaborate, communicate and learn in online communities.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nSome other defining features of a Q&A software includes:\n* differentiation of questions and answers (features that affect answers should not affect the question)\n* differentiation of answers (replies to the question) and comments (replies to an answer)\n* user voting of answers\n* sorting of answers by votes and questions by answered status\n* approval of an answer\n* question tagging and tag search\n* marking a question as a duplicate of another one (if the event occurs)\n\n==Impact==\nQ&A sites and software as a way of coordinating development and user support activities, compared to the traditional mail list, have a significant impact on the user behavior.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Vasilescu|first=Bogdan|last2=Serebrenik|first2=Alexander|last3=Devanbu|first3=Prem|last4=Filkov|first4=Vladimir|date=2014|title=How Social Q&A Sites Are Changing Knowledge Sharing in Open Source Software Communities|journal=Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work & Social Computing|series=CSCW '14|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=342\u2013354|doi=10.1145/2531602.2531659|isbn=9781450325400}}</ref>\n\nA large number of users shift from the mail list to the Q&A software. The number of the user of Q&A significantly increased and the number of activities of the traditional mail list decreased. In addition, users of the Q&A software tend to provide answer faster. Because Q&A software and websites are considered forms of crowdsourcing systems, it's inevitable that they have wide-ranging impacts that can be either positive or negative.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Comparison of Q&A software==\nA complete comparison of Q&A sites can be found in the wiki pages listed below. {{see also|Comparison of Q&A sites|Comparison of wiki software}}\n\nOnly self-hostable solutions are in scope for this table.<ref>There are potentially more. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/37953</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 85%; width: auto; table-layout: fixed;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width: 12em\" |\n!

The mausoleum contains the body of Nina Craigmiles, a seven-year-old who died on October 18, 1871, when a horse buggy in which she was riding was struck by a train. Her father, John Craigmiles, constructed the church and mausoleum in Nina's memory. He named the church St. Luke's because the girl died on St. Luke's Day.<ref>Kazek, Kelly (2011).

The term 'land' includes buildings and other structures upon the land.<ref>Land Registration (Scotland) Act 2012 s.113, ''meaning of land.''</ref>  The missives of sale form the first of three stages required to validly transfer ownership of land in Scotland. The three stages are: \n\n# The Contractual Stage (The Missives of Sale) \n# The Conveyancing Stage\n# The Registration Stage\n\n== The Missives of Sale ==\nThe first stage of a voluntary transfer is contractual in nature, where parties negotiate the formal contract of sale between the owner (the Seller) and the Buyer. In Scots law, this contract is known as a \"missive of sale\" and typically are a series of formal letters with each parties offers and qualifications (containing conditions needed to be complied by either party). With the corporeal heritable property, the nature of its property's usage will reflect on the missives of sale, especially where the property is residential or commercial property.\n\n=== Requirements of Written Contract ===\nUnder the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/contents Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995], a written document is required for the creation of a contract for transfer, variation or extinction of a real right in land.<ref>Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995 section 1(2(a(i))).</ref> As ownership is a real right, a written contract is required.

However, it is usually common practice to ''qualify'' an acceptance by the making of further conditions.

All prospective buyers will typically submit an offer outlining their purchase price and any conditions to be complied with by the Seller, such as the Buyer having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as [[white goods]]) in the sale of the property. Only any moveable property that has acceeded to the heritable property will be included in the transfer automatically. Prior to any ''closing date'', the date on which the Seller decides to stop receiving offers, the buyers will submit offers to purchase the corporeal heritable property. The Seller will then review the offers made by the prospective buyers and choose a preferred buyer and will respond to this preferred buyer's offer. This response, called the acceptance, may accept the offer outright, known as a ''simple'' or ''de plano acceptance,'' resulting in a binding contract between the parties in Scots law. However, as discussed above, it is common for the response to be a qualified acceptance in order to avoid creating a binding missives of sale at an early stage.  \n\n=== The Scottish Standard Clauses ===\nBecause of the individualistic nature of offers of sale/offers to purchase, the system of missives in residential property became liable to complexity. Over time, standard styles (templates) became used in localities and across Sheriffdoms in an effort to simplify the missives stage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sinclair, Euan,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1100869226|title=Conveyancing practice in Scotland.|isbn=978-1-78043-943-3|edition=Seventh edition.|location=London|oclc=1100869226}}</ref> The Law Society of Scotland's Property Committee has built on this work which culminated with the publication of the '''Scottish Standard Clauses'''.

The Scottish Standard Clauses are registered as a public document in the Books of Council and Session for all solicitors in Scotland to incorporate them into the missives of sale to simplify the process. However there is nothing to preclude a solicitor from using their own drafting in the missives of sale of property.\n\n== Commercial Property Missives of Sale ==\nCommercial Property transactions may involve planning permissions and other legal requirements under planning law prior to the usage of land as a commercial property. As such, the missives of commercial property may have numerous conditions and complex terms, leading to a large amount of contractual negotiations. The Property Standardisation Group was formed by four law firms, [[CMS (law firm)|CMS]] (formerly known as [[Dundas & Wilson]]), [[Dentons]] (formerly known as [[Maclay Murray & Spens]]), [[Pinsent Masons]] (formerly known as [[McGrigors]]), and [[Shepherd and Wedderburn]] in 2001 in a combined effort to produce common agreed styles (templates) for transactions of commercial heritable property in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> These templates are available to view on the Property Standardisation Group website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nCommercial transactions usually operate by the sharing of a draft agreement between the parties agents, now commonly done online on secure [[Cloud computing|cloud softwares]] where both parties' agents can amend the document or by e-mail exchange of draft documents between agents, until the agreement of a draft missives of sale.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue),'' Chapter 2, para 8. </ref> The parties, or their authorised agents, can then formally sign and bind the parties to the contract in line with the the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/contents Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995]. \n\n== Property Sold at Auction (Public Roup) ==\nHeritable property may also be sold at an auction, called a ''roup'' in Scots law. The Seller prepares a standard contract that is exhibited to the bidders in advance of the auction.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref> The winning bidder at the roup, signs a ''minute of enactment and preference'' to bind himself to the pre-prepared contract and becomes the Buyer.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref>\n\n== Conclusion of Missives ==\nOnce the parties contractual negotiations have concluded, a contract will be validly created where, as discussed above, a party makes a simple acceptance to another party's offer, which can incorporate acceptance to any previous qualified acceptances/offers conditions made. This is known as the \"conclusion of missives\" and ends the contractual stage of the [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Voluntary Transfer|voluntary transfer of land]]. The conclusion of missives typically takes a few weeks due to the due diligence process that each party must undertake before the creation of a legally binding agreement.<ref>Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue)'', Ch 2, ''Missives and Other Obligations,'' para 9. </ref> However, it should be noted that the parties only have a personal right '''at the point the missives conclude''', there is no enforceable right against the Buyer or Seller until then.  Following the conclusion of missives, the Buyer will only have a personal right against the Seller '''not''' a [[Scots property law#Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law|real right (right in rem)]]. \n\nOnce the missives have concluded, the parties in a voluntary transfer of land can move to the registration stage. After conclusion, the missives, as an enforceable contract, may only be revoked  by written discharge of the two parties.<ref>''Inglis v Lowrie'' ''1990 SLT (Sh Ct) 60''</ref> Should the parties wish to amend rather than discharge the missives and enter into a new contract, they may apply to the [[Sheriff court|Sheriff Court]] or [[Court of Session]] for a rectification order under [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985] section 8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents/data.htm|title=Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory Personal Bar ==\nA statutory personal bar exists in Scots law in relation to written contracts, similar to the concept of ''[[Estoppel|esoppel]]'' in other jurisdictions. This protection allows an otherwise invalid contract to be held valid and enforceable where parties have acted in reliance of the contract with material (financial or otherwise) consequences. Under the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/3 Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995,] section 1(3) and 1(4) provides that: <blockquote>\"'''Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995''' \n\n'''Section 1(3)'''\n\nWhere a contract, obligation or trust mentioned in subsection (2)(a) [''list of situations where writings are required''l] above is not constituted in a document complying with section 2 [written document] or, as the case may be, section 9B [''electronic documents''] of this Act, <u>but one of the parties to the contract</u>, a creditor in the obligation or a beneficiary under the trust (\u201cthe first person\u201d) has <u>acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust <u>with the knowledge</u> and <u>acquiescence</u> of the other party to the contract, the <u>debtor</u> in the obligation or the truster (\u201cthe second person\u201d)\u2014\n(a)the second person shall <u>not be entitled to withdraw from the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust; and\n\n(b)the contract, obligation or trust <u>shall not be regarded as invalid</u>,\n\non the ground that it is not so constituted, if the condition set out in subsection (4) below is satisfied.\n\n'''Section 1(4)'''\n\n(4)The condition referred to in '''subsection (3)''' above is that the position of the <u>first person</u>\u2014\n\n(a)as a <u>result of acting or refraining from acting</u> as mentioned in that subsection <u>has been affected</u> to a <u>material exten</u>t; and\n\n(b)as a <u>result of such a withdrawal</u> as is mentioned in that subsection <u>would be adversely affected</u> to a <u>material extent</u>.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/1/data.htm|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>[''brackets and <u>underlines</u> added]'' </blockquote>This means where the missives of sale were not created in compliance to the 1995 Act, such as by informal writings or oral agreement, can still be enforceable against a person where the the other party has: \n\n# '''Has acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contract,''' (eg: s''econd party is the seller who has made an offer to purchase a house because he believed his house to be sold,  the second party is the buyer who has made arrangements to leave her current property'') \n# '''the second person knew of the party's actions,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) was told that the person (Seller) was going to purchase another house, the second person (Buyer) told the person (Seller) that she was going to make arrangements to leave property)'' \n# '''The second person acquiesced to this acting or refraining from acting,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) did not object to the Seller making a purchase another house, the second person (Seller) did not object to the Buyer quitting her current property and ceasing searching for another property)'' \n# '''as a result of the acting or refraining from acting, the first person has been affected to a <u>material</u> extent.''' (eg: ''the first person (Seller) has now entered into a contract of sale, the first person (Buyer) has incurred cancellation costs and other fees)'' \n\nThe first party then has to prove that if the second party does withdraw from the invalid contract, the first party would be '''<u>adversely affected</u>''' to a material extent.

NB: This is an Outer House judgment and may be overruled by a subsequent new case in the Inner House or United Kingdom Supreme Court. </ref>  Lord Kirkwood held that once one of the parties indicated he was no longer prepared to contract, the other party can create the contract by accepting ''de plano'' an existing offer.<ref>''1990 SC 38''</ref> However, the onus will be on the party who made the offer to prove that timeous notice of withdrawal of the offer was communicated to the other party's agent before any valid acceptance ''de plano'' is made.<ref>''1990 SC 389''</ref> It is not possible in Scots law for a party to withdraw their own qualifications to an offer once these qualifications have been received by the other party, and then to send a new ''de plano'' acceptance to the other party's offer in an attempt to create a valid contract which could not have been concluded previously.<ref>''Rutterford Ltd v Allied Breweries Ltd'' ''1990 SCLR 186, 1990 SLT 249, OH''.</ref> \n\n== Residential Property ==\nIn cases of residential property (typically, but not limited to, houses/flats with adjacent land), the Seller will place the property for sale on the market through an estate agent of solicitor firm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mygov.scot/buying-a-home/|title=Buying a home: the legal process - mygov.scot|website=www.mygov.scot|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Home Report ===\nDepending on the nature of the residential property, the Seller typically must obtain a home report (including a questionnaire and [[Home survey|survey report]]) when placing the property on the market,<ref>Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 s.98; The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008.</ref> excluding:<ref>See The Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 (Prescribed Documents) Regulations 2008.</ref>\n\n* Property for sale as part of a portfolio.\n* Seasonal and holiday accommodation.\n* Property for sale alongside or ancillary to non-residential property.\n* Property used for both residential and non-residential use\n* Property which is unoccupied and unsafe for occupation\n* Property which has not been previously used as a house before.\n\n=== Missives Process in Residential Property Transactions ===\nThe Seller may advertise the property on the market at a fixed price or use a blind-bidding system whereby multiple offerers silently bid against each other without knowledge of the other offeror's offered purchase price.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mygov.scot/buying-a-home/|title=Buying a home: the legal process - mygov.scot|website=www.mygov.scot|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref> The offeror, if they wish to purchase the property, will submit a formal written offer through their solicitor to the Seller's agents to purchase the residential property.  All prospective buyers will typically submit an offer outlining their purchase price and any conditions to be complied with by the Seller, such as the Buyer having sight of reports on the property or the inclusion of any moveable property (such as [[white goods]]) in the sale of the property. Only any moveable property that has acceeded to the heritable property will be included in the transfer automatically. Prior to any ''closing date'', the date on which the Seller decides to stop receiving offers, the buyers will submit offers to purchase the corporeal heritable property. The Seller will then review the offers made by the prospective buyers and choose a preferred buyer and will respond to this preferred buyer's offer. This response, called the acceptance, may accept the offer outright, known as a ''simple'' or ''de plano acceptance,'' resulting in a binding contract between the parties in Scots law. However, as discussed above, it is common for the response to be a qualified acceptance in order to avoid creating a binding missives of sale at an early stage.  \n\n=== The Scottish Standard Clauses ===\nBecause of the individualistic nature of offers of sale/offers to purchase, the system of missives in residential property became liable to complexity. Over time, standard styles (templates) became used in localities and across Sheriffdoms in an effort to simplify the missives stage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sinclair, Euan,|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1100869226|title=Conveyancing practice in Scotland.|isbn=978-1-78043-943-3|edition=Seventh edition.|location=London|oclc=1100869226}}</ref> The Law Society of Scotland's Property Committee has built on this work which culminated with the publication of the '''Scottish Standard Clauses'''.

The Scottish Standard Clauses are registered as a public document in the Books of Council and Session for all solicitors in Scotland to incorporate them into the missives of sale to simplify the process. However there is nothing to preclude a solicitor from using their own drafting in the missives of sale of property.\n\n== Commercial Property Missives of Sale ==\nCommercial Property transactions may involve planning permissions and other legal requirements under planning law prior to the usage of land as a commercial property. As such, the missives of commercial property may have numerous conditions and complex terms, leading to a large amount of contractual negotiations. The Property Standardisation Group was formed by four law firms, [[CMS (law firm)|CMS]] (formerly known as [[Dundas & Wilson]]), [[Dentons]] (formerly known as [[Maclay Murray & Spens]]), [[Pinsent Masons]] (formerly known as [[McGrigors]]), and [[Shepherd and Wedderburn]] in 2001 in a combined effort to produce common agreed styles (templates) for transactions of commercial heritable property in Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref> These templates are available to view on the Property Standardisation Group website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.psglegal.co.uk/|title=The Property Standardisation Group|website=www.psglegal.co.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>\n\nCommercial transactions usually operate by the sharing of a draft agreement between the parties agents, now commonly done online on secure [[Cloud computing|cloud softwares]] where both parties' agents can amend the document or by e-mail exchange of draft documents between agents, until the agreement of a draft missives of sale.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue),'' Chapter 2, para 8. </ref> The parties, or their authorised agents, can then formally sign and bind the parties to the contract in line with the the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/contents Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995]. \n\n== Property Sold at Auction (Public Roup) ==\nHeritable property may also be sold at an auction, called a ''roup'' in Scots law. The Seller prepares a standard contract that is exhibited to the bidders in advance of the auction.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref> The winning bidder at the roup, signs a ''minute of enactment and preference'' to bind himself to the pre-prepared contract and becomes the Buyer.<ref>Stair Memorial Encylopaedia, Vol 18, ''Property'', Ch.4, ''Corporeal Heritable Property'', para 641.</ref>\n\n== Conclusion of Missives ==\nOnce the parties contractual negotiations have concluded, a contract will be validly created where, as discussed above, a party makes a simple acceptance to another party's offer, which can incorporate acceptance to any previous qualified acceptances/offers conditions made. This is known as the \"conclusion of missives\" and ends the contractual stage of the [[Draft:Ownership of Property in Scots Law#Voluntary Transfer|voluntary transfer of land]]. The conclusion of missives typically takes a few weeks due to the due diligence process that each party must undertake before the creation of a legally binding agreement.<ref>Stair Memorial Encyclopaedia, ''Conveyancing (2nd reissue)'', Ch 2, ''Missives and Other Obligations,'' para 9. </ref> However, it should be noted that the parties only have a personal right '''at the point the missives conclude''', there is no enforceable right against the Buyer or Seller until then.  Following the conclusion of missives, the Buyer will only have a personal right against the Seller '''not''' a [[Scots property law#Recognised Property Rights in Scots Law|real right (right in rem)]]. \n\nOnce the missives have concluded, the parties in a voluntary transfer of land can move to the registration stage. After conclusion, the missives, as an enforceable contract, may only be revoked  by written discharge of the two parties.<ref>''Inglis v Lowrie'' ''1990 SLT (Sh Ct) 60''</ref> Should the parties wish to amend rather than discharge the missives and enter into a new contract, they may apply to the [[Sheriff court|Sheriff Court]] or [[Court of Session]] for a rectification order under [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985] section 8.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1985/73/contents/data.htm|title=Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-26}}</ref>\n\n== Statutory Personal Bar ==\nA statutory personal bar exists in Scots law in relation to written contracts, similar to the concept of ''[[Estoppel|esoppel]]'' in other jurisdictions. This protection allows an otherwise invalid contract to be held valid and enforceable where parties have acted in reliance of the contract with material (financial or otherwise) consequences. Under the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/3 Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995,] section 1(3) and 1(4) provides that: <blockquote>\"'''Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995''' \n\n'''Section 1(3)'''\n\nWhere a contract, obligation or trust mentioned in subsection (2)(a) [''list of situations where writings are required''l] above is not constituted in a document complying with section 2 [written document] or, as the case may be, section 9B [''electronic documents''] of this Act, <u>but one of the parties to the contract</u>, a creditor in the obligation or a beneficiary under the trust (\u201cthe first person\u201d) has <u>acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust <u>with the knowledge</u> and <u>acquiescence</u> of the other party to the contract, the <u>debtor</u> in the obligation or the truster (\u201cthe second person\u201d)\u2014\n(a)the second person shall <u>not be entitled to withdraw from the contrac</u>t, obligation or trust; and\n\n(b)the contract, obligation or trust <u>shall not be regarded as invalid</u>,\n\non the ground that it is not so constituted, if the condition set out in subsection (4) below is satisfied.\n\n'''Section 1(4)'''\n\n(4)The condition referred to in '''subsection (3)''' above is that the position of the <u>first person</u>\u2014\n\n(a)as a <u>result of acting or refraining from acting</u> as mentioned in that subsection <u>has been affected</u> to a <u>material exten</u>t; and\n\n(b)as a <u>result of such a withdrawal</u> as is mentioned in that subsection <u>would be adversely affected</u> to a <u>material extent</u>.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1995/7/section/1/data.htm|title=Requirements of Writing (Scotland) Act 1995|last=Participation|first=Expert|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|access-date=2020-04-25}}</ref>[''brackets and <u>underlines</u> added]'' </blockquote>This means where the missives of sale were not created in compliance to the 1995 Act, such as by informal writings or oral agreement, can still be enforceable against a person where the the other party has: \n\n# '''Has acted or refrained from acting in reliance on the contract,''' (eg: s''econd party is the seller who has made an offer to purchase a house because he believed his house to be sold,  the second party is the buyer who has made arrangements to leave her current property'') \n# '''the second person knew of the party's actions,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) was told that the person (Seller) was going to purchase another house, the second person (Buyer) told the person (Seller) that she was going to make arrangements to leave property)'' \n# '''The second person acquiesced to this acting or refraining from acting,''' (eg: ''the second person (Buyer) did not object to the Seller making a purchase another house, the second person (Seller) did not object to the Buyer quitting her current property and ceasing searching for another property)'' \n# '''as a result of the acting or refraining from acting, the first person has been affected to a <u>material</u> extent.''' (eg: ''the first person (Seller) has now entered into a contract of sale, the first person (Buyer) has incurred cancellation costs and other fees)'' \n\nThe first party then has to prove that if the second party does withdraw from the invalid contract, the first party would be '''<u>adversely affected</u>''' to a material extent. As always in [[Scots civil procedure|Scots civil law]], the first person must prove the above statutory burden of proof on the balance of probabilities that it occurred. \n<br />[[Category:[[Scots law]]] {{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "name_user": "Kentigern1136", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStatutory Personal Bar", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missives_(Scots_law)"}

He became the [[List of Governors of New York|46th governor of New York]] in December 1942, and was the first [[Italian-American]] governor in the United States.\n\nBorn in [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre, Vermont]] to Italian immigrants, Poletti graduated from Barre's [[Spaulding High School (Barre, Vermont)|Spaulding High School]], [[Harvard University]], and [[Harvard Law School]], and became an attorney in [[New York City]]. He became active in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and served as counsel to the [[Democratic National Committee]], counsel to Governor [[Herbert H. Lehman]], and a Justice of the [[New York State Supreme Court]].\n\nPoletti served as [[Lieutenant Governor of New York|lieutenant governor of New York]] from 1939 to 1942. He lost his bid for reelection in 1942, as did gubernatorial nominee [[John J. Bennett, Jr.]]. In December, Lehman resigned as governor in order to accept an appointment with the [[United States Department of State]]; Poletti succeeded to the governorship and served the final month of Lehman's term. After leaving office, Poletti served in [[World War II]], initially as a special assistant to the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], and then in the [[United States Army]] as a Civil Affairs officer responsible for rebuilding and restoring democracy in [[Italy]] following its liberation by the Allies.\n\nAfter the war, Poletti practiced law, served as a member of the [[New York Power Authority|New York State Power Authority]], and was an executive responsible for planning and overseeing execution of foreign exhibits at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]]. After retiring, he resided in [[Florida]] and [[Elizabethtown, New York]]. He died in Florida at age 99, and was buried in Elizabethtown. At the time of his death, he was the earliest-serving living former governor of a U.S. state.\n\n==Early life and education==\nAldo Charles Poletti was born in [[Barre (city), Vermont|Barre, Vermont]] to Dino Poletti (April 28, 1865, [[Pogno|Pogno, Italy]]\u2014February 12, 1922, Barre, Vermont) and Carolina (Gervasini) Poletti.

Analysis of terrain, the probable [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) threat, and PAVN armored actions during [[Operation Lam Son 719]] made it clear that armored units would continue to be needed in this area.

During Lam Son 719, armored vehicles had proven vulnerable to individual antitank weapons when not protected by infantry. The JGS had therefore directed an addition to the regiment, a 270-man armored rifle company. Ninety riflemen were assigned to each tank squadron and were to ride on the outside of the tanks, providing local security. Other changes in the tank regiment's organization and equipment included the addition of tracked [[M548]] ammunition and fuel cargo vehicles, elimination of the regimental scout platoon, for which a five-vehicle security section was substituted, and elimination of the armored vehicle-launched bridge section and all infrared fire control equipment. Later six [[Xenon arc lamp|xenon searchlights]] per squadron were authorized after advisers questioned the wisdom of limiting $15 million worth of fighting equipment to daytime use by refusing to spend $300,000 on searchlights. Unfortunately, the decision to dispense with the vehicle-launched bridge section was not reconsidered, and lack of bridging during the PAVN offensive proved a major factor in the loss of tanks.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|203\u20134}}\n\nTraining for the 20th Regiment began at [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Combat Base|\u00c1i T\u1eed Combat Base]] near [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb (town)|Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb]], but proceeded slowly because of many problems, particularly in maintenance. About 60 percent of the tanks received by the regiment had serious deficiencies beyond the repair capability of the tank crews. Repair parts and technical manuals were missing and the language barrier prevented US instructors from communicating adequately with the Vietnamese crewmen. On 1 November a gunnery program based on US tank standards got under way. Unfortunately, the inexperienced tank crews had difficulty in comprehending the integrated functioning of the [[Rangefinder]] and ballistic computer. Partly because of their experience with the [[M41 Walker Bulldog|M41]] tank, which had no rangefinder, Vietnamese commanders at first could not be convinced of the rangefinder's value. Rapid troop turnover and manpower shortages also adversely affected crew performance. Training therefore made slow headway, with many reversions to basic lessons. By 25 January 1972 gunnery training ended, with 41 of 51 available crews qualifying, using test criteria as rigorous as those used for US units. Unit tactical training began in the foothills west of Quang Tri on 1 February and was judged successful in its later stages. A recurring problem during tactical testing was the Vietnamese inclination to disregard maintenance before, during, and after an operation. Continued emphasis on maintenance resulted in some improvement, but standards remained below acceptable levels, even after the unit completed its training. The regiment's final tactical test, a field training exercise, was to be conducted by the South Vietnamese Armor Command along US lines, with the proviso that any portion not completed correctly was to be repeated. Several problems delayed the exercise past its scheduled starting date of 13 March 1972. Poor weather during the gunnery phase, the necessity for some tactical retraining at the troop level, and the lack of [[M88 Recovery Vehicle]]s and M548 tracked cargo vehicles to carry fuel combined to cause setbacks. Finally, after devoting several days to vehicle maintenance, the regiment began its training test on 27 March.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|204}}\n\n===Easter Offensive===\nIn the early morning hours of 30 March 1972 devasting PAVN rocket, mortar and artillery fire fell on every ARVN fire support base in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]. The bombardment continued all day, and late in the day the northernmost bases reported PAVN tanks and infantry moving south across the [[Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone]] (DMZ). The artillery offensive was followed by infantry and armor attacks in the east across the [[Ben Hai River]] following the axis of [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|Route 1]] in the west toward the district capital of [[Cam L\u1ed9 District|Cam L\u1ed9]] and [[Camp Carroll]]. Elements of the PAVN [[304th Division (Vietnam)|304th]] and [[308th Division (Vietnam)|308th Division]]s, three separate infantry regiments of the B5 Front, two tank regiments, and at least one sapper battalion were later identified among the attacking forces. Initially then, the PAVN concentrated a numerical advantage of more than three to one over the defending ARVN [[3rd Division (South Vietnam)|3rd Division]] and attacked forces which were disposed to counter the infiltration and raid tactics heretofore employed by the PAVN in the DMZ area.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|204\u20135}}\n\nThe tactical situation on 30 March was confused; the 3rd Division received vague and conflicting reports from fire bases at an astonishing rate. Just before noon the 20th Tank Regiment received a frantic message from Headquarters, I Corps, ordering it to return to Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb. Since no explanation was given, Major General Nguyen Van Toan, Chief of Armor, and his American adviser, Colonel Raymond R. Battreall, Jr., flew to Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb to see General [[Vu Van Giai]], the 3rd Division commander. There they learned that the western fire bases near the DMZ had been overrun in a preclude to what was apparently a major PAVN offensive. Since the main attack had not yet been identified, and since no one was sure where the tank regiment would be of the most value, General Toan persuaded General Giai not to commit the 20th Regiment prematurely but to hold it as a division reserve or for use as a counterattack force. He also convinced General Giai that he should permit the unit to stand down for maintenance before its commitment. With that determined, the regiment, then conducting its final coordinated assault phase of the training exercise, completed the assault, did a right flank on the objective (out of line formation and into a column), and, without stopping, returned to \u00c1i T\u1eed Combat Base.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|205\u20136}}\n\nBy early morning of 1 April most of the outlying firebases along the DMZ and in western Qu\u1ea3ng Tri Province had been evacuated or overrun, leaving no friendly positions north of the Mieu Giang and Cua Viet rivers. Poor weather prevented air support and contributed to the relative ease with which the PAVN pushed back the South Vietnamese. The PAVN forces advanced south with impunity. By late afternoon on 1 April [[Mai Loc Camp]] and Camp Carroll, south of the Mieu Giang River, were under heavy attack. Frantically redeploying the three infantry regiments, one cavalry regiment, and two [[Republic of Vietnam Marine Division|Vietnamese Marine]] brigades at his disposal, General Giai established a defensive line along the south bank of the Mieu Giang. In an effort to stabilize the situation, he committed the 20th Tank Regiment on the morning of 1 April with the mission of relieving the embattled 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment and attached infantry units then fighting around Cam Lo, along [[National Route 9 (Vietnam)|Route 9]]. After joining a South Vietnamese Marine battalion, the tank regiment moved north from \u00c1i T\u1eed along Highway 1 towards [[\u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0]]. Poor traffic control and refugees congesting the route forced the regiment to move cross-country to the southwest of \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0, and in so doing it surprised and routed a PAVN ambush along Route 9. Prisoners taken during this action were dismounted members of a PAVN tank unit whose mission was to seize and man South Vietnamese armored vehicles expected to be captured in the offensive. With its 44 operational tanks, the regiment moved on toward Cam Lo, which was burning. As darkness approached, the unit set up a defensive position southeast of Cam Lo Village, withstanding PAVN probes throughout the night.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|206\u20137}}\n\nAt daybreak on 2 April, the regiment received reports that a large PAVN tank column was moving south across the [[B\u1ebfn H\u1ea3i River]] toward the bridge at \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0. About 09:00 the commander, Colonel Nguyen Huu Ly, received permission to move to \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0, then north across the bridge to engage the PAVN forces. When he reached the town he found PAVN infantry already occupying positions on the north bank of the Mieu Giang River that prevented his crossing the bridge. He deployed the regiment around the town of \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0, with the 1st Squadron in a blocking position on the high ground about 3&nbsp;km to the west, the 2nd Squadron to the south, and the 3rd Squadron defending positions within the town to prevent PAVN elements from crossing the bridge. About noon men of the 1st Squadron, from their vantage point on the high ground to the west, suddenly observed a PAVN tank and infantry column moving south along Highway 1 toward \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0. Moving their tanks into concealed positions, they waited as the PAVN tanks moved closer. At a range of 2,500 to 3,000 meters, the South Vietnamese tankers opened fire, quickly destroying nine [[PT-76]] tanks and two [[T-54]] tanks. The PAVN unit, which by its column formation showed that it was not expecting an attack, was thrown into confusion. Unable to see their adversaries, the North Vietnamese crewmen maneuvered their tanks wildly as the South Vietnamese tank gunners destroyed them one by one. The accompanying infantry dispersed, and the surviving T-54 tanks turned and headed north without firing a single shot. The ARVN regimental headquarters, monitoring the North Vietnamese radio net at that time, heard the PAVN commander express surprised disbelief at losing his tanks to cannon he could not see. The steady deterioration of the tactical situation around \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 was arrested by the arrival of the 1st Armor Brigade headquarters. Although the brigade headquarters had been in the area solely to monitor the 20th Tank Regiment's training exercise, it was a well-trained organization, possessing the armored vehicles and radios needed by General Giai to establish control of the scattered forces and direct the defense he hoped to establish at \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0. General Toan had urged its employment, and on the afternoon of 2 April the brigade, under 3rd Division control, assumed command of all armored, infantry, and Marine forces in the \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 area. Its units included the regiment, two squadrons of the 17th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 2nd and 57th Regiments of the 3rd Division, the 3rd Battalion of the 258th Marine Corps Brigade, and the survivors of the 56th Regiment from Camp Carroll.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|207\u20138}}  \nThe bridge spanning the Mieu Giang River at \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 afforded the PAVN the opportunity to cross the river unimpeded and then drive straight south to Quang Tri City. Before the armor brigade headquarters arrived, the 3rd Division engineers had made two unsuccessful attempts to destroy the bridge with explosive charges. When Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, the 1st Armor Brigade commander, arrived he decided to leave the bridge intact for the time being, since the PAVN had been stopped and the armor brigade forces were holding. Colonel Luat was preparing to make a counterattack to the north across the bridge when the bridge charges detonated and dropped the near span, putting an end to any counterattack plans.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|208}}  \n[[File:T-59 VC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Type 59 tank]] captured by the regiment on 9 April 1972]] \nOther PAVN forces continued to move south towards \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 on the afternoon of 2 April, engaged first by limited tactical air strikes and then by artillery, mortar and tank fire. A large search and rescue effort had been launched for the crew of a [[Rescue of Bat 21 Bravo|US aircraft downed near Cam Lo]]. The U.S. Air Force temporary no-fire zone was 27&nbsp;km in diameter, encompassing nearly the entire combat area and South Vietnamese defenders were unable for several hours to call for artillery support or tactical air strikes against the onrushing PAVN. The PAVN therefore had an opportunity to advance artillery, tanks, and infantry until 22:00, when the restriction was lifted. During the next several days, PAVN activity was relatively light, with sporadic attacks by fire and numerous small ground actions. The PAVN artillery fire was extremely accurate, and although South Vietnamese units moved frequently to avoid the shelling the PAVN seemed to be able to locate new positions very quickly. Although South Vietnamese units conducted attacks to eliminate pockets of resistance south of the Mieu Giang River, the pressure from the north remained intense. The next tank combat occurred on the 9th when all three squadrons of the 20th Tank Regiment fought PAVN armor. The 1st Squadron, shifted several kilometers west of \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 six days earlier, occupied high ground overlooking an important road junction along Route 9. The tankers engaged an infantry unit supported by 10 tanks at ranges up to 2,800 meters. A few answering shots fell short, and the PAVN tanks scattered, several bogging down in the rice paddies near the road. Eventually 8 were destroyed. In all, the regiment destroyed 16 T-54 tanks and captured one [[Type 59 tank]] that day, in turn suffering nothing more than superficial damage to several M48's. For the next two weeks the South Vietnamese carried out clearing operations interrupted by frequent engagements with PAVN armor and infantry which normally withdrew in the late afternoon. Nights were punctuated by artillery, mortar, and rocket attacks on South Vietnamese positions throughout the area. The defensive lines established on 2 April continued to hold, and on 11 April the 1st Armor Brigade was augmented by the arrival of the 18th Armored Cavalry Regiment from [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]]. By 14 April the 3rd Division controlled five regimental size South Vietnamese task forces, including units of the 4th, 11th, 17th and 18th Cavalry Regiments and the 20th Tank Regiment. On 23 April, several kilometers west of Dong Ha, the 2nd Squadron, 20th Tank Regiment was attacked by an infantry-tank force using a new weapon, the Soviet [[9M14 Malyutka|AT-3 \u2018\u2019Sagger\u2019\u2019]] wire-guided missile, destroying an M48A3 tank and an [[M113 armored personnel carrier|armored cavalry assault vehicle]] (ACAV). A second ACAV was damaged. At first the ARVN tankers seemed fascinated by the missile's slow and erratic flight. Through trial and error, however, the troops soon learned to engage the launch site of the AT-3 with tank main gun fire and to move their vehicles in evasive maneuvers.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|209\u201310}}\n\nOn 27 April heralded by massive artillery attacks with 122mm rockets and [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130mm guns]], a new PAVN offensive began against South Vietnamese positions all along the Mieu Giang-Cua Viet River defense line. The barrage was quickly followed by violent attacks by PAVN infantry and armor, met by equally determined resistance on the part of the South Vietnamese defenders. The 3rd Squadron, 20th Regiment, supporting the [[Vietnamese Rangers|5th Ranger Group]], received the brunt of the attack and was soon heavily engaged. By midmorning all officers of the 3rd Squadron had been killed or wounded, and 3 M48A3 tanks had been destroyed by AT-3 missiles. All along the defensive line, units were being overrun or pushed back. Forced to yield ground, Ranger and tank elements gradually withdrew to the southeast. Although losses were heavy on both sides, the numerically superior PAVN continued their drive, and by nightfall had pushed almost 4&nbsp;km south of \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0. In the early morning of 28 April, the regiment had 18 operational M48A3 tanks. During the South Vietnamese withdrawal the accurate gunnery of the 3rd Squadron cost the PAVN 5 T-54 tanks. At that point the South Vietnamese found large PAVN forces to their rear and for the armored units the withdrawal became an attack to the south. The 2nd Squadron attacking south to secure the bridge over the Vinh Phuoc River at midmorning on the 28th, was badly battered in a PAVN ambush. The commander lost control of his unit and the surviving vehicles, after crossing the bridge, continued to the south in disarray. It was then obvious to Colonel Luat that 1st Armored Brigade units were threatened with encirclement, so the entire force began moving south. All along the way fighting was heavy for the next two days. The terrain as well as the PAVN took its toll of vehicles. At the Vinh Phuoc River 7 vehicles were stranded on the north shore when the bridge, struck by PAVN artillery fire, collapsed.  Farther south at the [[Th\u1ea1ch H\u00e3n River]] near Qu\u1ea3ng Tri, the bridges were already destroyed. 2 tanks were lost there in fording the river on the 30th. By then the tank and cavalry units were beginning their fifth day of almost constant fighting. South of Qu\u1ea3ng Tri resupply of fuel and ammunition was nonexistent as the armored force continued its attack. Forced from the highway by the PAVN, the tanks and assault vehicles moved cross-country, falling victim to the many rice paddies, canal crossings, and streams as well as the antitank rockets and artillery. On the first day of May the vehicles began to run out of gas. Finally, on 2 May, having fought their way through the last PAVN units, the battered survivors of the armor command, intermingled with the remnants of other army units, reached Camp Evans at midafternoon. Only armored cavalry assault vehicles were left; the cavalry regiments and the tank regiment had lost all their tanks. The regiment was reduced to a demoralized, dismounted, and defeated unit. Employed primarily in a static, defensive role in frontline areas, the unit had steadily lost men and equipment without receiving replacements. Although vastly outnumbered, cavalry, infantry, tank, and Marine units of the 1st Armor Brigade, as well as tenacious [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Regional Forces]] and [[South Vietnamese Popular Force|Popular Forces]] to the east, had succeeded in slowing the momentum of the massive North Vietnamese invasion. With assistance from US and Vietnamese tactical air forces, they provided the resistance that delayed the PAVN until enough reinforcements could be brought up to halt the offensive.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|210\u20132}}\n\n==References==\n{{ACMH}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{ARVN}}\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations of South Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Tank units and formations]]\n", "text_old": "{{one source|date=September 2019}}\n{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name = 20th Tank Regiment\n| image =\n| caption =\n| dates = 1971-5\n| country = {{flagicon|South Vietnam}} South Vietnam\n| allegiance =\n| branch = {{Flagicon image|Flag of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam.svg}} [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]]\n| type = \n| role = \n| size = \n| command_structure = \n| garrison = [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Combat Base|\u00c1i T\u1eed Combat Base]], [[Qu\u1ea3ng Tr\u1ecb Province]]\n| garrison_label =\n| nickname =\n| patron =\n| motto =\n| colors =\n| colors_label =\n| march =\n| mascot =\n| equipment =\n| equipment_label =\n| battles =[[Vietnam War]]\n*[[Easter Offensive]]\n| anniversaries =\n| decorations =\n| battle_honours =\n| battle_honours_label =\n| disbanded =\n| flying_hours =\n| website =\n<!-- Commanders -->\n| commander1 = \n| commander1_label =\n| commander2 =\n| commander2_label =\n| commander3 =\n| commander3_label =\n| commander4 =\n| commander4_label =\n| notable_commanders =Colonel Nguyen Huu Ly\n<!-- Insignia -->\n| identification_symbol =\n| identification_symbol_label =\n| identification_symbol_2 =\n| identification_symbol_2_label =\n| identification_symbol_3 =\n| identification_symbol_3_label =\n| identification_symbol_4 =\n| identification_symbol_4_label =\n}}\nThe '''20th Tank Regiment''' was a unit of the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN), the South Vietnamese army. The 20th Tank Regiment was organized on 31 July 1971 and soon saw extensive combat during the 1972 [[Easter Offensive]].\n\n==History==\nIn mid 1971 [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]], a critical area bordered by [[North Vietnam]] and [[Laos]], was protected by ARVN infantry, three ARVN armored cavalry squadrons, and the US 1st Brigade, [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)]], scheduled to leave the country in August. Analysis of terrain, the probable [[People's Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) threat, and PAVN armored actions during [[Operation Lam Son 719]] made it clear that armored units would continue to be needed in this area.

General Toan had urged its employment, and on the afternoon of 2 April the brigade, under 3rd Division control, assumed command of all armored, infantry, and Marine forces in the \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 area. Its units included the regiment, two squadrons of the 17th Armored Cavalry Regiment, the 2nd and 57th Regiments of the 3rd Division, the 3rd Battalion of the 258th Marine Corps Brigade, and the survivors of the 56th Regiment from Camp Carroll.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|207\u20138}}  \nThe bridge spanning the Mieu Giang River at \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 afforded the PAVN the opportunity to cross the river unimpeded and then drive straight south to Quang Tri City. Before the armor brigade headquarters arrived, the 3rd Division engineers had made two unsuccessful attempts to destroy the bridge with explosive charges. When Colonel Nguyen Trong Luat, the 1st Armor Brigade commander, arrived he decided to leave the bridge intact for the time being, since the PAVN had been stopped and the armor brigade forces were holding. Colonel Luat was preparing to make a counterattack to the north across the bridge when the bridge charges detonated and dropped the near span, putting an end to any counterattack plans.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|208}}  \n[[File:T-59 VC.jpg|thumb|right|[[Type 59 tank]] captured by the regiment on 9 April 1972]] \nOther PAVN forces continued to move south towards \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 on the afternoon of 2 April, engaged first by limited tactical air strikes and then by artillery, mortar and tank fire. A large search and rescue effort had been launched for the crew of a [[Rescue of Bat 21 Bravo|US aircraft downed near Cam Lo]]. The U.S. Air Force temporary no-fire zone was 27&nbsp;km in diameter, encompassing nearly the entire combat area and South Vietnamese defenders were unable for several hours to call for artillery support or tactical air strikes against the onrushing PAVN. The PAVN therefore had an opportunity to advance artillery, tanks, and infantry until 22:00, when the restriction was lifted. During the next several days, PAVN activity was relatively light, with sporadic attacks by fire and numerous small ground actions. The PAVN artillery fire was extremely accurate, and although South Vietnamese units moved frequently to avoid the shelling the PAVN seemed to be able to locate new positions very quickly. Although South Vietnamese units conducted attacks to eliminate pockets of resistance south of the Mieu Giang River, the pressure from the north remained intense. The next tank combat occurred on the 9th when all three squadrons of the 20th Tank Regiment fought PAVN armor. The 1st Squadron, shifted several kilometers west of \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0 six days earlier, occupied high ground overlooking an important road junction along Route 9. The tankers engaged an infantry unit supported by 10 tanks at ranges up to 2,800 meters. A few answering shots fell short, and the PAVN tanks scattered, several bogging down in the rice paddies near the road. Eventually 8 were destroyed. In all, the regiment destroyed 16 T-54 tanks and captured one [[Type 59 tank]] that day, in turn suffering nothing more than superficial damage to several M48's. For the next two weeks the South Vietnamese carried out clearing operations interrupted by frequent engagements with PAVN armor and infantry which normally withdrew in the late afternoon. Nights were punctuated by artillery, mortar, and rocket attacks on South Vietnamese positions throughout the area. The defensive lines established on 2 April continued to hold, and on 11 April the 1st Armor Brigade was augmented by the arrival of the 18th Armored Cavalry Regiment from [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]]. By 14 April the 3rd Division controlled five regimental size South Vietnamese task forces, including units of the 4th, 11th, 17th and 18th Cavalry Regiments and the 20th Tank Regiment. On 23 April, several kilometers west of Dong Ha, the 2nd Squadron, 20th Tank Regiment was attacked by an infantry-tank force using a new weapon, the Soviet [[9M14 Malyutka|AT-3 \u2018\u2019Sagger\u2019\u2019]] wire-guided missile, destroying an M48A3 tank and an [[M113 armored personnel carrier|armored cavalry assault vehicle]] (ACAV). A second ACAV was damaged. At first the ARVN tankers seemed fascinated by the missile's slow and erratic flight. Through trial and error, however, the troops soon learned to engage the launch site of the AT-3 with tank main gun fire and to move their vehicles in evasive maneuvers.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|209\u201310}}\n\nOn 27 April heralded by massive artillery attacks with 122mm rockets and [[130 mm towed field gun M1954 (M-46)|130mm guns]], a new PAVN offensive began against South Vietnamese positions all along the Mieu Giang-Cua Viet River defense line. The barrage was quickly followed by violent attacks by PAVN infantry and armor, met by equally determined resistance on the part of the South Vietnamese defenders. The 3rd Squadron, 20th Regiment, supporting the [[Vietnamese Rangers|5th Ranger Group]], received the brunt of the attack and was soon heavily engaged. By midmorning all officers of the 3rd Squadron had been killed or wounded, and 3 M48A3 tanks had been destroyed by AT-3 missiles. All along the defensive line, units were being overrun or pushed back. Forced to yield ground, Ranger and tank elements gradually withdrew to the southeast. Although losses were heavy on both sides, the numerically superior PAVN continued their drive, and by nightfall had pushed almost 4&nbsp;km south of \u0110\u00f4ng H\u00e0. In the early morning of 28 April, the regiment had 18 operational M48A3 tanks. During the South Vietnamese withdrawal the accurate gunnery of the 3rd Squadron cost the PAVN 5 T-54 tanks. At that point the South Vietnamese found large PAVN forces to their rear and for the armored units the withdrawal became an attack to the south. The 2nd Squadron attacking south to secure the bridge over the Vinh Phuoc River at midmorning on the 28th, was badly battered in a PAVN ambush. The commander lost control of his unit and the surviving vehicles, after crossing the bridge, continued to the south in disarray. It was then obvious to Colonel Luat that 1st Armored Brigade units were threatened with encirclement, so the entire force began moving south. All along the way fighting was heavy for the next two days. The terrain as well as the PAVN took its toll of vehicles. At the Vinh Phuoc River 7 vehicles were stranded on the north shore when the bridge, struck by PAVN artillery fire, collapsed.  Farther south at the [[Th\u1ea1ch H\u00e3n River]] near Qu\u1ea3ng Tri, the bridges were already destroyed. 2 tanks were lost there in fording the river on the 30th. By then the tank and cavalry units were beginning their fifth day of almost constant fighting. South of Qu\u1ea3ng Tri resupply of fuel and ammunition was nonexistent as the armored force continued its attack. Forced from the highway by the PAVN, the tanks and assault vehicles moved cross-country, falling victim to the many rice paddies, canal crossings, and streams as well as the antitank rockets and artillery. On the first day of May the vehicles began to run out of gas. Finally, on 2 May, having fought their way through the last PAVN units, the battered survivors of the armor command, intermingled with the remnants of other army units, reached Camp Evans at midafternoon. Only armored cavalry assault vehicles were left; the cavalry regiments and the tank regiment had lost all their tanks. The regiment was reduced to a demoralized, dismounted, and defeated unit. Employed primarily in a static, defensive role in frontline areas, the unit had steadily lost men and equipment without receiving replacements. Although vastly outnumbered, cavalry, infantry, tank, and Marine units of the 1st Armor Brigade, as well as tenacious [[South Vietnamese Regional Force|Regional Forces]] and [[South Vietnamese Popular Force|Popular Forces]] to the east, had succeeded in slowing the momentum of the massive North Vietnamese invasion. With assistance from US and Vietnamese tactical air forces, they provided the resistance that delayed the PAVN until enough reinforcements could be brought up to halt the offensive.<ref name=Starry/>{{rp|210\u20132}}\n\n==References==\n{{ACMH}}\n{{reflist}}\n{{ARVN}}\n\n\n\n[[Category:South Vietnamese military personnel]]\n[[Category:Tank units and formations]]\n[[Category:Vietnam War]]\n", "name_user": "Choppers o'er Nam", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/20th_Tank_Regiment_(South_Vietnam)"}
