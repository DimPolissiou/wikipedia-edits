Financed only from local sources, it is the most commercially successful release in the history of South Africa's film industry.<ref name=\"Gorelik\"/> Originally released in 1980, the film is the first in [[The Gods Must Be Crazy (film series)|''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' series]]. It is followed by one official [[sequel]], ''[[The Gods Must Be Crazy II]]'', released by [[Columbia Pictures]].\n\nSet in [[Botswana]], it follows the story of Xi, a [[San people|San]] of the [[Kalahari Desert]] (played by Namibian [[San people|San]] farmer [[N\u01c3xau \u01c2Toma]]) whose tribe has no knowledge of the world beyond, Andrew Steyn ([[Marius Weyers]]), a biologist who analyzes manure samples for his PhD dissertation, and Kate Thompson ([[Sandra Prinsloo]]), a newly hired village school teacher.\n\n==Plot==\nXi and his San tribe of Ju'/Hoansi bushmen are living happily in the Kalahari Desert, far away from Western civilization. One day, a glass Coca-Cola bottle is carelessly thrown out of an airplane by a pilot and falls to Earth unbroken. Initially, Xi's people assume this strange artifact is a \"present\" from the gods just as they believe plants and animals are and find many uses for it. Unlike other bounties, however, there is only one glass bottle, which causes unforeseen conflict within the tribe. Consequently, Xi confers with elders and agrees to make a pilgrimage to the edge of the world and dispose of the supposedly cursed thing.\n\nAlong the way, he encounters diverse people, such as: biologist Andrew Steyn, who is studying the wildlife; Steyn's assistant and mechanic, M'pudi; Kate Thompson, the newly hired village school teacher; a band of guerrillas led by Sam Boga, who are being pursued by government troops after a failed assassination attempt; and a snobbish safari tour guide named Jack Hind.\n\nWhen Xi, hungry, happens upon a herd of goats, he shoots one with a tranquilizer arrow, but is caught and jailed. M'pudi, who once lived with the San and still speaks Xi's language, concludes that Xi will die if kept incarcerated. He and Steyn consequently apply to employ Xi as a tracker for the remainder of his sentence in lieu of prison, teaching him even how to drive Steyn's Land Rover. Meanwhile, the guerrillas invade Kate's school and take her and the students as human shields for their escape to a neighbouring country.\n\nSteyn, M'pudi, and Xi immersed in their fieldwork find that they are along the terrorists' chosen path. They manage to immobilize the guerrillas using makeshift tranquilizer darts launched by Xi with a tiny, silent, and concealable bow that M'pudi and Xi fabricate, and save Kate and the children. However, Jack Hind arrives and takes away Kate, taking credit for the rescue that Steyn, M'pudi and Xi had actually planned and executed. With Xi's term over, Steyn pays his wages and sends him on his way.\n\nSteyn and M'pudi discuss their small endeavors. When Steyn finally tells Kate about his shy and awkward nature around her, Kate finds it endearing and they begin a relationship.\n\nXi eventually arrives at [[God's Window]], the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. Convinced that he has reached the edge of the world, he throws the bottle off the cliff, and returns to his tribe.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[N\u01c3xau \u01c2Toma|N!xau]] as Xi\n*[[Marius Weyers]] as Andrew Steyn (Performed his own English language dub.)\n*[[Sandra Prinsloo]] as Kate Thompson (English language voice by Janet Meshad)\n*Nic de Jager as Jack Hind\n*Michael Thys as M'Pudi (voiced by [[Pip Freedman]] in the English dubbed release.)\n*Louw Verwey as Sam Boga\n\n==Release==\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\n''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' was released in South Africa in 1980 by [[Ster Kinekor]] Pictures; it became a box-office record breaker in that country.<ref name=focus>{{cite book|last=Pfaff|first=Fran\u00e7oise|title=Focus on African Films|isbn=0-253-21668-0|year=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press}}</ref>{{rp|77}}  For the film's overseas release, the original [[Afrikaans]] dialogue was dubbed into English, and voiceover work was provided for [[!Kung language|!Kung]] and [[Tswana language|Tswana]] lines.<ref name=focus/>{{rp|76}} At the time, it broke all box office records in Japan and it broke all box office records for a foreign film in the United States.\n\nIn mid-November 1986, ''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' was released on videocassette in the U.S. by [[CBS/Fox Video|CBS/Fox]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1085202162.html?dids=1085202162:1085202162&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Nov+14%2C+1986&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc='Gods+Must+Be+Crazy'+Drops+Into+Video+Stores%3B+'SpaceCamp'+Is+Set+for+Modest+Blast-Off&pqatl=google|last=Hunt|first=Dennis|title='Gods Must Be Crazy' Drops Into Video Stores; 'SpaceCamp' Is Set for Modest Blast-Off|date=14 November 1986|accessdate=2010-08-07|url-access=registration |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|page=K18}}</ref> on its Playhouse Video label.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B0DE6D91E3EF937A25755C0A961948260|last=James|first=Caryn|title=''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' (1981): Home Videos; Sophisticated Silliness|date=14 July 1987|accessdate=2010-08-07|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]}}</ref>\n\nLater, the movie was released on DVD by Sony Pictures Entertainment.{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Reception===\n{{expand section|date=October 2015}}\nBased on 19 reviews, ''The Gods Must Be Crazy'' has carried a 95% \"Fresh\" score on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-gods-must-be-crazy/|title=Reviews for ''The Gods Must Be Crazy''|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=2016-06-20|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref> Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film three stars out of four, and said in his conclusion: \"It might be easy to make a farce about screwball happenings in the desert, but it's a lot harder to create a funny interaction between nature and human nature.
