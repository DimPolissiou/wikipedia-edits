She was born in the family house, owned by her grandparents. She had a brother, from whom we know nothing. Her grandmother, a woman she never mentions in her letters except to say she was a \"witty and sound Parisian\" was at that time remarried to the Marquis de Vitry, an old French aristocrat, born before the French Revolution, who used to tell her story about this era.\n\nAlthough her biological maternal grandfather died when her mother was very young, she mentions in her letters to [[Theodore Stanton]] that she was raised with an admiration for this unknown grandfather,<ref>Stanton, Theodore, \"Autobiographical notes of Madame Blanc\" ''The North American Review'' Vol. 166, Issue 498. (May 1898).</ref> Major [[Adrian Benjamin Bentzon]], governor of the Danish West Indies from 1816 to 1820. The major, after Denmark lost the Virgin Islands, went on to file a case in the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] arguing he should have his sugar canes plantations back. After living in America with his family, Adrian Bentzon went back to Europe, but died later in the Caribbeans. His wife later married the Marquis de Vitry, installed in the small village of Seine-Port.\n\nMarie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se was in part raised by her grandparents and the new husband of her mother, [[Count Antoine Cartier D'Aure]], whom her mother had married shortly after her father's death (her father was 13 years older than her mother, as her birth certificate demonstrates). At her grandparents' home she received a cosmopolitan education, learning German and English, due to her father's origins and having an English nurse. She was taught every day at their house by the village's school teacher, and from him learned Greek, Latin and how to write.\n\nShe married in 1856 to a Louis Blanc, but three years later, after having a son, her husband left her. It isn't clear if he died or simple if they divorced, but she mentions in her letters to Stanton that after three years of a long and grieving time, she finally got free. But with this freedom also came the need for money to provide for her son, whose name is unknown (he is mentioned by the [[Goncourt brothers]] as the \"son of Madame Blanc\"<ref>The Goncourt brothers' journal</ref>).\n\nAfter working for different newspapers and magazines, she was introduced by her grandfather, the [[Count Antoine Cartier D'Aure]] to [[George Sand]], and spent a lot of time at Sand's house, in Nohant, helping her with her recording of events happening here. Sand mentions her in her journal.<ref>[[Marie Jenney Howe|Jenney Howe, Marie]]. ''George Sand. The Intimate Journal. Chicago: Academy of Chicago Publishers, 1978.''</ref> Her grandfather and Sand shared an interest for horses, and he had helped the writer buy some pure-breed race horses. As a thank she agreed to read a short novel written by his granddaughter, and to present her to the then editor of the [[Revue des Deux Mondes]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Buloz]]. This was the real beginning of her writing career. As an alias, she took her mother's maiden name, and generally was known as \"Th\u00e9odore Bentzon\" a masculine penname that was voluntarily identifying her as a man, for a woman writing was not well perceived in the nineteenth century.\n\n==The Revue des Deux Mondes==\nAfter Sand insisted, and helped by [[Victor Cherbuliez]], a reluctant Buloz let her in, as a literary critic, in 1872. She stayed in the magazine up until one year before her death. Thanks to her fluent English, she was appointed to the translation and comment of very important American and English authors, and it contributed to build her a solid network in the United States.\n\nHer work at the magazine consisted essentially in writing critics pertaining to the Anglo-Saxon, German and Russian world. She also published most of her fictional work through the magazine, while developing her friendship with major literary figures of her time. By the time the magazine's direction changed to [[Ferdinand Bruneti\u00e8re]], she had become a prominent writer at it. She lived the best years of the magazine.\n\nIn 1893, she was sent by the [[Revue des Deux Mondes]] in the US to report on the women's condition there. She left France in the first part of 1893, and from New York City went to Chicago. After spending a couple of months there, she took the train to Boston, where she spent almost a year, with trips to Louisiana and the Midwest. During her stay she went to visit [[Jane Addams]], the founder of [[Hull House]], met [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.]] just before he died, and saw [[Jacob Riis]] during a lecture on one of his latest novels.\n\nShe also met political, feminists and abolitionist figures.\n\nAt her return from the US, she compiled her articles in a book, a travel journal, published in 1896 by Calmann-Levy. She visited the US again in 1897 for a shorter amount of time. Her travel journal was a best-seller and was edited again 8 times, in different editions, the latest in 1904.\n\n==''The American Women At Home''==\nFirst published in 1896, her travel notes were organized around the remarks she had about American women. Her travel notes are not considered to be very original in terms of opinion on America, but the subjects she chose (education of and for women, women in society and the charity system in America) make her notes original according to William Chew's researches.<ref>Chew, William. Shifting Identities in Late 19th Century French Feminism: the case of Th. Bentzon.</ref>\n\nHer book also accords a great importance on urban America, making a thorough portrayal of it.\n\n==Her work==\nAmong her essays are ''Litt\u00e9rature et m\u0153urs \u00e9trang\u00e8res'' (1882) and ''Les nouveaux romanciers am\u00e9ricains'' (1885).

He wrote plays (''La Course des rois'' - 1947; ''Le Profanateur'' - 1950, ''La Ville au fond de la mer'' - 1953, ''Le Soir du conqu\u00e9rant'' - 1970) and essays (''Violence et conscience'' - 1945, ''La Face de m\u00e9duse du communisme'' - 1952, ''L'Europe a fait le monde'' - 1966, ''Le Sens des mots'' - 1976, ''Les Vaches sacr\u00e9es'' - 1977), but also commented on social themes (with Maulnier as a staunch [[Pro-European]]).\n\nIn 1964, he was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] in place of the deceased [[Henry Bordeaux]]. In 1986 he was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].\n\n== Works ==\n<!-- Partial list -->\n* ''La crise est dans l'homme'' (1932)\n* ''[[Nietzsche]]'' (1933)\n* ''[[Jean Racine|Racine]]'' (1934)\n* ''Miracle de la Monarchie'' (1935)\n* ''Mythes socialistes'' (1938)\n* ''Au-del\u00e0 du nationalisme'' (1938)\n* ''Introduction \u00e0 la po\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise'' (1939)\n* ''La France, la guerre et la paix'' (1942, Lyon)\n* ''Violence et conscience'' (1945)\n* ''Langages ''(1946)\n* ''Jeanne et ses juges'' (1952)\n* ''Le Sexe et le n\u00e9ant'', directed by [[Marcelle Tassencourt]], [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e]] (1960)\n* ''Cette Gr\u00e8ce o\u00f9 nous sommes n\u00e9s'' (1964)\n* ''La D\u00e9faite d'hannibal'', followed by ''La ville au fond de la mer'', Gallimard (1968)\n* ''Dialogue inattendu'', with Jean Elleinstein, Flammarion (1979)\n\n;Theatre\n* 1944: ''[[Antigone]]'' by [[Robert Garnier]], [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Tristan-Bernard|Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Charles de Rochefort]], [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vieux-Colombier]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise Seat 20}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maulnier, Thierry}}\n[[Category:1908 births]]\n[[Category:1988 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Al\u00e8s]]\n[[Category:20th-century French dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:French essayists]]\n[[Category:French journalists]]\n[[Category:French literary critics]]\n[[Category:French monarchists]]\n[[Category:French political writers]]\n[[Category:Writers from Occitanie]]\n[[Category:People affiliated with Action Fran\u00e7aise]]\n[[Category:French anti-communists]]\n[[Category:\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure alumni]]\n[[Category:Members of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]]\n[[Category:Prix mondial Cino Del Duca winners]]\n[[Category:20th-century essayists]]\n", "name_user": "Bearcat", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:recat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Maulnier"}

He was the first winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1901.\n\nBorn in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times.

He worked for a while in the [[Le Creusot|Creusot]] region for the [[Schneider Electric|Schneider]] steel [[foundry]], and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the ''Conf\u00e9rence La Bruy\u00e8re'' (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n\n==Writing==\nHis first collection, ''Stances et Po\u00e8mes'' (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by [[Sainte-Beuve]]. It included his most famous poem, ''Le vase bris\u00e9''. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This war, which he discussed in ''Impressions de la guerre'' (1872) and ''La France'' (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus]] school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. The inspiration was clearly [[Lucretius]]'s ''[[De rerum natura]]'', for the first book of which he made a verse translation. His philosophy was expressed in ''La Justice'' (1878) and ''Le Bonheur'' (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] in 1881. Another distinction, ''Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur]]'', was to follow in 1895.\n\nAfter, ''Le Bonheur'', Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on [[aesthetics]] and philosophy. He published two important essays: ''L'Expression dans les beaux-arts'' (1884) and ''R\u00e9flexions sur l'art des vers'' (1892), a series of articles on [[Blaise Pascal]] in ''[[La Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' (1890), and an article on [[free will]] (''La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre'', 1906) in the ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale''.\n\n==Nobel Prize==\nThe first writer to receive the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of [[lofty idealism]], artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres]]''. He also founded, in 1902, the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ais]]'' with [[Jose-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leon Dierx]].\n\n==Death==\n[[File:SullyPrudhommetomb.JPG|thumb|Grave of Sully Prudhomme at [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] in Paris.]]\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a [[recluse]] at [[Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry]], suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] in Paris.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Poetry===\n* 1865: ''Stances et po\u00e8mes''\n* 1866: ''Les \u00e9preuves''\n* 1868: ''Croquis italiens''\n* 1869: ''Les solitudes: po\u00e9sies'' [''Les \u00e9curies d\u2019Augias'']\n* 1872: ''Les destins''\n* 1874: ''La r\u00e9volte des fleurs''\n* 1874: ''La France''\n* 1875: ''Les vaines tendresses''\n* 1876: ''Le z\u00e9nith'', previously published in ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]''\n* 1878: ''La justice''\n* 1865\u20131888: ''Po\u00e9sie''\n* 1886: ''Le prisme, po\u00e9sies diverses''\n* 1888: ''Le bonheur''\n* 1908: ''\u00c9paves''\n\n===Prose===\n* 1883\u20131908: ''\u0152uvres de Sully Prudhomme'' (poetry and prose), 8 volumes, A.

He worked for a while in the [[Le Creusot|Creusot]] region for the [[Schneider Electric|Schneider]] steel [[foundry]], and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the ''Conf\u00e9rence La Bruy\u00e8re'' (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.\n\n==Writing==\nHis first collection, ''Stances et Po\u00e8mes'' (\"Stanzas and Poems\", 1865), was praised by [[Sainte-Beuve]]. It included his most famous poem, ''Le vase bris\u00e9''. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This war, which he discussed in ''Impressions de la guerre'' (1872) and ''La France'' (1874), permanently damaged his health.\n\nDuring his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus]] school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. The inspiration was clearly [[Lucretius]]'s ''[[De rerum natura]]'', for the first book of which he made a verse translation. His philosophy was expressed in ''La Justice'' (1878) and ''Le Bonheur'' (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]] in 1881. Another distinction, ''Chevalier de la [[L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur]]'', was to follow in 1895.\n\nAfter, ''Le Bonheur'', Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on [[aesthetics]] and philosophy. He published two important essays: ''L'Expression dans les beaux-arts'' (1884) and ''R\u00e9flexions sur l'art des vers'' (1892), a series of articles on [[Blaise Pascal]] in ''[[La Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' (1890), and an article on [[free will]] (''La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre'', 1906) in the ''Revue de m\u00e9taphysique et de morale''.\n\n==Nobel Prize==\nThe first writer to receive the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (given \"in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of [[lofty idealism]], artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect\"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres]]''. He also founded, in 1902, the ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ais]]'' with [[Jose-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leon Dierx]].\n\n==Death==\n[[File:SullyPrudhommetomb.JPG|thumb|Grave of Sully Prudhomme at [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] in Paris.]]\nAt the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a [[recluse]] at [[Ch\u00e2tenay-Malabry]], suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at [[P\u00e8re-Lachaise]] in Paris.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Poetry===\n* 1865: ''Stances et po\u00e8mes''\n* 1866: ''Les \u00e9preuves''\n* 1868: ''Croquis italiens''\n* 1869: ''Les solitudes: po\u00e9sies'' [''Les \u00e9curies d\u2019Augias'']\n* 1872: ''Les destins''\n* 1874: ''La r\u00e9volte des fleurs''\n* 1874: ''La France''\n* 1875: ''Les vaines tendresses''\n* 1876: ''Le z\u00e9nith'', previously published in ''[[Revue des deux mondes]]''\n* 1878: ''La justice''\n* 1865\u20131888: ''Po\u00e9sie''\n* 1886: ''Le prisme, po\u00e9sies diverses''\n* 1888: ''Le bonheur''\n* 1908: ''\u00c9paves''\n\n===Prose===\n* 1883\u20131908: ''\u0152uvres de Sully Prudhomme'' (poetry and prose), 8 volumes, A.

Best known for the novels ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' (''[[The Red and the Black]]'', 1830) and ''La Chartreuse de Parme'' (''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', 1839), he is highly regarded for the acute analysis of his characters' psychology and considered one of the early and foremost practitioners of [[Literary realism|realism]].\n\n==Life==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2018}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\nBorn in [[Grenoble]], [[Is\u00e8re]], he was an unhappy child, disliking his \"unimaginative\" father and mourning his mother, whom he passionately loved, and who died when he was seven. {{cn span|He spent \"the happiest years of his life\" at the Beyle country house in [[Claix, Is\u00e8re|Claix]] near Grenoble.|date=December 2017}} His closest friend was his younger sister, Pauline, with whom he maintained a steady correspondence throughout the first decade of the 19th century.\n\n[[File:Casa di Stendhal.JPG|thumb|upright|A plaque on a house in [[Vilnius]] where Stendhal stayed in December 1812 during [[Napoleon]]'s retreat from Russia.]]\nThe military and theatrical worlds of the [[First French Empire]] were a revelation to Beyle. He was named an [[auditor]] with the [[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'\u00c9tat]] on 3 August 1810, and thereafter took part in the French administration and in the [[Napoleonic wars]] in Italy.

He was appointed Commissioner of War Supplies and sent to [[Smolensk]] to prepare provisions for the returning army. He crossed the [[Battle of Berezina|Berezina River]] by finding a usable ford rather than the overwhelmed pontoon bridge, which probably saved his life and those of his companions.

He formed a particular attachment to Italy, where he spent much of the remainder of his career, serving as French [[Consulate general|consul]] at Trieste and Civitavecchia.  His novel ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', written in 52 days, is set in Italy, which he considered a more sincere and passionate country than Restoration France. An aside in that novel, referring to a character who contemplates suicide after being jilted, speaks about his attitude towards his home country:  \"To make this course of action clear to my French readers, I must explain that in Italy, a country very far away from us, people are still driven to despair by love.\"\n\nStendhal identified with the nascent [[liberalism]] and his sojourn in Italy convinced him that [[Romanticism]] was essentially the literary counterpart of liberalism in politics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=F.

C. |title=Stendhal |date=2011 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=239}}</ref>\n\nStendhal was a dandy and wit about town in Paris, as well as an obsessive womaniser. His genuine empathy towards women is evident in his books; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] spoke highly of him in ''[[The Second Sex]]''. One of his early works is ''On Love,'' a rational analysis of romantic passion that was based on his [[unrequited love]] for Mathilde, Countess Dembowska, whom he met while living at [[Milan]]. This fusion of, and tension between, clear-headed analysis and romantic feeling is typical of Stendhal's great novels; he could be considered a Romantic realist.\n\nStendhal suffered miserable physical disabilities in his final years as he continued to produce some of his most famous work. As he noted in his journal, he was taking iodide of [[potassium]] and [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] to treat his [[syphilis]], resulting in swollen armpits, difficulty swallowing, pains in his shrunken testicles, sleeplessness, giddiness, roaring in the ears, racing pulse and \"tremors so bad he could scarcely hold a fork or a pen\". Modern medicine has shown that his health problems were more attributable to his treatment than to his syphilis.\n\nStendhal died on 23 March 1842, a few hours after collapsing with a seizure on the streets of Paris. He is interred in the [[Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre]].\n\n==Pseudonyms==\nBefore settling on the pen name Stendhal, he published under many [[pen name]]s, including \"Louis Alexandre Bombet\" and \"Anastasius Serpi\u00e8re\". The only book that Stendhal published under his own name was ''The History of Painting'' (1817). From the publication of ''Rome, Naples, Florence'' (September 1817) onwards, he published his works under the pseudonym \"M. de Stendhal, officier de [[Cavalry|cavalerie]]\". He borrowed this ''[[nom de plume]]'' from the German city of [[Stendal]], birthplace of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], an art historian and archaeologist famous at the time.<ref name=JR>{{cite book| first= Joanna |last= Richardson |title= Stendhal| publisher= Coward, McCann & Geoghegan |year= 1974| page= 68}}</ref>\n\nIn 1807 Stendhal stayed near Stendal, where he fell in love with a woman named Wilhelmine, whom he called Minette, and for whose sake he remained in the city. \"I have no inclination, now, except for Minette, for this blonde and charming Minette, this soul of the north, such as I have never seen in France or Italy.\"<ref name=JR /> Stendhal added an additional \"H\" to make more clear the Germanic pronunciation.\n\nStendhal used many aliases in his autobiographical writings and correspondence, and often assigned pseudonyms to friends, some of whom adopted the names for themselves. Stendhal used more than a hundred pseudonyms, which were astonishingly diverse. Some he used no more than once, while others he returned to throughout his life. \"Dominique\" and \"Salviati\" served as intimate pet names. He coins comic names \"that make him even more bourgeois than he really is: Cotonnet, Bombet, Chamier.\"<ref name=JSAG>{{cite book |last=Starobinski |first=Jean |translator=Arthur Goldhammer |title=The Living Eye |publisher=Harvard University Press |date= 1989| chapter= Pseudononimous Stendhal |isbn=0-674-53664-9  |lastauthoramp=y}}</ref>{{rp|80}} He uses many ridiculous names: \"Don phlegm\", \"[[Giorgio Vasari]]\", \"William Crocodile\", \"Poverino\", \"Baron de Cutendre\".

He was not fully appreciated until the beginning of the 20th century. He dedicated his writing to \"the Happy Few\" (in English in the original). This can be interpreted as a reference to Canto 11 of [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]'', which refers to \"the thousand happy few\" who enjoy high society, or to the \"we few, we happy few, we band of brothers\" line of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', but Stendhal's use more likely refers to ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' by [[Oliver Goldsmith]], parts of which he had memorized in the course of teaching himself English.<ref name=BJM>Martin, Brian Joseph. ''Napoleonic Friendship: Military Fraternity, Intimacy, and Sexuality in Nineteenth-Century France''.

Stendhal was an avid fan of music, particularly the works of the composers [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Gioacchino Rossini]]. He wrote a biography of Rossini, ''Vie de Rossini'' (1824), now more valued for its wide-ranging musical criticism than for its historical content.\n\nIn his works, Stendhal [[reprise]]d excerpts [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] from [[Giuseppe Carpani]], [[Th\u00e9ophile Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Winckler]], [[Sismondi]] and others.<ref>{{cite book| last= Randall| first= Marilyn |year= 2001| url= https://archive.org/details/pragmaticplagiar0000rand | url-access= registration|title= Pragmatic plagiarism: authorship, profit, and power| publisher= University of Toronto Press| page=[https://archive.org/details/pragmaticplagiar0000rand/page/199 199] |quote=If the plagiarisms of Stendhal are legion, many are virtually translations: that is, cross-border plagiarism.

In the analogy, the city of [[Bologna]] represents ''indifference'' and [[Rome]] represents ''perfect love'':\n\n[[File:Crystallization.jpg|400px|thumb|Stendhal's depiction of \"crystallization\" in the process of falling in love.]]\n\nWhen we are in Bologna, we are entirely indifferent; we are not concerned to admire in any particular way the person with whom we shall perhaps one day be madly in love; even less is our imagination inclined to overrate their worth.  In a word, in Bologna \"crystallization\" has not yet begun.  When the journey begins, love departs.  One leaves Bologna, climbs the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and takes the road to Rome. The departure, according to Stendhal, has nothing to do with one's will; it is an instinctive moment.  This transformative process actuates in terms of four steps along a journey:\n\n#Admiration \u2013 one marvels at the qualities of the loved one.\n#Acknowledgement \u2013 one acknowledges the pleasantness of having gained the loved one's interest.\n#Hope \u2013 one envisions gaining the love of the loved one.\n#Delight \u2013 one delights in overrating the beauty and merit of the person whose love one hopes to win.\n\nThis journey or crystallization process (shown above) was detailed by Stendhal on the back of a playing card while speaking to Madame Gherardi, during his trip to the Salzburg salt mine.\n\n==Critical appraisal==\n[[Hippolyte Taine]] considered the psychological portraits of Stendhal's characters to be \"real, because they are complex, many-sided, particular and original, like living human beings.\" [[\u00c9mile Zola]] concurred with Taine's assessment of Stendhal's skills as a \"psychologist\", and although emphatic in his praise of Stendhal's psychological accuracy and rejection of convention, he deplored the various implausibilities of the novels and Stendhal's clear authorial intervention.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=Roger |date=2014 |title=Stendhal: \"The Red and the Black\" and \"The Charterhouse of Parma\" |publisher=Routledge|page=6 |isbn=0582096162}}</ref>\n\nThe German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] refers to Stendhal as \"France's last great psychologist\" in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (1886).<ref>Nietzsche, F., Penguin Classics (1973) p. 187</ref> He also mentions Stendhal in the ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' (1889) during a discussion of Dostoevsky as a psychologist, saying that encountering [[Dostoevsky]] was \"the most beautiful accident of my life, more so than even my discovery of Stendhal\".<ref>Common, Thomas.

Beyle-Stendhal was a man of keen intelligence, quick and alive, mentally independent and courageous, but not quite a great figure. His ideas are often forceful and inspired, but they are erratic, arbitrarily advanced, and, despite all their show of boldness, lacking in inward certainty and continuity. There is something unsettled about his whole nature: his fluctuation between realistic candor in general and silly mystification in particulars, between cold self-control, rapturous abandonment to sensual pleasures, and insecure and sometimes sentimental vaingloriousness, is not always easy to put up with; his literary style is very impressive and unmistakably original, but it is short-winded, not uniformly successful, and only seldom wholly takes possession of and fixes the subject. But, such as he was, he offered himself to the moment; circumstances seized him, tossed him about, and laid upon him a unique and unexpected destiny; they formed him so that he was compelled to come to terms with reality in a way which no one had done before him.<ref name=A454 />}}\n\n[[Vladimir Nabokov]] was dismissive of Stendhal, in ''[[Strong Opinions]]'' calling him \"that pet of all those who like their French plain\". In the notes to his translation of ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', he asserts that ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' is \"much overrated\", and that Stendhal has a \"paltry style\". In ''[[Pnin]]'' Nabokov wrote satirically, \"Literary departments still labored under the impression that Stendhal, [[John Galsworthy|Galsworthy]], [[Theodore Dreiser|Dreiser]], and [[Thomas Mann|Mann]] were great writers.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1965/jul/15/the-strange-case-of-pushkin-and-nabokov/ |title=The Strange Case of Pushkin and Nabokov |last1=Wilson |first1=Edmund |date=July 15, 1965 |website=nybooks.com |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]] |access-date=July 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, rumours began amongst the undergraduate body at the [[University of Oxford]] that Stendhal was actually a woman posing as a man.

He formed a particular attachment to Italy, where he spent much of the remainder of his career, serving as French [[Consulate general|consul]] at Trieste and Civitavecchia.  His novel ''[[The Charterhouse of Parma]]'', written in 52 days, is set in Italy, which he considered a more sincere and passionate country than Restoration France. An aside in that novel, referring to a character who contemplates suicide after being jilted, speaks about his attitude towards his home country:  \"To make this course of action clear to my French readers, I must explain that in Italy, a country very far away from us, people are still driven to despair by love.\"\n\nStendhal identified with the nascent [[liberalism]] and his sojourn in Italy convinced him that [[Romanticism]] was essentially the literary counterpart of liberalism in politics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Green |first1=F.

His genuine empathy towards women is evident in his books; [[Simone de Beauvoir]] spoke highly of him in ''[[The Second Sex]]''. One of his early works is ''On Love,'' a rational analysis of romantic passion that was based on his [[unrequited love]] for Mathilde, Countess Dembowska, whom he met while living at [[Milan]]. This fusion of, and tension between, clear-headed analysis and romantic feeling is typical of Stendhal's great novels; he could be considered a Romantic realist.\n\nStendhal suffered miserable physical disabilities in his final years as he continued to produce some of his most famous work. As he noted in his journal, he was taking iodide of [[potassium]] and [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] to treat his [[syphilis]], resulting in swollen armpits, difficulty swallowing, pains in his shrunken testicles, sleeplessness, giddiness, roaring in the ears, racing pulse and \"tremors so bad he could scarcely hold a fork or a pen\". Modern medicine has shown that his health problems were more attributable to his treatment than to his syphilis.\n\nStendhal died on 23 March 1842, a few hours after collapsing with a seizure on the streets of Paris. He is interred in the [[Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre]].\n\n==Pseudonyms==\nBefore settling on the pen name Stendhal, he published under many [[pen name]]s, including \"Louis Alexandre Bombet\" and \"Anastasius Serpi\u00e8re\". The only book that Stendhal published under his own name was ''The History of Painting'' (1817). From the publication of ''Rome, Naples, Florence'' (September 1817) onwards, he published his works under the pseudonym \"M. de Stendhal, officier de [[Cavalry|cavalerie]]\". He borrowed this ''[[nom de plume]]'' from the German city of [[Stendal]], birthplace of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], an art historian and archaeologist famous at the time.<ref name=JR>{{cite book| first= Joanna |last= Richardson |title= Stendhal| publisher= Coward, McCann & Geoghegan |year= 1974| page= 68}}</ref>\n\nIn 1807 Stendhal stayed near Stendal, where he fell in love with a woman named Wilhelmine, whom he called Minette, and for whose sake he remained in the city. \"I have no inclination, now, except for Minette, for this blonde and charming Minette, this soul of the north, such as I have never seen in France or Italy.\"<ref name=JR /> Stendhal added an additional \"H\" to make more clear the Germanic pronunciation.\n\nStendhal used many aliases in his autobiographical writings and correspondence, and often assigned pseudonyms to friends, some of whom adopted the names for themselves. Stendhal used more than a hundred pseudonyms, which were astonishingly diverse. Some he used no more than once, while others he returned to throughout his life. \"Dominique\" and \"Salviati\" served as intimate pet names.

He was not fully appreciated until the beginning of the 20th century. He dedicated his writing to \"the Happy Few\" (in English in the original). This can be interpreted as a reference to Canto 11 of [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (poem)|Don Juan]]'', which refers to \"the thousand happy few\" who enjoy high society, or to the \"we few, we happy few, we band of brothers\" line of [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', but Stendhal's use more likely refers to ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'' by [[Oliver Goldsmith]], parts of which he had memorized in the course of teaching himself English.<ref name=BJM>Martin, Brian Joseph. ''Napoleonic Friendship: Military Fraternity, Intimacy, and Sexuality in Nineteenth-Century France''.

Stendhal was an avid fan of music, particularly the works of the composers [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Gioacchino Rossini]]. He wrote a biography of Rossini, ''Vie de Rossini'' (1824), now more valued for its wide-ranging musical criticism than for its historical content.\n\nIn his works, Stendhal [[reprise]]d excerpts [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] from [[Giuseppe Carpani]], [[Th\u00e9ophile Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Winckler]], [[Sismondi]] and others.<ref>{{cite book| last= Randall| first= Marilyn |year= 2001| url= https://archive.org/details/pragmaticplagiar0000rand | url-access= registration|title= Pragmatic plagiarism: authorship, profit, and power| publisher= University of Toronto Press| page=[https://archive.org/details/pragmaticplagiar0000rand/page/199 199] |quote=If the plagiarisms of Stendhal are legion, many are virtually translations: that is, cross-border plagiarism.

In the analogy, the city of [[Bologna]] represents ''indifference'' and [[Rome]] represents ''perfect love'':\n\n[[File:Crystallization.jpg|400px|thumb|Stendhal's depiction of \"crystallization\" in the process of falling in love.]]\n\nWhen we are in Bologna, we are entirely indifferent; we are not concerned to admire in any particular way the person with whom we shall perhaps one day be madly in love; even less is our imagination inclined to overrate their worth.  In a word, in Bologna \"crystallization\" has not yet begun.  When the journey begins, love departs.  One leaves Bologna, climbs the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]], and takes the road to Rome. The departure, according to Stendhal, has nothing to do with one's will; it is an instinctive moment.  This transformative process actuates in terms of four steps along a journey:\n\n#Admiration \u2013 one marvels at the qualities of the loved one.\n#Acknowledgement \u2013 one acknowledges the pleasantness of having gained the loved one's interest.\n#Hope \u2013 one envisions gaining the love of the loved one.\n#Delight \u2013 one delights in overrating the beauty and merit of the person whose love one hopes to win.\n\nThis journey or crystallization process (shown above) was detailed by Stendhal on the back of a playing card while speaking to Madame Gherardi, during his trip to the Salzburg salt mine.\n\n==Critical appraisal==\n[[Hippolyte Taine]] considered the psychological portraits of Stendhal's characters to be \"real, because they are complex, many-sided, particular and original, like living human beings.\" [[\u00c9mile Zola]] concurred with Taine's assessment of Stendhal's skills as a \"psychologist\", and although emphatic in his praise of Stendhal's psychological accuracy and rejection of convention, he deplored the various implausibilities of the novels and Stendhal's clear authorial intervention.<ref>{{cite book |last=Pearson |first=Roger |date=2014 |title=Stendhal: \"The Red and the Black\" and \"The Charterhouse of Parma\" |publisher=Routledge|page=6 |isbn=0582096162}}</ref>\n\nThe German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] refers to Stendhal as \"France's last great psychologist\" in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'' (1886).<ref>Nietzsche, F., Penguin Classics (1973) p. 187</ref> He also mentions Stendhal in the ''[[Twilight of the Idols]]'' (1889) during a discussion of Dostoevsky as a psychologist, saying that encountering [[Dostoevsky]] was \"the most beautiful accident of my life, more so than even my discovery of Stendhal\".<ref>Common, Thomas.

Beyle-Stendhal was a man of keen intelligence, quick and alive, mentally independent and courageous, but not quite a great figure. His ideas are often forceful and inspired, but they are erratic, arbitrarily advanced, and, despite all their show of boldness, lacking in inward certainty and continuity. There is something unsettled about his whole nature: his fluctuation between realistic candor in general and silly mystification in particulars, between cold self-control, rapturous abandonment to sensual pleasures, and insecure and sometimes sentimental vaingloriousness, is not always easy to put up with; his literary style is very impressive and unmistakably original, but it is short-winded, not uniformly successful, and only seldom wholly takes possession of and fixes the subject. But, such as he was, he offered himself to the moment; circumstances seized him, tossed him about, and laid upon him a unique and unexpected destiny; they formed him so that he was compelled to come to terms with reality in a way which no one had done before him.<ref name=A454 />}}\n\n[[Vladimir Nabokov]] was dismissive of Stendhal, in ''[[Strong Opinions]]'' calling him \"that pet of all those who like their French plain\". In the notes to his translation of ''[[Eugene Onegin]]'', he asserts that ''Le Rouge et le Noir'' is \"much overrated\", and that Stendhal has a \"paltry style\". In ''[[Pnin]]'' Nabokov wrote satirically, \"Literary departments still labored under the impression that Stendhal, [[John Galsworthy|Galsworthy]], [[Theodore Dreiser|Dreiser]], and [[Thomas Mann|Mann]] were great writers.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1965/jul/15/the-strange-case-of-pushkin-and-nabokov/ |title=The Strange Case of Pushkin and Nabokov |last1=Wilson |first1=Edmund |date=July 15, 1965 |website=nybooks.com |publisher=[[The New York Review of Books]] |access-date=July 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, rumours began amongst the undergraduate body at the [[University of Oxford]] that Stendhal was actually a woman posing as a man.

Her abandoned primary thesis (''th\u00e8se principale'') for her [[State doctorate]], later published as ''Nietzsche et la m\u00e9taphore'', was supervised by Deleuze. In 1969 Kofman met [[Jacques Derrida]] and began attending his seminars at the [[\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nKofman did not receive tenure until 1991, when she was appointed to a chair at [[Paris I]].\n\nKofman was the author of numerous books, including several on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. Her book, ''L'\u00e9nigme de la femme: La femme dans les textes de Freud'' (1980), is perhaps the most thorough consideration of Freud's ideas concerning [[human female sexuality|female sexuality]].\n\n==Writings==\nThough many of her philosophical writings focused on Nietzsche and Freud, Kofman wrote several works in an autobiographical vein. ''Paroles suffoqu\u00e9es'' (1987) is dedicated to the memory of her father, rabbi [[Bereck Kofman]], whom she saw for the last time on July 16, 1942, and who was killed at [[Auschwitz]].\n\n''Rue Ordener, rue Labat'' (1994) also opens with the removal of her father by the [[Vichy]] police, and describes what Kofman understands to have been his fate. The title refers to two Parisian streets: the address at which her family lived until her father's arrest; and the address at which she was sheltered for much of the remainder of the war. Kofman was taken in by a Parisian divorc\u00e9e who became her surrogate mother and whom she called M\u00e9m\u00e9. The book tells the story of this period, and of the custody dispute between M\u00e9m\u00e9 and Kofman's mother following the [[liberation of Paris]].\n\n==Death==\nKofman committed [[suicide]] in 1994. The fact that she did so on the date of Nietzsche's 150th birthday<ref>[http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/kofman-sarah JWA.org]</ref> has been seen by some writers as significant.<ref>Christie McDonald, [http://www.erudit.org/revue/TTR/1998/v11/n2/037340ar.pdf Sarah Kofman: Effecting Self Translation], p. 191</ref> After her death, Jacques Derrida wrote the following:\n\n{{quote|For she too was without pity, if not without mercy, in the end, for both Nietzsche and Freud, whom she knew and whose bodies of work she had read inside and out.
