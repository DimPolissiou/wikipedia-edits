Gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that accounts for its adhesive properties.\n\nAt the free end of the body is a mouth opening surrounded by one to twelve thin, mobile [[tentacle]]s. Each tentacle, or cnida (plural: cnidae), is clothed with highly specialised stinging cells called [[cnidocyte]]s. Cnidocytes contain specialized structures called [[nematocyst]]s, which look like miniature light bulbs with a coiled thread inside. At the narrow outer edge of the cnidocyte is a short trigger hair called a cnidocil. Upon contact with prey, the contents of the nematocyst are explosively discharged, firing a dart-like thread containing [[neurotoxin]]s into whatever triggered the release. This can paralyze the prey, especially if many hundreds of nematocysts are fired.\n\n''Hydra'' has two main body layers, which makes it \"[[diploblastic]]\". The layers are separated by [[mesoglea]], a gel-like substance. The outer layer is the [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]], and the inner layer is called the [[gastrodermis]], because it lines the stomach. The cells making up these two body layers are relatively simple.

''Hydra'' generally react in the same way regardless of the direction of the stimulus, and this may be due to the simplicity of the nerve nets.\n\n''Hydra'' are generally [[Wiktionary:sedentary|sedentary]] or [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]], but do occasionally move quite readily, especially when hunting. They have two distinct methods for moving \u2013 'looping' and 'somersaulting'. They do this by bending over and attaching themselves to the [[Wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] with the mouth and tentacles and then relocate the foot, which provides the usual attachment, this process is called looping. In somersaulting, the body then bends over and makes a new place of attachment with the foot. By this process of \"looping\" or \"somersaulting\", a ''Hydra'' can move several inches (c.&nbsp;100&nbsp;mm) in a day. ''Hydra'' may also move by [[Amoeboid movement|amoeboid motion]] of their bases or by detaching from the substrate and floating away in the current.\n\n==Reproduction and life cycle==\n[[File:Hydra Budding.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.35|''Hydra'' ''[[budding]]'':<br>1.

Swellings in the body wall develop into either ovaries or testes. The testes release free-swimming [[gamete]]s into the water, and these can fertilize the egg in the ovary of another individual. The fertilized eggs secrete a tough outer coating, and, as the adult dies (due to starvation or cold), these resting eggs fall to the bottom of the lake or pond to await better conditions, whereupon they hatch into nymph ''Hydra''.

Despite their simple construction, the tentacles of ''Hydra'' are extraordinarily extensible and can be four to five times the length of the body. Once fully extended, the tentacles are slowly manoeuvred around waiting for contact with a suitable prey animal. Upon contact, nematocysts on the tentacle fire into the prey, and the tentacle itself coils around the prey. Within 30 seconds, most of the remaining tentacles will have already joined in the attack to subdue the struggling prey. Within two minutes, the tentacles will have surrounded the prey and moved it into the opened mouth aperture. Within ten minutes, the prey will have been engulfed within the body cavity, and digestion will have started. ''Hydra'' are able to stretch their body wall considerably in order to digest prey more than twice their size. After two or three days, the indigestible remains of the prey will be discharged through the mouth aperture via contractions.{{citation needed |date=March 2019}}\n\nThe feeding behaviour of ''Hydra'' demonstrates the sophistication of what appears to be a simple nervous system.\n\nSome species of ''Hydra'' exist in a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutual relationship]] with various types of unicellular [[algae]]. The algae are protected from predators by ''Hydra'' and, in return, [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] products from the algae are beneficial as a food source to ''Hydra''.\n\n===Measuring the feeding response===\n\n[[File:Fig1 TentacleSpread wiki.png|thumb|Addition of glutathione causes reduction in the tentacle spread in hydra.]]\nThe feeding response in ''Hydra'' is induced by [[glutathione]] (specifically in the reduced state as GSH) released from damaged tissue of injured prey.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Loomis WF | title =  Glutathione control of the specific feeding reactions of hydra. | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | date = October 1955 | volume = 62 | issue = 9 | pages = 211\u201327 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1955.tb35372.x | bibcode = 1955NYASA..62..211L }}</ref> There are several methods conventionally used for quantification of the feeding response.

Typically, ''Hydras'' will reproduce by just budding off a whole new individual, the bud will occur around two-thirds of the way down the body axis. When a ''Hydra'' is cut in half, each half will regenerate and form into a small ''Hydra''; the \"head\" will regenerate a \"foot\" and the \"foot\" will regenerate a \"head\". This regeneration occurs without cell division. If the ''Hydra'' is sliced into many segments then the middle slices will form both a \"head\" and a \"foot\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The polarity of the regeneration is explained by two pairs of positional value gradients.

Gland cells in the basal disc secrete a sticky fluid that accounts for its adhesive properties.\n\nAt the free end of the body is a mouth opening surrounded by one to twelve thin, mobile [[tentacle]]s. Each tentacle, or cnida (plural: cnidae), is clothed with highly specialised stinging cells called [[cnidocyte]]s. Cnidocytes contain specialized structures called [[nematocyst]]s, which look like miniature light bulbs with a coiled thread inside. At the narrow outer edge of the cnidocyte is a short trigger hair called a cnidocil. Upon contact with prey, the contents of the nematocyst are explosively discharged, firing a dart-like thread containing [[neurotoxin]]s into whatever triggered the release. This can paralyze the prey, especially if many hundreds of nematocysts are fired.\n\n''Hydra'' has two main body layers, which makes it \"[[diploblastic]]\". The layers are separated by [[mesoglea]], a gel-like substance. The outer layer is the [[Squamous epithelium|epidermis]], and the inner layer is called the [[gastrodermis]], because it lines the stomach. The cells making up these two body layers are relatively simple.

They have two distinct methods for moving \u2013 'looping' and 'somersaulting'. They do this by bending over and attaching themselves to the [[Wiktionary:substrate|substrate]] with the mouth and tentacles and then relocate the foot, which provides the usual attachment, this process is called looping. In somersaulting, the body then bends over and makes a new place of attachment with the foot. By this process of \"looping\" or \"somersaulting\", a ''Hydra'' can move several inches (c.&nbsp;100&nbsp;mm) in a day.

The fertilized eggs secrete a tough outer coating, and, as the adult dies (due to starvation or cold), these resting eggs fall to the bottom of the lake or pond to await better conditions, whereupon they hatch into nymph ''Hydra''.

Despite their simple construction, the tentacles of ''Hydra'' are extraordinarily extensible and can be four to five times the length of the body. Once fully extended, the tentacles are slowly manoeuvred around waiting for contact with a suitable prey animal. Upon contact, nematocysts on the tentacle fire into the prey, and the tentacle itself coils around the prey. Within 30 seconds, most of the remaining tentacles will have already joined in the attack to subdue the struggling prey. Within two minutes, the tentacles will have surrounded the prey and moved it into the opened mouth aperture. Within ten minutes, the prey will have been engulfed within the body cavity, and digestion will have started. ''Hydra'' are able to stretch their body wall considerably in order to digest prey more than twice their size. After two or three days, the indigestible remains of the prey will be discharged through the mouth aperture via contractions.{{cn |date=March 2019}}\n\nThe feeding behaviour of ''Hydra'' demonstrates the sophistication of what appears to be a simple nervous system.\n\nSome species of ''Hydra'' exist in a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutual relationship]] with various types of unicellular [[algae]].

This regeneration occurs without cell division. If the ''Hydra'' is sliced into many segments then the middle slices will form both a \"head\" and a \"foot\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The polarity of the regeneration is explained by two pairs of positional value gradients.

{"title_page": "Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n{{Use South African English|date=June 2012}}\n{{Apartheid}}\nThe [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] system in [[South Africa]] was ended through a series of negotiations between 1990 and 1993 and through unilateral steps by the [[F.W. de Klerk|de Klerk]] government. These [[negotiation]]s took place between the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], the [[African National Congress]], and a wide variety of other political organisations.  Negotiations took place against a  backdrop of political violence in the country, including allegations of a state-sponsored third force destabilising the country. The negotiations resulted in South Africa's first non-racial [[1994 South African general election|election]], which was won by the [[African National Congress]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|South Africa under apartheid|Internal resistance to apartheid}}\nApartheid was a system of [[racial discrimination]] and [[racial segregation|segregation]] in South African government. It was formalised in 1948, forming a framework for political and economic dominance by the [[white South African|white]] population and severely restricting the political rights of the [[black people|black]] majority.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1990, the [[African National Congress]] and other mainly black opposition political organisations were banned. As the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] cracked down on black opposition to apartheid, most leaders of ANC and other opposition organisations were either killed, imprisoned or went into exile.\n\nHowever, increasing local and international pressure on the government, as well as the realisation that apartheid could neither be maintained by force forever nor overthrown by the opposition without considerable suffering, eventually led both sides to the negotiating table. The [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]], which brought an end to the [[South African Border War]] in neighbouring Angola and Namibia, created a window of opportunity to create the enabling conditions for a negotiated settlement, recognized by Dr [[Niel Barnard]] of the National Intelligence Service.<ref>Turton, A.R. 2010. Shaking Hands with Billy: The Private Memoirs of Anthony Richard Turton. Durban: Just Done Publications. http://www.shakinghandswithbilly.com</ref>\n\n===Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith===\n{{Main|Mahlabatini Declaration}}\nOn 4 January 1974, [[Harry Schwarz]], leader of the liberal-reformist wing of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], met with [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi|Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi]], Chief Executive Councillor of the black homeland of [[KwaZulu]], and signed a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa, which came to be known as the [[Mahlabatini Declaration|Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]].{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Signers of the Mahlabatini Declaration\n| width     = 100\n   | footer    = \n   | image1    = HarrySchwarz1976.jpeg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Harry Schwarz\n   | image2    = Mangosuthu Buthelezi (1983).jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = Gatsha Buthelezi\n  }} The declaration stated that \"the situation of South Africa in the world scene as well as internal community relations requires, in our view, an acceptance of certain fundamental concepts for the economic, social and constitutional development of our country\". It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also affirmed that political change must take place through non-violent means.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Thomas|year=2002|title=Indispensable traitors: liberal parties in settler conflicts|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0-313-31774-7}}</ref>\n\nThe declaration was the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white political leaders in South Africa that affirmed to these principles. The commitment to the peaceful pursuit of political change was declared at a time when neither the National Party nor the African National Congress was looking to peaceful solutions or dialogue. The declaration was heralded by the English speaking press as a breakthrough in race relations in South Africa. Shortly after it was issued, the declaration was endorsed by several chief ministers of the black homelands, including [[Cedric Phatudi]] ([[Lebowa]]), [[Lucas Mangope]] ([[Bophuthatswana]]) and Hudson Nisanwisi ([[Gazankulu]]).<ref>http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201974.pdf</ref> Despite considerable support from black leaders, the English speaking press and liberal figures such as [[Alan Paton]], the declaration saw staunch opposition from the National Party, the Afrikaans press and the conservative wing of Harry Schwarz's United Party.<ref>http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201975.pdf</ref>\n\n===Early contact===\nThe very first meetings between the South African Government and [[Nelson Mandela]] were driven by the [[National Intelligence Service (South Africa)|National Intelligence Service]] (NIS) under the leadership of [[Niel Barnard]] and his Deputy Director General, [[Mike Louw]]. These meetings were secret in nature and were designed to develop an understanding about whether there were sufficient common grounds for future peace talks. As these meetings evolved, a level of trust developed between the key actors (Barnard, Louw, and Mandela).<ref name=\"turton\"/> To facilitate future talks while preserving secrecy needed to protect the process, Barnard arranged for Mandela to be moved off [[Robben Island]] to [[Pollsmoor Prison]] in 1982. This provided Mandela with more comfortable lodgings, but also gave easier access in a way that could not be compromised. Barnard therefore brokered an initial agreement in principle about what became known as \"talks about talks\". It was at this stage that the process was elevated from a secret engagement to a more public engagement. \n \nThe first less-tentative meeting between Mandela and the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government came while [[P. W. Botha]] was [[State President of South Africa|State President]]. In November 1985, Minister [[Kobie Coetsee]] met Mandela in the hospital while Mandela was being treated for prostate surgery.{{dubious|date=December 2013}} Over the next four years, a series of tentative meetings took place, laying the groundwork for further contact and future negotiations, but little real progress was made, and the meetings remained secret until several years later.<ref name=sparks>{{cite book|\ntitle=Tomorrow is Another Country: the inside story of South Africa's Negotiated Revolution|\nfirst=Allister|last=Sparks|\nauthorlink=Allister Sparks|\nyear=1994|\npublisher=Struik\n|location=Sandton\n|isbn=978-1-87501-511-5}}</ref>\n\nAs the secret talks bore fruit and the political engagement started to take place, the National Intelligence Service withdrew from centre stage in the process, and moved to a new phase of operational support work.

The ANC pushed instead for a transition in a single stage to majority rule.  Other sticking points included minority rights, decisions on a unitary or federal state, property rights, and indemnity from prosecution for politically motivated crimes.\n\nFollowing the collapse of CODESA II, bilateral negotiations between the ANC and the NP became the main negotiation channel. Two key negotiators were [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] of the ANC, and [[Roelf Meyer]] of the National Party, who formed a close friendship.<ref name=codesa/>\n\nIt was [[Joe Slovo]], leader of the [[South African Communist Party]], who in 1992 proposed the breakthrough \"sunset clause\" for a coalition government for the five years following a democratic election, including guarantees and concessions to all sides.<ref name=sunset>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/asr/7No4/Pariah.html|title=From Pariah to Partner - Bophuthatswana, the NPKF, and the SANDF|last=Cilliers|first=Jakkie|journal=African Security Review|volume=7|issue=4|year=1998|accessdate=2006-12-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012051236/http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/ASR/7No4/Pariah.html|archivedate=12 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the negotiating and reshaping process, the government under De Klerk also had detainees released who were classified as political prisoners at that time.

This put considerable pressure on the other parties to agree with the consensus or be left behind.<ref name=codesa/> In protest at the perceived sidelining of the mainly-[[Zulu people|Zulu]] Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Mangosuthu Buthelezi took the IFP out of the MPNF and formed the ''Concerned South Africans Group'' (COSAG; later renamed the \"Freedom Alliance\") together with traditional leaders, homeland leaders and white right-wing groups. A period of brinkmanship followed, with the IFP remaining out of the negotiations until within days of the election on 27 April 1994. Buthelezi was convinced to give up the [[boycott]] of the elections, after [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]] offered the Zulu king, [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu]], a guarantee of special status of the Zulu monarchy, and to Buthelezi, the promise that foreign mediators would examine Inkatha's claims to more autonomy in the Zulu area. This was managed with the help of a foreign team led by former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]].\n\nOn 10 April 1993, the assassination of [[Chris Hani]], leader of the SACP and a senior ANC leader, by white right-wingers again brought the country to the brink of disaster, but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination.<ref name=turningpoints>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm|title=Turning Points in History Book 6: Negotiation, Transition and Freedom|accessdate=2007-12-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309124114/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm|archivedate=9 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Chris Hani#Assassination|assassination of Hani]] sometimes is considered as an event which led to a shift of power in favour of the ANC because of Nelson Mandela's handling of the situation.\n\nThe negotiations were dramatically interrupted in June 1993 when the right-wing [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] [[Storming of Kempton Park World Trade Centre|stormed the World Trade Centre]] in Kempton Park, breaking through the glass front of the building with an armoured car and briefly taking over the negotiations chamber.<ref name=turningpoints/>\n\nThe MPNF ratified the interim Constitution in the early hours of the morning of 18 November 1993.

These [[negotiation]]s took place between the governing [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], the [[African National Congress]], and a wide variety of other political organisations.  Negotiations took place against a  backdrop of political violence in the country, including allegations of a state-sponsored third force destabilising the country. The negotiations resulted in South Africa's first non-racial [[1994 South African general election|election]], which was won by the [[African National Congress]].\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|South Africa under apartheid|Internal resistance to apartheid}}\nApartheid was a system of [[racial discrimination]] and [[racial segregation|segregation]] in South African government. It was formalised in 1948, forming a framework for political and economic dominance by the [[white South African|white]] population and severely restricting the political rights of the [[black people|black]] majority.\n\nBetween 1960 and 1990, the [[African National Congress]] and other mainly black opposition political organisations were banned. As the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] cracked down on black opposition to apartheid, most leaders of ANC and other opposition organisations were either killed, imprisoned or went into exile.\n\nHowever, increasing local and international pressure on the government, as well as the realisation that apartheid could neither be maintained by force forever nor overthrown by the opposition without considerable suffering, eventually led both sides to the negotiating table. The [[Tripartite Accord (Angola)|Tripartite Accord]], which brought an end to the [[South African Border War]] in neighbouring Angola and Namibia, created a window of opportunity to create the enabling conditions for a negotiated settlement, recognized by Dr [[Niel Barnard]] of the National Intelligence Service.<ref>Turton, A.R. 2010.

Durban: Just Done Publications. http://www.shakinghandswithbilly.com</ref>\n\n===Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith===\n{{Main|Mahlabatini Declaration}}\nOn 4 January 1974, [[Harry Schwarz]], leader of the liberal-reformist wing of the [[United Party (South Africa)|United Party]], met with [[Mangosuthu Buthelezi|Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi]], Chief Executive Councillor of the black homeland of [[KwaZulu]], and signed a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa, which came to be known as the [[Mahlabatini Declaration|Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith]].{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    = Signers of the Mahlabatini Declaration\n| width     = 100\n   | footer    = \n   | image1    = HarrySchwarz1976.jpeg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Harry Schwarz\n   | image2    = Mangosuthu Buthelezi (1983).jpg\n   | alt2      = \n   | caption2  = Gatsha Buthelezi\n  }} The declaration stated that \"the situation of South Africa in the world scene as well as internal community relations requires, in our view, an acceptance of certain fundamental concepts for the economic, social and constitutional development of our country\". It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also affirmed that political change must take place through non-violent means.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Thomas|year=2002|title=Indispensable traitors: liberal parties in settler conflicts|publisher=Praeger|isbn=0-313-31774-7}}</ref>\n\nThe declaration was the first of such agreements by acknowledged black and white political leaders in South Africa that affirmed to these principles. The commitment to the peaceful pursuit of political change was declared at a time when neither the National Party nor the African National Congress was looking to peaceful solutions or dialogue. The declaration was heralded by the English speaking press as a breakthrough in race relations in South Africa. Shortly after it was issued, the declaration was endorsed by several chief ministers of the black homelands, including [[Cedric Phatudi]] ([[Lebowa]]), [[Lucas Mangope]] ([[Bophuthatswana]]) and Hudson Nisanwisi ([[Gazankulu]]).<ref>http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201974.pdf</ref> Despite considerable support from black leaders, the English speaking press and liberal figures such as [[Alan Paton]], the declaration saw staunch opposition from the National Party, the Afrikaans press and the conservative wing of Harry Schwarz's United Party.<ref>http://www.nelsonmandela.org/omalley/cis/omalley/OMalleyWeb/dat/SAIRR%20Survey%201975.pdf</ref>\n\n===Early contact===\nThe very first meetings between the South African Government and [[Nelson Mandela]] were driven by the [[National Intelligence Service (South Africa)|National Intelligence Service]] (NIS) under the leadership of [[Niel Barnard]] and his Deputy Director General, [[Mike Louw]]. These meetings were secret in nature and were designed to develop an understanding about whether there were sufficient common grounds for future peace talks. As these meetings evolved, a level of trust developed between the key actors (Barnard, Louw, and Mandela).<ref name=\"turton\"/> To facilitate future talks while preserving secrecy needed to protect the process, Barnard arranged for Mandela to be moved off [[Robben Island]] to [[Pollsmoor Prison]] in 1982. This provided Mandela with more comfortable lodgings, but also gave easier access in a way that could not be compromised. Barnard therefore brokered an initial agreement in principle about what became known as \"talks about talks\". It was at this stage that the process was elevated from a secret engagement to a more public engagement. \n \nThe first less-tentative meeting between Mandela and the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] government came while [[P. W. Botha]] was [[State President of South Africa|State President]]. In November 1985, Minister [[Kobie Coetsee]] met Mandela in the hospital while Mandela was being treated for prostate surgery.{{dubious|date=December 2013}} Over the next four years, a series of tentative meetings took place, laying the groundwork for further contact and future negotiations, but little real progress was made, and the meetings remained secret until several years later.<ref name=sparks>{{cite book|\ntitle=Tomorrow is Another Country: the inside story of South Africa's Negotiated Revolution|\nfirst=Allister|last=Sparks|\nauthorlink=Allister Sparks|\nyear=1994|\npublisher=Struik\n|location=Sandton\n|isbn=978-1-87501-511-5}}</ref>\n\nAs the secret talks bore fruit and the political engagement started to take place, the National Intelligence Service withdrew from centre stage in the process, and moved to a new phase of operational support work.

The IFP was therefore represented by Frank Mdlalose at CODESA.\n\nIn the period between CODESA I and CODESA II in early 1992, the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] lost three by-elections to the Conservative Party. De Klerk announced that a \"whites only\" [[1992 South African referendum|referendum]] would be held on the issue of reforms and negotiation. The result was a landslide victory for the \"yes\" side, with over 68% of the voters voting for a continuation of the reforms and negotiations.<ref name=bbc-referendum>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/march/18/newsid_2524000/2524695.stm|title=1992: South Africa votes for change|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2007-04-28 | date=18 March 1992}}</ref>\n\n==CODESA II and the breakdown of negotiations==\nCODESA II (the second plenary session) took place in May 1992. In June 1992, the [[Boipatong massacre]] took place, with 45 residents of [[Boipatong]] killed by mainly-Zulu hostel dwellers. Mandela accused De Klerk's government of complicity in the attack and withdrew the ANC from the negotiations, leading to the end of CODESA II.<ref name=boipatong>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/1992/pr0618.html|title=Boipatong Massacre|date=18 June 1992|accessdate=2007-04-28|publisher=ANC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010514041611/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/1992/pr0618.html|archivedate=14 May 2001}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Truth Commission - Special Report|url=http://www.sabctrc.saha.org.za/glossary/boipatong_massacre.htm?t=%2BBoipatong+%2Bmassacre&tab=victims&start=60|publisher=SABC|accessdate=29 June 2014|quote=Forty-five people died and 27 others were seriously injured on 17 June 1992|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629110120/http://www.sabctrc.saha.org.za/glossary/boipatong_massacre.htm?t=%2BBoipatong+%2Bmassacre&tab=victims&start=60|archivedate=29 June 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=SmithJanet>{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Janet|title=The Boipatong massacre: 20 years on|url=http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/the-boipatong-massacre-20-years-on-1.1318617#.U6_wUJSSyyg|accessdate=29 June 2014|work=The Star|date=14 June 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928193147/http://www.iol.co.za/the-star/the-boipatong-massacre-20-years-on-1.1318617|archivedate=28 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe ANC instead took to the streets with a programme of \"[[rolling mass action]]\", which met with tragedy in the [[Bisho massacre]] in September 1992, when the army of the nominally independent \"[[bantustan|homeland]]\" of [[Ciskei]] opened fire on protest marchers, killing 29. This brought a new urgency to the search for a political settlement.<ref name=SmithJanet/><ref name=Mandela>{{cite book|title=[[Long Walk to Freedom (book)|Long Walk to Freedom]]|first=Nelson|last=Mandela|year=1994}}</ref>\n\n==Resumption of negotiations==\nDuring the negotiations, De Klerk's government pushed for a two-phase transition with an appointed transitional government with a rotating presidency. The ANC pushed instead for a transition in a single stage to majority rule.  Other sticking points included minority rights, decisions on a unitary or federal state, property rights, and indemnity from prosecution for politically motivated crimes.\n\nFollowing the collapse of CODESA II, bilateral negotiations between the ANC and the NP became the main negotiation channel. Two key negotiators were [[Cyril Ramaphosa]] of the ANC, and [[Roelf Meyer]] of the National Party, who formed a close friendship.<ref name=codesa/>\n\nIt was [[Joe Slovo]], leader of the [[South African Communist Party]], who in 1992 proposed the breakthrough \"sunset clause\" for a coalition government for the five years following a democratic election, including guarantees and concessions to all sides.<ref name=sunset>{{cite journal|url=http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/asr/7No4/Pariah.html|title=From Pariah to Partner - Bophuthatswana, the NPKF, and the SANDF|last=Cilliers|first=Jakkie|journal=African Security Review|volume=7|issue=4|year=1998|accessdate=2006-12-19|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012051236/http://www.iss.co.za/pubs/ASR/7No4/Pariah.html|archivedate=12 October 2006|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the course of the negotiating and reshaping process, the government under De Klerk also had detainees released who were classified as political prisoners at that time. Among those released in 1992 were convicts facing [[capital punishment]] such as [[Barend Strydom]] and [[Robert McBride (police officer)|Robert McBride]] from opposite ends of the political spectrum.\n\n===Record of understanding===\nOn 26 September 1992 the government and the ANC agreed on a ''Record of Understanding''. This dealt with a constitutional assembly, an interim government, political prisoners, hostels, dangerous weapons and mass action and restarted the negotiation process after the failure of CODESA.<ref name=record>{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/record.html|title=Record of Understanding|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=2006-12-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061012064901/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/record.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-12}}</ref>\n\n===Multiparty Negotiating Forum===\nOn 1 April 1993 the ''Multiparty Negotiating Forum'' (MPNF) gathered for the first time. In contrast to CODESA, the white right (the Conservative Party and the Afrikaner Volksunie), the Pan Africanist Congress, the KwaZulu homeland government and delegations of \"traditional leaders\" initially participated in the Multiparty Negotiating Forum.<ref name=conscourt>{{cite web|url=http://www.constitutionalcourt.org.za/text/constitution/history.html|title=The history of the Constitution|publisher=Constitutional Court of South Africa|accessdate=2007-04-28}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the Record of Understanding, the two main negotiating parties, the ANC and the NP, agreed to reach bilateral consensus on issues before taking them to the other parties in the forum. This put considerable pressure on the other parties to agree with the consensus or be left behind.<ref name=codesa/> In protest at the perceived sidelining of the mainly-[[Zulu people|Zulu]] Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP), Mangosuthu Buthelezi took the IFP out of the MPNF and formed the ''Concerned South Africans Group'' (COSAG; later renamed the \"Freedom Alliance\") together with traditional leaders, homeland leaders and white right-wing groups. A period of brinkmanship followed, with the IFP remaining out of the negotiations until within days of the election on 27 April 1994. Buthelezi was convinced to give up the [[boycott]] of the elections, after [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]] offered the Zulu king, [[Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu]], a guarantee of special status of the Zulu monarchy, and to Buthelezi, the promise that foreign mediators would examine Inkatha's claims to more autonomy in the Zulu area. This was managed with the help of a foreign team led by former [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] and former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]].\n\nOn 10 April 1993, the assassination of [[Chris Hani]], leader of the SACP and a senior ANC leader, by white right-wingers again brought the country to the brink of disaster, but ultimately proved a turning point, after which the main parties pushed for a settlement with increased determination.<ref name=turningpoints>{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm|title=Turning Points in History Book 6: Negotiation, Transition and Freedom|accessdate=2007-12-03|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309124114/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/turningpoints/bk6/intro.htm|archivedate=9 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Chris Hani#Assassination|assassination of Hani]] sometimes is considered as an event which led to a shift of power in favour of the ANC because of Nelson Mandela's handling of the situation.\n\nThe negotiations were dramatically interrupted in June 1993 when the right-wing [[Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging]] [[Storming of Kempton Park World Trade Centre|stormed the World Trade Centre]] in Kempton Park, breaking through the glass front of the building with an armoured car and briefly taking over the negotiations chamber.<ref name=turningpoints/>\n\nThe MPNF ratified the interim Constitution in the early hours of the morning of 18 November 1993. Thereafter, the [[Transitional Executive Council]] (TEC) oversaw the run-up to a democratic election.<ref name=conscourt/>\n\n==Elections==\n{{Main|1994 South African general election}}\n\nThe election held on 27 April 1994 resulted in the ANC winning 62% of the vote, and Nelson Mandela becoming president, with De Klerk and [[Thabo Mbeki]] as deputies.
