After independence in August 1947, the need for an official aircraft for head of state was felt strongly. For this purpose, an ex-[[History of the Royal Air Force|British Imperial Air Force]] [[Vickers Viking]] was procured to serve as the official transport of the [[Governor-General of Pakistan]]. This aircraft is considered as the first to use the call sign reserved for an aircraft flying Pakistan's head of state or head of government, 'PAKISTAN ONE'. Pakistan's first Governor-General, Quaid-e-Azam [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] was the first to fly in this aircraft, using it until his death on 11 September 1948. After his death, the new Governor-General, [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] used the aircraft as his official transport until 1953, when the aircraft was retired. It remained parked at [[Karachi]]'s [[Mauripur Airbase]] and then at a PAF Base in Peshawar. In 1997, the aircraft was disassembled and transported to Karachi via road. In Karachi, it was restored and put up for display at the [[Pakistan Air Force]] Museum.\n\nFollowing that, in the 1960s and 70s, the [[President of Pakistan]]: [[Muhammad Ayub Khan]], [[Yahya Khan]] and [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] used [[Boeing 707]] jetliners of the national flag carrier, [[Pakistan International Airlines]]. \nIn the 1980s, President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] used [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130B Hercules]]. In the '90s, Prime Ministers [[Nawaz Sharif]] and [[Benazir Bhutto]] used a [[Boeing 737]] for their official trips. The airliner was maintained by Pakistan Government Transport. [[Pakistan International Airlines|PIA]] always transports the presidents and Prime Ministers of Pakistan on overseas visits. During the late 1990s, Prime Minister Sharif's government bought a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] for official use. \nInitially it was given to PIA for commercial use while it was not on official duty. However, when the government changed after a military coup in 1999, the aircraft was transferred to PIA permanently. The President and Prime Minister then resorted to using two of PIA's [[Airbus A310]]s for official visits, while rare trips were done on regular commercial flights of the airline. In 2007 Qatar government gifted an Airbus A310-300 of [[Qatar Amiri Flight]] to Pakistan, it was operated for the Pakistan Air Force by PIA.\n\nSince 2010 Gulfstream IV is being operated by Pakistan Air Force with serial number J-755, J-756 and four AW 139 helicopters are also on President and Prime Minister disposal every time.\n{{-}}\n===Peru===\n[[File:Avi\u00f3n presidencia del Per\u00fa.JPG|thumb|right|Boeing 737 of Republic of Peru]]\nThe official aircraft of the [[President of Peru]] is a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500]] acquired in 1995 during [[Alberto Fujimori]]'s presidency.\n{{-}}\n===Philippines===\nThe 250th Presidential Airlift Wing of the [[Philippine Air Force]] is used to transport the [[President of the Philippines]] and the First Family.  On occasion, the wing has also been tasked to provide transportation for other members of government, visiting heads of state, and other state guests.\n\nThe fleet includes: 1 [[Fokker F28]], which is primarily used for the President's domestic trips and it is also called ''Kalayaan'' (\"Freedom\") ''One'' when the President is on board, 1 [[Fokker F27]] aircraft, 4 [[Bell 412]] helicopters, 3 [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopters, and 1 [[Sikorsky S-70|Sikorsky S-70A-5 Black Hawk]]. On October 2019, the government purchased a [[Gulfstream G280]] aircraft for use by the President and other senior officials, and is set for delivery by 2020.\n\nFor trips outside of the Philippines, the President uses a [[Learjet 60]], Challenger 850 or charters appropriate aircraft from [[Philippine Airlines]]. The aircraft with the flight number '''PR/PAL 001''' and callsign '''PHILIPPINE 001''' is a special aircraft operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the presidential aircraft was a [[Mitsubishi MC-20]]. In the 1950s, PAF [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s, which were named ''[[Mount Pinatubo]]'' and ''Pagasa'' (\"Hope\") were used for domestic flights. Prior to 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from [[Pan American World Airways]] as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended. In 1963, the ''Pag-asa'' was renamed ''Common Man''.\n\n[[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] are being used for short-haul flights.

After independence in August 1947, the need for an official aircraft for head of state was felt strongly. For this purpose, an ex-[[History of the Royal Air Force|British Imperial Air Force]] [[Vickers Viking]] was procured to serve as the official transport of the [[Governor-General of Pakistan]]. This aircraft is considered as the first to use the call sign reserved for an aircraft flying Pakistan's head of state or head of government, 'PAKISTAN ONE'. Pakistan's first Governor-General, Quaid-e-Azam [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] was the first to fly in this aircraft, using it until his death on 11 September 1948. After his death, the new Governor-General, [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]] used the aircraft as his official transport until 1953, when the aircraft was retired. It remained parked at [[Karachi]]'s [[Mauripur Airbase]] and then at a PAF Base in Peshawar. In 1997, the aircraft was disassembled and transported to Karachi via road. In Karachi, it was restored and put up for display at the [[Pakistan Air Force]] Museum.\n\nFollowing that, in the 1960s and 70s, the [[President of Pakistan]]: [[Muhammad Ayub Khan]], [[Yahya Khan]] and [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] used [[Boeing 707]] jetliners of the national flag carrier, [[Pakistan International Airlines]]. \nIn the 1980s, President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] used [[Lockheed C-130 Hercules|Lockheed C-130B Hercules]]. In the '90s, Prime Ministers [[Nawaz Sharif]] and [[Benazir Bhutto]] used a [[Boeing 737]] for their official trips. The airliner was maintained by Pakistan Government Transport. [[Pakistan International Airlines|PIA]] always transports the presidents and Prime Ministers of Pakistan on overseas visits. During the late 1990s, Prime Minister Sharif's government bought a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-300]] for official use. \nInitially it was given to PIA for commercial use while it was not on official duty. However, when the government changed after a military coup in 1999, the aircraft was transferred to PIA permanently. The President and Prime Minister then resorted to using two of PIA's [[Airbus A310]]s for official visits, while rare trips were done on regular commercial flights of the airline. In 2007 Qatar government gifted an Airbus A310-300 of [[Qatar Amiri Flight]] to Pakistan, it was operated for the Pakistan Air Force by PIA.\n\nSince 2010 Gulfstream IV is being operated by Pakistan Air Force with serial number J-755, J-756 and four AW 139 helicopters are also on President and Prime Minister disposal every time.\n{{-}}\n===Peru===\n[[File:Avi\u00f3n presidencia del Per\u00fa.JPG|thumb|right|Boeing 737 of Republic of Peru]]\nThe official aircraft of the [[President of Peru]] is a [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500]] acquired in 1995 during [[Alberto Fujimori]]'s presidency.\n{{-}}\n===Philippines===\nThe 250th Presidential Airlift Wing of the [[Philippine Air Force]] is used to transport the [[President of the Philippines]] and the First Family.  On occasion, the wing has also been tasked to provide transportation for other members of government, visiting heads of state, and other state guests.\n\nThe fleet includes: 1 [[Fokker F28]], which is primarily used for the President's domestic trips and it is also called ''Kalayaan'' (\"Freedom\") ''One'' when the President is on board, 1 [[Fokker F27]] aircraft, 4 [[Bell 412]] helicopters, 3 [[Sikorsky S-76]] helicopters, and 1 [[Sikorsky S-70|Sikorsky S-70A-5 Black Hawk]]. On October 2019, the government purchased a [[Gulfstream G280]] aircraft for use by the President and other senior officials, and is set for delivery by 2020.\n\nFor trips outside of the Philippines, the President uses a [[Learjet 60]], Challenger 850 or charters appropriate aircraft from [[Philippine Airlines]]. The aircraft with the flight number '''PR/PAL 001''' and callsign '''PHILIPPINE 001''' is a special aircraft operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the President.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], the presidential aircraft was a [[Mitsubishi MC-20]]. In the 1950s, PAF [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]]s, which were named ''[[Mount Pinatubo]]'' and ''Pagasa'' (\"Hope\") were used for domestic flights. Prior to 1962, the Air Force chartered aircraft from [[Pan American World Airways]] as the international services of Philippine Airlines were suspended. In 1963, the ''Pag-asa'' was renamed ''Common Man''.\n\n[[Airbus A320 family|Airbus A320]] and [[Airbus A321]] are being used for short-haul flights.

Anna is the [[narcissistic]] and arrogant younger sister of the quiet and serious [[Nina Williams]], the personal bodyguard of [[Kazuya Mishima]] and second-in-command at [[G Corporation (Tekken)|G Corporation]]. She is also, although unbeknownst to her, the aunt of boxing competitor [[Steve Fox (Tekken)|Steve Fox]]. She is defined by her rivalry with Nina, a trait that has been around since the original ''Tekken'' game.\n\nAnna originally shared most of her moves with her sister Nina, but has since gained a more idiosyncratic moveset. In the other ''Tekken'' media, including films, Anna usually appears in role of a minor villain. The character was met with positive critical reception.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\nAnna Williams was the daughter of an Irish father and American mother and was raised in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] together with her elder sister [[Nina Williams|Nina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5495441/kiss-me-im-an-irish-video-game-character/ |title=Kiss Me, I\u2019m An Irish Video Game Character |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> She and Nina were taught various martial arts by their father, a former assassin Richard Williams since young age. Anna was also personally trained by her mother. When Richard died under mysterious circumstances the sisters blamed each other, leading to a long-standing rivalry between them. After this, both sisters went their separate ways with Nina using her skills to become an assassin, and Anna joining the paramilitary and becoming an officer in the Tekken Force.\n\nAnna plays only a very minor role in the story of the [[Tekken (video game)|first game]], appearing as a [[sub-boss]] character for Nina. Her story was further expanded in later games. In ''[[Tekken 2]]'', as in the first tournament, the 20-year-old Nina was once again hired to assassinate the sponsor of the current tournament, [[Kazuya Mishima]]. Whether at Kazuya's discretion or Anna's own volition, Anna became a bodyguard for Kazuya, along with [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]] and [[List of Tekken characters#Bruce Irvin|Bruce Irvin]], who were all charged with Kazuya's protection. Nina was later captured by Mishima Zaibatsu forces and used in [[Dr. Bosconovitch]]'s [[cryonics]] research. Learning about this, Anna volunteered to be another test subject, requesting that she be woken in the future at the same time as Nina. Her reason for doing this is unknown, but the two most reasonable explanations would be because she didn't want to feel lonely without Nina, and she didn't want her sister's age preserved in a cryonic sleep while she herself continues to age.\n\nIn ''[[Tekken 3]]'', after being placed in suspended animation during the second tournament, Nina was awoken 19 years later by the influence of the recently excavated [[Ogre (Tekken)|Ogre]], who compelled her to assassinate [[Jin Kazama]]. As per her request, Anna was awoken at the same time as her sister, though she was unaffected by Ogre's influence. Nina also began to suffer ill effects from the 'cold-sleep', resulting in long-term memory loss. In an act of compassion, Anna set out to stop Nina from once again becoming an assassin, and to help her recover her memory loss. However, she failed at the end of the tournament when Nina recovered her memory about her rivalry with Anna, which resulted in Nina leaving and cutting all contact with Anna.\n\nIn ''[[Tekken 5]]'', Nina decides to make contact with Anna in hopes of restoring her memory, but their meeting triggers Nina's lost feelings of hostility towards her sister, and she immediately opens fire. Anna retaliates, and the reunion descends into a gunfight which lasts for days. The sisters eventually reach a stalemate and agree to settle things for good and a portion of their battle can be seen in the introductory sequence of the game. During their battle in the tournament, both sisters agreed that only one would walk away from their battle alive. However, when Nina defeats Anna, she refuses to take Anna's life as she felt the fight was not satisfactory.\n\nHumiliated by her loss, Anna seeks revenge at Nina, who has already gone into hiding. Anna hears rumors she has become Jin's new bodyguard, thus being involved with the Mishima Zaibatsu. In another attempt to have a chance to battle Nina, she offers herself as a personal bodyguard to the CEO of G Corporation, Kazuya Mishima, knowing that his plan to confront Jin would eventually lead her to her sister. She enters ''[[Tekken 6|The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6]]'' at Kazuya's request. In Scenario Campaign, Anna leads the defense of G Corporation against Mishima Zaibatsu and [[Lars Alexandersson]]'s rebel army, and during a confrontation with the rebel army, she sends troops that results in Lars' friend, Tougou's death. She also accompanies Kazuya when he comes to Azazel's Temple in the desert. Upon the latter's stalemate battle with Lars, Anna escapes with Kazuya after he is let go by Lars.\n\nAnna appears in Nina's own spin-off action game ''[[Death by Degrees]]'' as a commander of the Tekken Force. Like in the ''Tekken'' games, Anna fights using her fists and her feet, appearing in several encounters. After Nina wins the game's final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight against her, Anna almost falls into the water below but Nina grabs her hand, and then she reminisces about when her father Richard Williams was killed with gunfire and Anna comforted her afterwards. Another explosion almost sends them both into the water, but Anna jumps rescues Nina in turn. Once the game is completed, Anna becomes a [[player character]] in her own scenario, titled \"Anna Mode\", which is more difficult than the standard game as there are limited recovery items and weapons and no save locations in the first play through, and Anna can use melee weapons but no guns. The Anna Mode takes place in the Prison used in the standard game, but with many more enemies, as she must find 12 data cards and then reach the helicopter evacuation spot. Anna also appears as the final boss in Challenge Mode.\n\nAnna is absent in ''[[Tekken 4]]'', though she is briefly mentioned in Nina's ''Tekken 4'' prologue. She also appears in the non-canon games ''[[Tekken Card Challenge]]'', ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament]]'', ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]'' and ''[[Tekken 3D: Prime Edition]]''.\n\nAnna is playable in ''[[Tekken 7]]'' as part of the Season 2 DLC. After the events of ''[[Tekken 6]]'', Anna's heart grew tired of endless fighting. Following her retirement, she met and fell in love with an elite soldier from the G Corporation. But, on the day of their wedding, tragedy occurred. Whilst getting ready for the big day, the sound of gun shots filled the main hall. Anna rushed to the noise, arriving to find her fianc\u00e9 dead and Nina fleeing the scene. Anna, fueled by rage, decided to return to the fight once more.\n\n====Design and gameplay====\nAnna is sultry and curvy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-warriors-of-tekken-6/ |title=The warriors of Tekken 6 |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref> wearing stylish red outfits. Before the fight, she is seen flirting and teasing the enemy, and then to ridicule meeting ends with a coarse laugh and provocative moves; for her attitude and way of clothing can be considered as a ''[[flapper]]'' as well as a ''[[femme fatale]]'' character. Usually, she is shown wearing a modified silk [[qipao]]/[[cheongsam]] with floral pantyhose along with matching gloves and shoes, often [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]], and she keeps her hair well-coiffed and cut to the neckline. She is also seen a few times wearing a zebra printed jumpsuit with a matching zebra printed hat, a necklace, black gloves, and black heels. She is often among the few characters who are given a third outfit option, as opposed to the standard two, some of them designed by [[Mamoru Nagano]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/it/anime-news/2017/11/05/gothicmade-mecha-figure-showcased-at-anime-screening|title=\"Gothicmade\" Mecha Figure Showcased At Anime Screening|last=Green|first=Scott|website=Crunchyroll|language=it|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> In ''Death by Degrees'', Anna is wearing a more Nina-style high-tech combat outfit and has a different haircut.

She is Nina's sub-boss in the other ''Tekken'' games as well, except for ''Tekken 4'', the only game in the ''Tekken'' series in which she does not appear. In ''Tekken 5'' her sub-boss is [[Lee Chaolan]], and she is also a sub-boss for [[Craig Marduk]]. She is also the final boss of ''Death by Degrees''. In most games she is in, she usually only appears as an unlockable/time-release character, though ''Tekken Tag Tournament'' notably makes her a default character, and ''Tekken 6'' and ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' do away with the time release system entirely, making everyone playable on launch. Anna was added to the ''Tekken 7'' roster in 2018 as part of the Season 2 DLC character pack.\n\nAnna's fighting style is based on [[hapkido]], a martial art that is known for its efficient spinning back kicks, jumping kicks and throws at closer fighting distances. Despite this, she and Nina have both a unique fighting martial art.<ref name=\"UGO\">{{cite web|author=UGO Team |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties-anna-tekken |title=Anna Williams- Hottest Girls in Games |publisher=UGO.com |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229042347/http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties-anna-tekken |archivedate=2011-12-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\n[[File:Tekken cosplay models at E3 2012.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Elle Navarro as Anna Williams at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012]]]]\n\nAnna appears in the anime ''[[Tekken: The Motion Picture]]'' as one of primary antagonists. Her rivalry with Nina is also one of the film's subplots, with a few differences, such as the two vying for the attention of [[Lee Chaolan]], their unfaithful contractor who has hired them both to kill Kazuya, who Heihachi intends to bequeath the Mishima Zaibatsu to. She is the only sister who manages to have sex with Lee, implying that he felt more loyalty to her than Nina. During her confrontation with Nina, it is revealed that Anna murdered their father in cold blood out of resentment for him giving more attention to Nina when they were children. Anna is ultimately ambushed from behind and devoured by a biologically enhanced dinosaur-like being (based loosely on [[Alex (Tekken character)|Alex]]) while Nina escapes after Lee kills himself and Kazuya defeats Heihachi.\n\nIn the live-action film ''[[Tekken (2009 film)|Tekken]]'', portrayed by Marian Zapico as a [[Yakuza]] assassin working alongside Nina. They are also Kazuya's lovers. Kazuya sends them to assassinate Jin Kazama, but the ensuing fight attracts Christie Monteiro's attention and Nina and Anna flee.

Anna also appears in the CGI-animated film ''[[Tekken: Blood Vengeance]]'', in which she works under Kazuya Mishima and forces [[Ling Xiaoyu]] to find Shin Kamiya.\n\nHer manga and comic book appearances include ''Tekken: Tatakai no Kanatani'', ''Tekken Saga'', ''Tekken Forever'', ''Tekken 2'' and ''Tekken: Blood Feud''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/anna-williams/29-59558/ |title=Anna Williams (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date=1964-08-15 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref> In 2000, [[Epoch Co.]] released a 1/6 scale Anna Williams action figure, based her appearance from ''Tekken 3''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/19005_tekken_3_anna_williams_1_6_epoch |title=Databases \u203a Figures \u203a Tekken 3 - Anna Williams - 1/6 (Epoch) |publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref> A small PVC figure was also released by Yujin in the SR Namco Girls Part 5 series in 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/39907_tekken_anna_williams_sr_namco_girls_part_5_yujin |title=Databases \u203a Figures \u203a Tekken - Anna Williams - SR Namco Girls Part 5 (Yujin) |publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref> and another was designed by Shunya Yamashita in 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dreamnews.jp/press/0000103378/|title=\u4eba\u6c17\u683c\u95d8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u9244\u62f3\u300d\u3088\u308a\u30cb\u30fc\u30ca\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u59b9\u300c\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u300d\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30ae\u30e5\u30a2\u3082\u767b\u5834\u300cTEKKEN\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u3000\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30ea\u30a2\u30e0\u30ba\u300d2015\u5e745\u6708\u767a\u58f2|last=|first=|date=|work=dreamnews.jp|access-date=2018-11-21|language=ja}}</ref> A live-action Anna, portrayed by Elle Navarro, also appears in the ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] \"Girl Power\", shown at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9PzZr3zoDQ |title=TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENT 2 - Behind the scenes of \"Girl Power\" trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-08-02 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character has often been noted for her sex appeal.

Anna is the [[narcissistic]] and arrogant younger sister of the quiet and serious [[Nina Williams]], the personal bodyguard of [[Kazuya Mishima]] and second-in-command at [[G Corporation (Tekken)|G Corporation]]. She is also, although unbeknownst to her, the aunt of boxing competitor [[Steve Fox (Tekken)|Steve Fox]]. She is defined by her rivalry with Nina, a trait that has been around since the original ''Tekken'' game.\n\nAnna originally shared most of her moves with her sister Nina, but has since gained a more idiosyncratic moveset. In the other ''Tekken'' media, including films, Anna usually appears in role of a minor villain. The character was met with positive critical reception.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\nAnna Williams was the daughter of an Irish father and American mother and was raised in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] together with her elder sister [[Nina Williams|Nina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5495441/kiss-me-im-an-irish-video-game-character/ |title=Kiss Me, I\u2019m An Irish Video Game Character |publisher=Kotaku.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}</ref> She and Nina were taught various martial arts by their father, a former assassin Richard Williams since young age. Anna was also personally trained by her mother. When Richard died under mysterious circumstances the sisters blamed each other, leading to a long-standing rivalry between them. After this, both sisters went their separate ways with Nina using her skills to become an assassin, and Anna joining the paramilitary and becoming an officer in the Tekken Force.\n\nAnna plays only a very minor role in the story of the [[Tekken (video game)|first game]], appearing as a [[sub-boss]] character for Nina. Her story was further expanded in later games. In ''[[Tekken 2]]'', as in the first tournament, the 20-year-old Nina was once again hired to assassinate the sponsor of the current tournament, [[Kazuya Mishima]]. Whether at Kazuya's discretion or Anna's own volition, Anna became a bodyguard for Kazuya, along with [[Ganryu (Tekken)|Ganryu]] and [[List of Tekken characters#Bruce Irvin|Bruce Irvin]], who were all charged with Kazuya's protection. Nina was later captured by Mishima Zaibatsu forces and used in [[Dr. Bosconovitch]]'s [[cryonics]] research. Learning about this, Anna volunteered to be another test subject, requesting that she be woken in the future at the same time as Nina. Her reason for doing this is unknown, but the two most reasonable explanations would be because she didn't want to feel lonely without Nina, and she didn't want her sister's age preserved in a cryonic sleep while she herself continues to age.\n\nIn ''[[Tekken 3]]'', after being placed in suspended animation during the second tournament, Nina was awoken 19 years later by the influence of the recently excavated [[Ogre (Tekken)|Ogre]], who compelled her to assassinate [[Jin Kazama]]. As per her request, Anna was awoken at the same time as her sister, though she was unaffected by Ogre's influence. Nina also began to suffer ill effects from the 'cold-sleep', resulting in long term memory loss. In an act of compassion, Anna set out to stop Nina from once again becoming an assassin, and to help her recover her memory loss. However, she failed at the end of the tournament when Nina recovered her memory about her rivalry with Anna, which resulted in Nina leaving and cutting all contact with Anna.\n\nIn ''[[Tekken 5]]'', Nina decides to make contact with Anna in hopes of restoring her memory, but their meeting triggers Nina's lost feelings of hostility towards her sister, and she immediately opens fire. Anna retaliates, and the reunion descends into a gunfight which lasts for days. The sisters eventually reach a stalemate and agree to settle things for good and a portion of their battle can be seen in the introductory sequence of the game. During their battle in the tournament, both sisters agreed that only one would walk away from their battle alive. However, when Nina defeats Anna, she refuses to take Anna's life as she felt the fight was not satisfactory.\n\nHumiliated by her loss, Anna seeks revenge at Nina, who has already gone into hiding. Anna hears rumors she has become Jin's new bodyguard, thus being involved with the Mishima Zaibatsu. In another attempt to have a chance to battle Nina, she offers herself as a personal bodyguard to the CEO of G Corporation, Kazuya Mishima, knowing that his plan to confront Jin would eventually lead her to her sister. She enters ''[[Tekken 6|The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6]]'' at Kazuya's request. In Scenario Campaign, Anna leads the defense of G Corporation against Mishima Zaibatsu and [[Lars Alexandersson]]'s rebel army, and during a confrontation with the rebel army, she sends troops that results in Lars' friend, Tougou's death. She also accompanies Kazuya when he comes to Azazel's Temple in the desert. Upon the latter's stalemate battle with Lars, Anna escapes with Kazuya after he is let go by Lars.\n\nAnna appears in Nina's own spin-off action game ''[[Death by Degrees]]'' as a commander of the Tekken Force. Like in the ''Tekken'' games, Anna fights using her fists and her feet, appearing in several encounters. After Nina wins the game's final [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight against her, Anna almost falls into the water below but Nina grabs her hand, and then she reminisces about when her father Richard Williams was killed with gunfire and Anna comforted her afterwards. Another explosion almost sends them both into the water, but Anna jumps rescues Nina in turn. Once the game is completed, Anna becomes a [[player character]] in her own scenario, titled \"Anna Mode\", which is more difficult than the standard game as there are limited recovery items and weapons and no save locations in the first play through, and Anna can use melee weapons but no guns. The Anna Mode takes place in the Prison used in the standard game, but with many more enemies, as she must find 12 data cards and then reach the helicopter evacuation spot. Anna also appears as the final boss in Challenge Mode.\n\nAnna is absent in ''[[Tekken 4]]'', though she is briefly mentioned in Nina's ''Tekken 4'' prologue. She also appears in the non-canon games ''[[Tekken Card Challenge]]'', ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament]]'', ''[[Tekken Tag Tournament 2]]'' and ''[[Tekken 3D: Prime Edition]]''.\n\nAnna is playable in ''[[Tekken 7]]'' as part of the Season 2 DLC. After the events of ''[[Tekken 6]]'', Anna\u2019s heart grew tired of endless fighting. Following her retirement, she met and fell in love with an elite soldier from the G Corporation. But, on the day of their wedding, tragedy occurred. Whilst getting ready for the big day, the sound of gun shots filled the main hall. Anna rushed to the noise, arriving to find her fianc\u00e9 dead and Nina fleeing the scene. Anna, fueled by rage, decided to return to the fight once more.\n\n====Design and gameplay====\nAnna is sultry and curvy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/the-warriors-of-tekken-6/ |title=The warriors of Tekken 6 |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2011-12-23}}</ref> wearing stylish red outfits. Before the fight, she is seen flirting and teasing the enemy, and then to ridicule meeting ends with a coarse laugh and provocative moves; for her attitude and way of clothing can be considered as a ''[[flapper]]'' as well as a ''[[femme fatale]]'' character. Usually, she is shown wearing a modified silk [[qipao]]/[[cheongsam]] with floral pantyhose along with matching gloves and shoes, often [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]], and she keeps her hair well-coiffed and cut to the neckline. She is also seen a few times wearing a zebra printed jumpsuit with a matching zebra printed hat, a necklace, black gloves, and black heels. She is often among the few characters who are given a third outfit option, as opposed to the standard two, some of them designed by [[Mamoru Nagano]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/it/anime-news/2017/11/05/gothicmade-mecha-figure-showcased-at-anime-screening|title=\"Gothicmade\" Mecha Figure Showcased At Anime Screening|last=Green|first=Scott|website=Crunchyroll|language=it|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref> In ''Death by Degrees'', Anna is wearing a more Nina-style high-tech combat outfit and has a different haircut.

She is Nina's sub-boss in the other ''Tekken'' games as well, except for ''Tekken 4'', the only game in the ''Tekken'' series in which she does not appear. In ''Tekken 5'' her sub-boss is [[Lee Chaolan]], and she is also a sub-boss for [[Craig Marduk]]. She is also the final boss of ''Death by Degrees''. In most games she is in, she usually only appears as an unlockable/time-release character, though ''Tekken Tag Tournament'' notably makes her a default character, and ''Tekken 6'' and ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' do away with the time release system entirely, making everyone playable on launch. Anna was added to the ''Tekken 7'' roster in 2018 as part of the Season 2 DLC character pack.\n\nAnna's fighting style is based on [[hapkido]], a martial art that is known for its efficient spinning back kicks, jumping kicks and throws at closer fighting distances. Despite this, she and Nina have both a unique fighting martial art.<ref name=\"UGO\">{{cite web|author=UGO Team |url=http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties-anna-tekken |title=Anna Williams- Hottest Girls in Games |publisher=UGO.com |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2011-12-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111229042347/http://www.ugo.com/games/video-game-hotties-anna-tekken |archivedate=2011-12-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Other appearances===\n[[File:Tekken cosplay models at E3 2012.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Elle Navarro as Anna Williams at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012]]]]\n\nAnna appears in the anime ''[[Tekken: The Motion Picture]]'' as one of primary antagonists. Her rivalry with Nina is also one of the film's subplots, with a few differences, such as the two vying for the attention of [[Lee Chaolan]], their unfaithful contractor who has hired them both to kill Kazuya, who Heihachi intends to bequeath the Mishima Zaibatsu to. She is the only sister who manages to have sex with Lee, implying that he felt more loyalty to her than Nina. During her confrontation with Nina, it is revealed that Anna murdered their father in cold blood out of resentment for him giving more attention to Nina when they were children. Anna is ultimately ambushed from behind and devoured by a biologically enhanced dinosaur-like being (based loosely on [[Alex (Tekken character)|Alex]]) while Nina escapes after Lee kills himself and Kazuya defeats Heihachi.\n\nIn the live-action film ''[[Tekken (2009 film)|Tekken]]'', portrayed by Marian Zapico as a [[Yakuza]] assassin working alongside Nina. They are also Kazuya's lovers. Kazuya sends them to assassinate Jin Kazama, but the ensuing fight attracts Christie Monteiro's attention and Nina and Anna flee. Unlike the games, she and Nina are in good terms and has no relation to Steve Fox. Anna also appears in the CGI-animated film ''[[Tekken: Blood Vengeance]]'', in which she works under Kazuya Mishima and forces [[Ling Xiaoyu]] to find Shin Kamiya.\n\nHer manga and comic book appearances include ''Tekken: Tatakai no Kanatani'', ''Tekken Saga'', ''Tekken Forever'', ''Tekken 2'' and ''Tekken: Blood Feud''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/anna-williams/29-59558/ |title=Anna Williams (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date=1964-08-15 |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref> In 2000, [[Epoch Co.]] released a 1/6 scale Anna Williams action figure, based her appearance from ''Tekken 3''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/19005_tekken_3_anna_williams_1_6_epoch |title=Databases \u203a Figures \u203a Tekken 3 - Anna Williams - 1/6 (Epoch) |publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref> A small PVC figure was also released by Yujin in the SR Namco Girls Part 5 series in 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myfigurecollection.net/item/39907_tekken_anna_williams_sr_namco_girls_part_5_yujin |title=Databases \u203a Figures \u203a Tekken - Anna Williams - SR Namco Girls Part 5 (Yujin) |publisher=MyFigureCollection.net |date= |accessdate=2013-08-04}}</ref> and another was designed by Shunya Yamashita in 2015.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dreamnews.jp/press/0000103378/|title=\u4eba\u6c17\u683c\u95d8\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u300c\u9244\u62f3\u300d\u3088\u308a\u30cb\u30fc\u30ca\u306b\u7d9a\u304d\u59b9\u300c\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u300d\u306e\u30d5\u30a3\u30ae\u30e5\u30a2\u3082\u767b\u5834\u300cTEKKEN\u7f8e\u5c11\u5973\u3000\u30a2\u30f3\u30ca\u30fb\u30a6\u30a3\u30ea\u30a2\u30e0\u30ba\u300d2015\u5e745\u6708\u767a\u58f2|last=|first=|date=|work=dreamnews.jp|access-date=2018-11-21|language=ja}}</ref> A live-action Anna, portrayed by Elle Navarro, also appears in the ''Tekken Tag Tournament 2'' [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] \"Girl Power\", shown at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|Comic-Con]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9PzZr3zoDQ |title=TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENT 2 - Behind the scenes of \"Girl Power\" trailer |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-08-02 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe character has often been noted for her sex appeal.

The following is the verse quoted in this context:-'''Where the grass is green and abundant,Where the grass appears beautiful In that blissful site let our sheep Thrive, and afford us good pasture,And such lands, and give us the strength in battles.20'''.  The above references provide evidences that there was a community of [[shepherds]] among the Aryans.

They lived in Brindavan, rearing animals and eking their livelihood by selling dairy products.

It is also stated that they lived in Repalle village at the beginning of [[Kali Yuga|Kali Yug]]. During the reign of Rajaraja Narendra, it was said that they immigrated to southern regions from Repalle. It is because of the above inferences, the Gollas consider themselves to belong to the Yadava clan or Golla kings. The very term Golla kings asserts their kinship with [[Krishna|Sri Krishna]], besides asserting them to be of a higher stratum of the society.

The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers.

It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.

The said village Kalialli with its income amounting to 130 varahas and two hanas is granted for the three services, in the afternoon, of the god Kirtinarayana\nand the gift is made in the Pampa-kshetra which is the same as [[Vijayanagara|Vijayanagari]], on the banks of the Tungabhadra, and in the presence of the God Virhpaksha-linga on the above occasion, as a holy gift (Krishnarpana) with pouring of water and gold; and the village is made over, together with the procession images of the gods and goddesses at Vijayanagari and their ornaments, into the treasury of the god Kirtina-rayana, in order that the gift might last as long as the moon and sun endure. The gift of the village was made at the request of Upavasi Achariya of Bharadvaja gotra, Yajussakhe, and Apastamba-sutra, for the merit of Krishnaraya and Saluva Timma.Between making a gift and maintaining one already made, maintenance is better than gift. By a gift one obtains heaven and by protecting a gift one goes to a region from which there is no fall. Maintaining a gift made by others is twice as meritorious as making a gift oneself. By confiscating another\u2019s gift, one\u2019s own gift becomes fruitless. \u201cThis bridge of dharma is common to all kings and should be protected by you from time to time.\u201d Thus does Ramachandra beseech again and again all future rulers. He who seizes land gifted by himsolf or by others is borm as a worm in ordure for 60,000 years. Whoever destroys this gift will incur the sin of killing tawny cows on the banks of the [[Ganges]].<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.501532|title=Annual Report Of The Mysore Archaeological Department, For The Year 1930|first=M.H.|last=Krishna|date=1934|language=english}}</ref>\n\n'''Note'''\n\nThis is a record registering the grant of a village called Kavahalli or Kalihalli (same as the present village Kahalli) for services in the Kirtinarayana temple at Talakad on the Kaveri river in T.-Narsipur Taluk, Mysore District. It belongs to the reign of the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] king Krishnaraya and is dated S' 1434 Srimukha sam.\nPhal. ba. 5. This date corresponds to March 15, A. D. 1514, if we take S' 1434\nexpired or S' 1435 current Srimukha as the year intended. There are some peculiar features in the historical portion of this record. The king Krishnaraya is here styled Krishnavarma-mahadhiraja (L.8) as is aged the\ncase in two other inscriptions of the same Taluk (E. C. III. Nanjangud 190 and 195 of 1512 and 1513 A. D.). He is given some titles of the Western Gangas and [[Hoysala Empire|Hoysalas]]. (Jitam bhagavata gata-ghana-gaganabhena L.3, : Yadava-kulambara-dyumani samyaktva-chudamani). Another point to notice in this record is the mention of the king\u2019s visit to the southern part of his empire on a conquering expedition. Saluva Timmarasa and his brother Saluva Govindaraja were ministers of Krishnaraja and Govindaraja was entrusted with the government of Terakanambi kingdom (see E. C. IV [[Gundlupet]] 3 of S 1435 and 1 of S 1444, etc.,) and\nhis grants are frequently met with in the [[Nanjangud]], Chamarajanagar and\nGundlupet Taluks. (E. C. Ill Nanjangud 196 of S\u2019 1435; T.-Narsipur 42 of S\u2019 1445 ; T.-Narsipur 73 of S\u2019 1441 : E. C. IV Gundlup6t 1, 3, 35 ; [[Chamarajanagar]] 99 of S 1445, 111 etc.) In some of these records their gotra is given as Kaundinya\nand not as Khandava. The temple of Kirtinarayana at Talakad- is a Hoysala structure and is believed to have been constructed by king Vishnuvardhana (see M. A. R. 1912, p.&nbsp;11). Not only are the revenues of the village stated to have been granted for services in the temple but also the utsava-images of the god and goddesses with ornaments either newly prepared or bolonging to some other temple are said to have been sent from Vijayanagar, the capital. Lastly the grant is stated to have been made at\nthe instance of a [[Brahman]] named Upavasi- Achariya. The usual imprecatory stanzas are found at the end of the grant.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n* In The Book \"Sculptural Art of Hampi\" Published by Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore says as Below:-\n{{cquote| The Tuluvas claimed their descent from the Yadava Lineage.The earliest known member of this family is Isvaranayaka.|||Directorate of Archaeology and Museum, Mysore  '''<ref>{{Cite book| title=Sculptural Art of Hampi | volume=|first=K.M| last=Suresh| year=1998| page=21 | publisher=  Directorate of Archaeology and Museum,Mysore| url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=r7xmluMu-FsC&dq=tuluva+yadava&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=yadava }}</ref>}}\n\n==Formation of the Balija==\n*During the time of The Vijayanagara king [[Krishnadevaraya]], formed the business division called [[Balija]] by mobilizing '''Gollas''', [[Gavara]]s and many others under the title of 'Balija':<ref>{{cite book |last1=N\u0101r\u0101ya\u1e47ar\u0101vu |first1=V\u0113lc\u0113ru |last2=Rao |first2=Velcheru Narayana |last3=Shulman |first3=David Dean |last4=Subrahmanyam |first4=Sanjay |title=Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu |date=1992 |publisher=Oxford University Press |hdl=2027/heb.02449 |oclc=758445206 }}{{page needed|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Subrahmanyam1992\">{{cite book|author=Velcheru Narayana Rao|author2==David Dean Shulman |author3=Sanjay Subrahmanyam|title= Symbols of substance: court and state in N\u0101yaka Period Tamilnadu|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1992|isbn=0-19-563021-1|page=74|quote=''These left-[[Shudra|Sudra]] groups \u2014 often referred to by the cover-title 'Balija', but also including [[Boyar caste|Boyas]], left-hand Gollas, [[Gavara]]s, and others - were first mobilized by [[Krishnadevaraya]] in the Vijayanagara heyday...These Balija fighters are not afraid of kings: some stories speak of their killing kings who interfered with their affairs\"}}</ref>\n* The Government Official Record \" Madras District Gazetteers\" by Honourable F.J.Richards (Indian Civil Services) says as below :-\n {{cquote| Balijas are reported to be mere occupational terms which do not indicate true Sub-castes.The Golla Balijas are probably '''Gollas''' (q.v.)who called themselves Naidus; the Kamma Balijas are perhaps to be identified with the [[Kamma (caste)|Kammas]] (q.v. p.166), and Linga Balija or Sivachar Kavarai appears to be the popular term for Kanarese [[Lingayats]].|||F.J.Richards <ref>{{citation |last= Richards |first= F.J. |title=MADRAS DISTRICT GAZETTEERS|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281734/page/n191/mode/2up|year=1918 |publisher=GOVERNMENT PRESS|page=179}}</ref>}}\n\n==Establishment of Madurai Nayak Dynasty==\n[[File:Tnayak-edited.JPG|thumb|150px|Thirumala Nayakkar Statue in [[Madurai Meenakshi Temple]]]]\n\n[[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Mahamandaleshwara Nagama nayak]] the successful Commander-in-chief of Sri Krishnadevaraya's court and also the leader of Gollas, wanted to establish a new empire for the Gollas due domination by other castes in the Later [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar Empire]] as chiefs and ministers. So, Nagama Nayak waited for the moment to start his riot to claim a separate Kingdom for Gollas. In [[Madurai]] (Pandya Nadu) at the time [[Chola dynasty|Chola King Veerasekhara Chola]] invades the Madurai Kingdom and deposed the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya King Chandrasekhara Pandyan]], who was under the protection of Sri [[Krishnadevaraya]]. Due to this, an enraged Sri Krishnadevaraya sends Nagama Nayak to aid Chandrasekhara Pandyan. Nagama Nayak suppresses Veerasekhara Chola and takes Madurai, but then he used a situation to found empire for Golla. So, he threw off his allegiance and declining to help Chandrasekhara Pandyan, usurped the throne.\n\nSo, [[Viswanatha Nayak]] volunteers to face his father on the battle ground. Nagama Nayak is defeated and the loyalty of Viswanatha Nayak is proved. Chivalry of both father and son is admired by Sri Krishnadevaraya, who makes Viswanatha Nayak the Governor of Madurai and other regions.\nDue to this cause the [[Madurai Nayak dynasty|Madurai Nayak Empire]] founder in 1529 AD. Then Viswanatha Nayak became the first king of the empire  then, he divided Madurai regions in to 72 palayams (Zamins) and nearly 52 of the palayams were left under the control of Golla Rajakambalam by nominating them as [[Polygar|Poligars]] of the palayams and also Viswanatha Nayak designed his kingdom's flag with a symbol of '''poli avu (Poli Rishaba)''' means holy cow of Gollas in it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aiyar|first=R.
