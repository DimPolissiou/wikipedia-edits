The first two CSX lines being [[Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad|P&A Subdivision]], a line formerly owned by the [[Louisville and Nashville Railroad]], and the other is the Tallahassee Subdivision, a former [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] line. These two lines meet in [[Chattahoochee, Florida|Chatahoochee]] and served [[Amtrak]]'s [[Sunset Limited]] until it was truncated to [[New Orleans]] in 2005 by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. A third line is the [[Apalachicola Northern Railroad]], a line that spans as far south as [[Port Saint Joe, Florida|Port St. Joe]]. The line enters from Liberty County, then crosses SR 12 in Greensboro, runs under I-10, follows CR 268 in Hardaway, and then turns west into Chatahoochee. The fourth line is the third CSX Line, the Bainbridge Subdivision, which runs along the west side of US 27 from Leon County by way of a bridge over the [[Ochlockonee River]] to the Georgia State Line. While some spurs still exist, other lines within the county were abandoned.\n\n===Public Transportation===\nPublic Transportation is provided by [[Big Bend Transit]], which operates 3 bus routes in

The line enters from Liberty County, then crosses SR 12 in Greensboro, runs under I-10, follows CR 268 in Hardaway, and then turns west into Chatahoochee. The fourth line is the third CSX Line, the Bainbridge Subdivision, which runs along the west side of US 27 from Leon County by way of a bridge over the [[Ochlockonee River]] to the Georgia State Line.

Jackson had been involved in a shoot-out at [[Round Rock, Texas]] between the Bass gang and the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] in July, 1878. Jackson was shot in one leg, but survived.

Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery==\n[[File:Willcox-Building-John H.

Norton and Company Store]][[File:Cochise-Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot-1903.jpg|200px|thumb|The Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019]]\nConstable [[Burt Alvord]] was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in [[Tombstone, Arizona|Tombstone]]. Alvord hired Bill Downing and [[Billy Stiles]] as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThey conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at [[Cochise, Arizona|Cochise Junction]]. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse.<ref name=\"BSG\"/><ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They  held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up.

The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind.

At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and went to the the jailhouse. He shot [[United States Marshals Service|Deputy Marshal]] George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A.

The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the [[sally port]] which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A.

The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nMrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a.

Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some of his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as to reach for his gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nArizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: \u201cThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.\u201d Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\"/>\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the shot was fired by Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Arizoniana: Stories from Old Arizona\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: Primer Pub; {{ISBN|188559089X}}; {{ISBN|978-1885590893}}\n*\"Arizona Outlaws and Lawmen: Gunslingers, Bandits, Heroes and Peacekeepers\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: The History Press; ASIN: B00XZPQM2W\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Biography}}\n*[[List of historic properties in Willcox, Arizona]]\n===Arizona pioneers===\n*[[Henry Garfias]]\n*[[Joe Mayer]]\n*[[William John Murphy]]\n*[[Levi Ruggles]]\n*[[Trinidad Swilling]]\n*[[Ora Rush Weed]]\n*[[Henry Wickenburg]]\n*[[Sedona Schnebly]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Wild West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Downing, Bill}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lawmen of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n[[Category:Gunslingers of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona pioneers]]\n[[Category:Outlaws of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:American outlaws]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox person\n| name                      = Bill Downing \n| image                     = Bill Downing.jpg\n| image_size                = 200px\n| caption                   =  William \"Bill\" Downing\n| birth_name                = Allegedly: Frank Jackson\n| birth_date                = 1860\n| birth_place               = [[Texas]]\n| death_date                =August 5, 1908\n| death_place               = [[Willcox, Arizona]]\n| resting_place             = Old City Cemetery in Willcox, Az\n| nationality               = American\n| other_names               = William F.

Downing worked as a cowhand at the nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, a ranch which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==The killing of  William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor==\n[[File:Pearce-Ranch House-1896.jpg|200px|thumb|Ranch house in Pearce]][[File:Burt Alvord Arizona.jpg|200px|thumb|Constable Burt Alvord]]\nDowning and his wife moved to the town of [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]]. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. \u201cBurt\u201d Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nTraynor, who also went by the name of \"Bill Traynor\", was a native of [[Tennessee]] who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran [[Rough Rider]] campaigning in [[Cuba]] with [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nOn the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \"Elite Saloon\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nWitnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.\u201d<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nConstable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull.

Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets.<ref name=\"AA\"/> Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter \u201cBilly\u201d Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. \u201cSlim\u201d Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the  \u201cdrunk and unruly\u201d saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \"Free and Easy\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nThe following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nDowning thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as to reach for gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\nArizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: \u201cThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.\u201d Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/><ref name=\"OCC\"/>\n\nThe coroner's jury found that the shot was fired by Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.<ref name=\"BD\"/><ref name=\"OL\"/><ref name=\"DEL\"/><ref name=\"BAG\"/>\n\n==Further reading==\n*\"Arizoniana: Stories from Old Arizona\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: Primer Pub; {{ISBN|188559089X}}; {{ISBN|978-1885590893}}\n*\"Arizona Outlaws and Lawmen: Gunslingers, Bandits, Heroes and Peacekeepers\"; by: Marshall Trimble; Publisher: The History Press; ASIN: B00XZPQM2W\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Biography}}\n*[[List of historic properties in Willcox, Arizona]]\n===Arizona pioneers===\n*[[Henry Garfias]]\n*[[Joe Mayer]]\n*[[William John Murphy]]\n*[[Levi Ruggles]]\n*[[Trinidad Swilling]]\n*[[Ora Rush Weed]]\n*[[Henry Wickenburg]]\n*[[Sedona Schnebly]]\n\n{{Clear}}\n{{Wild West}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Downing, Bill}}\n[[Category:1860 births]]\n[[Category:1908 deaths]]\n[[Category:Lawmen of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona folklore]]\n[[Category:Gunslingers of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Arizona pioneers]]\n[[Category:Outlaws of the American Old West]]\n[[Category:Cowboys]]\n[[Category:American outlaws]]\n[[Category:People of the American Old West]]\n", "name_user": "Marine 69-71", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDowning's last stand", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Downing"}

A home version for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], simply titled '''''Astyanax''''', was released a year after the arcade version.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Arcade version===\n[[File:The Astyanax.png|thumb|left|Screenshot of the arcade version]]\n\nThe arcade version of ''Astyanax'' is set in a fantasy world populated by mythical creatures from [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|Arab]] mythology. The game consists of six stages: a [[forest]], a [[cave]], a [[lake]], a lift, a [[castle]] and the final battle. Up to two players can play simultaneously with continues allowed at any moment. The first player controls Roche (a blond-haired warrior in blue [[body armor|armor]]), while the second player controls an unnamed [[palette swap]] of Roche in red armor with black hair. The controls consist of an eight-way [[joystick]] and three buttons for attacking, jumping or using a thunder attack that covers the whole screen. The player has four health points per life.\n\nThe player's main weapon is his [[axe]], with a power gauge that fills automatically when the player is not swinging it. When the gauge is filled, the player's axe will be lit on [[fire]], allowing for a stronger attack. This allows the player a choice between faster weak swings or a slow strong one.\n\nThe player can obtain power-ups by destroying stone pillars such as [[crystal]]s for points or red [[gemstone|jewels]] for additional health. There's also a blue [[arrowhead]] that increases the strength of the player's thunder attack by up to four levels (the player must have at least one arrowhead in stock to perform a thunder attack) and a shield that allows the player to block enemy attacks until it breaks.\n\n===NES===\nUnlike the arcade version, the NES version can only be played by one player. Like in the arcade version, the player has a life gauge, a strength gauge that fills automatically when he is not attacking and a magic gauge for his spells. Also unlike the arcade version, the player can wield other weapons besides the default axe, as well as use different [[spell (paranormal)|magic spells]], which are selected by pausing the game.\n\nBy picking up a power-up, Astyanax's weapon, the Bash, changes shape from its default axe form into a [[spear]], which can be upgraded again into a [[sword]]. The spear has the weakest attack strength, but allows Astyanax to use his magic spells more often by consuming less magic points, while the sword can deal the most damage to enemies, but consumes the most magic points when casting a spell. The player will revert to his previous weapon after losing a life.\n\nThe player's magic spells consist of a binding spell that temporarily freezes all enemies for a few seconds, a fire blast spell that damages all enemies within range and a thunderbolt spell that damages every enemy on-screen. Each spell consumes a different amount of magic points, with the binding spell consuming the least points, while the thunderbolt consumes the most.\n\nOther power-ups include a power supply that extends the length of Astyanax's power gauge (allowing for stronger axe swings), a wing that increases the refill speed of Astyanax's power gauge, potions that restore the player's health and magic and extra lives. Astyanax can also encounter Cutie throughout certain stages, who will offer to either change Astyanax's weapon or refill his magic points.\n\n==Plot==\n===Arcade===\nA long time ago, an ugly battle was being waged every day as the world was ruled by [[demon]]s.

Armed with the legendary axe Bash, Astyanax sets out on a journey to Blackhorn's lair with Cutie in order to rescue Rosebud. In Blackhorn's castle they fall into a trap and Cutie sacrifices her life to allow Astyanax to fight onward alone. He eventually destroys Blackhorn, and is transported back to Earth by Rosebud.

{"title_page": "Flying Gang", "text_new": "[[File:Edward Teach Commonly Call'd Black Beard (bw).jpg|thumb]]\n\nThe '''Flying Gang''' were an 18th-century group of [[pirates]] who established themselves in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], New Providence in [[The Bahamas]] after the destruction of [[Port Royal]] in [[Jamaica]]. The gang consisted of the most notorious and cunning pirates of the time, buccaneers that would terrorise and pillage the Caribbean until the Royal Navy and infighting brought them to justice. They achieved great fame and wealth by raiding salvagers attempting to recover gold from the sunken [[1715_Treasure_Fleet|Spanish treasure fleet]]. They established their own codes and governed themselves independent from any of the colonial powers of the time. Nassau was deemed the [[Republic of Pirates]] as it attracted many former [[Privateer]]s looking for work to its shores. The [[Governor of Bermuda]] stated that there were over 1000 pirates in Nassau at that time and that they outnumbered the mere hundred of inhabitants in the town.<ref>http://www.goldenageofpiracy.org/infamous-pirates/flying-gang.php</ref>\n\n==Benjamin Hornigold==\n[[Benjamin Hornigold]] turned to piracy in the aftermath of the [[War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War of the Spanish Succession]], seeing great opportunity in the [[The_Bahamas|Bahamas]] to intercept Spanish and French shipping; an appealing idea to earn his way after the [[Royal_Navy|Royal Navy]] was financially drained and the Admirality mothballed its fleet, releasing over half of its labour force. Hornigold's career in piracy began with dividing his men into three different parties to raid Spanish plantations spotted along the [[Caribbean]] coast, to further launch a year-long reign of terror over the [[Caribbean|Caribbean ]], capturing an estimated 60,000 pounds. In November of 1715, Hornigold seized the English ship Mary, a [[Sloop]] with capacity for 140 men and six guns, and in this, he sailed into Nassau harbour along with a captured Spanish vessel. He then proclaimed that every pirate in the area would fall under his protection. Hornigold called this group of ruffians the Flying Gang and took over Nassau, making it a pirate haven. Hornigold remained reluctant to attack English ships, though he would encourage his allies, such as [[Samuel_Bellamy|Samuel Bellamy]], to do so. Hornigold's patriotism was infuriating for his crew members and they mutinied and cast Hornigold aside as captain. When in September of 1717 [[George_I_of_Great_Britain|King George I]] issued a proclamation granting royal pardon for all piracies committed, Hornigold, who regularly regarded himself as more a privateer than a pirate, saw an opportunity to invest his booty into legal trade. In 1719, Hornigold resumed full-time work as a privateer under the operations of [[Woodes_Rogers|Woodes Rogers]], Governor of Jamaica. Hornigold spent the remainder of his life hunting his old prodigies and other famous buccaneers. \n\n==Henry Jennings==\nThe Flying Gang's co-founder, [[Henry Jennings]], started his infamous pirating career after the [[War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War of Spanish Succession]] and his fearsome reputation developed after one venturous raid in July, 1715. A hurricane sunk a Spanish Treasure Fleet just out of Florida and [[Philip_V_of_Spain|King Philip V of Spain]] declared the treasure to be rightful property of Spain. Spanish crews were immediately dispatched to salvage the wreck. Jennings outnumbered the Spanish, who had built a fort at St Augustine to protect the treasure, and Jennings took the treasure for his own. Jennings mentored other well-known pirates such as [[Charles_Vane|Charles Vane]] and [[Calico_Jack|Jack 'Calico' Rackham]]. Jennings was also known for a botched attack on a French merchant vessel, causing great diplomatic unrest. Driven by greed, Jennings friend, [[Samuel_Bellamy|Sam Bellamy]], double-crossed Jennings, leading Jennings to brutally kill a group of captured British and French prisoners in retaliation. When Jennings returned to Jamaica following his latest raid, he found himself officially declared a pirate by [[George_I_of_Great_Britain|King George I]]. Forced to flee, he headed for [[The_Bahamas|The Bahamas]], setting up a new life in the New Providence. He became the unofficial governor of Nassau and received a formal pardon from Governor of Bahamas, [[Woodes_Rogers|Woodes Rogers]]. Henry Jennings was an unusual pirate because he lived to enjoy old age.\n\n==Edward Teach==\nEdward Teach, more famously known as [[Blackbeard]], may be the most legendary and terrifying pirate from the [[Golden_Age_of_Piracy|Golden Age of Piracy]]. Teach met and joined the crew of [[Benjamin_Hornigold|Benjamin Hornigold]] in the [[New_Providence|New Providence]] after Teach had concluded his time as a privateer in the [[War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War of Spanish Succession]]. The two became a dynamic duo, successfully raiding ships and pirating throughout the [[West_Indies|West Indies]]. When Hornigold retired in 1717 and gave his head title to Teach, [[Stede_Bonnet|Stede Bonnet]] joined Teach's crew. November of 1717, Teach attacked a French merchant vessel La Concorde off the coast of Saint Vincent. He took the ship for his own and renamed it Queen Anne's Revenge and equipping it with 40 guns. Teach flew a flag showing a skeleton spearing a heart, an image that became quickly well-known and feared on the high seas. Teach would wear three pistols across his chest and put lit matches under his hat to create a terrifying mist, creating a notorious and fearsome look about him. There are no verified accounts of Teach murdering or harming his captives, despite his reputation. In June of 1718, Teach ventured to the Governor of Virginia for a pardon after having stripped the Revenge of its provisions and marooned its crew. He settled in Bath with a wife and found work as a privateer in 1718. While on an expedition, Teach encountered [[Charles_Vane|Charles Vane]] and a group of other infamous individuals such as [[Calico_Jack|Calico Jack]], [[Robert_Deal_(pirate)|Robert Deal]] and [[Israel_Hands|Israel Hands]]. They spent several drunken nights loitering together until [[Robert_Maynard|Lieutenant Robert Maynard]] was ordered to capture Teach. This led to a bloody battle upon Maynard's ship and Teach was eventually killed after 20 stab wounds and at least 5 bullet holes. His head was later hung from the bow of Maynard's ship. \nThere are tales told of Teach's ghost. One of the most common ones being that unknown lights that are out at sea are called 'Teach's light' and that he roams the afterlife searching for his severed head.\n\n==Charles Vane==\n[[Charles Vane]] was a pirate renowned for his sadistic and cruel ways. He would ignore the [[Pirate_code|Pirate Code]] and showed little respect for his fellow crew members, despite his wittiness and skilfulness when it came to being a sailor. He was unmerciful towards any prisoner, turning to torture and murder when given the opportunity. Yet, Vane was admired for his great navigating and fighting skills. He made his first appearance in piracy history when he became a sailor of [[Henry_Jennings|Captain Henry Jennings]] crew. After Jennings crew raided Spanish camps that had salvaged sunken treasure from a Spanish Treasure Fleet in 1715, Vane used his share to outfit his own ship, renaming it Ranger. For two years, Vane used [[Nassau,_Bahamas|Nassau]] as a base for plundering merchant ships, along with many other notorious pirates collectively known as the Flying Gang. Vane declined a pardon from the Governor of The Bahamas, [[Woodes_Rogers|Woodes Rogers]] and was later pursued by [[Benjamin_Hornigold|Benjamin Hornigold]], who was under Rogers employ. Vane escaped to the Carolinas and on one occasion, conducted a blockade of Charleston Port. It is said that Vane's piracy almost stopped the slave trade at one point because of so few ships entering port. Vane later faced mutiny by his crew members whereby they never appealed to the captain's wicked ways and selfishness. Eventually, Vane was ditched as captain and left on a small ship, and in his place, his quartermaster, [[Calico_Jack|Calico Jack]], was named captain. Vane was imprisoned in [[Port_Royal|Port Royal]] by Captain Holford in 1719. Vane's former accomplices spoke out against him during trial and Vane gave no defence. Vane's piracy career was most successful of any pirate, but it was his ego that eventually cost him his life. Vane was hung on 22 March 1720 and his body hung at Gun Bay as a warning to others who defied the law.\n\n==\u201cCalico Jack\u201d Rackham==\n[[John Rackham]] is most famous for his flag, the [[Jolly Roger]], and that his crew consisted of both men and women. He started his pirate career during the mutiny against Charles Vane after he refused to attack a French ship. When Rackham went to Nassau he met [[Anne Bonny]] and started an affair with her. The two of them went out on the seas and recruited people from the ships they attacked. Rackham was captured after a drunkard battle and he was sent to Port Royal to be hanged.\n\n==Stede Bonnet==\n[[Stede Bonnet]] was a [[plantation owner]] on [[Barbados]] before he became a pirate. He became known as the \"Gentleman Pirate\". He plundered ships on the east coast of America before meeting up with Blackbeard in Nassau. During his battles he was wounded and could not lead, instead he followed Blackbeard and his crew during many successful raids. Bonnet lost almost everything when his crew left him to serve aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge.\n\n==Mary Read==\n[[Mary Read]] started her career in the Royal Navy disguised as a man. She became one of the Pirates in Nassau after her ship was captured by [[buccaneers]]. In 1720 she joined Jack Rackham's crew. It is said that she only revealed that she was a woman to Anne Bonny. When she was captured she said that she was pregnant to avoid hanging. But she became sick and died in prison.\n\n==Sam Bellamy==\nAs it usually was with Pirates, [[Sam Bellamy]] got his nickname \u201cBlack Sam\u201d from how he looked.  He always wore a black coat and did not wear wigs like so many others. After a mutiny to Benjamin Hornigold Bellamy became one of the richest pirates ever. New investigations of his flagship Whydah shows that in 1717 when he died he had over five tons of cargo.\n\n==Olivier \u201cLa Buse\u201d Levasseur==\nLike so many other Pirates, [[Olivier Levasseur]] did not want to stop being a pirate after the end of the [[War of Spanish Succession]]. He was called the Buzzard for his bold attacks and raids. Levasseur had an enormous treasure that is worth an estimated \u00a31 billion. When he was about to be hanged in 1730 he threw away a [[cryptogram]] that he said would lead to his treasure. Many adventurers and treasure hunters have searched for the treasure, but none have found it.\n\n==Paulsgrave Williams==\n[[Paulsgrave Williams]], was Bellamy's companion and with him looted the remains of the Spanish Treasure Fleet in 1715. But when he arrived much of the treasure had already been taken. Williams decided to \u201crelieve\u201d other ships of their treasure instead and started his career as a pirate. Unlike his partner Williams always wore a white wig. Many people commented on the big contrast between his white hair and sunburned skin.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Piracy-stub}}\n\n[[Category:Pirates]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Edward Teach Commonly Call'd Black Beard (bw).jpg|thumb]]\n\nThe '''Flying Gang''' were an 18th-century group of [[pirates]] who established themselves in [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], New Providence in [[The Bahamas]] after the destruction of [[Port Royal]] in [[Jamaica]]. The gang consisted of the most notorious and cunning pirates of the time, buccaneers that would terrorise and pillage the Caribbean until the Royal Navy and infighting brought them to justice. They achieved great fame and wealth by raiding salvagers attempting to recover gold from the sunken [[1715_Treasure_Fleet|Spanish treasure fleet]]. They established their own codes and governed themselves independent from any of the colonial powers of the time. Nassau was deemed the [[Republic of Pirates]] as it attracted many former [[Privateer]]s looking for work to its shores. The [[Governor of Bermuda]] stated that there were over 1000 pirates in Nassau at that time and that they outnumbered the mere hundred of inhabitants in the town.<ref>http://www.goldenageofpiracy.org/infamous-pirates/flying-gang.php</ref>\n\n==Benjamin Hornigold==\n[[Benjamin Hornigold]] turned to piracy in the aftermath of the [[War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War of the Spanish Succession]], seeing great opportunity in the [[The_Bahamas|Bahamas]] to intercept Spanish and French shipping; an appealing idea to earn his way after the [[Royal_Navy|Royal Navy]] was financially drained and the Admirality mothballed its fleet, releasing over half of its labour force. Hornigold's career in piracy began with dividing his men into three different parties to raid Spanish plantations spotted along the [[Caribbean]] coast, to further launch a year-long reign of terror over the [[Caribbean|Caribbean ]], capturing an estimated 60,000 pounds. In November of 1715, Hornigold seized the English ship Mary, a [[Sloop]] with capacity for 140 men and six guns, and in this, he sailed into Nassau harbour along with a captured Spanish vessel. He then proclaimed that every pirate in the area would fall under his protection. Hornigold called this group of ruffians the Flying Gang and took over Nassau, making it a pirate haven. Hornigold remained reluctant to attack English ships, though he would encourage his allies, such as [[Samuel_Bellamy|Samuel Bellamy]], to do so. Hornigold's patriotism was infuriating for his crew members and they mutinied and cast Hornigold aside as captain. When in September of 1717 [[George_I_of_Great_Britain|King George I]] issued a proclamation granting royal pardon for all piracies committed, Hornigold, who regularly regarded himself as more a privateer than a pirate, saw an opportunity to invest his booty into legal trade. In 1719, Hornigold resumed full-time work as a privateer under the operations of [[Woodes_Rogers|Woodes Rogers]], Governor of Jamaica. Hornigold spent the remainder of his life hunting his old prodigies and other famous buccaneers. \n\n==Henry Jennings==\nThe Flying Gang's co-founder, [[Henry Jennings]], started his infamous pirating career after the [[War_of_the_Spanish_Succession|War of Spanish Succession]] and his fearsome reputation developed after one venturous raid in July, 1715. A hurricane sunk a Spanish Treasure Fleet just out of Florida and [[Philip_V_of_Spain|King Philip V of Spain]] declared the treasure to be rightful property of Spain. Spanish crews were immediately dispatched to salvage the wreck. Jennings outnumbered the Spanish, who had built a fort at St Augustine to protect the treasure, and Jennings took the treasure for his own. Jennings mentored other well-known pirates such as [[Charles_Vane|Charles Vane]] and [[Calico_Jack|Jack 'Calico' Rackham]]. Jennings was also known for a botched attack on a French merchant vessel, causing great diplomatic unrest. Driven by greed, Jennings friend, [[Samuel_Bellamy|Sam Bellamy]], double-crossed Jennings, leading Jennings to brutally kill a group of captured British and French prisoners in retaliation. When Jennings returned to Jamaica following his latest raid, he found himself officially declared a pirate by [[George_I_of_Great_Britain|King George I]]. Forced to flee, he headed for [[The_Bahamas|The Bahamas]], setting up a new life in the New Providence. He became the unofficial governor of Nassau and received a formal pardon from Governor of Bahamas, [[Woodes_Rogers|Woodes Rogers]]. Henry Jennings was an unusual pirate because he lived to enjoy old age.\n\n==Edward Teach==\nEdward Teach, more famously known as [[Blackbeard]], may be the most legendary and terrifying pirate from the [[Golden_Age_of_Piracy|Golden Age of Piracy]].

In addition, CIMS provides opportunities and facilities for undergraduate students to do and discuss mathematical research, including an undergraduate math lounge on the 11th floor and an undergraduate computer science lounge on the 3rd floor of Warren Weaver Hall.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |title=Math Lounge |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718174327/http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/MathLounge.html |archive-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.global-derivatives.com/index.php?Itemid=5&id=91&option=com_content&task=view |title=New York University - MSc Mathematics in Finance |publisher=Global-derivatives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n[[File:CIMS Classroom.jpg|thumb|Classroom at Warren Weaver Hall]]\nThe mathematics and computer science undergraduate and graduate programs at the Courant Institute has a strong focus on building quantitative and problem-solving skills through teamwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/ |title=Department of Mathematics, Courant Institute |publisher=Math.nyu.edu |date=2005-09-01 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> An undergraduate computer science course on Computer Vision, for example, requires students to be in small teams to use and apply recently developed algorithms by researchers around the world on their own. One example assignment requires a student to study a paper written by researchers from [[Microsoft Research Cambridge]] in order to do an assignment on Segmentation and Graph Cut. To encourage innovation, students in advanced coursework are allowed to use any means to complete their assignment, such as a programming language of their choice and hacking a [[Kinect]] through legal means.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring11/V22.0480-001/index.html |title=V22.0480-001 |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe Courant Institute's undergraduate program also encourages students to engage in research with professors and graduate students. About 30% of undergraduate students participate in academic research through the competitive [[Research Experiences for Undergraduates]] program funded by the [[National Science Foundation]] or research funded primarily by the Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund. The Courant Institute has one of the highest percentage of undergraduate students doing research within [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |title=NYU > A & S > Dean's Undergraduate Research Fund |publisher=Cas.nyu.edu |accessdate=2011-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629120916/http://cas.nyu.edu/page/ug.DeansResearchFund.html |archive-date=2011-06-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/web/Academic/Undergrad/spotlight.html |title=Undergraduate Student Spotlight - NYU Computer Science Department |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531134706/http://www.quantnet.com/review-nyu-mathematical-finance-program |date=May 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/ |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate Program |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref> With permission of their advisers or faculty, undergraduate students may take graduate-level courses. Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Students may combine the degree with other majors within the College of Arts and Science to create a personalized joint major. Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

Courant undergraduate students through the years and alumni contribute greatly to the vitality of the Mathematics and Computer Science departments. Some accomplishments by current and former undergraduate Courant students include an Apple Worldwide Developers Conference Scholarship Winner, development of Object Category Recognition Techniques to sort garbage for recycling for the NYC's trash program, placement in 7th out of 42 in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC), and inventors of the [[Diaspora (software)]] social network.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Mathematics offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in Mathematics. It consists of a wide variety of courses in pure and applied mathematics taught by a distinguished faculty with a tradition of excellence in teaching and research. Students in advanced coursework often participate in formulating models outside the field of mathematics as well as in analyzing them. For example, an advanced mathematics course in Computers in Medicine and Biology requires a student to construct two computer models selected from the following list: circulation, gas exchange in the lung, control of cell volume, and the renal countercurrent mechanism. The student uses the models to conduct simulated physiological experiments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:vGj-HafADLoJ:math.nyu.edu/degree/undergrad/Math%2520major%2520bulletin%25202010-11%2520Final.pdf+Math+undergraduate+nyu+requirements&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi4x3xv-_X-4B0Xil4BidRNWKCKg9smDHdaXmhcPNv2gRXB173WgH0mNEM6D-RGr6C-oEz4XoRNBZvoWRQ_RWpcHpNzWxe06LDC0hc2wG0Yi5rf6AFY3cYBVAKb3_wZ-EJjvU6I&sig=AHIEtbSCuQUYJiy-dq4Yg8t8z5z6AnV2Ig |title=Powered by Google Docs |publisher=Docs.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\nThe undergraduate division of the Department of Computer Science offers a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree, and fours minors.

Two specific combined degrees are the joint major in computer science/economics and the joint major in computer science/mathematics. The Department of Computer Science also offers a BS/BE Dual Degree in computer science and engineering and an accelerated master's program available to qualifying undergraduates in conjunction with the [[Tandon School of Engineering]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/overview |title=NYU Computer Science Department > Undergraduate CS Program Overview |publisher=Cs.nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}</ref>\n\n===Graduation===\nThe Courant Institute encourages students at any stage of their studies, including the very early stage, to seek summer employment opportunities at various government and industry facilities. In the past few years, Courant students have taken summer internships at the National Institute of Health, Los Alamos National Laboratory,  Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and NASA, as well as Wall Street firms. Such opportunities can greatly expand students' understanding of the mathematical sciences, offer them possible areas of interest for thesis research, and enhance their career options. Members of the faculty (and in particular the students' academic advisors) can assist students in finding appropriate summer employment. All graduate students are given official advisers, and  undergraduates are provided mentors from Courant faculty.\n\n===Academic research===\n[[File:Games for Learning Institute.jpg|thumb|The Courant Institute along with Microsoft Research are the founders of the Games for Learning Institute]]\nThe Department of Mathematics at Courant occupies a leading position in analysis and applied mathematics, including [[partial differential equations]], [[differential geometry]], [[dynamical systems]], [[probability]] and [[stochastic processes]], [[scientific computation]], [[mathematical finance]], [[mathematical physics]], and [[fluid dynamics]]. A special feature of the Institute is its highly interdisciplinary character \u2014 with courses, seminars, and active research collaborations in areas such as [[financial mathematics]], materials science, visual neural science, atmosphere/ocean science, cardiac fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and mathematical genomics. Another special feature is the central role of [[analysis]], which provides a natural bridge between pure and applied mathematics. The Department of Computer Science has strengths in multimedia, programming languages and systems, distributed and parallel computing, and the [[analysis of algorithms]].\n\nSince 1948, Courant Institute has maintained its own research journal, [[Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics]], which currently has the highest impact factor internationally among mathematics journals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/78504520/issue |title=Wiley Online Library |publisher=.interscience.wiley.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}{{dead link|date=February 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>   While the journal represents the full spectrum of the Institute's mathematical research activity, most articles are in  the fields of applied mathematics, mathematical analysis, or mathematical physics. Its contents over the years amount to a modern history of the theory of partial differential equations. Most articles originate within the Institute or are specially invited. The Institute also  publishes its own series of lecture notes. They are based on the research interests of the faculty and visitors of the   Institute, originated in advanced graduate courses and mini-courses offered at the Institute.\n\n==Resources==\n[[File:Applied Mathematics Lab.jpg|thumb|Applied Mathematics Laboratory]]\n\n===Warren Weaver Hall & 60 Fifth Avenue===\nCIMS consists of the [[NYU]] Departments of Mathematics and Computer Science as well as a variety of research activities.

He was given the task of building up the Department of Mathematics at the [[NYU Graduate School of Arts and Science]]. He was later joined by [[Kurt O. Friedrichs]] and James J. Stoker. In 1946, the department was renamed \"Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics\". Also in 1946, NYU Professor [[Morris Kline]] focused on mathematical problems of electromagnetic wave propagation. This project gave rise to the Institute's Division of Wave Propagation and Applied Mathematics. In 1952, the [[U.S. Atomic Energy Commission]] installed one of the first (electronic) computers at New York University, which led to the creation of the Courant Mathematics and Computing Laboratory. The Division of Magnetofluid Dynamics was initiated by a project on plasma fusion by NYU Professor [[Harold Grad]] in 1954.  The Institute was in the forefront of advanced hardware use, with an early [[IBM 7094]] and the fourth produced [[CDC 6600]].  The Division of [[Computational Fluid Dynamics]] was created in 1978, arising from a project of NYU Professor [[Paul Garabedian|Paul R. Garabedian]].\n\n==Directors==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! Image\n! Name\n!

The film premiered on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] on January 10, 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nAn outlaw band led by Blackjack Britton and Cavin Guthrie rob a bank. During the subsequent [[gunfight]], a woman named Dolly Sloan is shot and dies in the arms of Cavin's nephew Sonny. The gang flees and is pursued by a [[Posse comitatus|posse]]. After passing through a dust storm, they escape through a tunnel and emerge at the other end in the town of Refuge.  The gang is welcomed there but they are puzzled by the town's residents, who don't carry guns or swear, and who immediately flock to the church whenever the bell rings.\n\nSonny thinks he has seen some of the town's residents before, but he is unable to remember where. The rest of the outlaws occupy the saloon and begin causing trouble.  Sonny befriends a woman named Rose who tries to steer him away from asking questions but, as he investigates further, he realizes that the town appears to be occupied by former notorious gunfighters.  These include [[Wild Bill Hickok]], the town's Sheriff, [[Jesse James]], [[Billy the Kid]] and [[Doc Holliday]], although they deny their identities to Sonny. Later he talks to a gardener named Lamb whom he prompts to admit who he really is.  Before Sonny can ask more questions, some of Blackjack's men tear up Lamb's garden. Enraged, he beats one to death with his shovel and is led away by a mysterious [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] who acts as Gatekeeper to the other realm.\n\nWhile talking to Doc, Sonny lets slip the true nature of their gang.  Upon hearing that they are all wanted outlaws, the Sheriff asks them to saddle up and leave town.  Blackjack orders all his men to assemble in the saloon except Sonny, who is ejected from the gang by Cavin.  Sonny sneaks in anyway and overhears the gang members planning to rob the town on their way out, while Cavin plans to rape Rose.  Sonny joins the others in church, where he begs them to defend their town.  The townspeople finally admit to Sonny that Refuge is a form of [[Purgatory]].  If they can go ten years while resisting the temptations of their former lives they are admitted to [[Heaven]].  They don't want to face off against Blackjack's gang because they fear it will cost them their souls.  A frustrated Sonny leaves the church and is jumped by Blackjack and Cavin, who beat him unconscious.\n\nThe next morning, a battered Sonny straps on his guns and prepares to face Blackjack's gang alone.  The townspeople are summoned by the church bells, but while most of them comply, Hickok, Holliday, James, and Billy all join Sonny, inspired by his willingness to die to protect Rose.  A shootout erupts, during which Blackjack's gang is slaughtered, but Cavin manages to shoot Sonny before being killed by him in return.  Sonny, despite being fatally wounded, does not feel pain and does not die.  Hickok welcomes him to Refuge, realizing that Sonny has earned his second chance.  When Blackjack arrives and challenges Hickok, he loses. \"I guess I'm one of you now,\" Blackjack jokes, realizing the truth of the situation.  \"I wouldn't count on it,\" Hickok replies before dispatching Blackjack finally.\n \nThe Gatekeeper carries the bodies of Cavin and Blackjack to the edge of a fiery pit, into which they are thrown screaming. Hickok and the others grimly follow, but the stagecoach arrives and the driver tells them that by sacrificing their second chances to protect the others, they have secured a place in Heaven. \"The Creator may be tough, but He ain't blind,\" he says. Sonny asks to stay behind with Rose, and Hickok hands him the Sheriff's badge.  The coach then leaves, riding upwards into the light.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Sheriff Forrest/[[Wild Bill Hickok]]\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Blackjack Britton\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Doc Woods/[[Doc Holliday]]\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Cavin Guthrie\n* [[Brad Rowe (actor)|Brad Rowe]] as Leon \"Sonny\" Miller\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Deputy Glen/[[Billy the Kid]]\n* [[J.

Davis later provided a chapter examining ''Purgatory's'' surreal and religious themes in the compilation ''Undead in the West''. This is a wry meditation on the changes rung on legend in the film, where the heroes portrayed had already been immortalized by reputation while still alive; now they are \u2018dead\u2019 they must earn their immortal redemption by giving up everything that had earned them their reputation in the first place.

''[[High Noon]]'' in particular, the prototype of the climactic final shootout, had gone through many variations in later films, and references to several of these exist in ''Purgatory''.

The film premiered on [[TNT (American TV network)|TNT]] on January 10, 1999.\n\n==Plot==\nAn outlaw band led by Blackjack Britton and Cavin Guthrie rob a bank. During the subsequent [[gunfight]], a woman named Dolly Sloan is shot and dies in the arms of Cavin's nephew Sonny. The gang flees and is pursued by a [[Posse comitatus|posse]]. After passing through a dust storm, they escape through a tunnel and emerge at the other end in the town of Refuge.  The gang is welcomed there but they are puzzled by the town's residents, who don't carry guns or swear, and who immediately flock to the church whenever the bell rings.\n\nSonny thinks he has seen some of the town's residents before, but he is unable to remember where. The rest of the outlaws occupy the saloon and begin causing trouble.  Sonny befriends a woman named Rose who tries to steer him away from asking questions but, as he investigates further, he realizes that the town appears to be occupied by former notorious gunfighters.  These include [[Wild Bill Hickok]], the town's Sheriff, [[Jesse James]], [[Billy the Kid]] and [[Doc Holliday]], although they deny their identities to Sonny. Later he talks to a gardener named Lamb whom he prompts to admit who he really is.  Before Sonny can ask more questions, some of Blackjack's men tear up Lamb's garden. Enraged, he beats one to death with his shovel and is led away by a mysterious [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] who acts as Gatekeeper to the other realm.\n\nWhile talking to Doc, Sonny lets slip the true nature of their gang.  Upon hearing that they are all wanted outlaws, the Sheriff asks them to saddle up and leave town.  Blackjack orders all his men to assemble in the saloon except Sonny, who is ejected from the gang by Cavin.  Sonny sneaks in anyway and overhears the gang members planning to rob the town on their way out, while Cavin plans to rape Rose.  Sonny joins the others in church, where he begs them to defend their town.  The townspeople finally admit to Sonny that Refuge is a form of [[Purgatory]].  If they can go ten years while resisting the temptations of their former lives they are admitted to [[Heaven]].  They don't want to face off against Blackjack's gang because they fear it will cost them their souls.  A frustrated Sonny leaves the church and is jumped by Blackjack and Cavin, who beat him unconscious.\n\nThe next morning, a battered Sonny straps on his guns and prepares to face Blackjack's gang alone.  The townspeople are summoned by the church bells, but while most of them comply, Hickok, Holliday, James, and Billy all join Sonny, inspired by his willingness to die to protect Rose.  A shootout erupts, during which Blackjack's gang is slaughtered, but Cavin manages to shoot Sonny before being killed by him in return.  Sonny, despite being fatally wounded, does not feel pain and does not die.  Hickok welcomes him to Refuge, realizing that Sonny has earned his second chance.  When Blackjack arrives and challenges Hickok, he loses. \"I guess I'm one of you now,\" Blackjack jokes, realizing the truth of the situation.  \"I wouldn't count on it,\" Hickok replies before dispatching Blackjack finally.\n \nThe Gatekeeper carries the bodies of Cavin and Blackjack to the edge of a fiery pit, into which they are thrown screaming. Hickok and the others grimly follow, but the stagecoach arrives and the driver tells them that by sacrificing their second chances to protect the others, they have secured a place in Heaven. \"The Creator may be tough, but He ain't blind,\" he says. Sonny asks to stay behind with Rose, and Hickok hands him the Sheriff's badge.  The coach then leaves, riding upwards into the light.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sam Shepard]] as Sheriff Forrest/[[Wild Bill Hickok]]\n* [[Eric Roberts]] as Blackjack Britton\n* [[Randy Quaid]] as Doc Woods/[[Doc Holliday]]\n* [[Peter Stormare]] as Cavin Guthrie\n* [[Brad Rowe (actor)|Brad Rowe]] as Leon \"Sonny\" Miller\n* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Deputy Glen/[[Billy the Kid]]\n* [[J.

Davis later provided a chapter examining ''Purgatory's'' surreal and religious themes in the compilation ''Undead in the West''.
