Jane's father seized the Spanish treasure ship ''Santa Br\u00edgida'' in the [[action of 16 October 1799]] and his share of the [[prize money]] established the family fortune. Holkham Hall was the family seat of her maternal grandfather [[Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (seventh creation)|Thomas Coke]] and in 1815 her father inherited and settled in [[Minterne Magna|Minterne House and estate]], [[Dorset]].\n\n=== Marriages, scandal, and affairs ===\nConsidered promiscuous for her times, Digby was first married to [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Edward Law, 2nd Baron Ellenborough]] (later Earl of Ellenborough), who became Governor General of India, on 15 October 1824. They had one son, Arthur Dudley Law (15 February 1828 \u2013 1 February 1830), who died in infancy.\n\nAfter successive affairs with her maternal cousin Colonel George Anson and [[Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg]], she was divorced from Lord Ellenborough in 1830 by an act of Parliament. This caused considerable scandal at the time. Digby had two children with Felix; Mathilde \"Didi\" (born 12 November 1829 [[Basel]], Switzerland and raised by Felix's sister) and Felix (born December 1830 Paris, France) who died just a few weeks after his birth. The affair with Felix ended shortly after the death of their son.\n\nShe then moved on to Germany and became the lover of [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]]. In Munich, she met Baron Karl von Venningen (6 January 1806 \u2013 10 June 1874). They married in November 1833 and had a son, Heribert (27 January 1833 [[Palermo]], Italy \u2013 1885 [[Munich]], Germany), and a daughter, Bertha (4 September 1834 [[Mannheim]], Germany \u2013 22 September 1907).\n\nIn 1838, Digby found a new lover in the Greek Count Spyridon Theotokis (born 1805). Venningen found out and challenged Theotokis to a duel, in which the latter was wounded. Venningen generously released Digby from their marriage and took care of their children. They remained friends for the rest of their lives. \n\nThough she was not legally divorced from Venningen until 1842, Digby converted to the Greek Orthodox faith and married Theotokis in [[Marseille]], France in 1841. The couple moved to Greece with their son Leonidas (21 March 1840 [[Paris]], France \u2013 1846 [[Athens]], Greece). In 1846, after their son's fatal fall off a balcony, Theotokis and Digby divorced. Greece's King [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] became her next lover.\n\nSubsequently came an affair with a hero of the [[Greek War of Independence]], the Thessalian general [[Christodoulos Chatzipetros]],<ref>[ \u0393\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03bd\u03b7\u03c2 \u039a\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03c2: \u00ab\u0397 \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u0391\u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03b9\u00bb (1834\u20131934), \u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb. 46 \u2013 47, \u03b3\u0384 \u03ad\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7, \u0395\u03ba\u03b4\u03cc\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2 \u03a6\u03b9\u03bb\u03b9\u03c0\u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7, \u0391\u03b8\u03ae\u03bd\u03b1, 1983.]</ref> acting as 'queen' of his army, living in caves, riding horses and hunting in the mountains.
