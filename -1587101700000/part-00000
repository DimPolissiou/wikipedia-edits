Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions.

This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain. This strategy also left [[supply line]]s poorly protected. One-third of Poland's forces were massed in or near the Polish Corridor, making them vulnerable to a [[Pincer movement|double envelopment]] from East Prussia and the west. Another third were concentrated in the north-central part of the country, between the major cities of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Warsaw.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 304\u2013310</ref> The forward positioning of Polish forces vastly increased the difficulty of carrying out strategic maneuvers, compounded by inadequate mobility, as Polish units often lacked the ability to retreat from their defensive positions as they were being overrun by more mobile German mechanized formations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n[[File:Peking.jpg|thumb|[[Peking Plan]]: Polish destroyers evacuate the Baltic Sea en route to the United Kingdom.|alt=Photo of three Polish destroyers executing the Peking Plan and evacuating to British before the start of the invasion.]]\n\nAs the prospect of conflict increased, the British government pressed Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz to evacuate the most modern elements of the Polish Navy from the Baltic Sea.<ref name=\"PN\" /> In the event of war the Polish military leaders realized that the ships which remained in the Baltic were likely to be quickly sunk by the Germans. Furthermore, the [[Danish straits]] were well within operating range of the German ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' and ''Luftwaffe'', so there was little chance of an evacuation plan succeeding if implemented after hostilities began. Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared. Polish pre-war [[propaganda]] emphasized that any German invasion would be easily repelled. Consequently, Polish defeats during the German invasion came as a shock to the civilian population.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> Lacking training for such a disaster, the civilian population panicked and retreated east, spreading chaos, lowering troop morale and making road transportation for Polish troops very difficult.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> The propaganda also had some negative consequences for the Polish troops themselves, whose communications, disrupted by German mobile units operating in the rear and civilians blocking roads, were further thrown into chaos by bizarre reports from Polish radio stations and newspapers, which often reported imaginary victories and other military operations. This led to some Polish troops being encircled or taking a stand against overwhelming odds, when they thought they were actually counterattacking or would soon receive reinforcements from other victorious areas.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\n=== Phase 1: German invasion ===\n[[File:Poland2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Map showing the advances made by the Germans, and the disposition of all troops from 1 to 14 September|alt=Map showing the advance made by the Germans, and the disposition of German and Polish troops on 14 September 1939.]]\n\nFollowing several German-staged incidents (like the Gleiwitz incident, a part of [[Operation Himmler]]), which German propaganda used as a [[pretext]] to claim that German forces were acting in [[self-defence]], one of the first acts of war took place on 1 September 1939. At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45. Around that time Luftwaffe attacked a number of military and civilian targets, including [[bombing of Wielu\u0144]], the first large scale city bombing of the war. At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south. All three assaults converged on the Polish capital of Warsaw.\n[[File:Zniszczenia1939 0.jpg|thumb|left|The city of [[Wielu\u0144]] destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing|alt=Aerial photo showing the city of Wielu\u0144, which was destroyed by ''Luftwaffe'' bombing on 1 September]]\n\nFrance and the UK declared war on Germany on 3 September, but [[Western betrayal|failed to provide any meaningful support]].

In 1939, only 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.<ref>Henryk Smaczny, ''Ksi\u0119ga kawalerii polskiej'' (\"Book of Polish cavalry\"), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, {{ISBN|83-00-02555-3}}</ref> [[Polish cavalry]] never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery, but usually acted as [[Mounted infantry|mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and reconnaissance units, and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against foot soldiers. Most of these charges were successful.<ref name=\"Kawaleria\">{{cite web | author=Marcin Lewandowski | title=Szar\u017ce we wrze\u015bniu 1939 (Cavalry charges in September 1939) | publisher= | year=2005 | work=Kawaleria II RP | url=http://www.kawaleria.marcin-lewandowski.xip.pl/szarze.php | accessdate=2006-04-26 |language=pl}}</ref> Other armies (including German and Soviet) also fielded and extensively used elite horse cavalry units at that time. The last cavalry-vs-cavalry battle in Europe was fought between German and Polish cavalries ([[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d (1939)]]). Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun. The myth originated from war correspondents' reports similar to that of the [[Charge at Krojanty|Battle of Krojanty]], where a Polish cavalry brigade was fired upon in ambush by hidden armored vehicles, after it had mounted a successful sabre-charge against German infantry. There were also cases when Polish cavalry dashing between tanks trying to break out of encirclement gave an impression of an attack.<ref group=\"Note\">Seidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion. Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/Cavalry_Myth/cavalry_myth.html|title=Cavalry Myth}}</ref>\n\n=== Polish Air Force ===\nThe [[Polish Air Force order of battle in 1939|Polish Air Force]] was not destroyed on the ground in the first days of the war. Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J. Zaloga, Ramiro Bujeiro, Howard Gerrard, ''Poland 1939: the birth of blitzkrieg'', Osprey Publishing, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-408-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQeAKAjlEwMC&pg=PA50&dq=Polish+airforce+1939+ground Google Print, p.50]</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' lost 285 aircraft to all operational causes, with 279 more damaged, and the Poles lost 333 aircraft.<ref>Overy, Richard J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uocntt1lGDUC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28 ''The Air War: 1939\u20131945''], London, Europa Publications, 1980. p. 28</ref>\n\n=== Polish resistance to the invasion ===\nAnother question concerns whether Poland inflicted any significant losses on the German forces and whether it surrendered too quickly. In the first few days, Germany sustained very heavy losses: Poland cost the Germans 993 tanks and armored vehicles as campaign losses of which 300 tanks were never recovered,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.achtungpanzer.com/invasion-of-poland-fall-weiss.htm|title=Invasion of Poland \u2013 Fall Weiss|website=achtungpanzer.com}}</ref><ref>''Encyklopedia II wojny \u015bwiatowej'', p. 670</ref> thousands of soldiers, and 25% of its air strength.<ref>Bekker, Cajus (1964) ''Angriffshohe'' 285 aircraft destroyed, 279 damaged of initial force</ref> As for duration, the September Campaign lasted about a week and a half less than the [[Battle of France]] in 1940 even though the Anglo-French forces were much closer to parity with the Germans in numerical strength and equipment and were supported by the [[Maginot line]].<ref group=\"Note\" name=\"FrenchForces\">Polish to German forces in the September Campaign: 1,000,000 soldiers, 4,300 guns, 880 tanks, 435 aircraft (Poland) to 1,800,000 soldiers, 10,000 guns, 2,800 tanks, 3,000 aircraft (Germany). French and participating Allies to German forces in the Battle of France: 2,862,000 soldiers, 13,974 guns, 3,384 tanks, 3,099 aircraft 2 (Allies) to 3,350,000 soldiers, 7,378 guns, 2,445 tanks, 5,446 aircraft (Germany).</ref> Furthermore, the Polish Army was preparing the [[Romanian Bridgehead]], which would have prolonged Polish defence, but the plan was invalidated by the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', ch. 3</ref> Poland also never officially surrendered to the Germans. Under German occupation, there was continued resistance by forces such as the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'', [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]]'s guerillas, and the [[Le\u015bni]] (\"forest partisans\").\n\n[[File:Defenders of Warsaw (1939).jpg|thumb|[[Polish Army|Polish soldiers]] with anti-aircraft artillery near the Warsaw Central Station in the first days of September 1939.]]\n[[File:American Embassy in Warsaw 1939.jpg|thumb|American embassy in Warsaw during the German air raid in September 1939. Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

In private, Hitler said in May that Danzig was not the important issue to him, but pursuit of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' for Germany.<ref>''A World at Total War: Global Conflict and the Politics of Destruction, 1937\u20131945'', Roger Chickering, Stig F\u00f6rster, Bernd Greiner, p. 97</ref>\n\n=== Breakdown of talks ===\nWith tensions mounting, Germany turned to aggressive diplomacy. On 28 April 1939, Hitler [[unilateral]]ly withdrew from both the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1934 and the [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement]] of 1935. Talks over Danzig and the Corridor broke down and months passed without diplomatic interaction between Germany and Poland. During this interim period, the Germans learned that France and Britain had failed to secure an alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, and that the Soviet Union was interested in an alliance with Germany against Poland. Hitler had already issued orders to prepare for a possible \"solution of the Polish problem by military means\" through the [[Fall Weiss (1939)|Case White]] scenario.\n\nIn May 1939, in a statement to his generals while they were in the midst of planning the invasion of Poland, Hitler made it clear that the invasion would not come without resistance as it had in Czechoslovakia:<ref name=\"Clark, Lloyd 2011, page 26\">Clark, Lloyd, ''Kursk: The Greatest Battle: Eastern Front 1943'', 2011, p. 26</ref>\n\n{{quote|With minor exceptions German national unification has been achieved.

In fact, the Soviets agreed not to aid France or the UK in the event of their going to war with Germany over Poland and, in a secret protocol of the pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed to divide Eastern Europe, including Poland, into two [[spheres of influence]]; the western one-third of the country was to go to Germany and the eastern two-thirds to the Soviet Union.\n\nThe German assault was originally scheduled to begin at 04:00 on 26 August. However, on 25 August, the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]] was signed as an annex to the [[Franco-Polish alliance (1921)]]. In this accord, Britain committed itself to the defence of Poland, guaranteeing to preserve Polish independence. At the same time, the British and the Poles were hinting to Berlin that they were willing to resume discussions\u2014not at all how Hitler hoped to frame the conflict. Thus, he wavered and postponed his attack until 1 September, managing to in effect halt the entire invasion \"in mid-leap\".\n[[File:Ribbentrop-Molotov.svg|thumb|left|Planned and actual divisions of Poland, according to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], with later adjustments|alt=Map showing the planned and actual divisions of Poland according to the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact.]]\n\nHowever, there was one exception: on the night of 25\u201326 August, a German sabotage group which had not heard anything about a delay of the invasion made an attack on the [[Jablunkov Pass]] and [[Mosty u Jablunkova|Mosty]] railway station in [[Silesia]]. On the morning of 26 August, this group was repelled by Polish troops. The German side described all this as an incident \"caused by an insane individual\" (see [[Jab\u0142onk\u00f3w incident]]).\n\nOn 26 August, Hitler tried to dissuade the British and the French from interfering in the upcoming conflict, even pledging that the ''Wehrmacht'' forces would be made available to Britain's empire in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/t295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/psf/box31/a295s04.html|title=Home \u2013 FDR Presidential Library & Museum}}</ref> The negotiations convinced Hitler that there was little chance the Western Allies would declare war on Germany, and even if they did, because of the lack of \"territorial guarantees\" to Poland, they would be willing to negotiate a compromise favourable to Germany after its conquest of Poland. Meanwhile, the increased number of overflights by high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]] and cross-border troop movements signaled that war was imminent.\n[[File:Second World War Europe.png|right|thumb|The map shows the beginning of World War II in September 1939 in a European context.]]\n\nOn 29 August, prompted by the British, Germany issued one last diplomatic offer, with ''Fall Weiss'' yet to be rescheduled. That evening, the German government responded in a communication that it aimed not only for the restoration of Danzig but also the Polish Corridor (which had not previously been part of Hitler's demands) in addition to the safeguarding of the [[German minority in Poland]]. It said that they were willing to commence negotiations, but indicated that a Polish representative with the power to sign an agreement had to arrive in Berlin the next day while in the meantime it would draw up a set of proposals.<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk78.asp Reply of the German Chancellor to the Communication of 28 August 1939, from His Majesty's Government] Cited in the British Blue Book</ref> The British Cabinet was pleased that negotiations had been agreed to but, mindful of how [[Emil H\u00e1cha]] had been [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|forced to sign his country away]] under similar circumstances just months earlier, regarded the requirement for an immediate arrival of a Polish representative with full signing powers as an unacceptable [[ultimatum]].<ref>[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/wwii/blbk81.asp Viscount Halifax to Sir N.

Hitler issued orders for the invasion to commence soon afterwards.\n\nOn 29 August, Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[J\u00f3zef Beck]] ordered military [[mobilization]], but under the pressure from Great Britain and France, the mobilization was cancelled. When the final mobilization started, it added to the confusion.<ref>Oslon and Cloud,\"A Question of Honor\" p. 50</ref>\n\nOn 30 August, the [[Polish Navy]] sent its destroyer [[flotilla]] to Britain, executing the [[Peking Plan]]. On the same day, [[Marshal of Poland]] [[Edward Rydz-\u015amig\u0142y]] announced the mobilization of Polish troops. However, he was pressured into revoking the order by the French, who apparently still hoped for a diplomatic settlement, failing to realize that the Germans were fully mobilized and concentrated at the Polish border.<ref>Seidner, Stanley S.

However, partly because of the earlier stoppage, Poland finally managed to mobilize only about 70% of its planned forces (only about 900,000 of 1,350,000 soldiers planned to mobilize in first order), and because of that many units were still forming or moving to their designated frontline positions. The late mobilization reduced combat capability of Polish Army by about 1/3.\n\n== Opposing forces ==\n{{See also|Opposing forces in the Polish September Campaign|Soviet order of battle for invasion of Poland in 1939|Slovak invasion of Poland}}\n\n=== Germany ===\n{{See also|German order of battle for the invasion of Poland}}\n\nGermany had a substantial numeric advantage over Poland and had developed a significant military before the conflict. The ''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'' (army) had 3,472 [[tank]]s in its inventory, of which 2,859 were with the Field Army and 408 with the [[Replacement Army]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=88}} 453 tanks were assigned into four light divisions, while another 225 tanks were in detached regiments and companies.{{sfn|Jentz|1996|p=91}}  Most notably, the Germans had seven ''[[Panzer]]'' divisions, with 2,009 tanks between them, utilizing a new [[operational doctrine]].{{sfn|Jentz|1996|pp=90\u201391}} It held that these divisions should act in coordination with other elements of the military, punching holes in the enemy line and isolating selected units, which would be [[Encirclement|encircled]] and destroyed. This would be followed up by less-mobile mechanized infantry and foot soldiers. The ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (air force) provided both tactical and strategic [[air power]], particularly [[dive bomber]]s that disrupted lines of supply and communications. Together, the new methods were nicknamed \"''[[Blitzkrieg]]''\" (lightning war). While historian [[Basil Liddell Hart]] claimed \"Poland was a full demonstration of the ''Blitzkrieg'' theory\",<ref>B.H. Hart & A.J.P. Taylor, p. 41</ref> [[Invasion of Poland#Misconceptions|some other historians]] disagree.<ref name=Cooper0 />\n\n[[Aircraft]] played a major role in the campaign. [[Bomber aircraft|Bombers]] also attacked cities, causing huge losses amongst the civilian population through [[terror bombing]] and strafing. The ''Luftwaffe'' forces consisted of 1,180 [[Fighter aircraft|fighters]], 290 [[Junkers Ju 87|Ju 87 ''Stuka'']] [[dive bomber]]s, 1,100 conventional bombers (mainly [[Heinkel He 111]]s and [[Dornier Do 17]]s), and an assortment of 550 transport and 350 reconnaissance aircraft.<ref>Bombers of the Luftwaffe, Joachim Dressel and Manfred Griehl, Arms and Armour, 1994</ref><ref>The Flying pencil, Heinz J.

The partitioning powers did not invest in the development of industry, especially in the armaments industry in ethnically Polish areas. Moreover, Poland had to deal with damage caused by [[World War I]]. This resulted in the need to build a defense industry from scratch. Between 1936 and 1939, Poland invested heavily in the newly created [[Centralny Okr\u0119g Przemys\u0142owy|Central Industrial Region]]. Preparations for a defensive war with Germany were ongoing for many years, but most plans assumed fighting would not begin before 1942. To raise funds for industrial development, Poland sold much of the modern equipment it produced.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 177</ref> In 1936, a [[Fundusz Obrony Narodowej|National Defence Fund]] was set up to collect funds necessary for strengthening the Polish Armed forces. The [[Polish Army]] had approximately a million soldiers, but not all were mobilized by 1 September. Latecomers sustained significant casualties when public transport became targets of the ''Luftwaffe''. The Polish military had fewer armored forces than the Germans, and these units, dispersed within the infantry, were unable to effectively engage the Germans.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 270\u201394</ref>\n\nExperiences in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] shaped Polish Army organizational and operational doctrine. Unlike the [[trench warfare]] of [[World War I]], the Polish\u2013Soviet War was a conflict in which the [[cavalry]]'s mobility played a decisive role.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 135\u2013138</ref> Poland acknowledged the benefits of mobility but was unable to invest heavily in many of the expensive, unproven inventions since then. In spite of this, [[Polish cavalry]] [[brigade]]s were used as mobile [[mounted infantry]] and had some successes against both German infantry and cavalry.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', p. 158</ref>\n[[File:Samoloty PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b wraz z za\u0142ogami 02 (1939).jpg|thumb|left|Polish [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] medium bombers with a four-man crew |alt=A Polish PZL.37 ''\u0141o\u015b'' medium bomber aircraft]]\n\nAn average Polish infantry division consisted of 16,492 soldiers and was equipped with 326 light and medium machine guns, 132 heavy machine guns, 92 anti-tank rifles and several dozen light, medium, heavy, anti-tank and anti-airplane field artillery.

Poland had only about 600 aircraft, of which only [[PZL.37 \u0141o\u015b]] heavy bombers were modern and comparable to their German counterparts.

All those aircraft were of indigenous Polish design, with the bombers being more modern than fighters, according to the [[Ludomi\u0142 Rayski]] air force expansion plan, which relied on a strong bomber force. The Polish Air Force consisted of a 'Bomber Brigade', 'Pursuit Brigade' and aircraft assigned to the various ground armies.<ref>'Duel for the Sky' by Christopher Shores</ref> The Polish fighters were older than their German counterparts; the PZL P.11 fighter\u2014produced in the early 1930s\u2014had a top speed of only {{convert|365|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}, far less than German bombers.

As a \"last minute\" order in the summer of 1939, Poland bought 160 French [[Morane-Saulnier M.S.406]] fighters and 111 English airplanes (100 light bombers [[Fairey Battle]], 10 [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and 1 [[Supermarine Spitfire]]; the sale of 150 Spitfires asked by the Polish government was rejected by the Air Ministry).<ref name=\"Wojciech Mazur\">{{cite journal |last1=Mazur |first1=Wojciech |title=Pomocnik Historyczny |journal=Polityka |date=March 2009 |volume=3/2009 |page=103}}</ref> Despite the fact that some of the airplanes had been shipped to Poland (the first transport of purchased aircraft on the ship \"Lassel\" sailed from Liverpool on 28 August 1939<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.plus-minus.net.pl/PomocPolsce/UnitedKingdom/index1.html | title=1::Pomoc wojenna Imperium Brytyjskiego dla Polski w okresie II Wojny \u015aWIATOWEJ}}</ref>), none of them would take part in combat.

It called for the start of hostilities before a [[declaration of war]], and pursued a doctrine of mass encirclement and destruction of enemy forces. The infantry\u2014far from completely mechanized but fitted with fast-moving artillery and logistic support\u2014was to be supported by ''Panzers'' and small numbers of truck-mounted infantry (the ''Sch\u00fctzen'' regiments, forerunners of the ''[[panzergrenadier]]s'') to assist the rapid movement of troops and concentrate on [[Schwerpunkt|localized parts]] of the enemy [[Military front|front]], eventually isolating segments of the enemy, surrounding, and destroying them. The pre-war \"armored idea\" (which an American journalist in 1939 dubbed ''Blitzkrieg'')\u2014which was advocated by some generals, including [[Heinz Guderian]]\u2014would have had the armor punching holes in the enemy's front and ranging deep into rear areas; in actuality, the campaign in Poland would be fought along more traditional lines. This stemmed from conservatism on the part of the German high command, who mainly restricted the role of armor and mechanized forces to supporting the conventional infantry divisions.\n\nPoland's terrain was well suited for mobile operations when the weather cooperated; the country had flat [[plain]]s with long frontiers totalling almost {{convert|5600|km|mi|abbr=on}}, Poland's long border with Germany on the west and north\u2014facing East Prussia\u2014extended {{convert|2000|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Those had been lengthened by another {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} on the southern side in the aftermath of the Munich Agreement of 1938. The German incorporation of [[Bohemia and Moravia]] and creation of the German [[puppet state]] of [[History of Slovakia#World War II|Slovakia]] meant that Poland's southern flank was also exposed.\n\nHitler demanded that Poland be conquered in six weeks, but German planners thought that it would require three months.<ref name=\"knickerbocker1941\">{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RwGwpIBHhgcC&lpg=PR2&pg=PA29#v=onepage&q&f=false | title=Is Tomorrow Hitler's? 200 Questions On the Battle of Mankind | publisher=Reynal & Hitchcock | author=Knickerbocker, H.R. | year=1941 | pages=29\u201330| isbn=978-1-4179-9277-5 }}</ref> They intended to fully exploit their long border with the great enveloping manoeuver of ''Fall Weiss''. German units were to invade Poland from three directions:\n* A main attack over the western Polish border. This was to be carried out by Army Group South commanded by Colonel General [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], attacking from German [[Silesia]] and from the [[Moravia]]n and Slovak border: General [[Johannes Blaskowitz]]'s 8th Army was to drive eastward against [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]; General [[Wilhelm List]]'s 14th Army was to push on toward [[Krak\u00f3w]] and to turn the Poles' [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] flank; and General [[Walter von Reichenau]]'s 10th Army, in the centre with Army Group South's armor, was to deliver the decisive blow with a northeastward thrust into the heart of Poland.\n* A second route of attack from northern [[Prussia]]. Colonel General [[Fedor von Bock]] commanded Army Group North, comprising General [[Georg von K\u00fcchler]]'s 3rd Army, which was to strike southward from East Prussia, and General [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]]'s 4th Army, which was to attack eastward across the base of the [[Polish Corridor]].\n* A tertiary attack by part of Army Group South's allied [[Slovak Republic (1939\u20131945)|Slovak]] units from Slovakia.\n* From within Poland, the German minority would assist by engaging in diversion and sabotage operations through ''[[Volksdeutscher Selbstschutz]]'' units prepared before the war.\n\nAll three assaults were to converge on [[Warsaw]], while the main Polish army was to be encircled and destroyed west of the [[Vistula]]. ''Fall Weiss'' was initiated on 1 September 1939, and was the first operation of [[European Theatre of World War II|Second World War in Europe]].\n\n=== Polish defence plan ===\n[[File:Dywizje wrzesien 1.png|thumb|right|Deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions immediately before the German invasion.|alt=Map showing deployment of German, Polish, and Slovak divisions on 1 September 1939, immediately before the German invasion.]]\n\nThe Polish determination to deploy forces directly at the German-Polish border, prompted by the [[Polish-British Common Defence Pact]], shaped the country's defence plan, \"[[Plan West]]\". Poland's most valuable natural resources, industry and population were located along the western border in [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920\u20131939)|Eastern Upper Silesia]]. Polish policy centred on their protection especially since many politicians feared that if Poland were to retreat from the regions disputed by Germany, Britain and France would sign a separate peace treaty with Germany similar to the [[Munich Agreement]] of 1938.<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 68\u201372</ref> The fact that none of Poland's allies had specifically guaranteed Polish borders or [[territorial integrity]] didn't help in easing Polish concerns. For these reasons, the Polish government disregarded French advice to deploy the bulk of its forces behind natural barriers such as the [[Vistula]] and [[San (river)|San]] rivers, even though some Polish generals supported it as a better strategy. The West Plan did permit the Polish armies to retreat inside the country, but it was supposed to be a slow retreat behind prepared positions and was intended to give the armed forces time to complete its mobilization and execute a general [[counteroffensive]] with the support of the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].<ref>Seidner, ''Marshal Edward \u015amig\u0142y-Rydz Rydz and the defence of Poland'', pp. 122\u201325</ref>\n\nIn the case of a failure to defend the most of the territory, the army was to retreat to the south-east of the country, where the rough terrain, the [[Stryi River|Stryj]] and [[Dniestr]] rivers, valleys, hills and swamps would provide natural lines of defence against the [[Nazi Germany|German]] advance and [[Romanian Bridgehead]] could be created.\n[[File:Polish P-11 camouflaged in airfield 1939.jpg|thumb|left|A camouflaged Polish P-11 fighter at a combat airfield|alt=A photo of a Polish P-11 fighter covered in camouflage netting at an unidentified combat airfield]]\n\nThe Polish General Staff had not begun elaborating the \"West\" defence plan until 4 March 1939. It was assumed that the Polish Army, fighting in the initial phase of the war alone, would be compelled to defend the western regions of the country. The plan of operations took into account, first of all, the numerical and material superiority of the enemy and, consequently, assumed the defensive character of Polish operations. The Polish intentions were: defence of the western regions judged as indispensable for waging the war, taking advantage of the propitious conditions for counterattacks by reserve units, and avoidance of being smashed before the beginning of Franco/British operations in Western Europe. The [[operation plan|operational plan]] had not been elaborated in detail and concerned only the first stage of operations.<ref name=\"Wojna Obronna\" />\n\nThe British and French estimated that Poland would be able to defend itself for two to three months, while Poland estimated it could do so for at least six months. While Poland drafted its estimates based upon the expectation that the Western Allies would honor their treaty obligations and quickly start an offensive of their own, the French and British expected the war to develop into [[trench warfare]] much like World War I. The Polish government was not notified of this strategy and based all of its defence plans on promises of quick relief by their Western allies.<ref name=\"Pi\u0105tkowski\">{{cite book | author =Henryk Pi\u0105tkowski | title =Kampania wrze\u015bniowa 1939 roku w Polsce | year =1943 | page =39 | publisher =Sekcja Wydawnicza APW | location =Jerusalem | url =http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | accessdate =2 November 2011 | language =pl | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080209164014/http://homepages.ihug.co.nz/~antora/WYDAW/KAMPANIA/tekst/KAMPANIA1.HTM | archive-date =9 February 2008 | url-status =dead }}</ref><ref name=\"Raczy\u0144ski\">{{cite book | author=Count [[Edward Raczy\u0144ski (1891\u20131993)|Edward Raczy\u0144ski]] | title = The British-Polish Alliance; Its Origin and Meaning | year =1948 | publisher=Mellville Press | location = London }}</ref>\n\nPolish forces were stretched thinly along the Polish-German border and lacked compact defence lines and good defence positions along disadvantageous terrain.

Four days after the signing of the Polish-British Common Defence Pact, three destroyers of the Polish Navy executed the Peking Plan and consequently evacuated to Great Britain.<ref name=\"PN\" />\n\nAlthough the Polish military had prepared for conflict, the civilian population remained largely unprepared.

At 04:45, the old German [[pre-dreadnought battleship]] ''[[German battleship Schleswig-Holstein|Schleswig-Holstein]]'' opened fire on the Polish military transit depot at [[Battle of Westerplatte|Westerplatte]] in the Free City of Danzig on the [[Baltic Sea]]. However, in many places German units crossed the Polish border even before 04.45.

At 08:00, German troops\u2014still without a formal declaration of war issued\u2014[[Battle of Mokra|attacked near the Polish village of Mokra]]. The [[Battle of the Border]] had begun. Later that day, the Germans attacked on Poland's western, southern and northern borders, while German aircraft began raids on Polish cities. The main axis of attack led eastwards from Germany through the western Polish border. Supporting attacks came from East Prussia in the north, and a joint German-Slovak tertiary attack by units ([[Field Army Bernol\u00e1k|Field Army \"Bernol\u00e1k\"]]) from the German-allied Slovak Republic in the south.

The ''Luftwaffe'' gained [[air superiority]] early in the campaign.

Up to 120,000 Polish troops escaped to [[Neutral country|neutral]] Romania (through the Romanian Bridgehead and [[Hungary]]), and another 20,000 to [[Latvia]] and Lithuania, with the majority eventually making their way to France or Britain.

It would be months before Hitler would see the futility of his peace negotiation attempts with the United Kingdom and France, but the culmination of combined European and Pacific conflicts would result in what was truly a \"world war\". Thus, what was not seen by most politicians and generals in 1939 is clear from the historical perspective: The Polish September Campaign marked the beginning of a pan-European war, which combined with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion of China]] in 1937 and the [[Pacific War]] in 1941 to form the global conflict known as World War II.\n\nThe invasion of Poland led Britain and France to declare war on Germany on 3 September. However, they did little to affect the outcome of the September Campaign. No declaration of war was issued by Britain and France against the Soviet Union. This lack of direct help led many Poles to believe that they had been [[Western betrayal#Up to 1939|betrayed by their Western allies]].

In 1939, only 10% of the Polish army was made up of cavalry units.<ref>Henryk Smaczny, ''Ksi\u0119ga kawalerii polskiej'' (\"Book of Polish cavalry\"), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, {{ISBN|83-00-02555-3}}</ref> [[Polish cavalry]] never charged German tanks or entrenched infantry or artillery, but usually acted as [[Mounted infantry|mobile infantry]] (like [[dragoon]]s) and reconnaissance units, and executed cavalry charges only in rare situations against foot soldiers. Most of these charges were successful.<ref name=\"Kawaleria\">{{cite web | author=Marcin Lewandowski | title=Szar\u017ce we wrze\u015bniu 1939 (Cavalry charges in September 1939) | publisher= | year=2005 | work=Kawaleria II RP | url=http://www.kawaleria.marcin-lewandowski.xip.pl/szarze.php | accessdate=2006-04-26 |language=pl}}</ref> Other armies (including German and Soviet) also fielded and extensively used elite horse cavalry units at that time. The last cavalry-vs-cavalry battle in Europe was fought between German and Polish cavalries ([[Battle of Krasnobr\u00f3d (1939)]]). Polish cavalry consisted of 11 [[brigade]]s, equipped with [[Anti-tank rifle, model 35|\"UR\" anti-tank rifles]] and light artillery such as the highly effective [[Bofors 37 mm]] anti-tank gun. The myth originated from war correspondents' reports similar to that of the [[Charge at Krojanty|Battle of Krojanty]], where a Polish cavalry brigade was fired upon in ambush by hidden armored vehicles, after it had mounted a successful sabre-charge against German infantry. There were also cases when Polish cavalry dashing between tanks trying to break out of encirclement gave an impression of an attack.<ref group=\"Note\">Seidner takes issue here with this contention on at least one occasion.

Though numerically inferior, it had been redeployed from major air bases to small camouflaged airfields shortly before the war. Only some [[trainer aircraft|trainers]] and auxiliary aircraft were destroyed on the ground. The Polish Air Force, despite being significantly outnumbered and with its fighters outmatched by more advanced German fighters, remained active until the second week of the campaign, inflicting significant damage on the ''Luftwaffe''.<ref>Steven J. Zaloga, Ramiro Bujeiro, Howard Gerrard, ''Poland 1939: the birth of blitzkrieg'', Osprey Publishing, 2002, {{ISBN|1-84176-408-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oQeAKAjlEwMC&pg=PA50&dq=Polish+airforce+1939+ground Google Print, p.50]</ref> The ''Luftwaffe'' lost 285 aircraft to all operational causes, with 279 more damaged, and the Poles lost 333 aircraft.<ref>Overy, Richard J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uocntt1lGDUC&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28 ''The Air War: 1939\u20131945''], London, Europa Publications, 1980. p. 28</ref>\n\n=== Polish resistance to the invasion ===\nAnother question concerns whether Poland inflicted any significant losses on the German forces and whether it surrendered too quickly.

Under German occupation, there was continued resistance by forces such as the ''[[Armia Krajowa]]'', [[Henryk Dobrza\u0144ski]]'s guerillas, and the [[Le\u015bni]] (\"forest partisans\").\n\n[[File:Defenders of Warsaw (1939).jpg|thumb|[[Polish Army|Polish soldiers]] with anti-aircraft artillery near the Warsaw Central Station in the first days of September 1939.]]\n[[File:American Embassy in Warsaw 1939.jpg|thumb|American embassy in Warsaw during the German air raid in September 1939. Visible shattered window.]]\n\n=== First use of ''Blitzkrieg'' strategy ===\nIt is often assumed that '' Blitzkrieg'' is the strategy that Germany first used in Poland. Many early post-war histories, such as Barrie Pitt's in ''The Second World War'' (BPC Publishing 1966), attribute German victory to \"enormous development in military technique which occurred between 1918 and 1940\", and cite that \"Germany, who translated (British inter-war) theories into action... called the result ''Blitzkrieg''\". That idea has been repudiated by some authors. Matthew Cooper writes:\n\n{{quote|\"Throughout the Polish Campaign, the employment of the mechanized units revealed the idea that they were intended solely to ease the advance and to support the activities of the infantry.... Thus, any strategic exploitation of the armoured idea was still-born. The paralysis of command and the breakdown of morale were not made the ultimate aim of the{{nbs}}... German ground and air forces, and were only incidental by-products of the traditional manoeuvers of rapid encirclement and of the supporting activities of the flying artillery of the ''Luftwaffe'', both of which had as their purpose the physical destruction of the enemy troops. Such was the ''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' of the Polish campaign.\" \u2013 Cooper<ref name=\"Cooper176\" />|sign=|source=}}\n\n''[[Vernichtungsgedanke]]'' was a strategy dating back to [[Frederick the Great]], and it was applied in the Polish Campaign, little changed from the [[Franco-Prussian War|French campaigns in 1870]] or 1914. The use of [[tank]]s\n\n{{quote|...left much to be desired... Fear of enemy action against the flanks of the advance, fear which was to prove so disastrous to German prospects in the west in 1940 and in the Soviet Union in 1941, was present from the beginning of the war. \u2013 Cooper<ref name=Cooper0 />}}\n\nJohn Ellis, writing in ''[[Brute Force (book)|Brute Force]]'', asserted that\n\n{{quote|...there is considerable justice in Matthew Cooper's assertion that the ''panzer'' divisions were not given the kind of ''strategic'' mission that was to characterize authentic armoured ''blitzkrieg'', and were almost always closely subordinated to the various mass infantry armies. \u2013 Ellis<ref>Ellis, John (1999). ''Brute Force: Allied Strategy and Tactics in the Second World War'', pp. 3\u20134</ref> (emphasis in original)}}\n\nZaloga and Madej, in ''The Polish Campaign 1939'', also address the subject of mythical interpretations of ''Blitzkrieg'' and the importance of other arms in the campaign. Western accounts of the September campaign have stressed the shock value of the ''panzers'' and ''Stuka'' attacks, they have\n\n{{quote|...tended to underestimate the punishing effect of German artillery on Polish units. Mobile and available in significant quantity, artillery shattered as many units as any other branch of the ''Wehrmacht''. \u2013 Zaloga and Madej<ref name=\"Cooper4\" />}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Eastern Front (World War II)]]\n* [[Polish resistance movement in World War II]]\n* [[History of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Horses in World War II]]\n* [[List of Polish divisions in World War II]]\n* [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945)]]\n* [[Oder\u2013Neisse line]]\n* [[Phoney War]]\n* [[Polish cavalry brigade order of battle in 1939]]\n* [[Polish contribution to World War II]]\n* [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)]]\n* [[Timeline of the invasion of Poland]]\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[Western betrayal]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n== References ==\n<!--This article uses the Cite.php citation mechanism.

While Texas has been part of various political entities throughout its history, including 10 years during 1836\u20131846 as the independent [[Republic of Texas]], the current legal status is as a state of the United States of America.\n\nDue to Texas's unique history, United States sovereignty over Texas has been disputed at times. Adherents of secessionist movements claim that American sovereignty is illegal, although this viewpoint is not widely held. Disputes over the legal status of Texas have revolved around key issues that include, but are not limited to, the legitimacy of its re-admittance to the Union following the Civil War, differing viewpoints over its ''[[de facto]]'' and ''[[de jure]]'' international standing, and perceived discrepancies between its original and current boundaries.\n\nRegardless, a minority viewpoint, as expressed by some factions such as [[Republic of Texas (group)]], has persisted, asserting that Texas remains an independent nation and that American actions in the American Civil War have resulted in an illegal military occupation of Texas. The debate is considered by some to resemble academic discourse being argued by several other activist groups in the United States, most notably arguments over the [[legal status of Hawaii]] and the [[legal status of Alaska]].<ref>Enriquez, J.

While Texas has been part of various political entities throughout its history, including 10 years during 1836\u20131846 as the independent [[Republic of Texas]], the current legal status is as a state of the United States of America.\n\nDue to Texas's unique history, United States sovereignty over Texas has been disputed at times. Adherents of secessionist movements claim that American sovereignty is illegal, although this viewpoint is not widely held. Disputes over the legal status of Texas have revolved around key issues that include, but are not limited to, the legitimacy of its re-admittance to the Union following the Civil War, differing viewpoints over its ''[[de facto]]'' and ''[[de jure]]'' international standing, and perceived discrepancies between its original and current boundaries.\n\nRegardless, a minority viewpoint, as expressed by some factions such as [[Republic of Texas (group)]], has persisted, asserting that Texas remains an independent nation and that American actions in the American Civil War have resulted in an illegal military occupation of Texas. The debate is considered by some to resemble academic discourse being argued by several other activist groups in the United States, most notably arguments over the [[legal status of Hawaii]] and the [[legal status of Alaska]].<ref>Enriquez, J.

{"title_page": "Serene Highness", "text_new": "'''His/Her Serene Highness''' ([[abbreviation]]: '''HSH''', second person address: '''Your Serene Highness''') is a [[style (manner of address)|style]] used today by the [[reign]]ing families of [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], and [[Thailand]]. Until 1918, it was also associated with the princely titles of members of some German ruling and [[German mediatisation|mediatised]] dynasties and with a few [[German nobility|princely but non-ruling]] families. It was also the form of address used for [[cadet (genealogy)|cadet]] members of the dynasties of France, Italy, Russia and [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine Saxony]], under their [[monarchy|monarchies]]. Additionally, the treatment was granted for some, but not all, princely yet non-reigning families of Bohemia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania and Russia by emperors or popes. In a handful of rare cases, it was employed by non-royal rulers in [[viceregal]] or even [[Republicanism|republican]] contexts.\n\nIn a number of older [[Dictionary#English Dictionaries|English dictionaries]], ''serene'' as used in this context means ''supreme''; ''royal''; ''august''; ''marked by majestic dignity or grandeur''; or ''high or supremely dignified''.\n\n==German-speaking lands==\nThe current, legal usage of the style in the German-speaking countries is confined to the [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein]], the entirety of which bears the treatment.\n\nThe German term is ''Durchlaucht'', a translation of the [[Latin]] ''(su)perillustris''. This is usually translated into English as ''Serene Highness'', however, it would be more literal to translate it as ''superior to, above, beyond or greater than illustrious'', as it is an augmentation of ''Erlaucht'' (\"illustrious\"), which was accorded to [[Imperial immediacy|immediate]] counts (''[[Imperial count|Reichsgrafen]]'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and by [[German Mediatisation|mediatised]] counts of the [[German Confederation]] and the [[German Empire]]. The 1911 edition of the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] wryly observes that a perfectly logical English version might be \"Your Transparency\".\n\nIn 1375 Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] bestowed the nobiliary style ''Durchlauchtig'' (Most Serene Highness) upon the seven [[Prince-elector]]s designated by the [[Golden Bull of 1356]]. As from 1664 Emperor [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]] vested all [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire|Imperial Princes]] with the title, it became so common that the Electors like the [[Archduke]]s of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] began to use the superlative address ''Durchlauchtigst''. In the German Empire, the style of ''Serene Highness'' was usually held by princes of lower rank than those who were entitled to ''[[Highness]]'' (exceptions were the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] cadets of the [[Ernestine duchies]]), ''[[Grand Ducal Highness]]'', ''[[Royal Highness]]'', and ''[[Imperial Highness]]''. Therefore, if a woman entitled to the treatment of ''Royal Highness'' married a man who was addressed only as ''Serene Highness'', the woman usually retained her pre-marital style.\n\nIn 1905 Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] granted the style of ''Durchlaucht'' to members of virtually every family which had held the title of prince in the former Holy Roman Empire, even if the family had never exercised [[sovereignty]].\n\nIn the [[German Empire|German]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] empires of the 19th and 20th centuries, the style ''Serene Highness'' was also officially borne by:\n* [[Cadet branch]]es of the sovereign [[Ernestine duchies|Ernestine dukes]] (i.e., [[Saxe-Altenburg]], [[Saxe-Meiningen]], [[Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]);<ref name=\"gotha\">''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' (Gotha: [[Justus Perthes]], 1944), pages 111-113, 115</ref>\n* Reigning ''[[F\u00fcrst]]en'' of the small German [[realm]]s which survived the collapse of the [[Holy Roman Empire]];<ref>''[[Almanach de Gotha]]'' (Gotha: [[Justus Perthes]], 1944), pages 73, 94, 97, 98, 121, 124, 126</ref>\n** [[Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen|Hohenzollern]] (yielded sovereignty to Hohenzollern kinsman, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|King of Prussia]], in 1848)\n** [[Lippe]]\n** [[Reuss (state)|Reuss]]\n** [[Schaumburg-Lippe]]\n** [[House of Schwarzburg|Schwarzburg]] \n** [[Waldeck (state)|Waldeck and Pyrmont]]\n* [[German Mediatisation|Mediatised princes]] (e.g., [[House of F\u00fcrstenberg (Swabia)|F\u00fcrstenberg]], [[Hohenlohe]], [[Leiningen family|Leiningen]], [[Thurn und Taxis]]) and [[duke]]s (e.g., [[Chlodwig, Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsf\u00fcrst#Succession to family titles and estates|Ratibor]]), and, eventually, their family members;\n* [[Morganatic marriage|Morganatic]] princes, descended from reigning dynasties;\n* Other non-reigning princes of the [[German nobility]], but not (always) their cadets (e.g., [[F\u00fcrst von Bismarck|Bismarck]], [[:de:Schoenaich-Carolath|Carolath-Beuthen]], [[Pless]], [[Wrede]]).\n\nBy tradition, ''Durchlaucht'' is still attributed to the princely dynasties which were sovereign until 1917 or had been mediatised under the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and [[German Confederation]] in 1815, although the usage has been unofficial since 1918.\n\nN.B. The highest form of ''durchlauchtig'' (adjective) was '''''allerdurchlauchtigst''''' (absolutely most serene), which was reserved only to the Emperor in his style of address: ''Allerdurchlauchtigster Gro\u00dfm\u00e4chtigster Allergn\u00e4digster Kaiser und Herr''\n\n==Francophone dominions==\nThere is some evidence that in pre-Revolutionary France, unlike Germany, one entitled to be addressed as ''Serene Highness'' was considered to outrank someone who was merely addressed as ''Highness''. Those members of the royal family who were not children or grandchildren of a king, i.e., the ''[[prince du sang|princes du sang]]'', were entitled to be addressed as \"Most Serene Highness\" (''son altesse s\u00e9r\u00e9nissime'').<ref name = velde1>{{cite web |url= http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/highness.htm |accessdate=1 March 2009 |last=Velde |first= Fran\u00e7ois |title=Royal Styles and the uses of \"Highness\" |work= Heraldica.org}}</ref> The simple style of \"Highness\" (''altesse'') was claimed by the ''[[Foreign Prince|princes \u00e9trangers]]'' and the ''princes l\u00e9gitim\u00e9s''.

Previous to this grant the style was sometimes used by the Catholic Monarch Isabella and Ferdinand as well as by other houses known anciently as illustrious or serene.

In present-day Thailand, there are very few Mom Chao left after the royal family discontinued the traditional practice of polygamous marriages, and in Thailand all royal titles and styles decrease one level every generation for those not of the immediate royal family. Therefore, the child of a Mom Chao would only have the aristocratic title of Mom Rajawongse, which would then decrease in the next generation to Mom Luang, which would then decrease further, similar to a British [[life peerage]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Style (manner of address)]]\n* [[Most Serene Republic]]\n* [[SAS (novel series)|''SAS'' (novel series)]], named after ''Son Altesse S\u00e9r\u00e9nissime'', French version of the honorific.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/highness.htm Article on the use of ''Highness'']\n\n{{Royal styles}}\n\n[[Category:Royal styles]]\n", "text_old": "'''His/Her Serene Highness''' ([[abbreviation]]: '''HSH''', second person address: '''Your Serene Highness''') is a [[style (manner of address)|style]] used today by the [[reign]]ing families of [[Liechtenstein]], [[Monaco]], and [[Thailand]].

When incorporated into the [[nobility of Italy|Italian nobility]], their use of the ''Serene Highness'' style was authorised by the Crown.\n\n===San Marino===\n[[San Marino]] is styled as the [[Most Serene Republic]].\n\n==Poland==\nIn the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|First Republic of Poland]] (1569-1795), also called \"the Most Serene Republic of Poland\" (''Najja\u015bniejsza Rzeczpospolita Polska''), His/Her ''Serene Reigning Majesty'' (SRM) was a style used by the reigning [[List of Polish monarchs|monarchs]].\n\n==Russia==\nAfter 1886, great-grandchildren of Russian emperors in the male-line were ''Prince[ss] of Russia'', and were to be granted the treatment of ''Highness'', and ''Prince[ss] of Russia'' with the style of ''Serene Highness'' if being more distantly descended from an emperor, and born from an equally marriage.

However, when translated into non-Slavic languages and used in reference to a member of the imperial [[House of Romanov|Romanov]] family, it was usually rendered as ''Serene Highness''.\n\n==United Kingdom==\n[[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] elevated each of the princes who married her daughters to ''Royal Highness'' (except for [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Crown Prince Friedrich of Prussia]], husband of [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], who already possessed the [[Royal Highness|HRH]]).

Peers with the title of prince were entitled to it, and between 1920 and 1944  the regent, [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], was styled as '''His Serene Highness the Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary''' ''(\u0150f\u0151m\u00e9lt\u00f3s\u00e1ga, a Magyar Kir\u00e1lys\u00e1g korm\u00e1nyz\u00f3ja)''.\n\n==Portugal==\nAs the most powerful noble family in [[Portugal]], the [[Dukes of Braganza]] had the official treatment of ''Serene Highness'' until 1640, when they mounted the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] throne, thereby becoming entitled to the style of ''Royal Highness'', however the infantes not in direct line for the throne of Portugal were titled as \"His/Her Highness, the Serene Infante(a)\".\n\n==Mexico==\nFrom 1853 to 1855 the president of [[Mexico]], [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]], enjoyed the official style of ''Most Serene Highness'', a treatment unique in that country.\n\n[[Agustin de Iturbide|Agustin I de Mexico]] gave that title to several members of his family.\n\n==Spain==\nIn 1807 [[Manuel de Godoy]], Prince de la Paz, was accorded the style of ''Most Serene Highness'', a treatment unique in that country at the time. Previous to this grant the style was sometimes used by the Catholic Monarch Isabella and Ferdinand as well as by other houses known anciently as illustrious or serene. A majority of these ancient houses lost the style through prescription. <ref>Monitorio \u00e1ulico  By Pascual Maria Massa Martinez (baron del Pujol de Planes.)</ref>\n\nThe honorific ({{lang-es|El Seren\u00edsimo Se\u00f1or}}) is one of the styles of the ''[[infante]]s''.  \n   \n==Thailand==\nIn Thailand, the title of Serene Highness is the westernized style of the Thai title of '''[[Thai royal and noble titles|Mom Chao]]''' (''His/Her Serene Highness Prince/Princess'' | Thai: \u0e2b\u0e21\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32), denoting the grandchild of a king through one of his princely sons. In present-day Thailand, there are very few Mom Chao left after the royal family discontinued the traditional practice of polygamous marriages, and in Thailand all royal titles and styles decrease one level every generation for those not of the immediate royal family. Therefore, the child of a Mom Chao would only have the aristocratic title of Mom Rajawongse, which would then decrease in the next generation to Mom Luang, which would then decrease further, similar to a British [[life peerage]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Style (manner of address)]]\n* [[Most Serene Republic]]\n* [[SAS (novel series)|''SAS'' (novel series)]], named after ''Son Altesse S\u00e9r\u00e9nissime'', French version of the honorific.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.heraldica.org/topics/royalty/highness.htm Article on the use of ''Highness'']\n\n{{Royal styles}}\n\n[[Category:Royal styles]]\n", "name_user": "Chris Rodgers", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRussia:add correct translation of the adjective; with the -ey- added internally, it's actually a superlative", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serene_Highness"}

Although fossils from other areas have been assigned to the genus, the only certain remains of ''Megalosaurus'' come from [[Oxfordshire]] and date to the late [[Middle Jurassic]].\n\n''Megalosaurus'' was, in 1824, the first genus of non-avian dinosaur to be validly named. The [[type species]] is ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'', named in 1827. In 1842, ''Megalosaurus'' was one of three genera on which [[Richard Owen]] based his [[Dinosauria]]. On Owen's directions a model was made as one of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]], which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Subsequently, over fifty other species would be classified under the genus, originally because dinosaurs were not well known, but even during the 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to ''M. bucklandii'', which is the only true ''Megalosaurus'' species. Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build.\n\nThe first naturalists who investigated ''Megalosaurus'' mistook it for a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded that it was no longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing ''Megalosaurus'' with its direct relatives in the [[Megalosauridae]], were able to obtain a more accurate picture. ''Megalosaurus'' was about six metres long, weighing about seven hundred kilogrammes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. ''Megalosaurus'' had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n\n===\"Scrotum humanum\"===\n[[File:Scrotum humanum.jpg|thumb|The cover of [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'', 1677 (right). Plot's illustration of the lower extremity of the femur dubbed \"Scrotum humanum\" (left)]]\n''Megalosaurus'' may have been the first [[dinosaur]], apart from modern birds, to be described in the scientific literature. The earliest possible fossil of the genus, from the [[Taynton Limestone Formation]], was the lower part of a [[femur]], discovered in the 17th century. It was originally described by Robert Plot as a thighbone of a [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[war elephant]], and then as a biblical giant.  Part of a bone was recovered from the [[Taynton Limestone Formation]] of [[Stonesfield]] limestone quarry, [[Oxfordshire]] in 1676. Sir Thomas Pennyson gave the fragment to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description and illustration in his ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'' in 1676.<ref name=\"plot1677\">{{cite journal |last=Plot |first=R. |year=1677 |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire, Being an Essay Toward the Natural History of England |journal=Mr. S.

Plot's engraving of the Cornwell bone was again used in a book by [[Richard Brookes]] in 1763. Brookes, in a caption, called it \"[[Scrotum]] humanum,\" apparently comparing its appearance to a pair of \"human [[testicle]]s\".<ref name=\"brookes1763\">{{cite journal |last=Brookes |first=R. |year=1763 |title=A New and Accurate System of Natural History: The Natural History of Waters, Earths, Stones, Fossils, and Minerals with their Virtues, Properties and Medicinal Uses, to which is added, the Method in which Linnaeus has treated these subjects |journal=J. Newberry |volume=5 |oclc=690730757 |page=364}}</ref> In 1970, paleontologist [[Beverly Halstead|Lambert Beverly Halstead]] pointed out that the similarity of ''Scrotum humanum'' to a modern species name, a so-called Linnaean \"[[binomen]]\" that has two parts, was not a coincidence. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], had in the eighteenth century not merely devised a system for naming living creatures, but also for classifying geological objects. The book by Brookes was all about applying this latter system to curious stones found in England. According to Halstead, Brookes thus had deliberately used [[binomial nomenclature]], and had in fact indicated the possible [[type specimen]] of a new biological genus. According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), the name ''Scrotum humanum'' in principle had priority over ''Megalosaurus'' because it was published first. That Brookes understood that the stone did not actually represent a pair of petrified testicles was irrelevant. Merely the fact that the name had not been used in subsequent literature meant that it could be removed from competition for priority, because the ICZN states that if a name has never been considered valid after 1899, it can be made a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'', an invalid \"forgotten name\".<ref name=\"halstead1970\">{{cite journal |last=Halstead |first=L.

Sarjeant submitted a petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] to formally suppress the name ''Scrotum'' in favour of ''Megalosaurus''. He wrote that the supposed junior synonym ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' should be made a [[conserved name]] to ensure its priority. However, the Executive Secretary of the ICZN at the time, Philip K. Tubbs, did not consider the petition to be admissible, concluding that the term \"Scrotum humanum\", published merely as a label for an illustration, did not constitute the valid creation of a new name, and stated that there was no evidence it was ever intended as such. Furthermore, the partial femur was too incomplete to definitely be referred to ''Megalosaurus'' and not a different, contemporary theropod.<ref name=halstead1993>{{Cite journal|last1=Halstead |first1=L.

According to an hypothesis published by [[science historian]] [[Robert Gunther|Robert William Theodor Gunther]] in 1925, among them was a partial lower jaw of ''Megalosaurus'', acquired in October 1797 by [[Christopher Pegge]] for [[\u00a3sd|10s.6d.]] and added to the collection of the [[Anatomy School]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church college]].<ref name=\"gunter1925\">{{cite journal |last=Gunther |first=R.

In 1815, [[John Kidd (chemist)|John Kidd]] reported the find of bones of giant tetrapods, again at the [[Stonesfield]] quarry.

Buckland also studied a lower jaw, according to Gunther the one bought by Pegge. Buckland did not know to what animal the bones belonged but, in 1818, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[French people|French]] comparative anatomist [[Georges Cuvier]] visited Buckland in Oxford and realised that they were those of a giant [[lizard]]-like creature. Buckland further studied the remains with his friend [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] who in 1821 referred to them as the \"Huge Lizard\". In 1822 Buckland and Conybeare, in a joint article to be included in Cuvier's ''Ossemens'', intended to provide scientific names for both gigantic lizard-like creatures known at the time: the remains found near [[Maastricht]] would be named ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' \u2013 then seen as a land-dwelling animal \u2013 while for the British lizard Conybeare had devised the name ''Megalosaurus'', from the Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, ''megas'', \"large\".

Because they represented several individuals, the described fossils formed a [[syntype]] series. By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based. In 1990, [[Ralph Molnar]] chose the famous [[dentary]] (front part of the lower jaw), '''OUM J13505''', as such a [[lectotype]].<ref name=\"molnar1990\">Molnar, R.E.; Seriozha M.K. & Dong Z.

He considered ''Megalosaurus'' to be a quadruped. He thought it was an \"amphibian\", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind ''Megalosaurus'' resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to ''[[Iguanodon]]'', or at least some [[Iguanodontidae|iguanodontid]], but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to ''Megalosaurus'' also. Even taking into account the effects of [[allometry]], heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of ''Megalosaurus'' at sixty to seventy feet.<ref name=\"buckland1824\"/> The existence of ''Megalosaurus'' posed some problems for Christian [[orthodoxy]], which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through [[Original Sin]], which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a [[pre-Adamism|pre-Adamitic]] phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'' that ''Megalosaurus'' had played a beneficial r\u00f4le in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, \"to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering\".<ref name=\"buckland1836\">{{cite journal|author=Buckland, W.|year=1836|title=Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology|journal=W.

In reaction, on 2 August 1841 [[Richard Owen]] during a lecture to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] claimed that certain prehistoric reptilian groups had already attained the organisational level of present mammals, implying there had been no progress. Owen presented three examples of such higher level reptiles: ''Iguanodon'', ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'' and ''Megalosaurus''. For these, the \"lizard model\" was entirely abandoned: they would have had an upright stance and a high metabolism. This also meant that earlier size estimates had been exaggerated. By simply adding the known length of the vertebrae, instead of extrapolating from a lizard, Owen arrived at a total body length for ''Megalosaurus'' of thirty feet. In the printed version of the lecture published in 1842, Owen united the three reptiles into a separate group: the Dinosauria. ''Megalosaurus'' was thus one of the three original dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Owen1842\">{{cite journal|author=Owen, R.|year=1842|title=Report on British fossil reptiles, part II|journal=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science|volume=11|pages=32\u201337|url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_108440_1842reportonbritishfossilrepti9999}}</ref>\n[[File:Humped Megalosaurus.jpg|thumb|Von Meyer's restoration of ''Megalosaurus'' from before 1897; showing it bipedal with long neural spines]] \nIn 1852, [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] was commissioned to build a life-sized concrete model of ''Megalosaurus'' for the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park]] in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked under the direction of Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been a mammal-like quadruped. The sculpture in Crystal Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump on the shoulders and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s.

In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal.

It was bipedal, the horizontal torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a [[carnivore]], its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey.<ref name=\"Benton, Michael J, Prehistoric Life\">{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2012 |title=Prehistoric Life |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9 |page=259}}</ref> The skeleton of ''Megalosaurus'' is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of ''Torvosaurus'', a close relative.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Skull and lower jaws===\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi tooth 2.jpg|thumb|left|Referred tooth of ''M. bucklandii''.]]\nThe skull of ''Megalosaurus'' is poorly known. The discovered skull elements are generally rather large in relation to the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that ''Megalosaurus'' had an uncommonly large head. The [[praemaxilla]] is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the [[maxilla]] was short. In the depression around the [[antorbital fenestra]] to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the ''fenestra maxillaris''. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty ''denticula'' per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13\u201314/13\u201314. The [[jugal bone]] is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an [[Air sacs|air sac]] in the [[nasal bone]]. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate [[autapomorphy]].<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi.jpg|thumb|Cast of the lower jaw]] \nThe lower jaw is rather robust. It is also straight in top view, without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the [[mandibula]], were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired to have been the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with ''Torvosaurus''), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by ''[[Piatnitzkysaurus]]''. The [[surangular]] has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a ''foramen surangulare posterior'', but a second ''foramen surangulare anterior'' to the front of it is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Vertebral column===\n[[File:Megalosaurus sacrum (39971421271).jpg|left|thumb|OUM J13576, an articulated sacrum]] \nAlthough the exact numbers are unknown, the [[vertebral column]] of ''Megalosaurus'' was probably divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as is common for basal [[Tetanurae]].<ref name=weishampel04/>\n\nThe Stonesfield Slate material contains no neck vertebrae; but a single broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large [[Vertebral column#Dinosaurs|pleurocoels]], pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly [[Vertebral column#Classification|opisthocoelous]], with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the [[diapophysis]], the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a [[hyposphene]]\u2013[[hypantrum]] complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests the presence of a crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing more than half of the total vertebral height.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Appendicular skeleton===\n[[File:Megalosaurus femur.jpg|thumb|upright|Lithograph of the femur, from a posterior (left) and medial view (right). Work by J. Erxleben in the 1800s]]\nThe [[shoulderblade]] or [[scapula]] is short and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves slightly to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes about half of the shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The [[coracoid]] is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a [[scapulocoracoid]], lacking a visible [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]]. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval [[foramen]] but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\nThe [[humerus]] is very robust with strongly expanded upper and lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals about half of the total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular [[deltopectoral crest]] is present, the attachment for the ''[[Musculus pectoralis major]]'' and the ''[[Musculus deltoideus]]''. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The [[ulna]] is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large [[olecranon]], the attachment process for the ''[[Musculus triceps brachii]]''. [[Radius (bone)|Radius]], wrist and hand are unknown.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus pelvis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lithograph of the Ilium. Work from the 1800s drawn by J. Erxleben]]\nIn the pelvis, the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] is long and low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is triangular and rather short; at the front end there is a small drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the ''[[Musculus iliofemoralis]]'', the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the ''[[Musculus caudofemoralis brevis]]''. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus can be seen as a separate \"medial blade\" that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally thick bony skirt at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable \"foot\" with a convex lower profile.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus right tibia (& left metatarsals).jpg|thumb|Tibia and metatarsals]]\nThe thighbone is straight in front view. Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20\u00b0 to the front. The [[greater trochanter]] is relatively wide and separated from the robust [[lesser trochanter]] in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At the lower end of the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the [[condyle]]s. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The [[shinbone]], or ''tibia'', is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the [[Talus bone|astragalus]]. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth [[metatarsals]] are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Diagnosis===\n[[File:Megalosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|Modern restoration of ''Megalosaurus'', with mostly hypothetical head.]]\nFor decades after its discovery, ''Megalosaurus'' was seen by researchers as the definitive or typical large carnivorous dinosaur. As a result, it began to function as a \"wastebasket taxon\", and many large or small carnivorous dinosaurs from Europe and elsewhere were assigned to the genus. This slowly changed during the 20th century, when it became common to restrict the genus to fossils found in the middle Jurassic of England. Further restriction occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, researchers such as [[Ronan Allain]] and [[Dan Chure]] suggesting that the Stonesfield Slate fossils perhaps belonged to several, possibly not directly related, species of theropod dinosaur. Subsequent research seemed to confirm this hypothesis, and the genus ''Megalosaurus'' and species ''M. bucklandii'' became generally regarded as limited to the taxon having produced the lectotype, the dentary of the lower jaw. Furthermore, several researchers failed to find any characteristics in that jaw that could be used to distinguish ''Megalosaurus'' from its relatives, which would mean the genus were a ''nomen dubium''.<ref name=bensonetal2008>{{cite journal|year=2008|title=The taxonomic status of ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire, UK|journal=Palaeontology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=419\u2013424|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2008.00751.x|author1=Benson, R.B.J. |author2=Barrett, P.M. |author3=Powell, H.P. |author4=Norman, D.B. |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref> However, a comprehensive study by Roger Benson and colleagues in 2008, and several related analyses published in subsequent years, overturned the previous consensus by identifying several [[autapomorphies]], or unique distinguishing characteristics, in the lower jaw that could be used to separate ''Megalosaurus'' from other megalosaurids.<ref name=bensonetal2008/>\n\nVarious distinguishing traits of the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, of the lower jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most [[parsimonious]] to assume that the Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed in other parts of the skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal.

Although fossils from other areas have been assigned to the genus, the only certain remains of ''Megalosaurus'' come from [[Oxfordshire]] and date to the late [[Middle Jurassic]].\n\n''Megalosaurus'' was, in 1824, the first genus of non-avian dinosaur to be validly named. The [[type species]] is ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'', named in 1827. In 1842, ''Megalosaurus'' was one of three genera on which [[Richard Owen]] based his [[Dinosauria]]. On Owen's directions a model was made as one of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs]], which greatly increased the public interest for prehistoric reptiles. Subsequently, over fifty other species would be classified under the genus, originally because dinosaurs were not well known, but even during the 20th century after many dinosaurs had been discovered. Today it is understood these additional species were not directly related to ''M. bucklandii'', which is the only true ''Megalosaurus'' species. Because a complete skeleton of it has never been found, much is still unclear about its build.\n\nThe first naturalists who investigated ''Megalosaurus'' mistook it for a gigantic lizard of twenty metres length. In 1842, Owen concluded that it was no longer than nine metres, standing on upright legs. He still thought it was a quadruped, though. Modern scientists, by comparing ''Megalosaurus'' with its direct relatives in the [[Megalosauridae]], were able to obtain a more accurate picture. ''Megalosaurus'' was about six metres long, weighing about seven hundred kilogrammes. It was bipedal, walking on stout hindlimbs, its horizontal torso balanced by a horizontal tail. Its forelimbs were short, though very robust. ''Megalosaurus'' had a rather large head, equipped with long curved teeth. It was generally a robust and heavily muscled animal.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n\n===\"Scrotum humanum\"===\n[[File:Scrotum humanum.jpg|thumb|The cover of [[Robert Plot]]'s ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'', 1677 (right). Plot's illustration of the lower extremity of the femur dubbed \"Scrotum humanum\" (left)]]\n''Megalosaurus'' may have been the first [[dinosaur]], apart from modern birds, to be described in the scientific literature. The earliest possible fossil of the genus, from the [[Taynton Limestone Formation]], was the lower part of a [[femur]], discovered in the 17th century. It was originally described by Robert Plot as a thighbone of a [[Roman empire|Roman]] [[war elephant]], and then as a biblical giant.  Part of a bone was recovered from the [[Taynton Limestone Formation]] of [[Stonesfield]] limestone quarry, [[Oxfordshire]] in 1676. Sir Thomas Pennyson gave the fragment to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description and illustration in his ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'' in 1676.<ref name=\"plot1677\">{{cite journal |last=Plot |first=R. |year=1677 |title=The Natural History of Oxford-shire, Being an Essay Toward the Natural History of England |journal=Mr. S.

Plot's engraving of the Cornwell bone was again used in a book by [[Richard Brookes]] in 1763. Brookes, in a caption, called it \"[[Scrotum]] humanum,\" apparently comparing its appearance to a pair of \"human [[testicle]]s\".<ref name=\"brookes1763\">{{cite journal |last=Brookes |first=R. |year=1763 |title=A New and Accurate System of Natural History: The Natural History of Waters, Earths, Stones, Fossils, and Minerals with their Virtues, Properties and Medicinal Uses, to which is added, the Method in which Linnaeus has treated these subjects |journal=J. Newberry |volume=5 |oclc=690730757 |page=364}}</ref> In 1970, paleontologist [[Beverly Halstead|Lambert Beverly Halstead]] pointed out that the similarity of ''Scrotum humanum'' to a modern species name, a so-called Linnaean \"[[binomen]]\" that has two parts, was not a coincidence. [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], the founder of modern [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], had in the eighteenth century not merely devised a system for naming living creatures, but also for classifying geological objects. The book by Brookes was all about applying this latter system to curious stones found in England. According to Halstead, Brookes thus had deliberately used [[binomial nomenclature]], and had in fact indicated the possible [[type specimen]] of a new biological genus. According to the rules of the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]] (ICZN), the name ''Scrotum humanum'' in principle had priority over ''Megalosaurus'' because it was published first. That Brookes understood that the stone did not actually represent a pair of petrified testicles was irrelevant. Merely the fact that the name had not been used in subsequent literature meant that it could be removed from competition for priority, because the ICZN states that if a name has never been considered valid after 1899, it can be made a ''[[nomen oblitum]]'', an invalid \"forgotten name\".<ref name=\"halstead1970\">{{cite journal |last=Halstead |first=L.

Sarjeant submitted a petition to the [[International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature]] to formally suppress the name ''Scrotum'' in favour of ''Megalosaurus''. He wrote that the supposed junior synonym ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' should be made a [[conserved name]] to ensure its priority. However, the Executive Secretary of the ICZN at the time, Philip K. Tubbs, did not consider the petition to be admissible, concluding that the term \"Scrotum humanum\", published merely as a label for an illustration, did not constitute the valid creation of a new name, and stated that there was no evidence it was ever intended as such. Furthermore, the partial femur was too incomplete to definitely be referred to ''Megalosaurus'' and not a different, contemporary theropod.<ref name=halstead1993>{{Cite journal|last1=Halstead |first1=L.

According to an hypothesis published by [[science historian]] [[Robert Gunther|Robert William Theodor Gunther]] in 1925, among them was a partial lower jaw of ''Megalosaurus'', acquired in October 1797 by [[Christopher Pegge]] for [[\u00a3sd|10s.6d.]] and added to the collection of the [[Anatomy School]] of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church college]].<ref name=\"gunter1925\">{{cite journal |last=Gunther |first=R.

In 1815, [[John Kidd (chemist)|John Kidd]] reported the find of bones of giant tetrapods, again at the [[Stonesfield]] quarry.

Buckland also studied a lower jaw, according to Gunther the one bought by Pegge. Buckland did not know to what animal the bones belonged but, in 1818, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[French people|French]] comparative anatomist [[Georges Cuvier]] visited Buckland in Oxford and realised that they were those of a giant [[lizard]]-like creature. Buckland further studied the remains with his friend [[William Conybeare (geologist)|William Conybeare]] who in 1821 referred to them as the \"Huge Lizard\". In 1822 Buckland and Conybeare, in a joint article to be included in Cuvier's ''Ossemens'', intended to provide scientific names for both gigantic lizard-like creatures known at the time: the remains found near [[Maastricht]] would be named ''[[Mosasaurus]]'' \u2013 then seen as a land-dwelling animal \u2013 while for the British lizard Conybeare had devised the name ''Megalosaurus'', from the Greek \u03bc\u03ad\u03b3\u03b1\u03c2, ''megas'', \"large\".

By modern standards, from these a single specimen has to be selected to serve as the type specimen on which the name is based.

He considered ''Megalosaurus'' to be a quadruped. He thought it was an \"amphibian\", i.e. an animal capable of both swimming in the sea and walking on land. Generally, in his mind ''Megalosaurus'' resembled a gigantic lizard, but Buckland already understood from the form of the thighbone head that the legs were not so much sprawling as held rather upright. In the original description of 1824, Buckland repeated Cuvier's size estimate that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been forty feet long with the weight of a seven foot tall elephant. However, this had been based on the remains present at Oxford. Buckland had also been hurried into naming his new reptile by a visit he had made to the fossil collection of Mantell, who during the lecture announced to have acquired a fossil thighbone of enormous magnitude, twice as long as that just described. Today, this is known to have belonged to ''[[Iguanodon]]'', or at least some [[Iguanodontidae|iguanodontid]], but at the time both men assumed this bone belonged to ''Megalosaurus'' also. Even taking into account the effects of [[allometry]], heavier animals having relatively stouter bones, Buckland was forced in the printed version of his lecture to estimate the maximum length of ''Megalosaurus'' at sixty to seventy feet.<ref name=\"buckland1824\"/> The existence of ''Megalosaurus'' posed some problems for Christian [[orthodoxy]], which typically held that suffering and death had only come into the world through [[Original Sin]], which seemed irreconcilable with the presence of a gigantic devouring reptile during a [[pre-Adamism|pre-Adamitic]] phase of history. Buckland rejected the usual solution, that such carnivores would originally have been peaceful vegetarians, as infantile and claimed in one of the ''[[Bridgewater Treatises]]'' that ''Megalosaurus'' had played a beneficial r\u00f4le in creation by ending the lives of old and ill animals, \"to diminish the aggregate amount of animal suffering\".<ref name=\"buckland1836\">{{cite journal|author=Buckland, W.|year=1836|title=Geology and Mineralogy considered with reference to Natural Theology|journal=W.

In reaction, on 2 August 1841 [[Richard Owen]] during a lecture to the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] claimed that certain prehistoric reptilian groups had already attained the organisational level of present mammals, implying there had been no progress. Owen presented three examples of such higher level reptiles: ''Iguanodon'', ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'' and ''Megalosaurus''. For these, the \"lizard model\" was entirely abandoned: they would have had an upright stance and a high metabolism. This also meant that earlier size estimates had been exaggerated. By simply adding the known length of the vertebrae, instead of extrapolating from a lizard, Owen arrived at a total body length for ''Megalosaurus'' of thirty feet. In the printed version of the lecture published in 1842, Owen united the three reptiles into a separate group: the Dinosauria. ''Megalosaurus'' was thus one of the three original dinosaurs.<ref name=\"Owen1842\">{{cite journal|author=Owen, R.|year=1842|title=Report on British fossil reptiles, part II|journal=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science|volume=11|pages=32\u201337|url=https://archive.org/details/cbarchive_108440_1842reportonbritishfossilrepti9999}}</ref>\n[[File:Humped Megalosaurus.jpg|thumb|Von Meyer's restoration of ''Megalosaurus'' from before 1897; showing it bipedal with long neural spines]] \nIn 1852, [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]] was commissioned to build a life-sized concrete model of ''Megalosaurus'' for the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|exhibition of prehistoric animals at the Crystal Palace Park]] in Sydenham, where it remains to this day. Hawkins worked under the direction of Owen and the statue reflected Owen's ideas that ''Megalosaurus'' would have been a mammal-like quadruped. The sculpture in Crystal Palace Park shows a conspicuous hump on the shoulders and it has been suggested this was inspired by a set of high vertebral spines acquired by Owen in the early 1850s.

In 1870, near Oxford, the type specimen of ''[[Eustreptospondylus]]'' was discovered - the first reasonably intact skeleton of a large theropod. It was clearly bipedal.

It was bipedal, the horizontal torso being balanced by a long horizontal tail. The hindlimbs were long and strong with three forward-facing weight-bearing toes, the forelimbs relatively short but exceptionally robust and probably carrying three digits. Being a [[carnivore]], its large elongated head bore long dagger-like teeth to slice the flesh of its prey.<ref name=\"Benton, Michael J, Prehistoric Life\">{{cite book |last=Benton |first=Michael J. |year=2012 |title=Prehistoric Life |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9 |page=259}}</ref> The skeleton of ''Megalosaurus'' is highly ossified, indicating a robust and muscular animal, though the lower leg was not as heavily built as that of ''Torvosaurus'', a close relative.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Skull and lower jaws===\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi tooth 2.jpg|thumb|left|Referred tooth of ''M. bucklandii''.]]\nThe skull of ''Megalosaurus'' is poorly known. The discovered skull elements are generally rather large in relation to the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that ''Megalosaurus'' had an uncommonly large head. The [[praemaxilla]] is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the [[maxilla]] was short. In the depression around the [[antorbital fenestra]] to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the ''fenestra maxillaris''. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty ''denticula'' per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13\u201314/13\u201314. The [[jugal bone]] is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably hollowed out by an outgrowth of an [[Air sacs|air sac]] in the [[nasal bone]]. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate [[autapomorphy]].<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus bucklandi.jpg|thumb|Cast of the lower jaw]] \nThe lower jaw is rather robust. It is also straight in top view, without much expansion at the jaw tip, suggesting the lower jaws as a pair, the [[mandibula]], were narrow. Several traits in 2008 identified as autapomorphies, later transpired to have been the result of damage. However, a unique combination of traits is present in the wide longitudinal groove on the outer side (shared with ''Torvosaurus''), the small third dentary tooth and a vascular channel, below the row of interdental plates, that only is closed from the fifth tooth position onwards. The number of dentary teeth was probably thirteen or fourteen, though the preserved damaged specimens show at most eleven tooth sockets. The interdental plates have smooth inner sides, whereas those of the maxilla are vertically grooved; the same combination is shown by ''[[Piatnitzkysaurus]]''. The [[surangular]] has no bony shelf, or even ridge, on its outer side. There is laterally an oval opening present in front of the jaw joint, a ''foramen surangulare posterior'', but a second ''foramen surangulare anterior'' to the front of it is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Vertebral column===\n[[File:Megalosaurus sacrum (39971421271).jpg|left|thumb|OUM J13576, an articulated sacrum]] \nAlthough the exact numbers are unknown, the [[vertebral column]] of ''Megalosaurus'' was probably divided into ten neck vertebrae, thirteen dorsal vertebrae, five sacral vertebrae and fifty to sixty tail vertebrae, as is common for basal [[Tetanurae]].<ref name=weishampel04/>\n\nThe Stonesfield Slate material contains no neck vertebrae; but a single broken anterior cervical vertebra is known from the New Park Quarry, specimen BMNH R9674. The breakage reveals large internal air chambers. The vertebra is also otherwise heavily pneumatised, with large [[Vertebral column#Dinosaurs|pleurocoels]], pneumatic excavations, on its sides. The rear facet of the centrum is strongly concave. The neck ribs are short. The front dorsal vertebrae are slightly [[Vertebral column#Classification|opisthocoelous]], with convex front centrum facets and concave rear centrum facets. They are also deeply keeled, with the ridge on the underside representing about 50% of the total centrum height. The front dorsals perhaps have a pleurocoel above the [[diapophysis]], the lower rib joint process. The rear dorsal vertebrae, according to Benson, are not pneumatised. They are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets. They have secondary joint processes, forming a [[hyposphene]]\u2013[[hypantrum]] complex, the hyposphene having a triangular transverse cross-section. The height of the dorsal spines of the rear dorsals is unknown, but a high spine on a tail vertebra of the New Park Quarry material, specimen BMNH R9677, suggests the presence of a crest on the hip area. The spines of the five vertebrae of the sacrum form a supraneural plate, fused at the top. The undersides of the sacral vertebrae are rounded but the second sacral is keeled; normally it is the third or fourth sacral having a ridge. The sacral vertebrae seem not to be pneumatised but have excavations at their sides. The tail vertebrae are slightly amphicoelous, with hollow centrum facets on both the front and rear side. They have excavations at their sides and a longitudinal groove on the underside. The neural spines of the tail basis are transversely thin and tall, representing more than half of the total vertebral height.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Appendicular skeleton===\n[[File:Megalosaurus femur.jpg|thumb|upright|Lithograph of the femur, from a posterior (left) and medial view (right). Work by J. Erxleben in the 1800s]]\nThe [[shoulderblade]] or [[scapula]] is short and wide, its length about 6.8 times the minimum width; this is a rare and basal trait within Tetanurae. Its top curves slightly to the rear in side view. On the lower outer side of the blade a broad ridge is present, running from just below the shoulder joint to about midlength where it gradually merges with the blade surface. The middle front edge over about 30% of its length is thinned forming a slightly protruding crest. The scapula constitutes about half of the shoulder joint, which is oriented obliquely sideways and to below. The [[coracoid]] is in all known specimens fused with the scapula into a [[scapulocoracoid]], lacking a visible [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]]. The coracoid as such is an oval bone plate, with its longest side attached to the scapula. It is pierced by a large oval [[foramen]] but the usual boss for the attachment of the upper arm muscles is lacking.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\nThe [[humerus]] is very robust with strongly expanded upper and lower ends. Humerus specimen OUMNH J.13575 has a length of 388 millimetres. Its shaft circumference equals about half of the total humerus length. The humerus head continues to the front and the rear into large bosses, together forming a massive bone plate. On the front outer side of the shaft a large triangular [[deltopectoral crest]] is present, the attachment for the ''[[Musculus pectoralis major]]'' and the ''[[Musculus deltoideus]]''. It covers about the upper half of the shaft length, its apex positioned rather low. The [[ulna]] is extremely robust, for its absolute size more heavily built than with any other known member of the Tetanurae. The only known specimen, BMNH 36585, has a length of 232 millimetres and a minimal shaft circumference of 142 millimetres. The ulna is straight in front view and has a large [[olecranon]], the attachment process for the ''[[Musculus triceps brachii]]''. [[Radius (bone)|Radius]], wrist and hand are unknown.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus pelvis.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lithograph of the Ilium. Work from the 1800s drawn by J. Erxleben]]\nIn the pelvis, the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] is long and low, with a convex upper profile. Its front blade is triangular and rather short; at the front end there is a small drooping point, separated by a notch from the pubic peduncle. The rear blade is roughly rectangular. The outer side of the ilium is concave, serving as an attachment surface for the ''[[Musculus iliofemoralis]]'', the main thigh muscle. Above the hip joint, on this surface a low vertical ridge is present with conspicuous vertical grooves. The bottom of the rear blade is excavated by a narrow but deep trough forming a bony shelf for the attachment of the ''[[Musculus caudofemoralis brevis]]''. The outer side of the rear blade does not match the inner side, which thus can be seen as a separate \"medial blade\" that in side view is visible in two places: in the corner between outer side and the ischial peduncle and as a small surface behind the extreme rear tip of the outer side of the rear blade. The pubic bone is straight. The pubic bones of both pelvis halves are connected via narrow bony skirts that originated at a rather high position on the rear side and continued downwards to a point low on the front side of the shaft. The ischium is S-shaped in side view, showing at the transition point between the two curvatures a rough boss on the outer side. On the front edge of the ischial shaft an obturator process is present in the form of a low ridge, at its top separated from the shaft by a notch. To below, this ridge continues into an exceptionally thick bony skirt at the inner rear side of the shaft, covering over half of its length. Towards the end of the shaft, this skirt gradually merges with it. The shaft eventually ends in a sizeable \"foot\" with a convex lower profile.<ref name=benson2010/>\n[[File:Megalosaurus right tibia (& left metatarsals).jpg|thumb|Tibia and metatarsals]]\nThe thighbone is straight in front view. Seen from the same direction its head is perpendicular to the shaft, seen from above it is orientated 20\u00b0 to the front. The [[greater trochanter]] is relatively wide and separated from the robust [[lesser trochanter]] in front of it, by a fissure. At the front base of the lesser trochanter a low accessory trochanter is present. At the lower end of the thighbone a distinct front, extensor, groove separates the [[condyle]]s. At the upper inner side of this groove a rough area is present continuing inwards into a longitudinal ridge, a typical megalosauroid trait. The [[shinbone]], or ''tibia'', is relatively straight, slightly curving inwards. To below, its shaft progressively flattens from front to rear, resulting in a generally oval cross-section. For about an eighth of its length the front lower end of the shaft is covered by a vertical branch of the [[Talus bone|astragalus]]. Of the foot, only the second, third and fourth [[metatarsals]] are known, the bone elements that were connected to the three weight-bearing toes. They are straight and robust, showing ligament pits at their lower sides. The third metatarsal has no clear condyles at its lower end, resulting in a more flexible joint, allowing for a modicum of horizontal movement. The top inner side of the third metatarsal carries a unique ridge that fits into a groove along the top outer side of the second metatarsal, causing a tighter connection.<ref name=benson2010/>\n\n===Diagnosis===\n[[File:Megalosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|Modern restoration of ''Megalosaurus'', with mostly hypothetical head.]]\nFor decades after its discovery, ''Megalosaurus'' was seen by researchers as the definitive or typical large carnivorous dinosaur. As a result, it began to function as a \"wastebasket taxon\", and many large or small carnivorous dinosaurs from Europe and elsewhere were assigned to the genus. This slowly changed during the 20th century, when it became common to restrict the genus to fossils found in the middle Jurassic of England. Further restriction occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, researchers such as [[Ronan Allain]] and [[Dan Chure]] suggesting that the Stonesfield Slate fossils perhaps belonged to several, possibly not directly related, species of theropod dinosaur. Subsequent research seemed to confirm this hypothesis, and the genus ''Megalosaurus'' and species ''M. bucklandii'' became generally regarded as limited to the taxon having produced the lectotype, the dentary of the lower jaw. Furthermore, several researchers failed to find any characteristics in that jaw that could be used to distinguish ''Megalosaurus'' from its relatives, which would mean the genus were a ''nomen dubium''.<ref name=bensonetal2008>{{cite journal|year=2008|title=The taxonomic status of ''Megalosaurus bucklandii'' (Dinosauria, Theropoda) from the Middle Jurassic of Oxfordshire, UK|journal=Palaeontology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=419\u2013424|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4983.2008.00751.x|author1=Benson, R.B.J. |author2=Barrett, P.M. |author3=Powell, H.P. |author4=Norman, D.B. |lastauthoramp=yes }}</ref> However, a comprehensive study by Roger Benson and colleagues in 2008, and several related analyses published in subsequent years, overturned the previous consensus by identifying several [[autapomorphies]], or unique distinguishing characteristics, in the lower jaw that could be used to separate ''Megalosaurus'' from other megalosaurids.<ref name=bensonetal2008/>\n\nVarious distinguishing traits of the lower jaw have been established. The longitudinal groove on the outer surface of the dentary is wide. The third tooth socket of the dentary is not enlarged. Seen from above, the dentary is straight without an expanded jaw tip. The interdental plates, reinforcing the teeth from behind, of the lower jaw are tall. Benson also concluded it would be most [[parsimonious]] to assume that the Stonesfield Slate material represents a single species. If so, several additional distinctive traits can be observed in other parts of the skeleton. The low vertical ridge on the outer side of the ilium, above the hip joint, shows parallel vertical grooves. The bony skirts between the shafts of the ischia are thick and touch each other forming an almost flat surface. There is a boss present on the lower outer side of the ischium shaft with a rough surface. The underside of the second sacral vertebra has an angular longitudinal keel. A ridge on the upper side of the third metatarsal connected to a groove in the side of the second metatarsal. The middle of the front edge of the scapula forms a thin crest.<ref>Carrano (2012) p. 236</ref>\n\n==Phylogeny==\n[[File:Megalosaurus tibia.jpg|thumb|upright|Referred tibia, lateral view (left), posterior view (right).

Modern Howick draws much of its character from the succeeding waves of Asian Settlement that it has observed since New Zealand\u2019s immigration reforms of the 80s; With a strong Chinese New Zealander presence in the suburb\u2019s Business and Education communities. Due to the relatively numerous remaining heritage buildings and other historical remnants from its early European settlement past, it has been called \"perhaps Auckland's most historically conscious place. <ref name=SOLDIERS/>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Maori origins ===\nThe local [[iwi]] (M\u0101ori tribe) was the [[Ngai Tai]] people of [[Tainui]] descent. They had lived there for around 300 years with [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|pa]] (fortified villages) at Ohuia Rangi ([[Pigeon Mountain (New Zealand)|Pigeon Mountain]]), Te Waiarohia ([[Musick Point]]) and Tuwakamana ([[Cockle Bay, New Zealand|Cockle Bay]]).\n\n===Fencible settlement===\n[[File:NZ-Howick-Mainstreet.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Main Picton Street, with [[Stockade Hill, Howick|Stockade Hill]] in the distance.]]\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2016}}\nThe Howick, [[Pakuranga]], and Whitford areas were part of the Fairburn claim. [[William Thomas Fairburn]], with his wife and family, established a Church [[Missionary]] Society Mission Station at [[Maraetai]] in 1836. The local [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] insisted they buy the 40,000 acres (162&nbsp;km\u00b2) between the [[Tamaki River|Tamaki]] and Wairoa Rivers to prevent attack by the [[Ngapuhi]] and [[Waikato]] tribes. Fairburn bought the land with his life savings.<ref name=\"Fencibles\">R. Alexander G. Gibson. ''The Royal NZ Fencibles, 1847\u20131852''. A LaRoche. Deed.

The suburb was therefore established in 1847 as a [[fencibles|fencible]] settlement, where soldiers were given land with the implied understanding that in wartime, they would be raised as units to defend it (however, the eventual fighting a decade later used professional soldiers instead). A relatively large amount of the early features from this time have been retained.<ref name=SOLDIERS>{{cite news|title=Auckland: Soldiers of fortune|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/panmure/news/article.cfm?l_id=356&objectid=10667027|accessdate=5 February 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=26 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] welcomed the Fencibles to Howick and recognised the advantages of co-operation and trade.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fencibles try to settle|url=https://www.times.co.nz/howick-170-years/fencibles-try-settle|accessdate=1 January 2020|newspaper=Howick & Pakuranga Times|date=21 December 2017}}</ref> [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] labourers built the Fencibles cottages under [[Royal Engineers]] supervision, although it was noted that initially, the Europeans had to live in raupo huts, having been falsely promised that houses would already be available for them and their families.<ref name=SOLDIERS/> There were about 250 Fencibles in Howick. Local M\u0101ori had been taught to read and write by the Fairburn LMS missionaries at Maraetai. The Fencibles and their families were poor with no capital apart from a small number of officers. About half were Catholic and half Protestant. Quite a few of the adults were illiterate. 101 Howick fencibles served with their sons in the 1860s [[New Zealand Wars]].<ref name=\"Fencibles\"/>\n\nHowick's links to Auckland's pioneering and Fencible past has influenced its development and is also evident in the names of many streets. Others are significantly named for [[United Kingdom|British]] military heroes or battles. Bleakhouse (as in Bleakhouse Rd) was the name given to a Fencible officer's house built in Bleakhouse Rd for Surgeon-Captain [[John Bacot]] who became a magistrate in Howick.\n\nOther roads such as Bacot, Bell, Fencible Drive, Montressor Place and Sale Street, plus many others, also have Fencible connexions, e.g. [[Sir Robert Sale]] was one of the ships which brought the Fencibles to Auckland in the 19th century. Montressor Place was named for Captain Charles Henry Montressor-Smith who arrived in Howick with the First [[Battalion]] of Fencibles in 1847. He later moved to a property in neighbouring [[Pakuranga]], where his house, known as Bell House, still stands at the end of Bell Rd next to the [[Howick Historical Village]].\n[[File:NZ-Howick-Beach.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Howick Beach.]]\nMoore St was named after General Sir [[John Moore (British soldier)|John Moore]], a British military hero, who lived from 1761\u20131809. General Moore fought against [[Napoleon]] alongside [[Sir David Baird]] for whom Baird St was named and he (Moore) died at [[Battle of Corunna|Corunna]] during the [[Peninsular War]] whilst serving under the Duke of Wellington. At [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]] he was attended by Dr J. Bacot, father of the Howick Fencible doctor, who lived in Bleakhouse. Moore St was part of the original Fencible village and was sub-divided into one [[acre]] (4,000 m\u00b2) allotments down to Rodney St. People will, no doubt, recognise that Wellington and Nelson Sts spring from the most famous of British war heroes, [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and that Selwyn Rd takes its name from the first [[Bishop of New Zealand]], [[George Augustus Selwyn]].\n\nThen there are streets such as Granger Road named for John Granger, manager of the brickworks, which once stood at [[Little Bucklands Beach]] near the rock outcrop where the Bucklands Beach Centre board clubrooms now stand, before moving to [[Whitford, New Zealand|Whitford]]. Litten Rd and John Gill Rd are named after the former farmer and landowner families. An Irishman, John Gill, settled in Howick in the 1850s, and his family farmed the land that is now Cockle Bay and Shelly Park. Litten Road is the boundary of one of the old Gill-Litten farms. To the north of Picton Street, the main street of Howick is [[Stockade Hill Howick|Stockade Hill]]. In 1863 a field work was constructed on what is now called Stockade Hill, for the purpose of defending Auckland from M\u0101ori who might advance overland from the south, or by canoes from the [[Firth of Thames]]. The ditches of the stockade can still be seen today. In the centre is a war memorial where services are held each [[ANZAC Day]].\n\n[[File:All Saints Church Howick.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[All Saints Church (Howick)|All Saints Church]], Howick, New Zealand.

Later the centre of Howick shifted to Picton Street which is now the centre. It later became popular as a retirement and seaside holiday location.\n\nIn 1865 Howick became a road board district; in 1922 it was created an independent town district; and on 1 February 1952 it was constituted a borough with Elections for Mayor and Council being held on 22 March 1952.\n\nThe 1930s saw the construction of a concrete all-weather road running all the way from Howick through [[Pakuranga]] to [[Panmure, New Zealand|Panmure]]. This allowed the rapid passage of people and goods to and from Auckland. This concrete road can still be seen, in parts, on the highway between Howick and Pakuranga.\n\nFrom the late 1940s to the 1970s the Howick area experienced rapid growth, when in 1947, at its centenary, it had still been a town of only 1,500. Up until the 1980s Howick was surrounded on all sides by farmland, but as Auckland grew and new subdivisions were created Howick was consumed by urban sprawl.\n\nIn [[1989 local government reforms|1989 the local government reorganisation in New Zealand]] saw Howick become a ward within [[Manukau City]], with its Borough Council being replaced by a Community Board and Councillor representation.\n\nToday Howick is one of the more affluent seaside suburbs of the former Manukau City (now merged with [[Auckland Council|Auckland]]). It has some of the oldest buildings in the Auckland area, as well as the first parish church in Auckland ([[All Saints Church (Howick)|All Saints Church]]).\n\nIn July 2008 the community radio station, East FM (formerly Howick Village Radio), was established on 88.1 FM broadcasting over most of the eastern suburb and on 107.1 FM broadcasting into Botany, Flat Bush, and East Tamaki. Worldwide streaming is also available from their website. They have a variety of shows including some hosted by students from local schools.\n\n=== Asian Settlement ===\n\nFollowing the range of Immigration Reforms passed by New Zealand\u2019s parliament in the early 1980s, Howick alongside much of East-Auckland\u2019s suburban cluster observed a dramatic shift in its demographic makeup, as thousands of newly-arrived Asian Immigrants began to form settlements in the area; Altering the suburb\u2019s then predominating European character in their image, bringing with them Chinese academic and cultural institutions, Cherry Blossom lined streets, and new housing developments built on the principles of Feng-Shui.  \n\nThe congregation of Affluent Asian New Zealanders in Howick and Botany Downs did much to further feed into the narrative of the area as being a \u2018Wealthy Asian Enclave\u2019, which had started to arise as the presence of New Zealanders of other ethnicities begun to be eclipsed by the newly conceived Asian Character of  East Auckland.\n\nFo Guang Shan Temple in Howick stands as a monolithic symbol of Asian New Zealander relevance and legitimacy in the Greater Auckland Region.\n\n<br />\n\n==Howick electorate==\nFrom [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] and prior to the introduction of MMP in 1996, Howick had its own seat in Parliament, [[Howick (New Zealand electorate)|Howick]]; which had been created from part of the former [[Otara (New Zealand electorate)|Otara]] electorate.\n\nIn the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 general election]], due to the need to decrease the number of general electorates in order to ensure a sufficient number of seats were available for list MPs, the population centres formerly in the Howick seat were merged into the former separate seat of [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]].\n\nWhile making recommendations for the boundaries to apply in the 2008 general election, the Electoral Commission recently proposed to resurrect the Howick seat.  The planned seat would have taken in the population centres of Howick and [[Botany Downs]]-[[Dannemora, New Zealand|Dannemora]] but would have had the effect of splitting [[Bucklands Beach]] and [[Highland Park, New Zealand|Highland Park]] across two electorates.  Due to this, and the planned move to incorporate [[Panmure, New Zealand|Panmure]], [[Point England]] and [[Glen Innes, New Zealand|Glen Innes]] into the neighbouring [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]] seat, the Commission received a significant number of objections from [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]] residents.  The Commission eventually adopted the recommendation of Objector N17/30 in keeping the Howick suburb in [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]] and renaming the new seat [[Botany Downs, New Zealand|Botany]], with a corresponding shift in centre of gravity to the new suburb of [[Flat Bush]].\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/mapping/final_report/scheduleb.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016103736/http://www.elections.org.nz/mapping/final_report/scheduleb.html |archive-date=16 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/voters/find-my-electorate|title=Find my Electorate|website=Electoral Commission|accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Mayors of Howick==\n*1952\u20131953 [[W E LaRoche]]\n*1953\u20131963 Sir [[William Stevenson (New Zealand politician, born 1901)|William Stevenson]]\n*1965\u20131966 J.

This is due to the proximity and influence of the surrounding ocean curtailing any extremes in temperature. Air temperatures below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0}} and above {{convert|29|\u00b0C|0}} are rare, both being recorded on average only once every 2\u20133 years. The maximum recorded temperature is {{convert|30.7|\u00b0C|0}} and minimum {{convert|-1.4|\u00b0C|0}}. Average summer daily maximum & minimum temperatures are around {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0}} and {{convert|16|\u00b0C|0}}. Humidity in summer can at times be oppressive and tropical-like with [[Dew Point]] temperatures occasionally exceeding {{convert|21|\u00b0C|0}}. Average winter daily maximum & minimum temperatures are around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0}} and {{convert|7|\u00b0C|0}}. Mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.4|\u00b0C|0}}.\n\n===Rainfall===\nRainfall is usually plentiful throughout the year averaging around {{convert|1250|mm|2}} however the winter months on average see more rain than the summer months. Between December and April, storms from the tropics can occasionally pass through or near the region bringing with it heavy rain. The highest 30-day rainfall of {{convert|417.2|mm|2}} was recorded during the period 7 March 2017 \u2013 5 April 2017 and includes the record highest daily rainfall of {{convert|93|mm|2}} on 4 April 2017. The most consecutive wet days (\u22651&nbsp;mm) is 12 recorded in the period 26 July 2016 \u2013 6 August 2016. The lowest 30-day rainfall of {{convert|2.2|mm|2}} was recorded in the period 15 January 2020 - 13 March 2020 and the most consecutive non-wet days (<1&nbsp;mm) is 29 recorded 2 January 2015 \u2013 30 January 2015. There are no recorded instances of snowfall. Occasionally droughts do occur during the warmer months, for example the 3 months Jan-Mar 2013 saw only {{convert|51|mm|2}} of rainfall, and the 5 months Nov 2019 - Mar 2020 saw only {{convert|120|mm|2}} of rainfall.\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Howick (Jan 2010 - Mar 2020)\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n<!-- Record high temperatures -->\n|Jan record high C = 30.2\n|Feb record high C = 30.7\n|Mar record high C = 27.4\n|Apr record high C = 25.4\n|May record high C = 22.6\n|Jun record high C = 19.3\n|Jul record high C = 18.7\n|Aug record high C = 19.4\n|Sep record high C = 21.6\n|Oct record high C = 22.6\n|Nov record high C = 26.7\n|Dec record high C = 28.9\n|year record high C = 30.7\n<!-- Average high temperatures -->\n|Jan high C = 24.6\n|Feb high C = 25.2\n|Mar high C = 23.6\n|Apr high C = 20.9\n|May high C = 18.1\n|Jun high C = 15.6\n|Jul high C = 14.8\n|Aug high C = 15.5\n|Sep high C = 16.9\n|Oct high C = 18.8\n|Nov high C = 20.9\n|Dec high C = 23.1\n|year high C = 19.8\n<!-- Mean daily temperature -->\n|Jan mean C = 19.9\n|Feb mean C = 20.3\n|Mar mean C = 18.8\n|Apr mean C = 16.4\n|May mean C = 13.9\n|Jun mean C = 11.7\n|Jul mean C = 10.6\n|Aug mean C = 11.4\n|Sep mean C = 12.7\n|Oct mean C = 14.3\n|Nov mean C = 16.1\n|Dec mean C = 18.5\n|year mean C = 15.4\n|<!-- Average low temperatures -->\n|Jan low C = 15.7\n|Feb low C = 16.1\n|Mar low C = 14.6\n|Apr low C = 12.4\n|May low C = 10.1\n|Jun low C = 8.2\n|Jul low C = 7.0\n|Aug low C = 7.7\n|Sep low C = 9.0\n|Oct low C = 10.3\n|Nov low C = 12.0\n|Dec low C = 14.7\n|year low C = 11.5\n<!-- Record low temperatures -->\n|Jan record low C = 9.1\n|Feb record low C = 8.5\n|Mar record low C = 6.3\n|Apr record low C = 4.8\n|May record low C = 0.3\n|Jun record low C = -0.4\n|Jul record low C = -1.4\n|Aug record low C = 0.2\n|Sep record low C = 0.1\n|Oct record low C = 3.1\n|Nov record low C = 5.3\n|Dec record low C = 7.4\n|year record low C = -1.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 67.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 62.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 97.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 105.5\n|May precipitation mm = 123.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 140.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 141.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 136.8\n|Sep precipitation mm = 127.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 78.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 64.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 93.2\n|year precipitation mm = 1236.7\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 6.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 7.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 7.7\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.9\n|May precipitation days = 13.1\n|Jun precipitation days = 14.0\n|Jul precipitation days = 14.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 16.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 15.3\n|Oct precipitation days = 11.5\n|Nov precipitation days = 8.8\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.7\n|year precipitation days = 133.7\n|\n|source 1 = Howick Weather Station<ref name=\"howickweather\">{{cite web\n| url = https://howickweather.co.nz/history-climate\n| title = Howick Weather &#124;

Modern Howick draws much of its character from the succeeding waves of Asian Settlement that it has observed since New Zealand\u2019s immigration reforms of the 80s; With a strong Chinese New Zealander presence in the suburb\u2019s Business and Education communities. Due to the relatively numerous remaining heritage buildings and other historical remnants from its early European settlement past, it has been called \"perhaps Auckland's most historically conscious place. <ref name=SOLDIERS/>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Maori origins ===\nThe local [[iwi]] (M\u0101ori tribe) was the [[Ngai Tai]] people of [[Tainui]] descent. They had lived there for around 300 years with [[P\u0101 (M\u0101ori)|pa]] (fortified villages) at Ohuia Rangi ([[Pigeon Mountain (New Zealand)|Pigeon Mountain]]), Te Waiarohia ([[Musick Point]]) and Tuwakamana ([[Cockle Bay, New Zealand|Cockle Bay]]).\n\n===Fencible settlement===\n[[File:NZ-Howick-Mainstreet.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Main Picton Street, with [[Stockade Hill, Howick|Stockade Hill]] in the distance.]]\n{{more citations needed|date=March 2016}}\nThe Howick, [[Pakuranga]], and Whitford areas were part of the Fairburn claim. [[William Thomas Fairburn]], with his wife and family, established a Church [[Missionary]] Society Mission Station at [[Maraetai]] in 1836. The local [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] insisted they buy the 40,000 acres (162&nbsp;km\u00b2) between the [[Tamaki River|Tamaki]] and Wairoa Rivers to prevent attack by the [[Ngapuhi]] and [[Waikato]] tribes. Fairburn bought the land with his life savings.<ref name=\"Fencibles\">R. Alexander G. Gibson. ''The Royal NZ Fencibles, 1847\u20131852''. A LaRoche. Deed.

The suburb was therefore established in 1847 as a [[fencibles|fencible]] settlement, where soldiers were given land with the implied understanding that in wartime, they would be raised as units to defend it (however, the eventual fighting a decade later used professional soldiers instead). A relatively large amount of the early features from this time have been retained.<ref name=SOLDIERS>{{cite news|title=Auckland: Soldiers of fortune|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/panmure/news/article.cfm?l_id=356&objectid=10667027|accessdate=5 February 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=26 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] welcomed the Fencibles to Howick and recognised the advantages of co-operation and trade.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fencibles try to settle|url=https://www.times.co.nz/howick-170-years/fencibles-try-settle|accessdate=1 January 2020|newspaper=Howick & Pakuranga Times|date=21 December 2017}}</ref> [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] labourers built the Fencibles cottages under [[Royal Engineers]] supervision, although it was noted that initially, the Europeans had to live in raupo huts, having been falsely promised that houses would already be available for them and their families.<ref name=SOLDIERS/> There were about 250 Fencibles in Howick. Local M\u0101ori had been taught to read and write by the Fairburn LMS missionaries at Maraetai. The Fencibles and their families were poor with no capital apart from a small number of officers. About half were Catholic and half Protestant. Quite a few of the adults were illiterate. 101 Howick fencibles served with their sons in the 1860s [[New Zealand Wars]].<ref name=\"Fencibles\"/>\n\nHowick's links to Auckland's pioneering and Fencible past has influenced its development and is also evident in the names of many streets. Others are significantly named for [[United Kingdom|British]] military heroes or battles. Bleakhouse (as in Bleakhouse Rd) was the name given to a Fencible officer's house built in Bleakhouse Rd for Surgeon-Captain [[John Bacot]] who became a magistrate in Howick.\n\nOther roads such as Bacot, Bell, Fencible Drive, Montressor Place and Sale Street, plus many others, also have Fencible connexions, e.g. [[Sir Robert Sale]] was one of the ships which brought the Fencibles to Auckland in the 19th century. Montressor Place was named for Captain Charles Henry Montressor-Smith who arrived in Howick with the First [[Battalion]] of Fencibles in 1847. He later moved to a property in neighbouring [[Pakuranga]], where his house, known as Bell House, still stands at the end of Bell Rd next to the [[Howick Historical Village]].\n[[File:NZ-Howick-Beach.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Howick Beach.]]\nMoore St was named after General Sir [[John Moore (British soldier)|John Moore]], a British military hero, who lived from 1761\u20131809. General Moore fought against [[Napoleon]] alongside [[Sir David Baird]] for whom Baird St was named and he (Moore) died at [[Battle of Corunna|Corunna]] during the [[Peninsular War]] whilst serving under the Duke of Wellington. At [[A Coru\u00f1a|Corunna]] he was attended by Dr J. Bacot, father of the Howick Fencible doctor, who lived in Bleakhouse. Moore St was part of the original Fencible village and was sub-divided into one [[acre]] (4,000 m\u00b2) allotments down to Rodney St. People will, no doubt, recognise that Wellington and Nelson Sts spring from the most famous of British war heroes, [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Lord Nelson]] and the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]] and that Selwyn Rd takes its name from the first [[Bishop of New Zealand]], [[George Augustus Selwyn]].\n\nThen there are streets such as Granger Road named for John Granger, manager of the brickworks, which once stood at [[Little Bucklands Beach]] near the rock outcrop where the Bucklands Beach Centre board clubrooms now stand, before moving to [[Whitford, New Zealand|Whitford]]. Litten Rd and John Gill Rd are named after the former farmer and landowner families. An Irishman, John Gill, settled in Howick in the 1850s, and his family farmed the land that is now Cockle Bay and Shelly Park. Litten Road is the boundary of one of the old Gill-Litten farms. To the north of Picton Street, the main street of Howick is [[Stockade Hill Howick|Stockade Hill]]. In 1863 a field work was constructed on what is now called Stockade Hill, for the purpose of defending Auckland from M\u0101ori who might advance overland from the south, or by canoes from the [[Firth of Thames]]. The ditches of the stockade can still be seen today. In the centre is a war memorial where services are held each [[ANZAC Day]].\n\n[[File:All Saints Church Howick.jpg|250px|left|thumb|[[All Saints Church (Howick)|All Saints Church]], Howick, New Zealand.

Later the centre of Howick shifted to Picton Street which is now the centre. It later became popular as a retirement and seaside holiday location.\n\nIn 1865 Howick became a road board district; in 1922 it was created an independent town district; and on 1 February 1952 it was constituted a borough with Elections for Mayor and Council being held on 22 March 1952.\n\nThe 1930s saw the construction of a concrete all-weather road running all the way from Howick through [[Pakuranga]] to [[Panmure, New Zealand|Panmure]]. This allowed the rapid passage of people and goods to and from Auckland. This concrete road can still be seen, in parts, on the highway between Howick and Pakuranga.\n\nFrom the late 1940s to the 1970s the Howick area experienced rapid growth, when in 1947, at its centenary, it had still been a town of only 1,500. Up until the 1980s Howick was surrounded on all sides by farmland, but as Auckland grew and new subdivisions were created Howick was consumed by urban sprawl.\n\nIn [[1989 local government reforms|1989 the local government reorganisation in New Zealand]] saw Howick become a ward within [[Manukau City]], with its Borough Council being replaced by a Community Board and Councillor representation.\n\nToday Howick is one of the more affluent seaside suburbs of the former Manukau City (now merged with [[Auckland Council|Auckland]]). It has some of the oldest buildings in the Auckland area, as well as the first parish church in Auckland ([[All Saints Church (Howick)|All Saints Church]]).\n\nIn July 2008 the community radio station, East FM (formerly Howick Village Radio), was established on 88.1 FM broadcasting over most of the eastern suburb and on 107.1 FM broadcasting into Botany, Flat Bush, and East Tamaki. Worldwide streaming is also available from their website. They have a variety of shows including some hosted by students from local schools.\n\n=== Asian Settlement ===\n\nFollowing the range of Immigration Reforms passed by New Zealand\u2019s parliament in the early 1980s, Howick alongside much of East-Auckland\u2019s suburban cluster observed a dramatic shift in its demographic makeup, as thousands of newly-arrived Asian Immigrants began to form settlements in the area; Altering the suburb\u2019s then predominating European character in their image, bringing with them Chinese academic and cultural institutions, Cherry Blossom lined streets, and new housing developments built on the principles of Feng-Shui.  \n\nThe congregation of Affluent Asian New Zealanders in Howick and Botany Downs did much to further feed into the narrative of the area as being a \u2018Wealthy Asian Enclave\u2019, which had started to arise as the presence of New Zealanders of other ethnicities begun to be eclipsed by the newly conceived Asian Character of  East Auckland.\n\nFo Guang Shan Temple in Howick stands as a monolithic symbol of Asian New Zealander relevance and legitimacy in the Greater Auckland Region.\n\n<br />\n\n==Howick electorate==\nFrom [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] and prior to the introduction of MMP in 1996, Howick had its own seat in Parliament, [[Howick (New Zealand electorate)|Howick]]; which had been created from part of the former [[Otara (New Zealand electorate)|Otara]] electorate.\n\nIn the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 general election]], due to the need to decrease the number of general electorates in order to ensure a sufficient number of seats were available for list MPs, the population centres formerly in the Howick seat were merged into the former separate seat of [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]].\n\nWhile making recommendations for the boundaries to apply in the 2008 general election, the Electoral Commission recently proposed to resurrect the Howick seat.  The planned seat would have taken in the population centres of Howick and [[Botany Downs]]-[[Dannemora, New Zealand|Dannemora]] but would have had the effect of splitting [[Bucklands Beach]] and [[Highland Park, New Zealand|Highland Park]] across two electorates.  Due to this, and the planned move to incorporate [[Panmure, New Zealand|Panmure]], [[Point England]] and [[Glen Innes, New Zealand|Glen Innes]] into the neighbouring [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]] seat, the Commission received a significant number of objections from [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]] residents.  The Commission eventually adopted the recommendation of Objector N17/30 in keeping the Howick suburb in [[Pakuranga (New Zealand electorate)|Pakuranga]] and renaming the new seat [[Botany Downs, New Zealand|Botany]], with a corresponding shift in centre of gravity to the new suburb of [[Flat Bush]].\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.elections.org.nz/mapping/final_report/scheduleb.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=10 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016103736/http://www.elections.org.nz/mapping/final_report/scheduleb.html |archive-date=16 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.org.nz/voters/find-my-electorate|title=Find my Electorate|website=Electoral Commission|accessdate=12 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Mayors of Howick==\n*1952\u20131953 [[W E LaRoche]]\n*1953\u20131963 Sir [[William Stevenson (New Zealand politician, born 1901)|William Stevenson]]\n*1965\u20131966 J.

This is due to the proximity and influence of the surrounding ocean curtailing any extremes in temperature. Air temperatures below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|0}} and above {{convert|29|\u00b0C|0}} are rare, both being recorded on average only once every 2\u20133 years. The maximum recorded temperature is {{convert|30.7|\u00b0C|0}} and minimum {{convert|-1.4|\u00b0C|0}}. Average summer daily maximum & minimum temperatures are around {{convert|25|\u00b0C|0}} and {{convert|16|\u00b0C|0}}. Humidity in summer can at times be oppressive and tropical-like with [[Dew Point]] temperatures occasionally exceeding {{convert|21|\u00b0C|0}}. Average winter daily maximum & minimum temperatures are around {{convert|15|\u00b0C|0}} and {{convert|7|\u00b0C|0}}. Mean annual temperature is {{convert|15.4|\u00b0C|0}}.\n\n===Rainfall===\nRainfall is usually plentiful throughout the year averaging around {{convert|1250|mm|2}} however the winter months on average see more rain than the summer months. Between December and April, storms from the tropics can occasionally pass through or near the region bringing with it heavy rain. The highest 30-day rainfall of {{convert|417.2|mm|2}} was recorded during the period 7 March 2017 \u2013 5 April 2017 and includes the record highest daily rainfall of {{convert|93|mm|2}} on 4 April 2017. The most consecutive wet days (\u22651&nbsp;mm) is 12 recorded in the period 26 July 2016 \u2013 6 August 2016. The lowest 30-day rainfall of {{convert|2.2|mm|2}} was recorded in the period 15 January 2020 - 13 March 2020 and the most consecutive non-wet days (<1&nbsp;mm) is 29 recorded 2 January 2015 \u2013 30 January 2015. There are no recorded instances of snowfall. Occasionally droughts do occur during the warmer months, for example the 3 months Jan-Mar 2013 saw only {{convert|51|mm|2}} of rainfall, and the 5 months Nov 2019 - Mar 2020 saw only {{convert|120|mm|2}} of rainfall.\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Howick (Jan 2010 - Mar 2020)\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n<!-- Record high temperatures -->\n|Jan record high C = 30.2\n|Feb record high C = 30.7\n|Mar record high C = 27.4\n|Apr record high C = 25.4\n|May record high C = 22.6\n|Jun record high C = 19.3\n|Jul record high C = 18.7\n|Aug record high C = 19.4\n|Sep record high C = 21.6\n|Oct record high C = 22.6\n|Nov record high C = 26.7\n|Dec record high C = 28.9\n|year record high C = 30.7\n<!-- Average high temperatures -->\n|Jan high C = 24.6\n|Feb high C = 25.2\n|Mar high C = 23.6\n|Apr high C = 20.9\n|May high C = 18.1\n|Jun high C = 15.6\n|Jul high C = 14.8\n|Aug high C = 15.5\n|Sep high C = 16.9\n|Oct high C = 18.8\n|Nov high C = 20.9\n|Dec high C = 23.1\n|year high C = 19.8\n<!-- Mean daily temperature -->\n|Jan mean C = 19.9\n|Feb mean C = 20.3\n|Mar mean C = 18.8\n|Apr mean C = 16.4\n|May mean C = 13.9\n|Jun mean C = 11.7\n|Jul mean C = 10.6\n|Aug mean C = 11.4\n|Sep mean C = 12.7\n|Oct mean C = 14.3\n|Nov mean C = 16.1\n|Dec mean C = 18.5\n|year mean C = 15.4\n|<!-- Average low temperatures -->\n|Jan low C = 15.7\n|Feb low C = 16.1\n|Mar low C = 14.6\n|Apr low C = 12.4\n|May low C = 10.1\n|Jun low C = 8.2\n|Jul low C = 7.0\n|Aug low C = 7.7\n|Sep low C = 9.0\n|Oct low C = 10.3\n|Nov low C = 12.0\n|Dec low C = 14.7\n|year low C = 11.5\n<!-- Record low temperatures -->\n|Jan record low C = 9.1\n|Feb record low C = 8.5\n|Mar record low C = 6.3\n|Apr record low C = 4.8\n|May record low C = 0.3\n|Jun record low C = -0.4\n|Jul record low C = -1.4\n|Aug record low C = 0.2\n|Sep record low C = 0.1\n|Oct record low C = 3.1\n|Nov record low C = 5.3\n|Dec record low C = 7.4\n|year record low C = -1.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 67.1\n|Feb precipitation mm = 62.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 97.1\n|Apr precipitation mm = 105.5\n|May precipitation mm = 123.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 140.4\n|Jul precipitation mm = 141.2\n|Aug precipitation mm = 136.8\n|Sep precipitation mm = 127.6\n|Oct precipitation mm = 78.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 64.1\n|Dec precipitation mm = 93.2\n|year precipitation mm = 1236.7\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 6.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 7.3\n|Mar precipitation days = 7.7\n|Apr precipitation days = 9.9\n|May precipitation days = 13.1\n|Jun precipitation days = 14.0\n|Jul precipitation days = 14.8\n|Aug precipitation days = 16.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 15.3\n|Oct precipitation days = 11.5\n|Nov precipitation days = 8.8\n|Dec precipitation days = 8.7\n|year precipitation days = 133.7\n|\n|source 1 = Howick Weather Station<ref name=\"howickweather\">{{cite web\n| url = https://howickweather.co.nz/history-climate\n| title = Howick Weather &#124; Climate\n| publisher = howickweather.co.nz \n| accessdate = 2 April 2020}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation|ref=none |last=La Roche |first=A. |title=The history of Howick and Pakuranga |publisher=The Howick & District Historical Society (Inc.) |year=1991 |isbn=0-473-01206-5}}\n* {{citation|ref=none |year=1902 |url=http://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz//tm/scholarly/tei-Cyc02Cycl-t1-body1-d3-d2-d3.html |encyclopedia=[[The Cyclopedia of New Zealand]]|volume=2: Auckland Provincial District |title=Howick |publisher=The Cyclopedia Company, Limited |location=Christchurch |pages=656\u2013657}} \u2013 history of the town to 1900 and biographies of some local notable people during the latter half of the 19th century.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fencible.org.nz/ Howick Historical Village]\n* [http://www.howickvillage.co.nz/ Howick Village]\n* [http://www.eastfm.nz East FM]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060509055247/http://www.welcome2manukau.com/tourism/Tsm_HistorickWalkHowick/ Howick Historic Walk]\n* [http://www.hlt.org.nz/ Howick Little Theatre Incorporated]\n* [https://kura.aucklandlibraries.govt.nz/digital/?p=q&collection=p20062coll1&search=howick&field=title&mode=all&conn= Photographs of Howick] held in [[Auckland Libraries|Auckland Libraries']] heritage collections.\n\n[[Category:Suburbs of Auckland]]\n", "name_user": "Agh47", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:updated photographs link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howick,_New_Zealand"}
