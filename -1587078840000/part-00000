Saul resolves never to go to a residential school, but his parents, converted to Christianity, are determined their eldest son will go to heaven. When the boy dies, they take him away to be blessed by a priest after he dies from his illness, leaving Saul with his grandmother  deep in the woods. The parents don\u2019t return. \n\nSaul and his grandmother stay and camp, but once cold weather starts, his grandmother decides they must continue their trek towards their ancestral lands. After their canoe capsizes, they must huddle to stay warm at night; they continue their journey on foot through snow. When his grandmother dies, Saul is discovered by the authorities and forcibly moved to a residential school. There, he meets a boy named Lonnie, who cannot speak English. The top official, Father Quinney, and his nun deem Lonnie an unsuitable name and call him Aaron, and forbid the use of the boys' [[Ojibwe language]], beating Lonnie when he cannot comply.\n\nIn the school, Saul witnesses the nuns and instructors abuse the children, and struggles to survive. One instructor, Father Gaston, seems to want to change the school. He convinces Father Quinney to allow a new outdoor activity, ice hockey. Saul does not meet the age requirement to play, but he convinces Father Gaston to give him the job of maintaining the [[ice rink|rink]] in the early morning, which allows him to spend time on the ice. From watching televised hockey games and practicing in the mornings, Saul also begins learning techniques. When one of the school's players is injured, Saul steps forward as a substitute and astounds Father Gaston with his talent. Saul declines to join Lonnie's escape attempt, as Saul was looking forward to playing; Lonnie is recaptured and punished.\n\nSaul shows remarkable hockey skills on the school team. When he becomes a teen, the school allows Saul to leave and move into a [[foster home]] with an Indigenous family in a mining town, where he can further pursue hockey. Saul joins an all-Indigenous team called the Moose, who travel to games between [[Indian reserve]]s, and receives the [[jersey number]] 13, \"for luck\". Winning a key game, Saul is treated as a star player in ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'' style, but the team faces [[racial discrimination]] and beatings afterwards in a pub.\n\nSaul attracts the notice of the Toronto Monarchs, a feeder team for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], but does not want to leave his friends in the Moose. His team insists he take the offer, and he reluctantly joins the Monarchs. There, he keeps his number 13, which no one else wants due to [[Triskaidekaphobia]]. Initially excelling, he is nevertheless put off by a racist caricature of him in the newspaper. On the ice, Saul becomes the target of racist slurs from opponents and teammates alike, while the audience throws toy Indian figures onto the ice. Pushed into violence by many fouls, he is confined to the [[penalty box]]. He is stunned when Father Gaston appears one night, professing pride in where hockey has taken Saul, and admitting the abuses in the school were wrong. Father Gaston tells Saul that the church is sending him to work in Africa. Gaston's appearance causes Saul to have flashbacks to the abuses committed at the school, and he leaves the team.\n\nTaking odd low-level jobs, he drifts from place to place between 1979 and 1989. He sees Lonnie in an alley, drinking liquor. Saul drinks a lot and develops [[alcoholism]]. Facing serious health issues after severe damage to his liver, Saul is accepted by the Indigenous rehabilitation centre Rising Dawn. The group therapy leader, seeing how sad and withdrawn Saul is, encourages him to confront the root of his suffering. Saul travels back to the now closed school, where it is revealed that he had been sexually molested by Father Gaston. He makes a pilgrimage by canoe back to his ancestral lands, and then returns to his foster family, where he is happily welcomed by his foster family and former Moose teammates.\n\n==Reception==\n''Indian Horse'' was the highest-grossing English Canadian film of 2018, making $1.69 million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://playbackonline.ca/2019/01/03/2018s-top-grossing-canadian-films-box-office/ |title=2018\u2032s top-grossing Canadian films, box office |work=[[Playback (magazine)|Playback]] |date=January 3, 2018 |accessdate=January 4, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 75%, based on 12 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 5.89/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/indian_horse |title=Indian Horse (2018) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango Media]] |accessdate=October 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Awards and accolades===\nThe film won the top award at the 2017 [[Vancouver International Film Festival]]<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://archive.viff.org/e-blasts/viff/2017/PR/18_VIFFAudienceAwards_PR.html |title=Indian Horse Wins Coveted VIFF Super Channel People's Choice Award |publisher=Greater Vancouver International Film Festival Society |work=33rd [[Vancouver International Film Festival]] |date=13 October 2017 |accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref> and the [[List of San Diego International Film Festival award winners#Kumeyaay Eagle Award for Best Native American Film|Kumeyaay Eagle Award for Best Native American Film]] at the [[List of San Diego International Film Festival award winners#SDiFF2018|2018 San Diego International Film Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sdfilmfest.com/award-winners/|title=Award Winners {{!}} San Diego International Film Festival|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> \n\nSladen Peltier received a [[Canadian Screen Award]] nomination for [[Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] at the [[6th Canadian Screen Awards]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Epilogue==\nFilm epilogue reads: \"Between the late 1800s and 1996, over 150,000 Indigenous children were sent to Residential Schools.
