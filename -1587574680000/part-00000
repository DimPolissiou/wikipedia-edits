{"title_page": "Know your customer", "text_new": "{{Finance sidebar|reg/stands}}{{Banking|related}}The '''know your customer''' or '''know your client''' ('''KYC''') guidelines in [[financial services]] requires that professionals make an effort to verify the identity, suitability, and risks involved with maintaining a [[Business relationship management|business relationship]]. The term can also refer to the [[bank regulation]]s and [[anti-money laundering]] regulations that govern these activities. KYC processes are also employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed customers, agents, consultants, or distributors are anti-[[bribery]] compliant, and are actually who they claim to be. Banks, insurers, export creditors and other financial institutions are increasingly demanding that customers provide detailed [[due diligence]] information. Initially, these regulations were imposed only on the financial institutions but now the non-financial industry, fintech, virtual assets dealers, and even the non-profit organizations are liable to oblige. \n\n== Standards ==\nThe objective of KYC guidelines is to prevent businesses (financial and non-financial) from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for money laundering. Related procedures also enable businesses to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. This helps them manage their risks in a well judged manner. Today, KYC principles apply to banks as well as different online businesses. They usually frame their KYC policies incorporating the following four key elements:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n* Customer acceptance policy;\n* Customer identification procedures;\n* Monitoring of transactions; and\n* [[Risk management]].\n\nThe stringent regulatory environment establishes KYC as a mandatory and crucial procedure for financial institutions as well as non-financial institutions. As it minimizes the risk of fraud, by identifying suspicious elements earlier on in the client-business relationship.

The term can also refer to the [[bank regulation]]s and [[anti-money laundering]] regulations that govern these activities. KYC processes are also employed by companies of all sizes for the purpose of ensuring their proposed customers, agents, consultants, or distributors are anti-[[bribery]] compliant, and are actually who they claim to be. Banks, insurers, export creditors and other financial institutions are increasingly demanding that customers provide detailed [[due diligence]] information. Initially, these regulations were imposed only on the financial institutions but now the non-financial industry, fintech, virtual assets dealers, and even the non-profit organizations are liable to oblige. \n\n== Standards ==\nThe objective of KYC guidelines is to prevent businesses (financial and non-financial) from being used, intentionally or unintentionally, by criminal elements for money laundering. Related procedures also enable businesses to better understand their customers and their financial dealings. This helps them manage their risks in a well judged manner. Today, KYC principles apply to banks as well as different online businesses. They usually frame their KYC policies incorporating the following four key elements:{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n* Customer acceptance policy;\n* Customer identification procedures;\n* Monitoring of transactions; and\n* [[Risk management]].\n\nThe stringent regulatory environment establishes KYC as a mandatory and crucial procedure for financial institutions as well as non-financial institutions. As it minimizes the risk of fraud, by identifying suspicious elements earlier on in the client-business relationship. For the purposes of a KYC policy, a ''customer/user'' may be defined as:{{cn|date=March 2020}}{{Financial regulation}}\n\n* a person or entity that maintains an account and/or has a business relationship with the reporting entity (bank/business);\n* one on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the [[beneficial owner]]);\n* beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries such as [[stockbroker]]s, Chartered Accountants, or solicitors, as permitted under the law; or\n* any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant reputational or other risks to the bank, for example, a wire transfer or issue of a high-value demand draft as a single transaction.\n\n==Laws by country==\n*[[Australia]]: The [[Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre]] (AUSTRAC), established in 1989, monitors financial transactions in Australia<ref name=\"Search\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00770l | title=Search}}</ref><ref>https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2016C01046</ref> and sets client identification requirements.\n*[[Canada]]: The [[Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada]] (FINTRAC), established in 2000, is Canada's financial intelligence unit.

In July 1592, however, he was asking for help from [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]] in a plot with the [[Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll|Earl of Erroll]] and other lords against [[John Maitland, 1st Lord Maitland of Thirlestane|John Maitland of Thirlestane]], the [[Chancellor of Scotland|Chancellor]], and protesting his absolute rejection of Spanish offers, but in October he signed the [[Spanish Blanks]]. On the discovery of this treason he was imprisoned in [[Edinburgh Castle]] on his return to Scotland in January 1593.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nDouglas escaped from Edinburgh Castle on 13 January 1593 with the help of his Countess, joining the Earls of [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly|Huntly]] and Erroll in the north. They were offered an Act of \"oblivion\" or \"abolition\" provided they renounced their religion or quit [[Scotland]].

Angus was again included in the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]], and in June 1598 was appointed the King's Lieutenant in southern Scotland, in which capacity he showed great zeal and conducted the \"Raid of [[Dumfries]],\" as the campaign against the [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstones]] was called.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nNot long afterwards, Angus, offended at the advancement of Huntly to a Marquessate, recanted, resisted all the arguments of the ministers to bring him to a \"better mind,\" and was again excommunicated in 1608.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1609 Douglas withdrew into exile, and died in [[Paris, France]] on 3 March 1611.

Becoming a Roman Catholic, he, in 1592, engaged with the earls of [[Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll|Errol]] and [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly|Huntly]] in the treasonable plot of obtaining the [[Philip II of Spain|King of Spain]]\u2019s assistance for the reestablishment of [[Papist|popery]] in Scotland, and on the 1st of the following January he was seized and committed to the castle of Edinburgh. On the 15th of February, however, he made his escape, and joined the other two earls in the north. On the 11th October, they came suddenly into the king\u2019s presence, and offered to submit themselves to trial. On the 26th November, it was determined that they and their associates should be exempted from all farther inquiry or prosecution on account of their correspondence with Spain, and that before the 1st of February 1594, they should either submit to the church, and renounce popery, or remove out of the kingdom. They refused to accede to these conditions, and continued their treasonable negotiations. After the [[battle of Glenlivet]], 3d October of the same year, in which, however, he was not present, Angus retired to the continent, and spent the remainder of his life in acts of devotion. He died at Paris 3d March 1611, in the 57th year of his age, and was buried in the church of [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s|St. Germain de Prez]], where a magnificent monument was erected to his memory, the inscription on which is printed at length in [[the Scots Magazine]] for 1767.

Angus was again included in the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]], and in June 1598 was appointed the King's Lieutenant in southern Scotland, in which capacity he showed great zeal and conducted the \"Raid of [[Dumfries]],\" as the campaign against the [[Clan Johnstone|Johnstones]] was called.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nNot long afterwards, Angus, offended at the advancement of Huntly to a Marquessate, recanted, resisted all the arguments of the ministers to bring him to a \"better mind,\" and was again excommunicated in 1608.<ref name=\"EB1911\"/>\n\nIn 1609 Douglas withdrew into exile, and died in [[Paris, France]] on 3 March 1611. He is buried at the [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s]].\n\nDouglas married [[Elizabeth Oliphant]], a daughter of [[Lord Oliphant#Lords Oliphant, (1455)|Lawrence, 4th Lord of Oliphant]], in spring 1585, and they had three sons and two daughters. His second son, James, was created [[James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington|Lord Mordington]] in 1641. His daughter Mary was married to [[Earl of Linlithgow#Earls of Linlithgow (1600-1716)|Alexander Livingston, 2nd Earl of Linlithgow]].\n\nFrom ''The Scottish Nation'':\n:{{quote| William, ..., tenth earl, was well versed in the antiquities and history of his country, and wrote a chronicle of the Douglases. Becoming a Roman Catholic, he, in 1592, engaged with the earls of [[Francis Hay, 9th Earl of Erroll|Errol]] and [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly|Huntly]] in the treasonable plot of obtaining the [[Philip II of Spain|King of Spain]]\u2019s assistance for the reestablishment of [[Papist|popery]] in Scotland, and on the 1st of the following January he was seized and committed to the castle of Edinburgh. On the 15th of February, however, he made his escape, and joined the other two earls in the north. On the 11th October, they came suddenly into the king\u2019s presence, and offered to submit themselves to trial. On the 26th November, it was determined that they and their associates should be exempted from all farther inquiry or prosecution on account of their correspondence with Spain, and that before the 1st of February 1594, they should either submit to the church, and renounce popery, or remove out of the kingdom. They refused to accede to these conditions, and continued their treasonable negotiations. After the [[battle of Glenlivet]], 3d October of the same year, in which, however, he was not present, Angus retired to the continent, and spent the remainder of his life in acts of devotion. He died at Paris 3d March 1611, in the 57th year of his age, and was buried in the church of [[Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s|St. Germain de Prez]], where a magnificent monument was erected to his memory, the inscription on which is printed at length in [[the Scots Magazine]] for 1767.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books.

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books.

{"title_page": "General Roman Calendar of 1960", "text_new": "{{about|the calendar currently used in the 1962 Tridentine Latin Mass|the liturgical calendar promulgated by decree of the Council of Trent|Tridentine Calendar}}\nThis article lists the feast days of the General Roman Calendar as approved on 25 July 1960 by [[Pope John XXIII]]'s ''[[motu proprio]]'' ''[[Rubricarum instructum]]'' and promulgated by the [[Sacred Congregation of Rites]] the following day, 26 July 1960, by the decree ''Novum rubricarum''. This 1960 calendar was incorporated into the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]], continued use of which [[Pope Benedict XVI]] authorized in the circumstances indicated in his 7 July 2007 motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.\n\n''Novum rubricarum'' replaced the former classifications of Doubles, Semidoubles, and Simples with I, II, and III class feasts and commemorations. It removed a few feasts, in particular duplications such as the [[Feast of the Cross]] (3 May and 14 September), the [[Chair of Peter]] (18 January and 22 February), [[Saint Peter]] (1 August and 29 June), Saint [[John the Evangelist]] (6 May and 27 December), [[Saint Michael]] (8 May and 29 September), and [[Saint Stephen]] (3 August and 26 December).\n\nThis calendar is distinct from the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]] in that it also incorporates the changes made by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955, which included the reduction of [[octave (liturgy)|octaves]] to three only, those of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost.<ref>General decree ''Cum nostra'' of the Sacred Congregation of Rites</ref> See [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]].\n\n==Changes to the Calendar==\n===New ranking system===\n''Novum rubricarum'' abolished the traditional ranking of Sundays, ferias, and feast days as doubles (of varying degrees) and simples\u2014the rank of semidouble having already been suppressed by Pope Pius XII in 1955\u2014and introduced a new system of ranking the various liturgical days of the Roman rite. Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the I class were reclassified as ''feasts of the I class.'' Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the II class were reclassified as ''feasts of the II class.'' Feasts ranked in 1954 as greater doubles, doubles, and semidoubles were reclassified as ''feasts of the III class.'' Feasts that had formerly been ranked as simples and had been reduced to commemorations in Pius XII's 1955 revision of the calendar remained ''commemorations.''\n\nThe Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Passiontide, and Low Sunday were classified as ''Sundays of the I class.'' All other Sundays of the year\u2014excluding those perpetually impeded by feasts of the I class\u2014became ''Sundays of the II class.''\n\nAsh Wednesday, the ferias of Holy Week, the Paschal Triduum, and the days within the octaves of Easter and Pentecost (including the Ember Days of Pentecost) were classified as ''ferias of the I class.'' The ferias of Advent from 17\u201323 December inclusive, the days within the octave of Christmas not impeded by the feasts of saints (29\u201331 December inclusive), as well as the Ember Days of Advent, Lent, and September were ranked as ''ferias of the II class.'' The ferias of Advent, excluding 17\u201323 December, were ranked as ''ferias of the III class,'' as were the ferias of Lent and Passiontide. In addition, the ferias of Lent and Passiontide were given precedence over all feasts of the III class, with III-class feasts reduced to commemorations in years in which they fell during Lent or Passiontide. The remaining ferias of the year were classified ''ferias of the IV class.''\n\nThe following feasts were reduced to commemorations:\n* the previous greater doubles of\n** Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel (16 July)\n** Our Lady of Ransom (24 September)\n** The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Friday after the I Sunday in Passiontide)\n* the previous doubles of\n** The Impression of the Sacred Stigmata of St. Francis Confessor (17 September)\n** Ss. Eustace and Companions Martyrs (20 September)\n** St. Thomas [of Canterbury] Bishop and Martyr (29 December)\n** St. Sylvester I Pope and Confessor (31 December)\n* the previous simples (up to 1955, semidoubles) of\n** St. George Martyr (23 April)\n** St. Alexis Confessor (17 July)\n** Ss. Cyriacus, Largus, and Smaragdus Martyrs (8 August)\n\nThe following days of the II class became liturgical days of the I class:\n* Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord (1 January)\n* The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (2 November or 3 November if 2 November falls on Sunday)\n\nThe following greater doubles became liturgical days of the II class:\n* The Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph (I Sunday after Epiphany)\n* The Chair of Saint Peter (22 February)\n* The Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 September)\n\n===Deletions and additions to the calendar===\nThe following feasts were deleted from the calendar:\n* doubles of the II class\n** The Finding of the Holy Cross (3 May; considered a duplication of the 14 September feast of the Cross)\n* greater doubles\n** The Chair of Saint Peter Apostle at Rome (18 January; merged with the 22 February feast of St. Peter's Chair at Antioch)\n** St. John Apostle and Evangelist Before the Latin Gate (6 May; considered a duplication of the 27 December feast of St. John)\n** The Apparition of St. Michael Archangel (8 May; considered a duplication of the 29 September feast of the Dedication of St. Michael)\n** St. Peter Apostle in Chains (1 August; considered a duplication of the 29 June feast of Ss.

Peter and Paul)\n* St. John Mary Vianney Confessor (9 to 8 August; to be nearer to his ''natalis'')\nThe commemoration of Ss. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, and Apuleius Martyrs was transferred from 7 to 8 October, due to rubrical changes that restricted the number of commemorations allowed on a II-class feast (in this case, the 7 October feast of the Rosary) to only one.\n\nThe following titles were changed:\n* The Circumcision of the Lord became the Octave Day of the Nativity (1 January)\n* The Octave Day of the Epiphany became the Commemoration of the Baptism of the Lord (13 January, II cl.)\n* The Chair of St. Peter Apostle at Antioch became The Chair of St. Peter Apostle (22 February)\n* The Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary became Blessed Virgin Mary of the Rosary (7 October)\n\nThe new rubrics also restricted the transferal of impeded feast days that occur in a given year on the same day as a liturgical day of higher rank solely to feasts of the I class (formerly doubles of the I class). Under the older rubrics, both doubles of the I class and doubles of the II class (feasts of the II class under the 1960 rubrics) were transferred when impeded.\n\n===Post-1960 developments===\nOn 25 March 2020, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] made public the decree ''Cum sanctissima'', dated 22 February 2020, which introduced a number of options for use in contemporary celebration of the Office and Mass according to the 1961 Breviary and 1962 Missal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Decreto Cum sanctissima della Congregazione per la Dottrina della Fede circa la celebrazione liturgica in onore dei santi nella forma extraordinaria del Rito Romano, 25.03.2020 |agency=Bolletino |issue=B0184 |publisher=Holy See Press Office |date=March 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=DiPippo |first1=Gregory |title=New Prefaces and Feasts for the EF Missal |url=http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2020/03/new-prefaces-and-feasts-for-ef-missal.html#.XpxfkMhKjIU |publisher=New Liturgical Movement |date=March 25, 2020}}</ref> With regard to the liturgical calendar, the decree grants permission for the celebration of feasts of saints canonized after 26 July 1960, provided the feasts are inscribed on the [[General Roman Calendar]] governing the [[Mass of Paul VI]].

This 1960 calendar was incorporated into the 1962 edition of the [[Roman Missal]], continued use of which [[Pope Benedict XVI]] authorized in the circumstances indicated in his 7 July 2007 motu proprio ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''.\n\n''Novum rubricarum'' replaced the former classifications of Doubles, Semidoubles, and Simples with I, II, and III class feasts and commemorations. It removed a few feasts, in particular duplications such as the [[Feast of the Cross]] (3 May and 14 September), the [[Chair of Peter]] (18 January and 22 February), [[Saint Peter]] (1 August and 29 June), Saint [[John the Evangelist]] (6 May and 27 December), [[Saint Michael]] (8 May and 29 September), and [[Saint Stephen]] (3 August and 26 December).\n\nThis calendar is distinct from the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]] in that it also incorporates the changes made by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1955, which included the reduction of [[octave (liturgy)|octaves]] to three only, those of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost.<ref>General decree ''Cum nostra'' of the Sacred Congregation of Rites</ref> See [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII]].\n\n==Changes to the Calendar==\n===New ranking system===\n''Novum rubricarum'' abolished the traditional ranking of Sundays, ferias, and feast days as doubles (of varying degrees) and simples\u2014the rank of semidouble having already been suppressed by Pope Pius XII in 1955\u2014and introduced a new system of ranking the various liturgical days of the Roman rite. Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the I class were reclassified as ''feasts of the I class.'' Feasts previously ranked as doubles of the II class were reclassified as ''feasts of the II class.'' Feasts ranked in 1954 as greater doubles, doubles, and semidoubles were reclassified as ''feasts of the III class.'' Feasts that had formerly been ranked as simples and had been reduced to commemorations in Pius XII's 1955 revision of the calendar remained ''commemorations.''\n\nThe Sundays of Advent, Lent, and Passiontide, and Low Sunday were classified as ''Sundays of the I class.'' All other Sundays of the year\u2014excluding those perpetually impeded by feasts of the I class\u2014became ''Sundays of the II class.''\n\nAsh Wednesday, the ferias of Holy Week, the Paschal Triduum, and the days within the octaves of Easter and Pentecost (including the Ember Days of Pentecost) were classified as ''ferias of the I class.'' The ferias of Advent from 17\u201323 December inclusive, the days within the octave of Christmas not impeded by the feasts of saints (29\u201331 December inclusive), as well as the Ember Days of Advent, Lent, and September were ranked as ''ferias of the II class.'' The ferias of Advent, excluding 17\u201323 December, were ranked as ''ferias of the III class,'' as were the ferias of Lent and Passiontide. In addition, the ferias of Lent and Passiontide were given precedence over all feasts of the III class, with III-class feasts reduced to commemorations in years in which they fell during Lent or Passiontide. The remaining ferias of the year were classified ''ferias of the IV class.''\n\nThe following feasts were reduced to commemorations:\n* the previous greater doubles of\n** Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel (16 July)\n** Our Lady of Ransom (24 September)\n** The Seven Sorrows of the Blessed Virgin Mary (Friday after the I Sunday in Passiontide)\n* the previous doubles of\n** The Impression of the Sacred Stigmata of St. Francis Confessor (17 September)\n** Ss. Eustace and Companions Martyrs (20 September)\n** St. Thomas [of Canterbury] Bishop and Martyr (29 December)\n** St. Sylvester I Pope and Confessor (31 December)\n* the previous simples (up to 1955, semidoubles) of\n** St. George Martyr (23 April)\n** St. Alexis Confessor (17 July)\n** Ss. Cyriacus, Largus, and Smaragdus Martyrs (8 August)\n\nThe following days of the II class became liturgical days of the I class:\n* Octave Day of the Nativity of the Lord (1 January)\n* The Commemoration of All the Faithful Departed (2 November or 3 November if 2 November falls on Sunday)\n\nThe following greater doubles became liturgical days of the II class:\n* The Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph (I Sunday after Epiphany)\n* The Chair of Saint Peter (22 February)\n* The Exaltation of the Holy Cross (14 September)\n\n===Deletions and additions to the calendar===\nThe following feasts were deleted from the calendar:\n* doubles of the II class\n** The Finding of the Holy Cross (3 May; considered a duplication of the 14 September feast of the Cross)\n* greater doubles\n** The Chair of Saint Peter Apostle at Rome (18 January; merged with the 22 February feast of St. Peter's Chair at Antioch)\n** St. John Apostle and Evangelist Before the Latin Gate (6 May; considered a duplication of the 27 December feast of St. John)\n** The Apparition of St. Michael Archangel (8 May; considered a duplication of the 29 September feast of the Dedication of St. Michael)\n** St. Peter Apostle in Chains (1 August; considered a duplication of the 29 June feast of Ss. Peter and Paul)\n* simples (up to 1955, semidoubles)\n** St. Leo II Pope and Confessor (3 July; removed as a result of the transfer of St. Irenaeus to 3 July)\n** St. Anacletus Pope and Martyr (13 July; merged with the 26 April feast of St. Cletus)\n** On the Finding of the Body of St. Stephen Protomartyr (3 August; considered a duplication of the 26 December feast of St. Stephen)\nThe commemoration of St. Vitalis Martyr (28 April) was likewise deleted, due to doubts about the historicity of his martyrdom.\n\nThe following feasts were inscribed in the calendar:\n* St. Gregory Barbarigo Bishop and Confessor (17 June, III cl.)\n* St. Anthony Mary Claret Bishop and Confessor (23 October, III cl.)\n\n===Other changes===\nThe following feasts were transferred:\n* St. Irenaeus Bishop and Martyr (28 June to 3 July; to make room for celebration of the Vigil of Ss. Peter and Paul)\n* St. John Mary Vianney Confessor (9 to 8 August; to be nearer to his ''natalis'')\nThe commemoration of Ss. Sergius, Bacchus, Marcellus, and Apuleius Martyrs was transferred from 7 to 8 October, due to rubrical changes that restricted the number of commemorations allowed on a II-class feast (in this case, the 7 October feast of the Rosary) to only one.\n\nThe following titles were changed:\n* The Circumcision of the Lord became the Octave Day of the Nativity (1 January)\n* The Octave Day of the Epiphany became the Commemoration of the Baptism of the Lord (13 January, II cl.)\n* The Chair of St. Peter Apostle at Antioch became The Chair of St. Peter Apostle (22 February)\n* The Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary became Blessed Virgin Mary of the Rosary (7 October)\n\nThe new rubrics also restricted the transferal of impeded feast days that occur in a given year on the same day as a liturgical day of higher rank solely to feasts of the I class (formerly doubles of the I class). Under the older rubrics, both doubles of the I class and doubles of the II class (feasts of the II class under the 1960 rubrics) were transferred when impeded.\n\n===Post-1960 developments===\nOn 25 March 2020, the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] made public the decree ''Cum sanctissima'', dated 22 February 2020, which introduced a number of options for use in contemporary celebration of the Office and Mass according to the 1961 Breviary and 1962 Missal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Decreto Cum sanctissima della Congregazione per la Dottrina della Fede circa la celebrazione liturgica in onore dei santi nella forma extraordinaria del Rito Romano, 25.03.2020 |agency=Bolletino |issue=B0184 |publisher=Holy See Press Office |date=March 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=DiPippo |first1=Gregory |title=New Prefaces and Feasts for the EF Missal |url=http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2020/03/new-prefaces-and-feasts-for-ef-missal.html#.XpxfkMhKjIU |publisher=New Liturgical Movement |date=March 25, 2020}}</ref> With regard to the liturgical calendar, the decree grants permission for the celebration of feasts of saints canonized after 26 July 1960, provided the feasts are inscribed on the [[General Roman Calendar]] governing the [[Mass of Paul VI]].

Best known for his lengthy tenure in professional [[martial arts]], Nielsen was an international competitor who held the [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] US Cruiserweight Championship for much of his career and fought in one of the earliest [[mixed martial arts]]-style matches of [[Japan]]. As an [[alternative medicine]] practitioner, Nielsen played an active role in legalizing chiropractic practice in [[Thailand]].\n\n==Early life==\nNielsen was born in [[Los Angeles]] on July 4, 1959 to Howard and Beth Nielsen.<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\"/> He began his formal [[martial arts]] training at age 10, studying [[tang soo do]] under a cousin who operated a [[dojo]] owned by [[Chuck Norris]].<ref name=\"BusinessReview\">{{cite journal |date=1993 |title=Don Nakaya Nielson |journal=Business Review |volume=22 |page=23 }}</ref> Competition in [[karate]] soon followed.<ref name=\"CitizenJournal\">{{cite web|url=http://citizen-journal.link/don-nakaya-nielsen/ |title=Don Nakaya Nielsen Dies! (Japanese) |publisher=Citizen Journal |date= |accessdate=2017-12-04}}</ref> He attended [[Whittier College]] on an athletic scholarship, playing [[American football|football]] and majoring in [[pre-medicine]].<ref name=\"BioEnergy\">{{cite web|url=http://bioenergyasia.com/index.php/about-us/profile/ |title=Tribute to Our Founder|publisher=Bio Energy Asia |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Kickboxing===\nAfter winning a [[Golden Gloves]] title in [[amateur boxing]]<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rafu.com/don-nakaya-nielsen/ |title=Don Nakaya Nielsen |publisher=Rafu Shimpo |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}</ref>, Nielsen moved on to professional [[kickboxing]]. He established himself in the [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]], amassing an early record of 12-4 with all wins coming by way of [[knockout]]. The golden days of his career began with his winning the WKA US Cruiserweight Championship: holding the title for most of his fighting days, Nielsen made his name as an aggressive knockout artist who defeated his opponents within the early rounds. His willingness to compete internationally led him to fight and train in [[Japan]], where he embraced his Japanese heritage en route to becoming one of the country's most popular sports stars. With Japanese fans accepting him as one of their countrymen, he represented Japan in international bouts and was one of the nation's only heavyweight kickboxers during his career.<ref name=\"BusinessReview\"/>\n\nIn May 1989, Nielsen entered world-class competition by challenging budding superstar [[Kevin Rosier]] for his WKA World Super Heavyweight Championship. With a record of 14-2, Rosier was half as experienced as Nielsen but was significantly taller and maintained a weight advantage of over 45 pounds (20.4 kilos). Frustration between the fighters rose as the number of committed [[foul (sports)|fouls]] mounted and Nielsen slowed the match\u2019s pace by repeatedly falling to the canvas. The fight ended in the sixth round when a visibly angered Rosier threw Nielsen onto the ring ropes and landed an unprotected blow to the face, leading to a [[technical knockout]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMhQpekHUko|title=Kevin Rosier Vs. Don Nakaya Nielsen (14-5-89)|first=|last=|date=2 March 2019|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nNielsen attempted to make up for this loss later in the year with a contest against [[Rob Kaman]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Muay Thai]] stylist attaining legendary status as an international champion. Nielsen sought to match his opponent\u2019s signature low kicks but found himself repeatedly swept by Kaman\u2019s legs before being knocked out by a surprise right hook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_TxLq1q30|title=\u30ed\u30d6\u30fb\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 vs \u30c9\u30f3\u4e2d\u77e2\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30bb\u30f3 2/2|first=|last=|date=29 April 2007|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> The following year, Nielsen met future world champion [[Masaaki Satake]] in the latter\u2019s debut match. Nielsen swarmed his less-experienced opponent early on but was unsettled by Satake\u2019s repeated headbutts, eventually dropping his guard and being knocked out by a right hook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozbpEgU0dKY|title=Don Nakaya Nielsen Vs. Masaaki Satake (30-6-90)|first=|last=|date=4 March 2019|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn the following three years, Nielsen continued to fight internationally, winning the WKA International Heavyweight Championship in 1992 but still falling short of world titles. His final match took place in September 1993 at the [[K-1 Illusion]] event, for the UKF World Heavyweight Championship, against returning opponent Masaaki Satake. More experienced at this time, Satake fought primarily with counter-strikes, rarely allowing even a single one of Nielsen\u2019s blows to go unrequited. He knocked Nielsen down three times within the opening round, leading to a TKO loss as per [[K-1]] rules.\n\n===Pro wrestling===\nNielsen's [[kickboxing]] success allowed an easy expansion to [[professional wrestling]], which he participated in alongside his fighting career. A participant of the [[shoot wrestling]] style, Nielsen's matches were designed to look as realistic as possible with Nielsen wearing boxing gloves to emphasize his kickboxing background. His list of opponents from 1986 to 1993 includes ring legends [[Akira Maeda]], [[Keiichi Yamada]], and [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]]. He wrestled primarily for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]].\n\n===Mixed martial arts===\nNielsen's most famous sporting endeavor was a one-time event in the budding field of [[mixed martial arts]]. On October 4, 1992, he met [[Ken Shamrock]] in a mixed rules bout - the first time in [[Japan]] that a [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]] had fought a [[kickboxing|kickboxer]] in televised no-holds-barred competition. Nielsen was quickly submitted by Shamrock, who took advantage of his opponent's limited grappling experience and the fact that Nielsen had opted to wear boxing gloves. The match elevated Japanese interest in MMA competition and helped lead to the formation of [[Pancrase|Pancrase Hybrid Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Shamrock\">{{Cite book |last=Shamrock |first=Ken |title=Beyond the Lion's Den: The Life, The Fights, The Techniques |year=2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9780804846592}}</ref>\n\n===Acting===\nNielsen made his [[acting]] debut in the 1984 film ''[[Fear City]]'', playing an uncredited role as a boxer. He upgraded to larger roles in the 1990s, playing villains in the [[Dale Cook]] vehicles ''Blood Ring'', ''Fist of Steel'', and ''Blood Ring 2''.\n\n===Chiropractic===\nNielsen earned a [[chiropractic]] doctorate from [[Cleveland University-Kansas City]] in 1986<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/> and was nationally certified in 1988. He began treating patients immediately after graduation. Beginning in 1987, he traveled to [[Thailand]] to train at [[Muay Thai]] gyms, where he treated his fellow kickboxers and learned that chiropractic wasn't widely practiced in the country. He subsequently partnered with Paolo Memorial Hospital and participated in monthly charity tours \u2013 offering chiropractic treatment to far-flung and impoverished villages. Seeking to establish chiropractic as a legitimate business in Thailand, he opened Dr. Don's Center for Natural Health in March 1993.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/>\n\nAs chiropractic was not yet adopted by Thailand's Ministry of Public Health, Nielsen's enterprise brought him into conflict with authorities - at one point being arrested and charged with practicing medicine without a license and running a clinic without a permit.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/><ref name=\"Chiropractic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc_ca/article.php?id=53124 |title=Chiropractic Licensed in Thailand |publisher=ChiroWeb.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}</ref> Though allowed to continue his business, he was required to do so under [[physical therapy]] and [[nursing]] licenses. Nielsen consequently became an activist, advocating that chiropractic be legally practiced without oversight by the [[Medical Council of Thailand]].<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/> In 2006, as the result of various efforts, chiropractic became a legal profession in the country<ref name=\"Chiropractic\"/> and Nielsen was able to practice freely.\n\nDuring his career, Nielsen served within many organizations furthering chiropractic practice, including the Subcommittee of Chiropractic via the Ministry of Public Health; he served from 2005 to 2009.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/> He was the co-founder and vice president of the Thailand Chiropractic Association, secretary of the steering committee under the Asian Chiropractic Federation, president of the Thailand chapter of the Federation International du Chiropractique de Sportif (FICS), and founder and president of the Thailand International Chiropractic Organization (TICO). He was also the founder and first president of the Chiropractic Association of Thailand and the founder of the Bio Energy Asia clinic in Bangkok.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/>\n\n==Death==\nOn August 14, 2017, Nielsen underwent surgery in [[Bangkok]] to treat an infection on his legs that had caused [[sepsis]] and [[renal failure]]. During the procedure, he suffered a [[heart attack]] and fell into a [[coma]]. More heart attacks followed, and Nielsen died within two days of his admission of the hospital. He was 58 years old.<ref name=\"efight\">{{cite web|url=http://efight.jp/news-20170818_266031 |title=[Old news] Don Nakaya Nielsen, who fought Akira Maeda, died (Japanese) |publisher=eFight |date=2017-08-18 |accessdate=2018-06-20}}</ref>\n\nNielsen's death was observed in [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. In Bangkok, funeral and cremation rites were performed at the Wat That Thong temple from August 22 to August 24. On September 16, a wake was held at the Rolling Hills Method Church in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nNielsen was married to his wife Cheryl, and the couple had three sons: Corey, Casey, and Colby. He also had three brothers: Scott, Greg, and Jon.<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\"/>\n\nNielsen was [[Multilingualism|trilingual]], being fluent in [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Thai language|Thai]].\n\n==Fighting style==\nAn aggressive fighter characterized by his powerful striking ability, Nielsen synthesized his [[boxing]] and [[martial arts]] skills into a formidable offensive technique. He engaged his [[kickboxing]] opponents head-on, frequently forcing them into a corner or against the ropes and pummeling them with roundhouse kicks and punches. Nielsen was capable of a more intricate approach as well, utilizing lunging attacks with precision striking reminiscent of [[karate]] point fighting. He was a [[knockout]]-focused fighter, with 22 of his 37 wins in late 1992 being the result of KO.<ref name=\"BusinessReview\"/>\n\nNielsen's primary weakness was his defense, which was exploited by [[world championship|world champion]]-level opponents. Future [[K-1 Grand Prix '94]] runner-up [[Masaaki Satake]] was able to control his rematch against Nielsen with counter strikes, and multi-time world champion [[Rob Kaman]] knocked him down repeatedly during their bout with his signature low kicks.\n\n==Championships==\n'''[[World Kickboxing Association]]'''\n* [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] United States Cruiserweight Champion\n* [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] International Heavyweight Champion\n'''[[Universal Kickboxing Federation]]'''\n* [[Universal Kickboxing Federation|UKF]] International Heavyweight Champion\n\n==Kickboxing record (incomplete)==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Date'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Result'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Opponent'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Event'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Method'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Round'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Time'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Location'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Record'''\n|-\n| September 4, 1993\n| {{no2}}Loss\n| {{flagicon|Japan}} [[Masaaki Satake]]\n| [[K-1 Illusion]]\n| TKO (3 Knockdowns/Right Hook)\n| 1\n| 2:30\n| {{flagicon|Japan}} [[Osaka]], Japan\n|-\n!

As an [[alternative medicine]] practitioner, Nielsen played an active role in legalizing chiropractic practice in [[Thailand]].\n\n==Early life==\nNielsen was born in [[Los Angeles]] on July 4, 1959 to Howard and Beth Nielsen.<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\"/> He began his formal [[martial arts]] training at age 10, studying [[tang soo do]] under a cousin who operated a [[dojo]] owned by [[Chuck Norris]].<ref name=\"BusinessReview\">{{cite journal |date=1993 |title=Don Nakaya Nielson |journal=Business Review |volume=22 |page=23 }}</ref> Competition in [[karate]] soon followed.<ref name=\"CitizenJournal\">{{cite web|url=http://citizen-journal.link/don-nakaya-nielsen/ |title=Don Nakaya Nielsen Dies! (Japanese) |publisher=Citizen Journal |date= |accessdate=2017-12-04}}</ref> He attended [[Whittier College]] on an athletic scholarship, playing [[American football|football]] and majoring in [[pre-medicine]].<ref name=\"BioEnergy\">{{cite web|url=http://bioenergyasia.com/index.php/about-us/profile/ |title=Tribute to Our Founder|publisher=Bio Energy Asia |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n===Kickboxing===\nAfter winning a [[Golden Gloves]] title in [[amateur boxing]]<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rafu.com/don-nakaya-nielsen/ |title=Don Nakaya Nielsen |publisher=Rafu Shimpo |date= |accessdate=2018-06-04}}</ref>, Nielsen moved on to professional [[kickboxing]]. He established himself in the [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]], amassing an early record of 12-4 with all wins coming by way of [[knockout]]. The golden days of his career began with his winning the WKA US Cruiserweight Championship: holding the title for most of his fighting days, Nielsen made his name as an aggressive knockout artist who defeated his opponents within the early rounds. His willingness to compete internationally led him to fight and train in [[Japan]], where he embraced his Japanese heritage en route to becoming one of the country's most popular sports stars. With Japanese fans accepting him as one of their countrymen, he represented Japan in international bouts and was one of the nation's only heavyweight kickboxers during his career.<ref name=\"BusinessReview\"/>\n\nIn May 1989, Nielsen entered world-class competition by challenging budding superstar [[Kevin Rosier]] for his WKA World Super Heavyweight Championship. With a record of 14-2, Rosier was half as experienced as Nielsen but was significantly taller and maintained a weight advantage of over 45 pounds (20.4 kilos). Frustration between the fighters rose as the number of committed [[foul (sports)|fouls]] mounted and Nielsen slowed the match\u2019s pace by repeatedly falling to the canvas. The fight ended in the sixth round when a visibly angered Rosier threw Nielsen onto the ring ropes and landed an unprotected blow to the face, leading to a [[technical knockout]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMhQpekHUko|title=Kevin Rosier Vs. Don Nakaya Nielsen (14-5-89)|first=|last=|date=2 March 2019|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nNielsen attempted to make up for this loss later in the year with a contest against [[Rob Kaman]], a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Muay Thai]] stylist attaining legendary status as an international champion. Nielsen sought to match his opponent\u2019s signature low kicks but found himself repeatedly swept by Kaman\u2019s legs before being knocked out by a surprise right hook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ay_TxLq1q30|title=\u30ed\u30d6\u30fb\u30ab\u30fc\u30de\u30f3 vs \u30c9\u30f3\u4e2d\u77e2\u30cb\u30fc\u30eb\u30bb\u30f3 2/2|first=|last=|date=29 April 2007|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> The following year, Nielsen met future world champion [[Masaaki Satake]] in the latter\u2019s debut match. Nielsen swarmed his less-experienced opponent early on but was unsettled by Satake\u2019s repeated headbutts, eventually dropping his guard and being knocked out by a right hook.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ozbpEgU0dKY|title=Don Nakaya Nielsen Vs. Masaaki Satake (30-6-90)|first=|last=|date=4 March 2019|publisher=|accessdate=15 May 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn the following three years, Nielsen continued to fight internationally, winning the WKA International Heavyweight Championship in 1992 but still falling short of world titles. His final match took place in September 1993 at the [[K-1 Illusion]] event, for the UKF World Heavyweight Championship, against returning opponent Masaaki Satake. More experienced at this time, Satake fought primarily with counter-strikes, rarely allowing even a single one of Nielsen\u2019s blows to go unrequited. He knocked Nielsen down three times within the opening round, leading to a TKO loss as per [[K-1]] rules.\n\n===Pro wrestling===\nNielsen's [[kickboxing]] success allowed an easy expansion to [[professional wrestling]], which he participated in alongside his fighting career. A participant of the [[shoot wrestling]] style, Nielsen's matches were designed to look as realistic as possible with Nielsen wearing boxing gloves to emphasize his kickboxing background. His list of opponents from 1986 to 1993 includes ring legends [[Akira Maeda]], [[Keiichi Yamada]], and [[Yoshiaki Fujiwara]]. He wrestled primarily for [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]].\n\n===Mixed martial arts===\nNielsen's most famous sporting endeavor was a one-time event in the budding field of [[mixed martial arts]]. On October 4, 1992, he met [[Ken Shamrock]] in a mixed rules bout - the first time in [[Japan]] that a [[professional wrestling|pro wrestler]] had fought a [[kickboxing|kickboxer]] in televised no-holds-barred competition. Nielsen was quickly submitted by Shamrock, who took advantage of his opponent's limited grappling experience and the fact that Nielsen had opted to wear boxing gloves. The match elevated Japanese interest in MMA competition and helped lead to the formation of [[Pancrase|Pancrase Hybrid Wrestling]].<ref name=\"Shamrock\">{{Cite book |last=Shamrock |first=Ken |title=Beyond the Lion's Den: The Life, The Fights, The Techniques |year=2012|publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9780804846592}}</ref>\n\n===Acting===\nNielsen made his [[acting]] debut in the 1984 film ''[[Fear City]]'', playing an uncredited role as a boxer. He upgraded to larger roles in the 1990s, playing villains in the [[Dale Cook]] vehicles ''Blood Ring'', ''Fist of Steel'', and ''Blood Ring 2''.\n\n===Chiropractic===\nNielsen earned a [[chiropractic]] doctorate from [[Cleveland University-Kansas City]] in 1986<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/> and was nationally certified in 1988. He began treating patients immediately after graduation. Beginning in 1987, he traveled to [[Thailand]] to train at [[Muay Thai]] gyms, where he treated his fellow kickboxers and learned that chiropractic wasn't widely practiced in the country. He subsequently partnered with Paolo Memorial Hospital and participated in monthly charity tours \u2013 offering chiropractic treatment to far-flung and impoverished villages. Seeking to establish chiropractic as a legitimate business in Thailand, he opened Dr. Don's Center for Natural Health in March 1993.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/>\n\nAs chiropractic was not yet adopted by Thailand's Ministry of Public Health, Nielsen's enterprise brought him into conflict with authorities - at one point being arrested and charged with practicing medicine without a license and running a clinic without a permit.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/><ref name=\"Chiropractic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc_ca/article.php?id=53124 |title=Chiropractic Licensed in Thailand |publisher=ChiroWeb.com |date= |accessdate=2018-06-06}}</ref> Though allowed to continue his business, he was required to do so under [[physical therapy]] and [[nursing]] licenses. Nielsen consequently became an activist, advocating that chiropractic be legally practiced without oversight by the [[Medical Council of Thailand]].<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/> In 2006, as the result of various efforts, chiropractic became a legal profession in the country<ref name=\"Chiropractic\"/> and Nielsen was able to practice freely.\n\nDuring his career, Nielsen served within many organizations furthering chiropractic practice, including the Subcommittee of Chiropractic via the Ministry of Public Health; he served from 2005 to 2009.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/> He was the co-founder and vice president of the Thailand Chiropractic Association, secretary of the steering committee under the Asian Chiropractic Federation, president of the Thailand chapter of the Federation International du Chiropractique de Sportif (FICS), and founder and president of the Thailand International Chiropractic Organization (TICO). He was also the founder and first president of the Chiropractic Association of Thailand and the founder of the Bio Energy Asia clinic in Bangkok.<ref name=\"BioEnergy\"/>\n\n==Death==\nOn August 14, 2017, Nielsen underwent surgery in [[Bangkok]] to treat an infection on his legs that had caused [[sepsis]] and [[renal failure]]. During the procedure, he suffered a [[heart attack]] and fell into a [[coma]]. More heart attacks followed, and Nielsen died within two days of his admission of the hospital. He was 58 years old.<ref name=\"efight\">{{cite web|url=http://efight.jp/news-20170818_266031 |title=[Old news] Don Nakaya Nielsen, who fought Akira Maeda, died (Japanese) |publisher=eFight |date=2017-08-18 |accessdate=2018-06-20}}</ref>\n\nNielsen's death was observed in [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. In Bangkok, funeral and cremation rites were performed at the Wat That Thong temple from August 22 to August 24. On September 16, a wake was held at the Rolling Hills Method Church in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\"/>\n\n==Personal life==\nNielsen was married to his wife Cheryl, and the couple had three sons: Corey, Casey, and Colby. He also had three brothers: Scott, Greg, and Jon.<ref name=\"RafuShimpo\"/>\n\nNielsen was [[Multilingualism|trilingual]], being fluent in [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Thai language|Thai]].\n\n==Fighting style==\nAn aggressive fighter characterized by his powerful striking ability, Nielsen synthesized his [[boxing]] and [[martial arts]] skills into a formidable offensive technique. He engaged his [[kickboxing]] opponents head-on, frequently forcing them into a corner or against the ropes and pummeling them with roundhouse kicks and punches. Nielsen was capable of a more intricate approach as well, utilizing lunging attacks with precision striking reminiscent of [[karate]] point fighting. He was a [[knockout]]-focused fighter, with 22 of his 37 wins in late 1992 being the result of KO.<ref name=\"BusinessReview\"/>\n\nNielsen's primary weakness was his defense, which was exploited by [[world championship|world champion]]-level opponents. Future [[K-1 Grand Prix '94]] runner-up [[Masaaki Satake]] was able to control his rematch against Nielsen with counter strikes, and multi-time world champion [[Rob Kaman]] knocked him down repeatedly during their bout with his signature low kicks.\n\n==Championships==\n'''[[World Kickboxing Association]]'''\n* [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] United States Cruiserweight Champion\n* [[World Kickboxing Association|WKA]] International Heavyweight Champion\n'''[[Universal Kickboxing Federation]]'''\n* [[Universal Kickboxing Federation|UKF]] International Heavyweight Champion\n\n==Kickboxing record (incomplete)==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em auto; font-size:85%; text-align:center;\"\n|-  style=\"text-align:center; background:#f0f0f0;\"\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Date'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Result'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Opponent'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Event'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Method'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Round'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Time'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Location'''\n|  style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|'''Record'''\n|-\n| September 4, 1993\n| {{no2}}Loss\n| {{flagicon|Japan}} [[Masaaki Satake]]\n| [[K-1 Illusion]]\n| TKO (3 Knockdowns/Right Hook)\n| 1\n| 2:30\n| {{flagicon|Japan}} [[Osaka]], Japan\n|-\n!

The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair [[Dan Quayle]], the former Vice-President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because it had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the [[CAW National Council 4000|CAW]]. At first, Air Canada selected Victor Li's ''Trinity Time Investments'', which initially asked for a board veto and the chairmanship in return for investing $650 million in the airline.

After Air Canada and Aeroplan changed the division of points collection and redemption, Air Canada introduced an internal rewards program, Altitude. The two programs operate in conjunction.\n\nOn 11 May 2017, Air Canada announced it plans to launch a new loyalty program to replace Aeroplan and Altitude in 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=Galleries Aimia shares crash after Air Canada parts ways with Aeroplan loyalty program|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/air-canada-aeroplan-1.4109868|accessdate=12 May 2017|date=11 May 2017}}</ref> On 10 January 2019, Air Canada re-acquired Aeroplan from Aimia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/air-canada-closes-aeroplan-loyalty-programme-purchase/130931.article|title=Air Canada closes Aeroplan loyalty programme purchase|last=Hemmerdinger|first=Jon|date=10 January 2019|website=Flight Global|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://skift.com/2019/01/15/air-canada-completes-bringing-aeroplan-loyalty-program-into-its-fold/|title=Air Canada Completes Bringing Aeroplan Loyalty Program Into Its Fold|date=2019-01-15|website=Skift|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref>\n\n===Air Canada Altitude===\nOn 20 September 2012, Air Canada unveiled its new frequent flyer status program named \"Air Canada Altitude\" to supplement Aeroplan. Aeroplan remained the frequent flyer rewards program, collecting miles which can be \"spent\", whereas status level is determined by Altitude standing.\n\nThere are five levels of membership in Air Canada's Altitude Program: Basic, Prestige 25K, Elite 35K, Elite 50K, Elite 75K and Super Elite 100K. The latter three are called \"Top Tier\" membership levels and provide travel benefits such as upgrades, lounge access, priority services (e.g., check-in, luggage handling), and bonuses when earning miles through air travel. In order to qualify for these levels, a member must earn, through flight activities, a certain number of miles ''or'' a certain number of segments ''and'' spending some level of money. Altitude refers to these as Altitude Qualifying Miles (AQM), Segments (AQS), and Dollars (AQD).\n\nPrestige members and Altitude Elite 35 K receive Star Alliance Silver status, while Elite 50K, Elite 75K, and Super Elite 100K members receive Star Alliance Gold status.\n\nAir Canada Status Miles are calculated on an annual basis (1 January through 31 December) to determine Altitude Membership Status for the following benefit year (1 March through 28 February). At the 35K and above levels, that level of status is granted when achieved, for the remainder of the current year, as well as for the next year.\n\nThis coincides with the alliance with [[Star Alliance]], and this can give you access to any Star Alliance lounge (you must be Star Alliance Gold) and discounts or upgrades on another Star Alliance member. \n\n===Status requirements===\n\nBeginning 1 January 2016, for the 2017 status year, Air Canada began requiring a minimum spend level for each level, Altitude Qualifying Dollars. The requirements were not changed for 2018, and thus are currently at:\n{{col div}}\n*Altitude Prestige: 25,000 AQM or 25 AQS and $3,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 35K: 35,000 AQM or 35 AQS and $4,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 50K: 50,000 AQM or 50 AQS and $6,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 75K: 75,000 AQM or 75 AQS and $9,000 AQD\n*Altitude Super Elite: 100,000 AQM or 95 AQS and $20,000 AQD\n{{col div end}}\n==Accidents and incidents==\n{{for|incidents before 1963|Trans-Canada Air Lines}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Flight number\n!Description\n|-\n|<center>13 June 1964</center>\n|<center>3277</center>\n|[[Vickers Viscount]] registration CF-THT was damaged beyond economical repair when it crash-landed at Toronto Airport after the failure of two engines on approach.<ref name=ASN130664>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19640613-1 |title=Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|<center>19 May 1967</center>\n|\n|[[Douglas DC-8|McDonnell Douglas DC-8-54F]] CF-TJM crashed and burned on a training flight while making a three-engine landing at [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa]], Ontario.

The Cerberus bid would have seen former Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] installed as chairman, being recruited by Cerberus' international advisory board chair [[Dan Quayle]], the former Vice-President of the United States. Cerberus was rejected because it had a reputation of changing existing employee pension agreements, a move strongly opposed by the [[CAW National Council 4000|CAW]].

Aeroplan remained the frequent flyer rewards program, collecting miles which can be \"spent\", whereas status level is determined by Altitude standing.\n\nThere are five levels of membership in Air Canada's Altitude Program: Basic, Prestige 25K, Elite 35K, Elite 50K, Elite 75K and Super Elite 100K. The latter three are called \"Top Tier\" membership levels and provide travel benefits such as upgrades, lounge access, priority services (e.g., check-in, luggage handling), and bonuses when earning miles through air travel. In order to qualify for these levels, a member must earn, through flight activities, a certain number of miles ''or'' a certain number of segments ''and'' spending some level of money. Altitude refers to these as Altitude Qualifying Miles (AQM), Segments (AQS), and Dollars (AQD).\n\nPrestige members and Altitude Elite 35 K receive Star Alliance Silver status, while Elite 50K, Elite 75K, and Super Elite 100K members receive Star Alliance Gold status.\n\nAir Canada Status Miles are calculated on an annual basis (1 January through 31 December) to determine Altitude Membership Status for the following benefit year (1 March through 28 February). At the 35K and above levels, that level of status is granted when achieved, for the remainder of the current year, as well as for the next year.\n\nThis coincides with the alliance with [[Star Alliance]], and this can give you access to any Star Alliance lounge (you must be Star Alliance Gold) and discounts or upgrades on another Star Alliance member. \n\n===Status requirements===\n\nBeginning 1 January 2016, for the 2017 status year, Air Canada began requiring a minimum spend level for each level, Altitude Qualifying Dollars. The requirements were not changed for 2018, and thus are currently at:\n{{col div}}\n*Altitude Prestige: 25,000 AQM or 25 AQS and $3,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 35K: 35,000 AQM or 35 AQS and $4,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 50K: 50,000 AQM or 50 AQS and $6,000 AQD\n*Altitude Elite 75K: 75,000 AQM or 75 AQS and $9,000 AQD\n*Altitude Super Elite: 100,000 AQM or 95 AQS and $20,000 AQD\n{{col div end}}\n==Accidents and incidents==\n{{for|incidents before 1963|Trans-Canada Air Lines}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Date\n!Flight number\n!Description\n|-\n|<center>13 June 1964</center>\n|<center>3277</center>\n|[[Vickers Viscount]] registration CF-THT was damaged beyond economical repair when it crash-landed at Toronto Airport after the failure of two engines on approach.<ref name=ASN130664>{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19640613-1 |title=Accident description |publisher=Aviation Safety Network |accessdate=6 October 2009}}</ref>\n|-\n|<center>19 May 1967</center>\n|\n|[[Douglas DC-8|McDonnell Douglas DC-8-54F]] CF-TJM crashed and burned on a training flight while making a three-engine landing at [[Ottawa Macdonald-Cartier International Airport|Ottawa]], Ontario.
