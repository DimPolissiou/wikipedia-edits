The film stars [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] and [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]. It tells a story of a [[Russians in the United Kingdom|Russian-British]] midwife, Anna (Watts), who delivers the baby of a drug-addicted 14-year old Russian prostitute who dies in childbirth. After Anna learns that the teen was [[sex trafficking|forced into prostitution]] by the [[Russian Mafia]] in [[London]], the leader of the Russian gangsters (Mueller-Stahl) threatens the baby's life to keep Anna from telling the police about their sex trafficking ring. As Anna tries to protect the baby, she is enmeshed deeper into the criminal underworld, and she is threatened by the Mafia leader's son (Cassel) and warned off by the son's strong-arm man (Mortensen).\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 2006, in locations in and around London. The film has been noted for its [[plot twist]], the subject of [[sex trafficking]], and for its violence and realistic depiction of Russian career criminals, which includes detailed portrayal of the tattoos which indicate their crimes and criminal status. ''Eastern Promises'' received positive critical reception, appearing on several critics' \"top 10 films\" lists for 2007. The film has won several awards, including the Audience Prize for best film at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and the Best Actor award for Mortensen at the [[British Independent Film Awards]]. The film received twelve [[Genie Award]] nominations and three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations. Mortensen was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nAnna Khitrova, a British-Russian [[midwife]] at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth. She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, which is owned by Semyon, an old [[Thief in law|vor]] in the [[Russian mafia]]. Anna sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the baby girl, and meets with Semyon, who offers to help. Anna's mother Helen does not discourage her, but Anna's Russian uncle Stepan, who claims he is a former [[KGB]] officer, urges caution. When Stepan translates Tatiana's diary, Anna comes to learn that Semyon had raped the girl after his son Kirill's failed attempt to do so (on account of his homosexuality), gotten her addicted to heroin, and forced her into prostitution. Ultimately, Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon.\n\nSemyon's driver, Nikolai Luzhin, also serves as the family \"cleaner\", removing evidence and dumping murdered bodies in the [[River Thames]]. Through Nikolai, Semyon, fearing prosecution, promises to give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she hands back the diary. Nikolai takes the diary and gives a location, but urges Anna to keep the baby in London. Semyon orders Nikolai to kill Stepan, who soon goes missing. As Nikolai's star rises within the ''vory'', Semyon sponsors him as a full member, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Semyon's playboy son Kirill, who authorized an ill-advised hit on a rival Chechen ''vory'' leader with the help of a Turkish associate, Azim, and without Semyon's approval. Two Chechen hit men soon arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim's mentally handicapped nephew, who also took part in the hit. Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into taking Kirill's place during a meeting at the baths with Azim. The Chechens attack, thinking Nikolai is Kirill, but Nikolai kills them both, ending up in the hospital with severe wounds.\n\nIt is revealed that Nikolai is actually an [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] agent who has infiltrated the gang, working under license from the British Government. As part of his undercover duties, Nikolai was able to read Tatiana's diary before Semyon destroyed it, and hatches a plan with his handler to have Semyon arrested for [[statutory rape]], with a paternity test of Tatiana's baby as evidence. Nikolai tells Anna that Stepan is safe, in a 5-star hotel in [[Edinburgh]] for protection. Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her. However, as Kirill sits by the Thames working up the courage to throw the child in, Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back. Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses. Nikolai succeeds Semyon as boss of the organization and Anna gains custody of Tatiana's baby, whom she names Christine.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Nikolai Luzhin\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Anna Ivanovna Khitrova\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Kirill\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Semyon\n* [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] as Helen\n* [[Mina E.

The Broadway Market hair dresser known as \"Broadway Gents Hairstylist\" was changed to \"Azim's Hair Salon\", where in the film one of the Russians is murdered. The owner Mr. Ismail Yesiloglu decided to keep most of the shop front after filming. In the original script, the name was \"Ozim's Hair Salon\", but it was later changed to \"Azim's\" as there is no such name as Ozim in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The \"Trafalgar Hospital\" is actually the [[Middlesex Hospital]], a hospital in the [[Fitzrovia]] area of London, which closed to patients in December 2005. The building in central London, which was knocked down in 2008, had the inscription 'Trafalgar Hospital', matching the style and apparent age of the old Middlesex Hospital, inserted into the legend above the main door. The fight scene in the Turkish Baths was filmed on a custom set<ref>Per DVD commentary.</ref> based on the [[Ironmonger Row Baths]] in [[Islington]].\n\n===Tattoos===\n{{See also|Russian criminal tattoos}}\nViggo Mortensen studied Russian gangsters and their tattoos.

The film stars [[Viggo Mortensen]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Vincent Cassel]], [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] and [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]]. It tells a story of a [[Russians in the United Kingdom|Russian-British]] midwife, Anna (Watts), who delivers the baby of a drug-addicted 14-year old Russian prostitute who dies in childbirth. After Anna learns that the teen was [[sex trafficking|forced into prostitution]] by the [[Russian Mafia]] in [[London]], the leader of the Russian gangsters (Mueller-Stahl) threatens the baby's life to keep Anna from telling the police about their sex trafficking ring. As Anna tries to protect the baby, she is enmeshed deeper into the criminal underworld, and she is threatened by the Mafia leader's son (Cassel) and warned off by the son's strong-arm man (Mortensen).\n\n[[Principal photography]] began in November 2006, in locations in and around London. The film has been noted for its [[plot twist]], the subject of [[sex trafficking]], and for its violence and realistic depiction of Russian career criminals, which includes detailed portrayal of the tattoos which indicate their crimes and criminal status. ''Eastern Promises'' received positive critical reception, appearing on several critics' \"top 10 films\" lists for 2007. The film has won several awards, including the Audience Prize for best film at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] and the Best Actor award for Mortensen at the [[British Independent Film Awards]]. The film received twelve [[Genie Award]] nominations and three [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations. Mortensen was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]].\n\n==Plot==\nAnna Khitrova, a British-Russian [[midwife]] at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth. She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian Restaurant, which is owned by Semyon, an old [[Thief in law|vor]] in the [[Russian mafia]]. Anna sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the baby girl, and meets with Semyon, who offers to help. Anna's mother Helen does not discourage her, but Anna's Russian uncle Stepan, who claims he is a former [[KGB]] officer, urges caution. When Stepan translates Tatiana's diary, Anna comes to learn that Semyon had raped the girl after his son Kirill\u2019s failed attempt to do so (on account of his homosexuality), gotten her addicted to heroin, and forced her into prostitution. Ultimately, Anna realizes that the baby was fathered by Semyon.\n\nSemyon's driver, Nikolai Luzhin, also serves as the family \"cleaner\", removing evidence and dumping murdered bodies in the [[River Thames]]. Through Nikolai, Semyon, fearing prosecution, promises to give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she hands back the diary. Nikolai takes the diary and gives a location, but urges Anna to keep the baby in London. Semyon orders Nikolai to kill Stepan, who soon goes missing. As Nikolai's star rises within the ''vory'', Semyon sponsors him as a full member, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Semyon's playboy son Kirill, who authorized an ill-advised hit on a rival Chechen ''vory'' leader with the help of a Turkish associate, Azim, and without Semyon's approval. Two Chechen hit men soon arrive in London seeking vengeance and kill Azim's mentally handicapped nephew, who also took part in the hit. Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into taking Kirill's place during a meeting at the baths with Azim. The Chechens attack, thinking Nikolai is Kirill, but Nikolai kills them both, ending up in the hospital with severe wounds.\n\nIt is revealed that Nikolai is actually an [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] agent who has infiltrated the gang, working under license from the British Government. As part of his undercover duties, Nikolai was able to read Tatiana's diary before Semyon destroyed it, and hatches a plan with his handler to have Semyon arrested for [[statutory rape]], with a paternity test of Tatiana's baby as evidence. Nikolai tells Anna that Stepan is safe, in a 5-star hotel in [[Edinburgh]] for protection. Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her. However, as Kirill sits by the Thames working up the courage to throw the child in, Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back. Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses. Nikolai succeeds Semyon as boss of the organization and Anna gains custody of Tatiana's baby, whom she names Christine.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Viggo Mortensen]] as Nikolai Luzhin\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Anna Ivanovna Khitrova\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as Kirill\n* [[Armin Mueller-Stahl]] as Semyon\n* [[Sin\u00e9ad Cusack]] as Helen\n* [[Mina E.

Filming also took place in [[Broadway Market]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and in [[Brompton Cemetery]] in the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea|London Borough of Kensington & Chelsea]]. The \"Trans-Siberian Restaurant\" is located in [[The Farmiloe Building]],<ref>[https://archive.is/20081231211410/http://www.locationworks.com/8889 \"Pictures of the Farmiloe Building at LocationWorks.com\"].{{Dead link|date=October 2010}}</ref> 34 [[St John Street, London|St John Street]], next to [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]].

The Broadway Market hair dresser known as \"Broadway Gents Hairstylist\" was changed to \"Azim's Hair Salon\", where in the film one of the Russians is murdered. The owner Mr. Ismail Yesiloglu decided to keep most of the shop front after filming. In the original script, the name was \"Ozim's Hair Salon\", but it was later changed to \"Azim's\" as there is no such name as Ozim in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]. The \"Trafalgar Hospital\" is actually the [[Middlesex Hospital]], a hospital in the [[Fitzrovia]] area of London, which closed to patients in December 2005. The building in central London, which was knocked down in 2008, had the inscription 'Trafalgar Hospital', matching the style and apparent age of the old Middlesex Hospital, inserted into the legend above the main door. The fight scene in the Turkish Baths was filmed on a custom set<ref>Per DVD commentary.</ref> based on the [[Ironmonger Row Baths]] in [[Islington]].\n\n===Tattoos===\n{{See also|Russian criminal tattoos}}\nViggo Mortensen studied Russian gangsters and their tattoos. Mortensen spent a lot of time with a Russian Mafia specialist, Gilly McKenzie (organised crime specialist for the UN) and also consulted a documentary on the subject called ''[[The Mark of Cain (2000 film)|The Mark of Cain]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/2007/09/09/2007-09-09_viggo_mortensen_digs_into_naked_emotiona.html |title=Viggo Mortensen digs into naked emotional turf |accessdate=September 26, 2007 |author=John Clark |date=September 9, 2007 |work=[[New York Daily News]]}}</ref> The tattoos that he wore, according to the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', were so realistic that diners in a Russian restaurant in London fell silent out of fear, until Mortensen revealed his identity and admitted the tattoos were for a film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ekstrabladet.dk/flash/filmogtv/film/article191518.ece  |title=Viggo is frightening (original Danish title: Viggo er skr\u00e6mmende) |accessdate=September 26, 2007 |author=Nanna Louise Teckemeier |date=January 18, 2007 |work=[[Ekstra Bladet]]|language=da}}</ref> From that day on he washed off his tattoos whenever he went off the set. Mortensen said of the significance of the tattoos:\n\n<blockquote>I talked to them [authentic gangsters and Gilly McKenzie] about what they meant and where they were on the body, what that said about where they'd been, what their specialties were, what their ethnic and geographical affiliations were. Basically their history, their calling card, is their body.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/oscar-acting-nominees-speak-article-1.310149 |title=Oscar acting nominees speak out |work=NyDailyNews.com |date=February 21, 2008 |accessdate=October 15, 2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe crucifix on his chest was once believed to be inappropriate for a mob chauffeur, but it is accurate because during his vor ceremony it is discovered that he was a thief and left his regular life behind at 15. {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Violence===\nConsistent with the trademark violence in much of Cronenberg's work, ''Eastern Promises'' features a graphically violent fight scene in a steam bath where the combatants wield [[Linoleum knife|linoleum knives]]. When asked in an interview about the difference between \"[[gun violence]]\" and \"knife violence,\" Cronenberg replied, \"We have no guns in this movie. There were no guns in the script. The choice of those curved knives we use in the steam bath was mine. They're not some kind of exotic Turkish knives, they're linoleum knives. I felt that these guys could walk around in the streets with these knives, and if they were ever caught, they could say 'we're linoleum cutters'.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/foreign-affairs-david-cronenbergs-eastern-promises/a-blast-from-the-past-joe-strummer-interview |title=''Eastern Promises'' |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |work=Film Society Lincoln Center}}</ref>\n\n==Director's commentary==\nAdam Nayman of ''[[Eye Weekly]]'' reported that director Cronenberg said \"just don't give the plot away\" and Nayman wrote \"his request is understandable.\" Nayman said \"there is one scene \u2013 the in-depth discussion of which prompted the director's anti-spoiler request referenced at the top of this story \u2013 that should rank not only in his personal pantheon of spectacularly deployed gore but among the most exhilaratingly visceral patches of cinema, period, full stop.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_08.30.07/film/feature.php |title=INDELIBLE INK |accessdate=October 22, 2007 |author=Adam Nayman |date=August 30, 2007 |work=[[Eye Weekly]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522151717/http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_08.30.07/film/feature.php |archivedate=May 22, 2011  }}</ref> ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted Cronenberg's quote and agreed, saying: \"He is correct that it would be fatal, because this is not a movie of what or how, but of why.

Smith Corporation was founded in 1874 by Charles Jeremiah Smith as '''C. J. Smith and Sons''', a baby carriage and bicycle parts manufacturer. They began forming steel tubing from sheet metal to make [[bicycle frame]]s.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/a-o-smith-corporation-history/|title=A.O. Smith Corporation History|publisher=Funding Universe}}</ref> By 1895, the company was the largest bicycle parts manufacturer. In 1899, Arthur Oliver Smith, a son of the founder, developed the world\u2019s first pressed steel [[vehicle frame]] and they later began making frames for the [[Peerless|Peerless Automobile Company]], [[Cadillac]], and [[Ford Motor Company]].<ref>Borth, Christy. ''Masters of Mass Production,'' pp.&nbsp;79, 248-9, Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis, IN, 1945.</ref> In 1904, the company incorporated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as A. O. Smith Company.\n\nIn 1913, Lloyd Raymond Smith took over, and in 1914, the company introduced the ''Smith Motor Wheel'', a gasoline-powered device for bicycles and in 1915, they began manufacturing the ''[[Smith Flyer]]'', which they later sold to '''Briggs & Stratton Company''' of Milwaukee. A year later in 1916, A.O. Smith was incorporated in New York, and in 1917, they began manufacturing [[bomb]] casings for [[World War I]].\n\nIn the 1920s, company engineers developed the coated welding rod which they used in manufacturing until 1965, as well as the world\u2019s first fully automated automobile frame [[factory]], with the capability of making a frame every eight seconds, until 1958, the first arc-welded, high-pressure vessel used to refine oil, which the company produced until 1963, and [[Pipeline transport|oil supply line pipes]], until 1972.\n\nIn 1933, the company used the process of fusing glass to steel to make a large single-piece glass-lined brewery tank. Over the next 32 years, they made more than 11,000 glass-lined tanks. In 1936, the company patented the glass-lined [[water heating|water heater]]. Three years later, they began mass-producing residential water heaters, but shifted all production to war-time use during [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1940, the company acquired '''Sawyer Electric''' of Los Angeles, California, a manufacturer of electric motors. In 1942, it once again began to produce bomb casings, as well as [[Propeller (aeronautics)|aircraft propellers]], [[Landing gear|undercarriage]]s, [[torpedo]]es, and air flasks. By 1945, the company had built 4.5 million bombs, 16,750 sets of landing gear, and 46,700 propeller blades. They also built nose frames for the [[B-25]] bomber, water heaters, jeep frames, and components for the atomic bomb project. In 1946, they built a 400,000 square foot residential water heater plant in [[Kankakee, Illinois]]. In 1948, they entered the commercial water heater market after acquiring '''The Burkay Company''' of [[Toledo, Ohio]]. In 1949, the company began producing ''Harvestore'', a [[Glass fused to steel|glass-fused-to-steel]] silo, targeted at dairy and livestock operations.\n \nIn the 1950s, A. O. Smith acquired '''Whirl-A-Way Motors''' of [[Dayton, Ohio]], and consolidated its electric motor manufacturing operations there. The motor division later introduced the hermetic motor, a critical component of air conditioning and refrigeration compressors. Its water heater division introduced the first glass-lined commercial water heater, the ''A. O. Smith Burkay B-65'', and later the company established a glass fiber division to replace steel in many applications. It also expanded into supplying oil field pipe and pipe for service stations, eventually becoming ''Smith Fiberglass Products'' in 1986.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the company opened a commercial water heater and boiler plant in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada. In 1965, the Motor division invented the enclosed canopy, two-compartment motor, a design that improved the reliability in pool pump motors by separating the switching components from the motor windings. In 1967, fourth generation Smith family member, Lloyd B. Smith, was elected chairman and chief executive officer of the company. By 1969, the company had produced its 10 millionth residential water heater, and by 1972, the company had expanded to Europe. In 1974, the ''Conservationist'' line of residential water heaters was introduced. In 1976, the Motor division opened a plant in [[Bray, Ireland]], to supply hermetic motors. In 1978, A.O. Smith began manufacturing storage tanks, beginning with ''Aquastore'', a glass-fused-to-steel tank.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the Automotive Products unit had manufactured over 100 million passenger car frames, and 50 million truck frames, in Milwaukee, and soon after the company opened its first electric motor assembly operations in [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ciudad Acu\u00f1a]], Mexico. In 1990, it developed the first hermetic motor insulation system compatible with R-134a non-ozone-depleting refrigerant. In 1995, they acquired '''Peabody TecTank''' of [[Parsons, Kansas]], allowing A.O. Smith to enter the bulk dry storage market.<ref name=\"CST Industries\">{{cite web|title=CST Industries History |url=http://www.cstindustries.com/history/|publisher=CST Industries}}</ref> That same year the company expanded into Asia by entering two joint-venture agreements: '''Smith Fiberglass Products''' and '''Harbin Composites Corporation''' to make fiberglass pipes for the China's petroleum industry, and '''Water Products Company''' and '''Yuhan Water Heater''' to make residential water heaters. In 1996, the Water Products division introduced the ''Cyclone XHE'' commercial water heater. In 1997, after 90 years in the automotive industry, A.O. Smith sold its Automotive Products Company to '''[[Tower International]]'''. In 1997, they acquired '''UPPCO, Inc.''', making A.O Smith the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of C-frame sub[[fractional horsepower motor]]s. In 1998, they acquired [[General Electric]]\u2019s domestic compressor motor business, as well as the electric motor division of '''[[Magnetek]]'''.

Smith Corporation was founded in 1874 by Charles Jeremiah Smith as '''C. J. Smith and Sons''', a baby carriage and bicycle parts manufacturer. They began forming steel tubing from sheet metal to make [[bicycle frame]]s.<ref name=\"Funding Universe\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/a-o-smith-corporation-history/|title=A.O. Smith Corporation History|publisher=Funding Universe}}</ref> By 1895, the company was the largest bicycle parts manufacturer. In 1899, Arthur Oliver Smith, a son of the founder, developed the world\u2019s first pressed steel [[vehicle frame]] and they later began making frames for the [[Peerless|Peerless Automobile Company]], [[Cadillac]], and [[Ford Motor Company]].<ref>Borth, Christy. ''Masters of Mass Production,'' pp.&nbsp;79, 248-9, Bobbs-Merrill Co., Indianapolis, IN, 1945.</ref> In 1904, the company incorporated in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as A. O. Smith Company.\n\nIn 1913, Lloyd Raymond Smith took over, and in 1914, the company introduced the ''Smith Motor Wheel'', a gasoline-powered device for bicycles and in 1915, they began manufacturing the ''[[Smith Flyer]]'', which they later sold to '''Briggs & Stratton Company''' of Milwaukee. A year later in 1916, A.O. Smith was incorporated in New York, and in 1917, they began manufacturing [[bomb]] casings for [[World War I]].\n\nIn the 1920s, company engineers developed the coated welding rod which they used in manufacturing until 1965, as well as the world\u2019s first fully automated automobile frame [[factory]], with the capability of making a frame every eight seconds, until 1958, the first arc-welded, high-pressure vessel used to refine oil, which the company produced until 1963, and [[Pipeline transport|oil supply line pipes]], until 1972.\n\nIn 1933, the company used the process of fusing glass to steel to make a large single-piece glass-lined brewery tank. Over the next 32 years, they made more than 11,000 glass-lined tanks. In 1936, the company patented the glass-lined [[water heating|water heater]]. Three years later, they began mass-producing residential water heaters, but shifted all production to war-time use during [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1940, the company acquired '''Sawyer Electric''' of Los Angeles, California, a manufacturer of electric motors. In 1942, it once again began to produce bomb casings, as well as [[Propeller (aeronautics)|aircraft propellers]], [[Landing gear|undercarriage]]s, [[torpedo]]es, and air flasks. By 1945, the company had built 4.5 million bombs, 16,750 sets of landing gear, and 46,700 propeller blades. They also built nose frames for the [[B-25]] bomber, water heaters, jeep frames, and components for the atomic bomb project. In 1946, they built a 400,000 square foot residential water heater plant in [[Kankakee, Illinois]]. In 1948, they entered the commercial water heater market after acquiring '''The Burkay Company''' of [[Toledo, Ohio]]. In 1949, the company began producing ''Harvestore'', a [[Glass fused to steel|glass-fused-to-steel]] silo, targeted at dairy and livestock operations.\n \nIn the 1950s, A. O. Smith acquired '''Whirl-A-Way Motors''' of [[Dayton, Ohio]], and consolidated its electric motor manufacturing operations there. The motor division later introduced the hermetic motor, a critical component of air conditioning and refrigeration compressors. Its water heater division introduced the first glass-lined commercial water heater, the ''A. O. Smith Burkay B-65'', and later the company established a glass fiber division to replace steel in many applications. It also expanded into supplying oil field pipe and pipe for service stations, eventually becoming ''Smith Fiberglass Products'' in 1986.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the company opened a commercial water heater and boiler plant in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada. In 1965, the Motor division invented the enclosed canopy, two-compartment motor, a design that improved the reliability in pool pump motors by separating the switching components from the motor windings. In 1967, fourth generation Smith family member, Lloyd B. Smith, was elected chairman and chief executive officer of the company. By 1969, the company had produced its 10 millionth residential water heater, and by 1972, the company had expanded to Europe. In 1974, the ''Conservationist'' line of residential water heaters was introduced. In 1976, the Motor division opened a plant in [[Bray, Ireland]], to supply hermetic motors. In 1978, A.O. Smith began manufacturing storage tanks, beginning with ''Aquastore'', a glass-fused-to-steel tank.\n\nBy the early 1980s, the Automotive Products unit had manufactured over 100 million passenger car frames, and 50 million truck frames, in Milwaukee, and soon after the company opened its first electric motor assembly operations in [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez]] and [[Ciudad Acu\u00f1a]], Mexico. In 1990, it developed the first hermetic motor insulation system compatible with R-134a non-ozone-depleting refrigerant. In 1995, they acquired '''Peabody TecTank''' of [[Parsons, Kansas]], allowing A.O. Smith to enter the bulk dry storage market.<ref name=\"CST Industries\">{{cite web|title=CST Industries History |url=http://www.cstindustries.com/history/|publisher=CST Industries}}</ref> That same year the company expanded into Asia by entering two joint-venture agreements: '''Smith Fiberglass Products''' and '''Harbin Composites Corporation''' to make fiberglass pipes for the China's petroleum industry, and '''Water Products Company''' and '''Yuhan Water Heater''' to make residential water heaters. In 1996, the Water Products division introduced the ''Cyclone XHE'' commercial water heater. In 1997, after 90 years in the automotive industry, A.O. Smith sold its Automotive Products Company to '''[[Tower International]]'''. In 1997, they acquired '''UPPCO, Inc.''', making A.O Smith the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of C-frame sub[[fractional horsepower motor]]s. In 1998, they acquired [[General Electric]]\u2019s domestic compressor motor business, as well as the electric motor division of '''[[Magnetek]]'''. By the end of the decade, Water Products Company had bought out its joint venture partner in Asia, and had opened a plant in [[Nanjing, China]].\n\nIn the 2000s, A. O. Smith made a number of acquisitions, by acquiring '''State Industries, Inc.''', and its subsidiary '''APCOM Inc.''', '''Shenzhen Speeda Industrial Co. Ltd.''', and '''Athens Products''', a supplier of hermetic motors for scroll compressor applications, as well as '''The Changheng Group''' of [[Changzhou]], China, a manufacturer of fractional horsepower motors for HVAC applications, '''Taicang Special Motor Company, Ltd.''', of [[Suzhou]], China, '''Yueyang Zhongmin Special Electrical Machinery Co.

In 2009, the company entered the water purification industry with a new venture, '''A. O. Smith (Shanghai) Water Treatment Products Co. Ltd'''. In 2010, A. O. Smith opened a 76,000 square foot residential water heater manufacturing plant in [[Bangalore, India]], which later expanded to 297000 sq ft operation with expansion to manufacture of water purification products.

According to the [[Bible]], God commanded [[Abraham]] in the [[Binding of Isaac]] to sacrifice his son, but He ultimately provided a ram as a substitute. The [[Ten Commandments]] in the [[Torah]] forbid murder.  In addition, the use of blood (human or otherwise) in cooking is prohibited by the [[Kashrut|kosher dietary laws]] (kashrut).  Blood from slaughtered animals may not be consumed, and it must be drained out of the animal and covered with earth ({{bibleverse||Leviticus|17:12-13|31}}). According to the [[Book of Leviticus]], blood from sacrificed animals may only be placed on the altar of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Great Temple in Jerusalem]] (which no longer existed at the time of the Christian blood libels).

Langmuir, Speculum, Vol. 47, No. 3 (July 1972), pp. 459\u2013482.</ref> The case is mentioned by [[Matthew Paris]] and [[Chaucer]], and thus has become well-known. Its notoriety sprang from the intervention of the Crown, the first time an accusation of ritual killing had been given royal credibility.\n\nThe eight-year-old Hugh disappeared at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 31 July 1255. His body was probably discovered on 29 August,  in a well. A Jew named Copin or Koppin confessed to involvement. He confessed to [[John Lexington|John of Lexington]], a servant of the crown, and relative of the Bishop of Lincoln. The church stood to gain from the establishment of a martyr's cult. Copin's confession was probably in return for the promise that his life should be spared. He is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], who had reached Lincoln at the beginning of October, had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans or Dominicans.<ref>See Langmuir (1972), p479; Jacobs, ''Jewish Ideals'', pp.&nbsp;192\u2013224</ref> Within a few decades, Jews would be [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled from all of England]] in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1657.\n\n===Continental Europe===\n[[File:Ritualmord-Legende.jpg|thumb|[[Simon of Trent]] blood libel. Illustration in Hartmann Schedel's Weltchronik, 1493]]\n\nMuch like the blood libel of England, the history of blood libel in continental Europe consists of unsubstantiated claims made about the corpses of Christian children. There were frequently associated supernatural events speculated about these discoveries and corpses, events which were often attributed by contemporaries to miracles. Also, just as in England, these accusations in continental Europe typically resulted in the execution of numerous Jews \u2014 sometimes even all, or close to all, the Jews in one town. These accusations and their effects also, in some cases, led to royal interference on behalf of the Jews.\n\nThomas of Monmouth's story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent. An early version appears in ''Bonum Universale de Apibus'' ii. 29, \u00a7 23, by [[Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9]] (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote, \"It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.\" Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9 also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to [[Pontius Pilate]], \"His blood be on us, and on our children\" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:25|NIV}}), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages, a condition equated with male menstruation:<ref>Albert Ehrman, \"The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 86</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (\"''solo sanguine Christiano''\").' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.</blockquote>\n\nThomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression \"''solo sanguine Christiano''\" had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus{{snd}} the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering.  Thomas did not mention the name of the \"very learned\" proselyte, but it may have been [[Nicholas Donin]] of [[La Rochelle]], who, in 1240, had a disputation on the [[Talmud]] with [[Yechiel of Paris]], and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas. Nicholas Donin and another Jewish convert, Theobald of Cambridge, are greatly credited with the adoption and the belief of the blood libel myth in Europe.<ref>Albert Ehrman, \"The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 88.</ref>\n\nThe first known case outside England was in [[Blois]], France, in 1171.

The accusation of ritual murder was brought against members of the Jewish community of Damascus. \n* 1840 [[Rhodes blood libel]]: The Jews of [[Rhodes]], under the [[Ottoman Empire]], were accused of murdering a [[Greeks|Greek]] Christian boy. The libel was supported by the local governor and the European consuls posted to Rhodes. Several Jews were arrested and tortured, and the entire Jewish quarter was blockaded for twelve days.

Despite the absurdity of the charge and the relatively progressive nature of society in [[Austria-Hungary]], Hilsner was convicted and sentenced to death.  He was later convicted of an additional unsolved murder, also involving a Christian woman.  In 1901, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. [[Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk]], a prominent Austro-Czech philosophy professor and future president of [[Czechoslovakia]], spearheaded Hilsner's defense.

The [[Pope|Papacy]] generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.\n\nIn 1911, the ''[[Dictionnaire apolog\u00e9tique de la foi catholique]]'', an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations.<ref>English translation [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/blood-libel-view-from-1911.html here].</ref> This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians.  Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] periodical ''[[La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica]]'') promoted the blood libel as truth.<ref>As shown by David Kertzer in ''The Popes Against the Jews'' (New York, 2001), pp. 161\u201363.</ref>\n\nToday, the accusations are almost entirely discredited in Catholic circles, and the cults associated with them have fallen into disfavour.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2018}}  For example, [[Simon of Trent]]'s local status as a saint was removed in 1965. \n\n===Papal pronouncements===\n* [[Pope Innocent IV]] took action against the blood libel: \"5 July 1247 Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent the accusation of Arabs on similar charges\" (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492\u20131404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, pp.&nbsp;188\u2013189, 193\u2013195, 208).  In 1247, he wrote also that \"Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;... they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See... Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,... we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner. Whenever any unjust attacks upon them come under your notice, redress their injuries, and do not suffer them to be visited in the future by similar tribulations\" (''Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1910), Vol. 8, pp.&nbsp;393\u2013394).

Langmuir, Speculum, Vol. 47, No. 3 (July 1972), pp. 459\u2013482.</ref> The case is mentioned by [[Matthew Paris]] and [[Chaucer]], and thus has become well-known. Its notoriety sprang from the intervention of the Crown, the first time an accusation of ritual killing had been given royal credibility.\n\nThe eight-year-old Hugh disappeared at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] on 31 July 1255. His body was probably discovered on 29 August,  in a well. A Jew named Copin or Koppin confessed to involvement. He confessed to [[John Lexington|John of Lexington]], a servant of the crown, and relative of the Bishop of Lincoln. The church stood to gain from the establishment of a martyr's cult. Copin's confession was probably in return for the promise that his life should be spared. He is said to have confessed that the boy had been crucified by the Jews, who had assembled at Lincoln for that purpose. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]], who had reached Lincoln at the beginning of October, had Copin executed and 91 of the Jews of Lincoln seized and sent up to London, where 18 of them were executed. The rest were pardoned at the intercession of the Franciscans or Dominicans.<ref>See Langmuir (1972), p479; Jacobs, ''Jewish Ideals'', pp.&nbsp;192\u2013224</ref> Within a few decades, Jews would be [[Edict of Expulsion|expelled from all of England]] in 1290 and not allowed to return until 1657.\n\n===Continental Europe===\n[[File:Ritualmord-Legende.jpg|thumb|[[Simon of Trent]] blood libel. Illustration in Hartmann Schedel's Weltchronik, 1493]]\n\nMuch like the blood libel of England, the history of blood libel in continental Europe consists of unsubstantiated claims made about the corpses of Christian children. There were frequently associated supernatural events speculated about these discoveries and corpses, events which were often attributed by contemporaries to miracles. Also, just as in England, these accusations in continental Europe typically resulted in the execution of numerous Jews \u2014 sometimes even all, or close to all, the Jews in one town. These accusations and their effects also, in some cases, led to royal interference on behalf of the Jews.\n\nThomas of Monmouth's story of the annual Jewish meeting to decide which local community would kill a Christian child also quickly spread to the continent. An early version appears in ''Bonum Universale de Apibus'' ii. 29, \u00a7 23, by [[Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9]] (a monastery near Cambray). Thomas wrote, \"It is quite certain that the Jews of every province annually decide by lot which congregation or city is to send Christian blood to the other congregations.\" Thomas of Cantimpr\u00e9 also believed that since the time when the Jews called out to [[Pontius Pilate]], \"His blood be on us, and on our children\" ({{bibleverse||Matthew|27:25|NIV}}), they have been afflicted with hemorrhages, a condition equated with male menstruation:<ref>Albert Ehrman, \"The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 86</ref>\n\n<blockquote>A very learned Jew, who in our day has been converted to the (Christian) faith, informs us that one enjoying the reputation of a prophet among them, toward the close of his life, made the following prediction: 'Be assured that relief from this secret ailment, to which you are exposed, can only be obtained through Christian blood (\"''solo sanguine Christiano''\").' This suggestion was followed by the ever-blind and impious Jews, who instituted the custom of annually shedding Christian blood in every province, in order that they might recover from their malady.</blockquote>\n\nThomas added that the Jews had misunderstood the words of their prophet, who by his expression \"''solo sanguine Christiano''\" had meant not the blood of any Christian, but that of Jesus{{snd}} the only true remedy for all physical and spiritual suffering.  Thomas did not mention the name of the \"very learned\" proselyte, but it may have been [[Nicholas Donin]] of [[La Rochelle]], who, in 1240, had a disputation on the [[Talmud]] with [[Yechiel of Paris]], and who in 1242 caused the burning of numerous Talmudic manuscripts in Paris. It is known that Thomas was personally acquainted with this Nicholas. Nicholas Donin and another Jewish convert, Theobald of Cambridge, are greatly credited with the adoption and the belief of the blood libel myth in Europe.<ref>Albert Ehrman, \"The Origins of the Ritual Murder Accusation and Blood Libel,\" Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought, Vol. 15, No. 4 (Spring 1976): 88.</ref>\n\nThe first known case outside England was in [[Blois]], France, in 1171.

The [[Pope|Papacy]] generally opposed them, although it had problems in enforcing its opposition.\n\nIn 1911, the ''[[Dictionnaire apolog\u00e9tique de la foi catholique]]'', an important French Catholic encyclopedia, published an analysis of the blood libel accusations.<ref>English translation [http://counterenlightenment.blogspot.com/2011/04/blood-libel-view-from-1911.html here].</ref> This may be taken as being broadly representative of educated Catholic opinion in continental Europe at that time. The article noted that the popes had generally refrained from endorsing the blood libel, and it concluded that the accusations were unproven in a general sense, but it left open the possibility that some Jews had committed ritual murders of Christians.  Other contemporary Catholic sources (notably the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] periodical ''[[La Civilt\u00e0 Cattolica]]'') promoted the blood libel as truth.<ref>As shown by David Kertzer in ''The Popes Against the Jews'' (New York, 2001), pp. 161\u201363.</ref>\n\nToday, the accusations are almost entirely discredited in Catholic circles, and the cults associated with them have fallen into disfavour.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.|date=February 2018}}  For example, [[Simon of Trent]]'s local status as a saint was removed in 1965. \n\n===Papal pronouncements===\n* [[Pope Innocent IV]] took action against the blood libel: \"5 July 1247 Mandate to the prelates of Germany and France to annul all measures adopted against the Jews on account of the ritual murder libel, and to prevent the accusation of Arabs on similar charges\" (The Apostolic See and the Jews, Documents: 492\u20131404; Simonsohn, Shlomo, pp.&nbsp;188\u2013189, 193\u2013195, 208).  In 1247, he wrote also that \"Certain of the clergy, and princes, nobles and great lords of your cities and dioceses have falsely devised certain godless plans against the Jews, unjustly depriving them by force of their property, and appropriating it themselves;... they falsely charge them with dividing up among themselves on the Passover the heart of a murdered boy...In their malice, they ascribe every murder, wherever it chance to occur, to the Jews. And on the ground of these and other fabrications, they are filled with rage against them, rob them of their possessions without any formal accusation, without confession, and without legal trial and conviction, contrary to the privileges granted to them by the Apostolic See... Since it is our pleasure that they shall not be disturbed,... we ordain that ye behave towards them in a friendly and kind manner.

In 2019, Fabrice Boudot, Pierrick Gaudry, Aurore Guillevic, Nadia Heninger, Emmanuel Thom\u00e9 and Paul Zimmermann factored a 240-digit number ([[RSA-240]]) utilizing  approximately 900 core-years of computing power.<ref>https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/cado-nfs-discuss/2019-December/001139.html</ref> The researchers estimated that a 1024-bit RSA modulus would take about 500 times as long.<ref name=rsa768>{{cite journal\n| url = http://eprint.iacr.org/2010/006.pdf\n| title = Factorization of a 768-bit RSA modulus\n| author = Kleinjung| publisher = [[International Association for Cryptologic Research]]\n| date = 2010-02-18\n| accessdate = 2010-08-09\n|display-authors=etal}}</ref> However, it has not been proven that no efficient algorithm exists. The presumed difficulty of this problem is at the heart of widely used algorithms in [[cryptography]] such as [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]. Many areas of [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]] have been brought to bear on the problem, including [[elliptic curve]]s, [[algebraic number theory]], and [[quantum computer|quantum computing]].\n\nNot all numbers of a given length are equally hard to factor. The hardest instances of these problems (for currently known techniques) are [[semiprime]]s, the product of two prime numbers. When they are both large, for instance more than two thousand [[bit]]s long, randomly chosen, and about the same size (but not too close, for example, to avoid efficient factorization by [[Fermat's factorization method]]), even the fastest prime factorization algorithms on the fastest computers can take enough time to make the search impractical; that is, as the number of digits of the primes being factored increases, the number of operations required to perform the factorization on any computer increases drastically.\n\nMany cryptographic protocols are based on the difficulty of factoring large composite integers or a related problem\u2014for example, the [[RSA problem]]. An algorithm that efficiently factors an arbitrary integer would render [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]]-based [[public-key]] cryptography insecure.\n\n==Prime decomposition==\n[[Image:PrimeDecompositionExample.png|right|thumb|Prime decomposition of 864 as {{math|2<sup>5</sup> \u00d7 3<sup>3</sup>}}]]\nBy the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]], every positive integer has a unique [[Prime factor|prime factorization]]. (By convention, 1 is the [[empty product]].) [[Primality test|Testing]] whether the integer is prime can be done in [[polynomial time]], for example, by the [[AKS primality test]]. If composite, however, the polynomial time tests give no insight into how to obtain the factors.\n\nGiven a general algorithm for integer factorization, any integer can be factored into its constituent [[prime factor]]s by repeated application of this algorithm. The situation is more complicated with special-purpose factorization algorithms, whose benefits may not be realized as well or even at all with the factors produced during decomposition. For example, if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 171 \u00d7 ''p'' \u00d7 ''q''}} where {{nowrap|''p'' < ''q''}} are very large primes, [[trial division]] will quickly produce the factors 3 and 19 but will take ''p'' divisions to find the next factor. As a contrasting example, if ''N'' is the product of the primes 13729, 1372933, and 18848997161, where {{nowrap|1=13729 \u00d7 1372933 = 18848997157}}, Fermat's factorization method will begin with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = \u2308{{sqrt|''N''}}\u2309 = 18848997159}} which immediately yields {{nowrap|1=''b'' = {{sqrt|''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''N''}} = {{sqrt|4}} = 2}} and hence the factors {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2212 ''b'' = 18848997157}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = 18848997161}}. While these are easily recognized as composite and prime respectively, Fermat's method will take much longer to factor the composite number because the starting value of {{nowrap|1=\u2308{{sqrt|18848997157}}\u2309 = 137292}} for ''a'' is nowhere near 1372933.\n\n==Current state of the art==\n{{See also|integer factorization records}}\nAmong the ''b''-bit numbers, the most difficult to factor in practice using existing algorithms are those that are products of two primes of similar size. For this reason, these are the integers used in cryptographic applications. The largest such semiprime yet factored was [[RSA numbers#RSA-250|RSA-250]], a 829-bit number with 250 decimal digits, in February 2020. The total computation time was roughly 2700 core-years of computing using [[Intel]] [[Xeon]] Gold 6130 at 2.1 GHz. Like all recent factorization records, this factorization was completed with a highly optimized implementation of the [[general number field sieve]] run on hundreds of machines.\n\n===Difficulty and complexity===\nNo [[algorithm]] has been published that can factor all integers in [[polynomial time]], that is, that can factor ''b''-bit numbers in time [[Big O notation|O]](''b''<sup>''k''</sup>) for some constant ''k''. Neither the existence nor non-existence of such algorithms has been proved, but it is generally suspected that they do not exist and hence that the problem is not in class P.<ref>{{citation |last=Krantz |first=Steven G. |authorlink=Steven G.

[[Shor's algorithm]] takes only {{math|O(''b''<sup>3</sup>)}} time and O(''b'') space on ''b''-bit number inputs.

This problem is trivially in [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]], and it is not known whether it lies in [[FP (complexity)|FP]] or not. This is the version solved by practical implementations.\n* The [[decision problem]] version: given an integer ''N'' and an integer ''M'' with {{nowrap|1 < ''M'' < ''N''}}, does ''N'' have a factor ''d'' with {{nowrap|1 < ''d'' \u2264 ''M''}}? This version is useful because most well studied complexity classes are defined as classes of decision problems, not function problems. \n\nFor {{nowrap|{{sqrt|''N''}} \u2264 ''M'' < ''N''}}, the decision problem is equivalent to asking whether ''N'' is not prime. \n\nAn algorithm for either version provides one for the other. Repeated application of the function problem (applied to ''d'' and ''N''/''d'', and their factors, if needed) will eventually provide either a factor of ''N'' no larger than ''M'' or a factorization into primes all greater than ''M''. All known algorithms for the decision problem work in this way. Hence it is only of theoretical interest that, with at most log&nbsp;''N'' queries using an algorithm for the decision problem, one would isolate a factor of ''N'' (or prove it prime) by [[binary search]]. \n\nIt is not known exactly which [[computational complexity theory|complexity classes]] contain the decision version of the integer factorization problem. It is known to be in both [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and [[co-NP]]. This is because both \"yes\" and \"no\" answers can be verified in polynomial time. An answer of \"yes\" can be certified by exhibiting a factorization {{nowrap|1=''N'' = ''d''(''N''/''d'')}} with {{nowrap|''d'' \u2264 ''M''}}. An answer of \"no\" can be certified by exhibiting the factorization of ''N'' into distinct primes, all larger than ''M''. We can verify their primality using the [[AKS primality test]] and that their product is ''N'' by multiplication. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] guarantees that there is only one possible string that will be accepted (providing the factors are required to be listed in order), which shows that the problem is in both '''[[UP (complexity)|UP]]''' and '''co-UP'''.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Lance Fortnow\n| title = Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring\n| date = 2002-09-13\n| url = http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html\n}}</ref> It is known to be in [[BQP]] because of Shor's algorithm. It is suspected to be outside of all three of the complexity classes P, NP-complete, and [[co-NP-complete]]. It is therefore a candidate for the [[NP-intermediate]] complexity class. If it could be proved that it is in either NP-complete or co-NP-complete, that would imply NP = co-NP. That would be a very surprising result, and therefore integer factorization is widely suspected to be outside both of those classes. Many people have tried to find classical polynomial-time algorithms for it and failed, and therefore it is widely suspected to be outside P.\n\nIn contrast, the decision problem \"is ''N'' a composite number?\" (or equivalently: \"is ''N'' a prime number?\") appears to be much easier than the problem of actually finding the factors of ''N''. Specifically, the former can be solved in polynomial time (in the number ''n'' of digits of ''N'') with the [[AKS primality test]]. In addition, there are a number of [[randomized algorithm|probabilistic algorithm]]s that can test primality very quickly in practice if one is willing to accept the vanishingly small possibility of error. The ease of [[primality test]]ing is a crucial part of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm, as it is necessary to find large prime numbers to start with.\n\n==Factoring algorithms<!-- This section is linked from [[Factorization]] -->==\n\n===Special-purpose===\nA special-purpose factoring algorithm's running time depends on the properties of the number to be factored or on one of its unknown factors: size, special form, etc. Exactly what the running time depends on varies between algorithms.\n\nAn important subclass of special-purpose factoring algorithms is the ''Category 1'' or ''First Category'' algorithms, whose running time depends on the size of smallest prime factor.

In this factoring algorithm the discriminant \u0394 is chosen as a multiple of ''n'', {{nowrap|1=\u0394 = \u2212''dn''}}, where ''d'' is some positive multiplier. The algorithm expects that for one ''d'' there exist enough [[smooth number|smooth]] forms in ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>. Lenstra and Pomerance show that the choice of ''d'' can be restricted to a small set to guarantee the smoothness result.\n\nDenote by ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub> the set of all primes ''q'' with [[Kronecker symbol]] <math>\\left(\\tfrac{\\Delta}{q}\\right)=1</math>. By constructing a set of [[Generating set of a group|generators]] of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> and prime forms ''f''<sub>q</sub> of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> with ''q'' in ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub> a sequence of relations between the set of generators and ''f''<sub>q</sub> are produced.\nThe size of ''q'' can be bounded by <math>c_0(\\log|\\Delta|)^2</math> for some constant <math>c_0</math>.\n\nThe relation that will be used is a relation between the product of powers that is equal to the [[group (mathematics)|neutral element]] of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>. These relations will be used to construct a so-called ambiguous form of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>, which is an element of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> of order dividing 2. By calculating the corresponding factorization of \u0394 and by taking a [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]], this ambiguous form provides the complete prime factorization of ''n''. This algorithm has these main steps:\n\nLet ''n'' be the number to be factored.\n# Let \u0394 be a negative integer with {{nowrap|1=\u0394 = \u2212''dn''}}, where ''d'' is a multiplier and \u0394 is the negative discriminant of some quadratic form.\n# Take the ''t'' first primes <math>p_1=2,p_2=3,p_3=5, \\dots ,p_t</math>, for some <math>t\\in{\\mathbb N}</math>.\n# Let <math>f_q</math> be a random prime form of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> with <math>\\left(\\tfrac{\\Delta}{q}\\right)=1</math>.\n# Find a generating set ''X'' of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>\n# Collect a sequence of relations between set ''X'' and {{nowrap|{''f<sub>q</sub> : q'' \u2208 ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub>}}} satisfying: <math>\\left(\\prod_{x \\in X_{}} x^{r(x)}\\right).\\left(\\prod_{q \\in P_\\Delta} f^{t(q)}_{q}\\right) = 1</math>\n# Construct an ambiguous form {{tmath|(a, b, c)}} that is an element ''f'' \u2208 ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> of order dividing 2 to obtain a coprime factorization of the largest odd divisor of \u0394 in which <math>\\Delta = -4ac \\text{ or } a(a - 4c) \\text{ or } (b - 2a)(b + 2a)</math>\n# If the ambiguous form provides a factorization of ''n'' then stop, otherwise find another ambiguous form until the factorization of ''n'' is found. In order to prevent useless ambiguous forms from generating, build up the [[Sylow theorems|2-Sylow]] group Sll<sub>2</sub>(\u0394) of ''G''(\u0394).\n\nTo obtain an algorithm for factoring any positive integer, it is necessary to add a few steps to this algorithm such as trial division, and the [[Adleman\u2013Pomerance\u2013Rumely primality test|Jacobi sum test]].\n\n===Expected running time===\nThe algorithm as stated is a [[probabilistic algorithm]] as it makes random choices.

When they are both large, for instance more than two thousand [[bit]]s long, randomly chosen, and about the same size (but not too close, for example, to avoid efficient factorization by [[Fermat's factorization method]]), even the fastest prime factorization algorithms on the fastest computers can take enough time to make the search impractical; that is, as the number of digits of the primes being factored increases, the number of operations required to perform the factorization on any computer increases drastically.\n\nMany cryptographic protocols are based on the difficulty of factoring large composite integers or a related problem\u2014for example, the [[RSA problem]].

For example, if {{nowrap|1=''N'' = 171 \u00d7 ''p'' \u00d7 ''q''}} where {{nowrap|''p'' < ''q''}} are very large primes, [[trial division]] will quickly produce the factors 3 and 19 but will take ''p'' divisions to find the next factor. As a contrasting example, if ''N'' is the product of the primes 13729, 1372933, and 18848997161, where {{nowrap|1=13729 \u00d7 1372933 = 18848997157}}, Fermat's factorization method will begin with {{nowrap|1=''a'' = \u2308{{sqrt|''N''}}\u2309 = 18848997159}} which immediately yields {{nowrap|1=''b'' = {{sqrt|''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''N''}} = {{sqrt|4}} = 2}} and hence the factors {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2212 ''b'' = 18848997157}} and {{nowrap|1=''a'' + ''b'' = 18848997161}}. While these are easily recognized as composite and prime respectively, Fermat's method will take much longer to factor the composite number because the starting value of {{nowrap|1=\u2308{{sqrt|18848997157}}\u2309 = 137292}} for ''a'' is nowhere near 1372933.\n\n==Current state of the art==\n{{See also|integer factorization records}}\nAmong the ''b''-bit numbers, the most difficult to factor in practice using existing algorithms are those that are products of two primes of similar size. For this reason, these are the integers used in cryptographic applications. The largest such semiprime yet factored was [[RSA numbers#RSA-240|RSA-240]], a 795-bit number with 240 decimal digits, in November 2019. This factorization took the equivalent of 900 years of computing on a single-core [[Intel]] [[Xeon]] Gold 6130 at 2.1 GHz. Like all recent factorization records, this factorization was completed with a highly optimized implementation of the [[general number field sieve]] run on hundreds of machines.\n\n===Difficulty and complexity===\nNo [[algorithm]] has been published that can factor all integers in [[polynomial time]], that is, that can factor ''b''-bit numbers in time [[Big O notation|O]](''b''<sup>''k''</sup>) for some constant ''k''. Neither the existence nor non-existence of such algorithms has been proved, but it is generally suspected that they do not exist and hence that the problem is not in class P.<ref>{{citation |last=Krantz |first=Steven G. |authorlink=Steven G.

[[Shor's algorithm]] takes only {{math|O(''b''<sup>3</sup>)}} time and O(''b'') space on ''b''-bit number inputs.

This problem is trivially in [[FNP (complexity)|FNP]], and it is not known whether it lies in [[FP (complexity)|FP]] or not. This is the version solved by practical implementations.\n* The [[decision problem]] version: given an integer ''N'' and an integer ''M'' with {{nowrap|1 < ''M'' < ''N''}}, does ''N'' have a factor ''d'' with {{nowrap|1 < ''d'' \u2264 ''M''}}? This version is useful because most well studied complexity classes are defined as classes of decision problems, not function problems. \n\nFor {{nowrap|{{sqrt|''N''}} \u2264 ''M'' < ''N''}}, the decision problem is equivalent to asking whether ''N'' is not prime. \n\nAn algorithm for either version provides one for the other. Repeated application of the function problem (applied to ''d'' and ''N''/''d'', and their factors, if needed) will eventually provide either a factor of ''N'' no larger than ''M'' or a factorization into primes all greater than ''M''. All known algorithms for the decision problem work in this way. Hence it is only of theoretical interest that, with at most log&nbsp;''N'' queries using an algorithm for the decision problem, one would isolate a factor of ''N'' (or prove it prime) by [[binary search]]. \n\nIt is not known exactly which [[computational complexity theory|complexity classes]] contain the decision version of the integer factorization problem. It is known to be in both [[NP (complexity)|NP]] and [[co-NP]]. This is because both \"yes\" and \"no\" answers can be verified in polynomial time. An answer of \"yes\" can be certified by exhibiting a factorization {{nowrap|1=''N'' = ''d''(''N''/''d'')}} with {{nowrap|''d'' \u2264 ''M''}}. An answer of \"no\" can be certified by exhibiting the factorization of ''N'' into distinct primes, all larger than ''M''. We can verify their primality using the [[AKS primality test]] and that their product is ''N'' by multiplication. The [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] guarantees that there is only one possible string that will be accepted (providing the factors are required to be listed in order), which shows that the problem is in both '''[[UP (complexity)|UP]]''' and '''co-UP'''.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Lance Fortnow\n| title = Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring\n| date = 2002-09-13\n| url = http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html\n}}</ref> It is known to be in [[BQP]] because of Shor's algorithm. It is suspected to be outside of all three of the complexity classes P, NP-complete, and [[co-NP-complete]]. It is therefore a candidate for the [[NP-intermediate]] complexity class. If it could be proved that it is in either NP-complete or co-NP-complete, that would imply NP = co-NP. That would be a very surprising result, and therefore integer factorization is widely suspected to be outside both of those classes. Many people have tried to find classical polynomial-time algorithms for it and failed, and therefore it is widely suspected to be outside P.\n\nIn contrast, the decision problem \"is ''N'' a composite number?\" (or equivalently: \"is ''N'' a prime number?\") appears to be much easier than the problem of actually finding the factors of ''N''. Specifically, the former can be solved in polynomial time (in the number ''n'' of digits of ''N'') with the [[AKS primality test]]. In addition, there are a number of [[randomized algorithm|probabilistic algorithm]]s that can test primality very quickly in practice if one is willing to accept the vanishingly small possibility of error. The ease of [[primality test]]ing is a crucial part of the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm, as it is necessary to find large prime numbers to start with.\n\n==Factoring algorithms<!-- This section is linked from [[Factorization]] -->==\n\n===Special-purpose===\nA special-purpose factoring algorithm's running time depends on the properties of the number to be factored or on one of its unknown factors: size, special form, etc. Exactly what the running time depends on varies between algorithms.\n\nAn important subclass of special-purpose factoring algorithms is the ''Category 1'' or ''First Category'' algorithms, whose running time depends on the size of smallest prime factor.

In this factoring algorithm the discriminant \u0394 is chosen as a multiple of ''n'', {{nowrap|1=\u0394 = \u2212''dn''}}, where ''d'' is some positive multiplier. The algorithm expects that for one ''d'' there exist enough [[smooth number|smooth]] forms in ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>. Lenstra and Pomerance show that the choice of ''d'' can be restricted to a small set to guarantee the smoothness result.\n\nDenote by ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub> the set of all primes ''q'' with [[Kronecker symbol]] <math>\\left(\\tfrac{\\Delta}{q}\\right)=1</math>. By constructing a set of [[Generating set of a group|generators]] of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> and prime forms ''f''<sub>q</sub> of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> with ''q'' in ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub> a sequence of relations between the set of generators and ''f''<sub>q</sub> are produced.\nThe size of ''q'' can be bounded by <math>c_0(\\log|\\Delta|)^2</math> for some constant <math>c_0</math>.\n\nThe relation that will be used is a relation between the product of powers that is equal to the [[group (mathematics)|neutral element]] of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>. These relations will be used to construct a so-called ambiguous form of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>, which is an element of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> of order dividing 2. By calculating the corresponding factorization of \u0394 and by taking a [[Greatest common divisor|gcd]], this ambiguous form provides the complete prime factorization of ''n''. This algorithm has these main steps:\n\nLet ''n'' be the number to be factored.\n# Let \u0394 be a negative integer with {{nowrap|1=\u0394 = \u2212''dn''}}, where ''d'' is a multiplier and \u0394 is the negative discriminant of some quadratic form.\n# Take the ''t'' first primes <math>p_1=2,p_2=3,p_3=5, \\dots ,p_t</math>, for some <math>t\\in{\\mathbb N}</math>.\n# Let <math>f_q</math> be a random prime form of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> with <math>\\left(\\tfrac{\\Delta}{q}\\right)=1</math>.\n# Find a generating set ''X'' of ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub>\n# Collect a sequence of relations between set ''X'' and {{nowrap|{''f<sub>q</sub> : q'' \u2208 ''P''<sub>\u0394</sub>}}} satisfying: <math>\\left(\\prod_{x \\in X_{}} x^{r(x)}\\right).\\left(\\prod_{q \\in P_\\Delta} f^{t(q)}_{q}\\right) = 1</math>\n# Construct an ambiguous form {{tmath|(a, b, c)}} that is an element ''f'' \u2208 ''G''<sub>\u0394</sub> of order dividing 2 to obtain a coprime factorization of the largest odd divisor of \u0394 in which <math>\\Delta = -4ac \\text{ or } a(a - 4c) \\text{ or } (b - 2a)(b + 2a)</math>\n# If the ambiguous form provides a factorization of ''n'' then stop, otherwise find another ambiguous form until the factorization of ''n'' is found. In order to prevent useless ambiguous forms from generating, build up the [[Sylow theorems|2-Sylow]] group Sll<sub>2</sub>(\u0394) of ''G''(\u0394).\n\nTo obtain an algorithm for factoring any positive integer, it is necessary to add a few steps to this algorithm such as trial division, and the [[Adleman\u2013Pomerance\u2013Rumely primality test|Jacobi sum test]].\n\n===Expected running time===\nThe algorithm as stated is a [[probabilistic algorithm]] as it makes random choices.
