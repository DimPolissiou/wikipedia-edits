Rosenthal]] first used the term \"confessional\" in a review of Robert Lowell's ''[[Life Studies]]'' entitled \"[[Poetry as Confession]]\",<ref>''The Nation'', September 19, 1959), reprinted in Rosenthal 1991, pp. 109 &ndash; 112. Rosenthal somewhat reworked the review into an essay \"Robert Lowell and the Poetry of Confession\" in his 1960 book ''The Modern Poets''</ref> Rosenthal differentiated the confessional approach from other modes of lyric poetry by way of its use of confidences that (Rosenthal said) went \"beyond customary bounds of reticence or personal embarrassment\".<ref>[[Ian Hamilton (critic)|Ian Hamilton]], 'A Biographer's Msgivings', collected in ''Walking Possession, Essays & Reviews 1968 &ndash; 1993'', Addison-Wesley, 1994. {{ISBN|0-201-48397-1}}</ref> Rosenthal notes that in earlier tendencies towards the confessional there was typically a \"mask\" that hid the poet's \"actual face\", and states that \"Lowell removes the mask. His speaker is unequivocally himself, and it is hard not to think of ''Life Studies'' as a series of personal confidences, rather shameful, that one is honor-bound not to reveal\".<ref>Rosenthal, 1959.</ref> In a review of the book in ''[[The Kenyon Review]]'', John Thompson wrote, \"For these poems, the question of propriety no longer exists. They have made a conquest: what they have won is a major expansion of the territory of poetry.\"<ref>Thompson, John, \"Two Poets\", ''Kenyon Review'' 21 (1959), pp. 482 &ndash; 490.</ref>\n\nThere were however clear moves towards the \"confessional\" mode before the publication of ''Life Studies''. [[Delmore Schwartz]]'s confessional long poem ''Genesis'' had been published in [[1943 in poetry|1943]]; and [[John Berryman]] had written a sonnet sequence in [[1947 in poetry|1947]] about an adulterous affair he'd had with a woman named Chris while he was married to his first wife, Eileen (however, since publishing the sonnets would have revealed the affair to his wife, Berryman didn't actually publish the sequence, titled ''Berryman's Sonnets'', until [[1967 in poetry|1967]], after he divorced from his first wife).<ref>Kirsch, p. 2, makes this observation in his reassessment of the historical context of ''Life Studies''.</ref><ref>Mariani, Paul. ''Dream Song: The Life of John Berryman''.</ref> Snodgrass' ''Heart's Needle'', in which he writes about the aftermath of his divorce, also preceded ''Life Studies''.\n\n''Life Studies'' was nonetheless the first book in the confessional mode that captured the reading public's attention and the first labeled \"confessional.\" Most notably \"confessional\" were the poems in the final section of ''Life Studies'' in which Lowell alludes to his struggles with mental illness and his hospitalization at McLean's, a mental hospital in Massachusetts. Plath remarked upon the influence of these types of poems from ''Life Studies'' in an interview in which she stated, \"I've been very excited by what I feel is the new breakthrough that came with, say, Robert Lowell's ''Life Studies'', this intense breakthrough into very serious, very personal, emotional experience which I feel has been partly taboo.

''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 199 and p. 792</ref> while one of the most prominent, consciously \"confessional\" poets to emerge in the 1980s was [[Sharon Olds]] whose focus on taboo sexual subject matter built off of the work of Ginsberg.\n\n==Reaction==\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, some writers rebelled against Confessionalism in American poetry, arguing that it was too self-indulgent. For instance, one of the foremost poets of the Deep Image school, [[Robert Bly]], was highly critical of what he perceived to be the [[Solipsism|solipsistic]] tendencies of Confessional poets. He referenced this aesthetic distaste when he praised the poet [[Antonio Machado]] for \"his emphasis on the suffering of others rather than his own\".<ref>Bly, Robert (translator), Machado, Antonio, ''Times Alone'', Wesleyan University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-8195-6081-0}}, page 1.</ref>  However, many others writers during this period, like [[Sharon Olds]], [[Marie Howe]], and [[Franz Wright]], were strongly influenced by the precedent set by Confessional poetry with its themes of taboo autobiographical experience, of the psyche and the self, and revelations of childhood and adult traumas.\n\nOn a similar thread of self-indulgence, biographers of Confessional poets have noticed a shared ambition among these writers to become famous.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blake|first=D.

For instance, one of the foremost poets of the Deep Image school, [[Robert Bly]], was highly critical of what he perceived to be the [[Solipsism|solipsistic]] tendencies of Confessional poets. He referenced this aesthetic distaste when he praised the poet [[Antonio Machado]] for \"his emphasis on the suffering of others rather than his own\".<ref>Bly, Robert (translator), Machado, Antonio, ''Times Alone'', Wesleyan University Press, 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-8195-6081-0}}, page 1.</ref>  However, many others writers during this period, like [[Sharon Olds]], [[Marie Howe]], and [[Franz Wright]], were strongly influenced by the precedent set by Confessional poetry with its themes of taboo autobiographical experience, of the psyche and the self, and revelations of childhood and adult traumas.\n\nOn a similar thread of self-indulgence, biographers of Confessional poets have noticed a shared ambition among these writers to become famous.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blake|first=D.

Churchward]] for heavy freight work.  They were the first [[2-8-0]] 'Consolidation' class in Great Britain.\n\nThe prototype, originally numbered 97 but later renumbered 2800, appeared in 1903.  Construction of the production series commenced in 1905 and continued until 1919.  The [[GWR 2884 Class|2884 Class]] which appeared in 1938\u20131942 was developed from the 2800 class and is sometimes classified with it.\n\n=== Prototype ===\nNo.97 undertook two years of trials before going into production. Initial results suggested that only the front end needed further development. Initially the boiler pressure of the 2-8-0 was set at {{convert|200|lbf/in2|MPa|abbr=on}} with {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} diameter cylinders. Tractive effort started out at {{convert|29775|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} but was increased substantially in the production engines by enlarging the cylinder diameter to {{convert|18+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and raising the steam pressure to {{convert|225|lbf/in2|MPa|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|8+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} piston valves were enlarged to {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== Production ===\nThe most visible difference between No.97 and the first of the 1905 production batch was the higher pitch of the boiler ({{convert|8|ft|2|in|m|2|abbr=on|disp=or}} opposed to {{convert|7|ft|8+1/2|in|m|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}). At first the prototype was given a {{convert|4000|impgal|adj=on}} tender but almost without exception the 2800s were harnessed to the {{convert|3500|impgal|adj=on}} variety throughout their working lives. [[Superheater|Superheating]] was incorporated into the class from 1909 with No.2808 the first to be retro-fitted. Other modifications centred on improving the weight distribution, altering smokebox lengths and fitting larger diameter chimneys. \nThe 84 2800s built by Churchward remained the GWR's principal long haul freight engines throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The only serious problem met with in traffic was with the sealing of the internal steam pipes. Beginning in 1934 most of the class had them replaced with the outside kind.\n\n=== Oil firing ===\nBetween 1945 and 1947, coal shortages caused [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] to experiment with [[Oil burner (engine)|oil fired]] 2800 [[locomotives]] and 12 of the 2800 class were converted. They were renumbered into the 4800 series, which necessitated re-numbering  the entire [[GWR 1400 Class|4800 class]] [[GWR Autocoach|autotanks]] into the 1400 series, and reclassified as 1400 class. The experiment, encouraged by the government was abandoned in 1948 once the extra maintenance costs were calculated and the bill had arrived for the imported oil.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 6 January 1932, locomotive No. 2808 was hauling a freight train was in collision with a milk train at Didcot East Junction. The locomotive was extensively damaged. Ten wagon were destroyed and seventeen more were damaged. The milk train had overrun signals.<ref name=BOT1932>{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_Didcot1932.pdf |title=Great Western Railway |first=E.

An express passenger train collided with the rear portion of the freight due to errors by the guard and signalman.

Initially the boiler pressure of the 2-8-0 was set at {{convert|200|lbf/in2|MPa|abbr=on}} with {{convert|18|in|mm|0|adj=on}} diameter cylinders. Tractive effort started out at {{convert|29775|lbf|kN|abbr=on}} but was increased substantially in the production engines by enlarging the cylinder diameter to {{convert|18+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} and raising the steam pressure to {{convert|225|lbf/in2|MPa|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|8+1/2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} piston valves were enlarged to {{convert|10|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n=== Production ===\nThe most visible difference between No.97 and the first of the 1905 production batch was the higher pitch of the boiler ({{convert|8|ft|2|in|m|2|abbr=on|disp=or}} opposed to {{convert|7|ft|8+1/2|in|m|2|abbr=on|disp=or}}). At first the prototype was given a {{convert|4000|impgal|adj=on}} tender but almost without exception the 2800s were harnessed to the {{convert|3500|impgal|adj=on}} variety throughout their working lives. [[Superheater|Superheating]] was incorporated into the class from 1909 with No.2808 the first to be retro-fitted. Other modifications centred on improving the weight distribution, altering smokebox lengths and fitting larger diameter chimneys. \nThe 84 2800s built by Churchward remained the GWR's principal long haul freight engines throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The only serious problem met with in traffic was with the sealing of the internal steam pipes. Beginning in 1934 most of the class had them replaced with the outside kind.\n\n=== Oil firing ===\nBetween 1945 and 1947, coal shortages caused [[Great Western Railway|GWR]] to experiment with [[Oil burner (engine)|oil fired]] 2800 [[locomotives]] and 12 of the 2800 class were converted. They were renumbered into the 4800 series, which necessitated re-numbering  the entire [[GWR 1400 Class|4800 class]] [[GWR Autocoach|autotanks]] into the 1400 series, and reclassified as 1400 class. The experiment, encouraged by the government was abandoned in 1948 once the extra maintenance costs were calculated and the bill had arrived for the imported oil.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n*On 6 January 1932, locomotive No. 2808 was hauling a freight train was in collision with a milk train at Didcot East Junction. The locomotive was extensively damaged. Ten wagon were destroyed and seventeen more were damaged. The milk train had overrun signals.<ref name=BOT1932>{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_Didcot1932.pdf |title=Great Western Railway |first=E.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling. \n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| alt1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance \n| caption1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)\n| image2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| alt2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)\n| caption2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies \n| image3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| alt3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)\n| caption3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara\n| direction = \n}}\n<br/>\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt.

Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi).

Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925|title=Chapter 5|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Machind Jain temple (2015) by Mahesh Sharma.jpg\n| alt1 = Machind Jain temple (2015)\n| link1 = Machind Jain temple (2015) by Mahesh Sharma.jpg\n| caption1 = '''Machind Jain temple (2015).

Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal.

Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. \n\nBoth Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near [[Kumbhalgarh]]) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to  Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling. \n<br/>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - Entrance.jpg\n| alt1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance \n| caption1 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara - entrance (2015)\n| image2 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015) - Central dome with Vidhya Devies.jpg\n| alt2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies (2015)\n| caption2 = Central dome with Vidhya Devies \n| image3 = Adeshwar Jain Temple at Delwara (2015).jpg\n| alt3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara (2015)\n| caption3 = Adeshwar (Rishabhdev) Jain Temple at Delwara\n| direction = \n}}\n<br/>\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt.

Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref>\n\nChauhans have 24 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n[[File:Extract of diary of Mathuranath Purohit .jpg|thumb|294x294px|Extract from diary of Mathuranath Purohit]]\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n{{multiple image\n| align = center\n| caption_align = center\n| total_width = 1000\n| image1 = Machind Jain temple (2015) by Mahesh Sharma.jpg\n| alt1 = Machind Jain temple (2015).

Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. [[File:Raja Shri Karan in battle at Chittor by Lalit C Sharma.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Raja Bohitya sacrificed his life in the battle at Chittorgarh, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I, against Allauddin Khilji in 1303.

Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. \n\nBoth Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999) Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near [[Kumbhalgarh]]) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to  Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rajasthani Granthaghar, Jodhpur.</ref>\n\n==Deora Chauhans embrace Jainism==\nAccording to Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh, written in 1593 by Jaysom,<blockquote>''\u201cAfter Rana Shree Karan's death in the battle, his wife Queen Ratna Devi along with her four sons - Samdhar, Udharam, Haridas and Veerdas, went to her parent's place (pihar) at Khedinagar ([[Kheda district|Kheda]], Gujarat) for their education and proficiency in art of warfare. Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.\n{{scalable image|Table 1 - Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhans Dynasty.jpg|3500px|Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|alt=Genealogical Tree - Deora Chauhan Dynasty at Jaolore, Sirohi and Delwara in Rajasthan|tooltip=no}}\n<br>\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Although the first organization,  [https://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/about/index.html NAAFA], and the first book, ''Fat Power'' (1970), were both created by men, in each case they were responses to weight discrimination experienced by their wives.

Issues addressed regarding women have included [[body image]], and in particular [[The Thin Ideal]] and its effect on women.

The results of these cases have varied considerably, although in some instances the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]] (ADA) has been successfully used to argue cases of discrimination against fat people.<ref>{{cite book|last=Theran|first=Elizabeth E.|title=Legal Theory on Weight Discriminationin Weight Bias: Nature, Consequences, And Remedies|year=2005|publisher=Guildford Press|isbn=978-1593851996|page=195|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FRszpOfV5o0C&dq=weight+discrimination+laws}}</ref> Roth and Solovay argue that, as with [[transgender]] people, a major cause for the variation in success is the extent to which litigants are apologetic for their size:\n<blockquote>\nWhat is the difference between a million-dollar weight case award and a losing case? Like the difference between many winning and losing transgender cases, it's all about the attitude. Does the claimant's attitude and experience about weight/gender reinforce or challenge dominant [[stereotype]]s? Winning cases generally adopt a legal posture that reinforces [[social prejudice]]s. Cases that challenge societal prejudices generally lose.<ref name=\"Dylan Roth and 2009 170\">{{cite book|last=Dylan Roth and|first=Sandra Solovay|title=No Apology: Shared Struggles in Fat and Transgender Law in Fat Studies Reader|year=2009|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814776407|page=170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtLWPWNO8gUC&dq=fat+acceptance+gender}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Americans with Disabilities Act continues to be used as there is no USA federal law against weight discrimination; however, the state of\n[[Michigan]] has passed a law against weight discrimination. The cities of [[Washington D.C.]], [[San Francisco]] (2000), [[Santa Cruz, California|Santa Cruz]], [[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]], [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]] (1990s) and [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] (1970s) have also passed laws prohibiting weight discrimination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weight Discrimination Laws|url=http://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/education/laws.html|work=NAAFA Online|publisher=NAAFA|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> In the cities that have a weight discrimination law, it is rare for more than 1 case a year to be brought, except for San Francisco which may have as many as 6. Opinions amongst city enforcement workers vary as to why the prosecution numbers are so low, although they all suggested that both overweight people and employers were unaware of the protective legislation and it was also noted that the cities with anti-weight discrimination laws tended to be liberal college towns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Weight Bias Laws: Tipping the Scales Against Prejudice?|url=http://mn.gov/mdhr/education/articles/rs10_2weightlaws.html|publisher=Minnesota Dept.

Despite recommendations from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] to the contrary, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] has decided that fat people will only qualify as [[disabled]] if it can be proved that their weight is caused by an underlying condition, supporting the concept that being obese is not inherently a disability.<ref name=\"Dylan Roth and 2009 170\"/>\n\nOther countries besides the United States have considered legislation to protect the rights of fat people. In the UK an All-Party Parliamentary Group published a report in 2012 called ''Reflections on Body Image'' that found that 1 in 5 British people had been victimized because of their weight. The report recommended that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] Investigated putting \"appearance-based discrimination\" under the same legal basis as sexual or racial discrimination via the [[Equality Act 2010]] which makes it illegal to harass, victimize or discriminate against anyone based on several named categories. including size or weight<ref>{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Stephen|title=Calling someone 'fatty' could become a hate crime|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9297496/Calling-someone-fatty-could-become-a-hate-crime.html|accessdate=|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2017-09-25}}</ref> The Equality Act came into force on 1 October 2010, it brings together over 116 separate pieces of legislation into one single Act.

[[Marilyn Wann]] argues that fat studies moved beyond being an individual endeavor to being a field of study with the 2004 conference ''Fat Attitudes: An Examination of an American Subculture and the Representation of the Female Body''<ref name=\"Rothblum and Sondra Solovay 2009 xi\"/> The [[American Popular Culture Association]] regularly includes panels on the subject. In many colleges, student groups with a fat activist agenda have emerged, including Hampshire, Smith, and Antioch. Fat studies are now available as an [[interdisciplinary]] course of study at some colleges, taking a similar approach to other identity studies such as [[women's studies]], [[queer studies]], and [[African American studies]].<ref>{{cite news|title = 'Fat Studies' Go to College|url = http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/11/03/fat-studies-colleges-hot-new-course.html|newspaper = The Daily Beast|date = 3 November 2010|publisher = The Daily Beast Company|last = Binder|first = Eve}}</ref> As of 2011, there were 2 Australian courses and 10 American courses that were primarily focussed on fat studies or [[Health at Every Size|health at every size]], and numerous other courses that had some fat acceptance content.<ref>{{cite web|last=Watkins|first=Patti Lou|title=Teaching Fat Studies From Conception to Reception|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ufts20/current|publisher=Oregan State University|accessdate=}}</ref> Taylor & Francis publish an online Fat Studies journal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fat Studies|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/ufts20/current|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=2017-09-25}}</ref> The first national Fat Studies seminar was held at York in May 2008, leading to the 2009 publication ''Fat Studies in the UK'', edited by Corinna Tomrley and Ann Kalosky Naylor.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fat Studies in the UK|url=http://www.rawnervebooks.co.uk/FSUK.html|publisher=Raw Nerve.

The fat acceptance community generally divides into two categories. One is those who feel discrimination towards thin people hinders the fat acceptance cause. The other side views thin people as at least a partial cause of their social stigma.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1086/659309|title = Body Norms and Fat Stigma in Global Perspective| journal=Current Anthropology| volume=52| issue=2| pages=269\u2013276|year = 2011|last1 = Brewis|first1 = Alexandra A.| last2=Wutich| first2=Amber| last3=Falletta-Cowden| first3=Ashlan| last4=Rodriguez-Soto| first4=Isa}}</ref>\n\nWomen are particularly active within the fat acceptance movement and membership of fat acceptance organizations is dominated by middle-class women in the heaviest 1\u20132% of the population.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saguy|first=Abigail|title=What's Wrong with Fat?|year=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199857081|page=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_kVC1XP05MC&dq=fat+acceptance+men}}</ref> Members have criticized the lack of representation in the movement from men, people of color, and people of lower socioeconomic status.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xojane.com/issues/why-im-over-the-size-acceptance-movement-or-hey-sa-what-have-you-done-for-me-lately|title=Why I'm Over The Size Acceptance Movement or Hey, SA, What Have You Done For Me Lately?|last=Webb|first=Cary|date=4 January 2014|website=XOJane.com|publisher=XOJANE|access-date=4 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nThe fat acceptance movement has been criticized from several perspectives. Primarily there has been a conflict over the medicalization of fat and health professionals who have criticized proponents of fat acceptance for ignoring health issues that many studies have shown to be linked to obesity.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Worth|first1=Tammy|title=Is the fat acceptance movement bad for our health?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/01/06/fat.acceptance/index.html|accessdate=9 December 2015|publisher=CNN|date=6 January 2010}}</ref> Fat acceptance has also been challenged from a moral perspective and the movement has been criticized for being out of touch with the mainstream.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Steve|title=Why Getting Tough on Fat Is the Kindest Gesture|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/stevemiller/why-getting-tough-on-fat-_b_6230628.html|website=The Huffington Post|accessdate=9 December 2015|date=2014-11-27}}</ref>\n\n[[Lionel Shriver]], American journalist and author, wrote a column in ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint magazine]]'' strongly criticizing the fat acceptance movement. She condemned the movements' demand for respect for fatness in itself, which promotes the same unhealthy lifestyle that she believes killed her brother, who was morbidly obese and died at the age of 55. She also criticized the movements' repeated comparison of sizeism with racism or homophobia, saying that this approach casts obesity in the light of being an unchangeable state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2009/dec/01/lionel-shriver-my-obese-brother|title=Lionel Shriver: My brother is eating himself to death|last=Shriver|first=Lionel|date=2009-12-01|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref>\n\n[[Cathy Young]], writing for ''[[The Boston Globe|The]]'' [[The Boston Globe|''Boston Globe'']], claimed that the movement was responsible for normalizing and promoting the acceptance of a controllable disease with clear health complications. While she recognizes the value in fighting against self-loathing, she draws the line at advocating for acceptance of an \"unhealthy status quo.\" She says that by normalizing obesity, the fat acceptance movement leads people to underestimate the associated health hazards, and that the movement has also grown intolerant, exhibiting signs of elitism and treading on personal freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/12/30/fat-acceptance-hazardous-health/1ojfoW46R2elWpHLarA19M/story.html|title=Fat acceptance is hazardous to US health - The Boston Globe|last=Young|first=Cathy|website=BostonGlobe.com|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref>\n\nThe movement has also been criticized for its treatment of women with eating disorders or who follow diets for health-related reasons, since they are seen as betraying the movement. In 2008 Lily-Rygh Glen, a writer, musician, and former fat acceptance activist, interviewed multiple women who claimed to be rejected by their peers within the movement and labeled \"traitors\" when they changed their diets. One female activist admitted to living in fear that her binge eating disorder and consequent body image issues would be discovered. Glen states, \"It is precisely because eating disorders are ''not'' openly discussed that many fat people who suffer from [[bulimia]], [[binge-eating disorder]], and pathorexia (defined as disordered appetite, and used to refer to an entire spectrum of disordered eating) feel they aren't welcome in the fat acceptance movement.\" The author also claimed that while interviewing and writing the article, which was featured in [[Bitch (magazine)|''Bitch'']] magazine's ''Lost & Found'' issue, she received wide condemnation from the fat acceptance community, and was labeled fatphobic and healthist.<ref>Lily-Rygh Glen, [https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/big-trouble \"Big Trouble: Are Eating Disorders the Lavender Menace of the Fat Acceptance Movement\"], Bitch Media, January 1,

NAAFA was founded in America, in 1969, by Bill Fabrey in response to discrimination against his wife. He primarily intended it to campaign for fat rights,  however, a reporter attending the 2001 NAAFA conference notes that few attendees were active in fat rights politics and that most women came to shop for fashion, wear it on the conference catwalk or to meet a potential partner.<ref>{{cite book|last=Saggy |first=Abigail |title=What's Wrong With Fat? |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199857081 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7_kVC1XP05MC&pg=PA55 }}</ref> Since 1991, Fabrey has worked as a director with the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination, specializing in the history of the size acceptance movement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Council Directors and Project Managers |url=http://cswd.org/bill-fabrey |publisher=Council on Size & Weight Discrimination |accessdate=2017-09-25}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972 the feminist group The Fat Underground was formed.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1913858,00.html|title=The Fat-Acceptance Movement|journal=Time|first=Dan|last=Fletcher|date=31 July 2009|via=content.time.com}}</ref> It began as a radical chapter of NAAFA and spun off to become independent when NAAFA expressed concerns about its promotion of a stronger activist philosophy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiancemagazine.com/issues/1998/winter_98/fat_underground.html |title=Life In The Fat Underground by Sara Fishman |publisher=Radiancemagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-31}}</ref> The FU were inspired by and, in some cases, members of the [[Radical Therapy Collective]], a [[feminist]] group that believed that many psychological problems were caused by oppressive social institutions and practices.

Although the first organization,  [https://www.naafaonline.com/dev2/about/index.html NAAFA], and the first book, ''Fat Power'' (1970), were both created by men, in each case they were responses to weight discrimination experienced by their wives. Women soon started campaigning on their behalf with the first feminist group, 'The Fat Underground', being formed in 1973. Issues addressed regarding women have included [[body image]], and in particular [[The Thin Ideal]] and its effect on women. Critics say NAAFA, which opposes dieting and weight-loss surgery, is an apologist for an unhealthy lifestyle. But NAAFA says it does no such thing, that some people are just bigger and no less deserving of the same rights as everyone else.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fletcher|first=Dan|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1913858,00.html|title=Breaking News, Analysis, Politics, Blogs, News Photos, Video, Tech Reviews|date=2009-07-31|work=Time|access-date=2020-03-20|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>\n\n====Fat men====\nThe fat acceptance movement has primarily focused on a [[feminist]] model of [[patriarchal]] oppression of fat women, most clearly represented by the encouragement of women to diet.

Despite recommendations from the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] to the contrary, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] has decided that fat people will only qualify as [[disabled]] if it can be proved that their weight is caused by an underlying condition, supporting the concept that being obese is not inherently a disability.<ref name=\"Dylan Roth and 2009 170\"/>\n\nOther countries besides the United States have considered legislation to protect the rights of fat people. In the UK an All-Party Parliamentary Group published a report in 2012 called ''Reflections on Body Image'' that found that 1 in 5 British people had been victimized because of their weight. The report recommended that [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] Investigated putting \"appearance-based discrimination\" under the same legal basis as sexual or racial discrimination via the [[Equality Act 2010]] which makes it illegal to harass, victimize or discriminate against anyone based on several named categories. including size or weight<ref>{{cite news|last=Adams|first=Stephen|title=Calling someone 'fatty' could become a hate crime|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9297496/Calling-someone-fatty-could-become-a-hate-crime.html|accessdate=|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=2017-09-25}}</ref> The Equality Act came into force on 1 October 2010, it brings together over 116 separate pieces of legislation into one single Act.

In many colleges, student groups with a fat activist agenda have emerged, including Hampshire, Smith, and Antioch.

While she recognizes the value in fighting against self-loathing, she draws the line at advocating for acceptance of an \"unhealthy status quo.\" She says that by normalizing obesity, the fat acceptance movement leads people to underestimate the associated health hazards, and that the movement has also grown intolerant, exhibiting signs of elitism and treading on personal freedom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2013/12/30/fat-acceptance-hazardous-health/1ojfoW46R2elWpHLarA19M/story.html|title=Fat acceptance is hazardous to US health - The Boston Globe|last=Young|first=Cathy|website=BostonGlobe.com|publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref>\n\nThe movement has also been criticized for its treatment of women with eating disorders or who follow diets for health-related reasons, since they are seen as betraying the movement. In 2008 Lily-Rygh Glen, a writer, musician, and former fat acceptance activist, interviewed multiple women who claimed to be rejected by their peers within the movement and labeled \"traitors\" when they changed their diets. One female activist admitted to living in fear that her binge eating disorder and consequent body image issues would be discovered. Glen states, \"It is precisely because eating disorders are ''not'' openly discussed that many fat people who suffer from [[bulimia]], [[binge-eating disorder]], and pathorexia (defined as disordered appetite, and used to refer to an entire spectrum of disordered eating) feel they aren't welcome in the fat acceptance movement.\" The author also claimed that while interviewing and writing the article, which was featured in [[Bitch (magazine)|''Bitch'']] magazine's ''Lost & Found'' issue, she received wide condemnation from the fat acceptance community, and was labeled fatphobic and

The railway bridge was to be the last link in a railway network that linked [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]], Sydney and [[Brisbane]] and was a major engineering feat at the time. The original railway bridge was build in 1899 and replaced by the current bridge in 1946. The 1946 bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1040>{{cite NSW SHR|5012052|Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge and Long Island Group|hr=01040|fn=S90/02923/1,11/10920,13/06427|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Before the bridge==\nOn 7 April 1887, the single track section of the Main North line was opened between [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] and the [[Hawkesbury River]].

The railways engineer-in-chief, [[John Whitton]], who designed and built the railway was not invited to design the bridge due to fallout from a mid 1880s enquiry into railway bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1040/> However, subcontractors were also involved in the actual construction work. The piers consisted of concrete below water with sandstone masonry above. The [[Span (architecture)|spans]] were assembled on [[Dangar Island]] and floated {{convert|1500|m|0}} or so across to the bridge site on barges.\n\nThe bridge had seven spans of {{convert|416|ft|m|0|order=flip}} each for a total length of {{convert|2910|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. Five of the piers were sunk to then record depths of between {{convert|150|to|160|ft|m|0|order=flip}} below high water. The bridge officially opened on 1 May 1889.<ref name=SHR/>\n\n===Load testing===\nAt the time, it was the longest structure to be load tested in Australia and so two distinct and separate methods were used. Firstly, optical measurements were taken of the deformation under load at the centre of each span, taken by two sets of observers positioned atop the stone piers. The second test used a [[water gauge]] to accurately measure the deformation and the amount of deflection or \"set\" for each span.\n\nLoad testing was carried out on 24 April 1889 in the presence of various dignitaries including [[Henry Deane (engineer)|Henry Deane]], the Assistant Engineer in Chief of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. During the morning, each span was tested separately by slowly running trains out onto the span, taking the required measurements, backing the train off again and retaking the measurements. This was repeated for each span but on the second span it was found that the optical readings did not match the water gauge. The cause was found to be a slow leak in a connecting pipe of the water gauge equipment. There was only one water gauge available and as the leak would become worse as the equipment was moved from span to span for each reading it was decided to abandon this method and rely wholly on the optical readings.\n\nA speed test was undertaken during the afternoon by four locomotives, coupled in two pairs. They were started off by a flagman standing above the Long Island tunnel and the trains ran across the causeway from [[Hawkesbury River railway station|Hawkesbury River station]] through the Long Island tunnel and out across the bridge at maximum speed.\n\n===Problems arise===\nAlthough the track on either end of the bridge was [[single track (rail)|single line]], the bridge itself was constructed to [[double track]] width with an eye to the future duplication of the line. This led to the undesirable practice of the bridge being used as a crossing point for trains, thus regularly subjecting the structure to maximum stress loads.\n\nThe bridge showed signs of problems within 12 months and the contractors were called back to repair some faults with the piers. Through the 1920s and 1930s, many design faults and problems became evident. By 1925 the original loading of the bridge was considered inadequate and in 1925 it was decided to strengthen the deck. The work took nearly six years between 1926\u201331 and numerous problems were experienced with the pin-jointed construction of the trusses, which while easy to assemble were difficult to maintain and strengthen.<ref name=nswshr-1040/><ref name=nswshr-1040-1568>{{Cite book | author1=Fraser, Donald J. | title=Bridges down under : the history of railway underbridges in New South Wales | publication-date=1995 | publisher=[[Australian Railway Historical Society]], New South Wales Division | isbn=978-0-909650-35-3 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/38692581}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 a severe crack in one of the piers was discovered and it became necessary to replace the entire structure. The depth of sediment had made it impossible to reach bedrock with the foundations on the southernmost pier and it seems that this was the cause of the structural faults.

The bridge crosses the Hawkesbury River from Long Island to the northern shore, approximately {{convert|1|km|mi|0|spell=on}} north of Hawkesbury River Railway Station. The bridge is a {{convert|785|m|ft|0|adj=on}} steel truss railway underbridge, consisting of two {{convert|44.81|m|ft|0|adj=on}} trusses, two {{convert|135.64|m|ft|0|adj=on}} trusses and four {{convert|105.92|m|ft|0|adj=on}} trusses, all on concrete piers supported on caissons. The bridge is symmetrical with two short Pratt trusses at the shore lines, then two large K-trusses, with four large Pratt trusses in between.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nAt the southern end of the bridge, adjacent to the entrance of the current concrete lined railway tunnel are two plaques on a concrete pier: one plaque commemorates the opening of the bridge on 1 July 1946 and the other commemorates the lives lost during construction.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n===Construction docks===\nThere are three construction docks immediately west of the southern abutment of the Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge. Only one of these is in RailCorp ownership. The docks were used for the construction of the steel trusses of the 1946 bridge. They are formed from rectangular cuttings into the bedrock. Each cutting contained a barge which supported the ends and middle of each large truss as they were being built. They were then floated from this position to specific piers and raised into their permanent position. The end of the dock in RailCorp ownership (the easternmost dock) has been extended in concrete and also has a set of steps providing access from the adjacent construction terrace next to the southern abutment of the bridge. This construction terrace has two footings made from concrete and steel plate, also associated with the construction phase. Under the abutment of the 1946 bridge there is a room containing a compressor and other materials. This space has a concrete vaulted ceiling and was originally an arched opening under the abutment and subsequently infilled.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n===Surviving first bridge abutments===\n\nThe southern abutment is constructed in concrete and face [[Hawkesbury sandstone]] and rises approximately {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} above the shoreline. It is classical in detail, particularly to the side elevations with the north-facing elevation constructed in [[ashlar]] stonework. Constructed on top of the abutment is a {{circa|1960}}s concrete block staff building associated with the maintenance depot. Within this 1960s structure and affixed to the top of the abutment is a large cast iron plaque which formally sat on the crest of the first [[Span (architecture)|span]] of the former rail bridge. It commemorates construction of the bridge by the Union Bridge Company. On the southern abutment there is a range of historic graffiti dating from 1901 to the present day.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nNorth from this abutment are a series of large sandstone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] within the Hawkesbury River. The deck of the former bridge has been removed. The northernmost pier is relatively close to the shore and subsequently the northern abutment is less elaborate and imposing than the southern abutment.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nImmediately to the north of the southernmost abutment, but slightly off alignment, is a concrete footing on the shoreline at the mean high water mark, which may have been linked to construction of the former or current bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe current and former Hawkesbury River Rail Bridges have State heritage significance. It forms part of a railway precinct of exceptional significance, with elements in an outstanding setting that represent key events in the history of railway development in NSW and demonstrate high levels of engineering achievement and the changes in railway technology in NSW in the period between the 1880s and 1970s.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe completion of the 1886 Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge saw the linkage not only of the significant Sydney to Newcastle Railway link but also in effect, the railway systems of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland were joined by continuous rail with the opening of the bridge. The Bridge was used by Sir [[Henry Parkes]] as a powerful symbol of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] and he gave the address at the opening of the bridge, which has been claimed by some as his first Federation speech. The abutments and piers of the bridge as well as the 1886 Long Island tunnel are tangible reminders of these significant events and the symbolic power they had for people at the time not only in NSW but throughout Australia. Both the 1889 and 1946 bridges and associated infrastructure on Long Island also demonstrate the significant investment in the railway system of NSW in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The workmanship of both bridges demonstrates the significant pride and confidence in the railways at the time.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe surviving sandstone elements of the former Hawkesbury River Bridge and the current Bridge have exceptional aesthetic value in their setting on the Hawkesbury River. The contrast of the man-made bridges and tunnels with the rugged and beautiful natural landscape of Hawkesbury River allows passengers and visitors to appreciate the engineering achievements of the railway line's construction. The vantage point of the approach to Long Island and the bridge also allows passengers to appreciate views of the natural landscape. Both of these factors have made the railway journey a destination in itself for generations of rail passengers.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe 1889 Hawkesbury River Bridge, Long Island Tunnel, [[Woy Woy Tunnel]] and the heavy earthworks and tunnels of the Cowan bank were the key engineering works on the Sydney to Newcastle rail link (The Short North). Together they demonstrate a high degree of engineering achievement in building a railway line in difficult and dangerous terrain. The 1889 Hawkesbury River Bridge in particular was a major technical achievement at the time: it was the fourth largest bridge constructed in the world, one of its caissons reached 49m, had the deepest bridge footing in the world and it was the longest bridge in Australia, pushing bridge design and construction techniques to the limit. The bridge was also the first of the American designed truss bridges that were introduced to Australia in the late 1880s and 1890s and thus the first to utilise the American principles of lightweight bracing, pin joints and eye bar tension members. It was the only steel trussed bridge of its type in Australia when it was built and the first major use of steel for bridges with previous examples being built in wrought iron. Its remains are tangible evidence of the change in engineering technology from British to American at this time and the decline of John Whitton's British based design influence on the NSW railway system. There is enough extant fabric in the remaining abutments, piers and the Long Island tunnel to demonstrate the engineering achievements of the original Hawkesbury River crossing.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe 1946 railway bridge was also a major technical achievement at the time of its construction, its large riveted steel trusses and its footings were still among the deepest in the world. It remains the longest purpose built rail bridge in the NSW network. The bridge itself as well as the remnant construction docks, platform and power station demonstrate the technical achievements in the construction of the bridge. The docks in particular provide direct evidence for the method of construction and the challenges associated with construction in this estuarine environment.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nHawkesbury River Railway Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nHawkesbury River Railway Bridges 1st & 2nd circa

line, New South Wales|Main North railway line]] (including the [[Railway electrification system|electrified]] [[Central Coast & Newcastle Line]]) across the [[Hawkesbury River]], connecting just north of the town of [[Brooklyn, New South Wales|Brooklyn]], [[Hornsby Shire]] on the northern outskirts of [[Sydney]] with [[Cogra Bay, New South Wales|Cogra Bay]], [[Central Coast Council (New South Wales)|Central Coast Council]], both in  [[New South Wales]], Australia. The railway bridge was to be the last link in a railway network that linked [[Adelaide]], [[Melbourne]], Sydney and [[Brisbane]] and was a major engineering feat at the time. The original railway bridge was build in 1899 and replaced by the current bridge in 1946. The 1946 bridge was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1040>{{cite NSW SHR|5012052|Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge and Long Island Group|hr=01040|fn=S90/02923/1,11/10920,13/06427|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Before the bridge==\nOn 7 April 1887, the single track section of the Main North line was opened between [[Hornsby railway station|Hornsby]] and the [[Hawkesbury River]]. Passengers and goods heading north now unloaded at the River Wharf platform on the eastern end of [[Long Island (New South Wales)|Long Island]], transferring to the double decker, rear [[Paddle steamer|paddled-wheeled steamer]] ''General Gordon'' for a three-hour trip out to [[Broken Bay]] and up [[Brisbane Water]] to [[Gosford railway station|Gosford]] where the train service recommenced. Once the {{convert|1.7|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} [[Woy Woy Tunnel]] was opened on 15 August 1887, the trip was considerably shortened as the boat only had to cross the river and negotiate the lower reaches of Mullet Creek to reach [[Wondabyne railway station|Mullet Creek station]].<ref name=SHR>{{cite NSW HD|4800130|Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge and Long Island Group|accessdate=12 September 2017}}</ref><ref name=Roundhouse>{{cite journal |title=Byways of Steam Hawkesbury River & Hornsby |journal=[[Roundhouse (periodical)|Roundhouse]] |date=October 1984 |pages=4-30 }}</ref>\n\n==First bridge==\n{{Infobox bridge \n| name = Hawkesbury River railway bridge<br/>{{small|(first bridge)}}\n| native_name = \n| native_name_lang = \n| image = Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge 1888.jpg\n| image_upright = 1.4 \n| alt = \n| caption = First bridge under construction in 1888\n| pushpin_map = \n| pushpin_relief = \n| pushpin_map_size = \n| pushpin_map_alt = \n| pushpin_map_caption = \n| coordinates = {{coord|33|32|2|S|151|13|42|E|region:AU-NSW_scale:10000_type:landmark|display=inline}}<!-- {{Coord}} -->\n| os_grid_reference = \n| qid = | refs = \n| carries = [[Main North railway line, New South Wales|Main North railway line]] \n| crosses = [[Hawkesbury River]] \n| locale = {{NSWcity|Brooklyn}}, [[New South Wales]] \n| starts = {{NSWcity|Brooklyn}} {{small|(south)}}\n| ends = {{NSWcity|Cogra Bay}} {{small|(north)}}\n| official_name = \n| other_name = \n| named_for = \n| owner = [[State Rail Authority of New South Wales]]\n| maint = \n| heritage = \n| id = \n| id_type = \n| website = \n| preceded = \n| followed = \n| design = Riveted [[truss bridge]]\n| material = Steel\n| material1 = \n| material2 = \n| length = {{convert|2910|ft|m|0|order=flip}}\n| width = \n| height = \n| depth = {{convert|150|to|160|ft|m|0|order=flip}}\n| traversable = \n| towpath = \n| mainspan = {{convert|416|ft|m|0|order=flip}}\n| number_spans = Seven\n| piers_in_water =  Five\n| load = 25 [[Theodore Cooper#Cooper's loading system|Cooper's e-value]]\n| clearance_above = \n| clearance_below = \n| lanes = \n| life = \n| first_length = \n| first_diameter = \n| second_length = \n| second_diameter = \n| third_length = \n| third_diameter = \n| capacity = \n| num_track = 1\n| track_gauge = \n| structure_gauge = \n| electrification = \n| architect = \n| designer = [[John Whitton]]\n| contracted_designer = \n| winner = \n| engineering = \n| builder = [[Union Bridge Company]], [[New York (state)|New York]]\n| fabricator = \n| begin = \n| complete = \n| cost = [[Australian pound|A\u00a3]]367,000\n| open = {{start date|1889|05|01|df=y}}<!-- or | opening = --> \n| inaugurated = \n| rebuilt = \n| collapsed = \n| closed = 1946\n| replaces = ''General Gordon'', a double decker, rear [[Paddle steamer|paddled-wheeled steamer]] \n| replaced_by = Hawkesbury River railway bridge ''(current)''\n| traffic = \n| toll = \n| map_type = \n| map_relief = \n| map_dot_label = \n| map_image = \n| map_size = \n| map_alt = \n| mapframe = \n| mapframe_zoom =\n| mapframe_width = \n| mapframe_height = \n| mapframe_marker = \n| mapframe_marker_color = \n| mapframe_lat = \n| mapframe_long = \n| map_caption = \n| extra = <!-- extra = module = embed = --> \n}}\nThe [[Union Bridge Company]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] was awarded the contract to construct the bridge in January 1886. The railways engineer-in-chief, [[John Whitton]], who designed and built the railway was not invited to design the bridge due to fallout from a mid 1880s enquiry into railway bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1040/> However, subcontractors were also involved in the actual construction work. The piers consisted of concrete below water with sandstone masonry above. The [[Span (architecture)|spans]] were assembled on [[Dangar Island]] and floated {{convert|1500|m|0}} or so across to the bridge site on barges.\n\nThe bridge had seven spans of {{convert|416|ft|m|0|order=flip}} each for a total length of {{convert|2910|ft|m|0|order=flip}}. Five of the piers were sunk to then record depths of between {{convert|150|to|160|ft|m|0|order=flip}} below high water. The bridge officially opened on 1 May 1889.<ref name=SHR/>\n\n===Load testing===\nAt the time, it was the longest structure to be load tested in Australia and so two distinct and separate methods were used. Firstly, optical measurements were taken of the deformation under load at the centre of each span, taken by two sets of observers positioned atop the stone piers. The second test used a [[water gauge]] to accurately measure the deformation and the amount of deflection or \"set\" for each span.\n\nLoad testing was carried out on 24 April 1889 in the presence of various dignitaries including [[Henry Deane (engineer)|Henry Deane]], the Assistant Engineer in Chief of the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. During the morning, each span was tested separately by slowly running trains out onto the span, taking the required measurements, backing the train off again and retaking the measurements. This was repeated for each span but on the second span it was found that the optical readings did not match the water gauge. The cause was found to be a slow leak in a connecting pipe of the water gauge equipment. There was only one water gauge available and as the leak would become worse as the equipment was moved from span to span for each reading it was decided to abandon this method and rely wholly on the optical readings.\n\nA speed test was undertaken during the afternoon by four locomotives, coupled in two pairs. They were started off by a flagman standing above the Long Island tunnel and the trains ran across the causeway from [[Hawkesbury River railway station|Hawkesbury River station]] through the Long Island tunnel and out across the bridge at maximum speed.\n\n===Problems arise===\nAlthough the track on either end of the bridge was [[single track (rail)|single line]], the bridge itself was constructed to [[double track]] width with an eye to the future duplication of the line. This led to the undesirable practice of the bridge being used as a crossing point for trains, thus regularly subjecting the structure to maximum stress loads.\n\nThe bridge showed signs of problems within 12 months and the contractors were called back to repair some faults with the piers. Through the 1920s and 1930s, many design faults and problems became evident. By 1925 the original loading of the bridge was considered inadequate and in 1925 it was decided to strengthen the deck. The work took nearly six years between 1926\u201331 and numerous problems were experienced with the pin-jointed construction of the trusses, which while easy to assemble were difficult to maintain and strengthen.<ref name=nswshr-1040/><ref name=nswshr-1040-1568>{{Cite book | author1=Fraser, Donald J. | title=Bridges down under : the history of railway underbridges in New South Wales | publication-date=1995 | publisher=[[Australian Railway Historical Society]], New South Wales Division | isbn=978-0-909650-35-3 | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/38692581}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938 a severe crack in one of the piers was discovered and it became necessary to replace the entire structure. The depth of sediment had made it impossible to reach bedrock with the foundations on the southernmost pier and it seems that this was the cause of the structural faults. The amount of traffic being carried (up to 100 trains a day) during [[World War II]] made the replacement extremely urgent and prior to the new bridge being brought into operation the speed limit on the old bridge was restricted to {{convert|14|mph|km/h|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} and finally down to {{convert|4|mph|km/h|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} with tracks altered to gauntlet configuration to ensure trains could not pass.<ref name=Roundhouse/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article230809567 |title=HAWKESBURY BRIDGE DEFECT SPREADS |newspaper=[[The Sun (Sydney)|The Sun]] |issue=8961 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=24 September 1938 |accessdate=31 August 2016 |page=3 (LATE FINAL EXTRA) |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17522105 |title=HAWKESBURY BRIDGE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=31,430 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=26 September 1938 |accessdate=31 August 2016 |page=13 |via=[[National Library of Australia]]}}</ref>\n\n==Second bridge==\nDesign and construction of a replacement bridge commenced in 1939, due to concerns that the original bridge would not hold up to extra loading and traffic caused by transport demands of [[World War II]].<ref name=nswshr-1040/> Work commenced on the new bridge in July 1940 and despite best efforts it was not completed until after the war finished, opening for traffic on 1 July 1946.

The bridge crosses the Hawkesbury River from Long Island to the northern shore, approximately {{convert|1|km|mi|0|spell=on}} north of Hawkesbury River Railway Station. The bridge is a {{convert|785|m|ft|0|adj=on}} steel truss railway underbridge, consisting of two {{convert|44.81|m|ft|0|adj=on}} trusses, two {{convert|135.64|m|ft|0|adj=on}} trusses and four {{convert|105.92|m|ft|0|adj=on}} trusses, all on concrete piers supported on caissons. The bridge is symmetrical with two short Pratt trusses at the shore lines, then two large K-trusses, with four large Pratt trusses in between.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nAt the southern end of the bridge, adjacent to the entrance of the current concrete lined railway tunnel are two plaques on a concrete pier: one plaque commemorates the opening of the bridge on 1 July 1946 and the other commemorates the lives lost during construction.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n===Construction docks===\nThere are three construction docks immediately west of the southern abutment of the Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge. Only one of these is in RailCorp ownership. The docks were used for the construction of the steel trusses of the 1946 bridge. They are formed from rectangular cuttings into the bedrock. Each cutting contained a barge which supported the ends and middle of each large truss as they were being built. They were then floated from this position to specific piers and raised into their permanent position. The end of the dock in RailCorp ownership (the easternmost dock) has been extended in concrete and also has a set of steps providing access from the adjacent construction terrace next to the southern abutment of the bridge. This construction terrace has two footings made from concrete and steel plate, also associated with the construction phase. Under the abutment of the 1946 bridge there is a room containing a compressor and other materials. This space has a concrete vaulted ceiling and was originally an arched opening under the abutment and subsequently infilled.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n===Surviving first bridge abutments===\n\nThe southern abutment is constructed in concrete and face [[Hawkesbury sandstone]] and rises approximately {{convert|20|m|ft|0}} above the shoreline. It is classical in detail, particularly to the side elevations with the north-facing elevation constructed in [[ashlar]] stonework. Constructed on top of the abutment is a {{circa|1960}}s concrete block staff building associated with the maintenance depot. Within this 1960s structure and affixed to the top of the abutment is a large cast iron plaque which formally sat on the crest of the first [[Span (architecture)|span]] of the former rail bridge. It commemorates construction of the bridge by the Union Bridge Company. On the southern abutment there is a range of historic graffiti dating from 1901 to the present day.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nNorth from this abutment are a series of large sandstone [[Pier (architecture)|piers]] within the Hawkesbury River. The deck of the former bridge has been removed. The northernmost pier is relatively close to the shore and subsequently the northern abutment is less elaborate and imposing than the southern abutment.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nImmediately to the north of the southernmost abutment, but slightly off alignment, is a concrete footing on the shoreline at the mean high water mark, which may have been linked to construction of the former or current bridges.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nThe current and former Hawkesbury River Rail Bridges have State heritage significance. It forms part of a railway precinct of exceptional significance, with elements in an outstanding setting that represent key events in the history of railway development in NSW and demonstrate high levels of engineering achievement and the changes in railway technology in NSW in the period between the 1880s and 1970s.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe completion of the 1886 Hawkesbury River Railway Bridge saw the linkage not only of the significant Sydney to Newcastle Railway link but also in effect, the railway systems of South Australia, Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland were joined by continuous rail with the opening of the bridge. The Bridge was used by Sir [[Henry Parkes]] as a powerful symbol of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] and he gave the address at the opening of the bridge, which has been claimed by some as his first Federation speech. The abutments and piers of the bridge as well as the 1886 Long Island tunnel are tangible reminders of these significant events and the symbolic power they had for people at the time not only in NSW but throughout Australia. Both the 1889 and 1946 bridges and associated infrastructure on Long Island also demonstrate the significant investment in the railway system of NSW in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The workmanship of both bridges demonstrates the significant pride and confidence in the railways at the time.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe surviving sandstone elements of the former Hawkesbury River Bridge and the current Bridge have exceptional aesthetic value in their setting on the Hawkesbury River. The contrast of the man-made bridges and tunnels with the rugged and beautiful natural landscape of Hawkesbury River allows passengers and visitors to appreciate the engineering achievements of the railway line's construction. The vantage point of the approach to Long Island and the bridge also allows passengers to appreciate views of the natural landscape. Both of these factors have made the railway journey a destination in itself for generations of rail passengers.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe 1889 Hawkesbury River Bridge, Long Island Tunnel, [[Woy Woy Tunnel]] and the heavy earthworks and tunnels of the Cowan bank were the key engineering works on the Sydney to Newcastle rail link (The Short North). Together they demonstrate a high degree of engineering achievement in building a railway line in difficult and dangerous terrain. The 1889 Hawkesbury River Bridge in particular was a major technical achievement at the time: it was the fourth largest bridge constructed in the world, one of its caissons reached 49m, had the deepest bridge footing in the world and it was the longest bridge in Australia, pushing bridge design and construction techniques to the limit. The bridge was also the first of the American designed truss bridges that were introduced to Australia in the late 1880s and 1890s and thus the first to utilise the American principles of lightweight bracing, pin joints and eye bar tension members. It was the only steel trussed bridge of its type in Australia when it was built and the first major use of steel for bridges with previous examples being built in wrought iron. Its remains are tangible evidence of the change in engineering technology from British to American at this time and the decline of John Whitton's British based design influence on the NSW railway system. There is enough extant fabric in the remaining abutments, piers and the Long Island tunnel to demonstrate the engineering achievements of the original Hawkesbury River crossing.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nThe 1946 railway bridge was also a major technical achievement at the time of its construction, its large riveted steel trusses and its footings were still among the deepest in the world. It remains the longest purpose built rail bridge in the NSW network. The bridge itself as well as the remnant construction docks, platform and power station demonstrate the technical achievements in the construction of the bridge. The docks in particular provide direct evidence for the method of construction and the challenges associated with construction in this estuarine environment.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\nHawkesbury River Railway Bridge was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1040/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nHawkesbury River Railway Bridges 1st & 2nd circa 1945.jpg|Original and replacement under construction, {{circa|1945}}\nBridges over the Hawkesbury River (3126974784).jpg|First and second bridges side by side\nNSWGR AD60 Class Locomotive.jpg|Second bridge - a pylon from the first bridge can be seen in the background\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{stack|{{Portal|Transport|Engineering|New South Wales|Railways}}}}\n*[[Historic bridges of New South Wales]]\n*[[:Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales|List of railway bridges in New South Wales]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Attribution ===\n{{NSW-SHR-CC-contains|name=Hawkesbury River Rail Bridge and Long Island Group|dno=5012052|id=01040|year=2018|accessdate=2 June 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n*{{cite book| title=Australian Encyclopaedia Vol II and VII| publisher=Angus and Robertson| year=1950}}\n*{{cite journal |title=Article title |journal=[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]] |number=541 |volume=XXXIII |date=November 1982 }}\n*{{cite journal |title=Article title |journal=[[Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]] |number=334 |volume=XVI |date=August 1965 }}\n*{{Citation |author1=Nock, Oswald Stevens |title=Railways of Australia |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/10344004 |publication-date=1971 |publisher=Adam & Charles Black |isbn=978-0-7136-1190-8 }}\n\n{{Bridges in Sydney |state=autocollapse}}\n{{The Hawkesbury River|state=collapsed}}\n\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1889]]\n[[Category:Bridges completed in 1946]]\n[[Category:Hawkesbury River]]\n[[Category:Railway bridges in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Transport on the Central Coast (New South Wales)]]\n[[Category:1889 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Brooklyn, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Cogra Bay, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Main North railway line, New South Wales]]\n[[Category:New South Wales State Heritage Register]]\n[[Category:Works of John Whitton]]\n[[Category:1946 establishments in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "tweaks to infobox", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury_River_railway_bridge"}
