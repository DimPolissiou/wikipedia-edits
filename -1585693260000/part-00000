The pilots believed this indicated a fault in the right engine, since earlier models of the 737 ventilated the cabin from the right, and they were unaware that the -400 used a different system. The pilots mistakenly shut down the functioning engine. They selected full thrust from the malfunctioning one and this increased its fuel supply, causing it to catch fire.

It's the right one\".<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=3}} In previous versions of the 737, the left air conditioning pack, fed with compressor bleed air from the left (number 1) engine, supplied air to the flight deck, while the right air conditioning pack, fed from the right (number 2) engine, supplied air to the passenger cabin. On the 737-400 this division of air is blurred; the left pack feeds the flight deck but also feeds the aft passenger cabin, while the right feeds the forward passenger cabin. The pilots had been used to the older version of the aircraft and did not realise that this aircraft (which had been flown by British Midland for only 520 hours over a two-month period) was different. The captain later claimed that his perception of smoke as coming forward from the passenger cabin led them to assume the fault was in the right engine.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=98}} The pilots throttled back the working right engine instead of the malfunctioning left engine.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=98}} They had no way of visually checking the engines from the cockpit, and the cabin crew&nbsp;\u2014 who did not hear the captain refer to the right hand engine in his cabin address&nbsp;\u2014 did not inform them that smoke and flames had been seen from the left engine.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=5}}\n\nWhen the pilots shut down the right engine, they could no longer smell the smoke, which led them to believe that they had correctly dealt with the problem. As it turned out, this was a coincidence: when the [[autothrottle]] was disengaged prior to shutting down the right engine, the fuel flow to both engines was reduced, and the excess fuel which had been igniting in the left engine exhaust disappeared; therefore, the ongoing damage was reduced, the smell of smoke ceased, and the vibration reduced, although it would still have been visible on cockpit instruments.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=99}}\n\nDuring the final approach to the [[East Midlands Airport]], the pilots selected increased thrust from the operating, damaged engine. This led to an engine fire that caused the engine to cease operating entirely. The [[ground proximity warning system]] (GPWS) activated, sounding several \"glideslope\" warnings. The pilots attempted to restart the right engine by [[Flameout#Engine restart|windmilling]], but the aircraft was by now flying at 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph), too slow for a restart. At 20:24:33, captain Hunt broadcast to the passengers via the aircraft's public address system: \"Prepare for crash landing,\" instructing passengers to take the brace position. The stick shaker then activated. Just before crossing the [[M1 motorway]] at 20:24:43, the tail and main landing gear struck the ground and the aircraft bounced back into the air and over the motorway, knocking down trees and a lamp post before crashing on the far embankment approximately 475 metres (<abbr title=\"0.3 mile\">519 yd</abbr>) short of the active [[runway]]'s paved surface and approximately 630 metres (<abbr title=\"0.4 mile\">689 yd</abbr>) from its threshold. The aircraft broke into three sections.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=7\u20138|}} This was adjacent to the motorway; remarkably, there were no vehicles travelling on that part of the M1 at the moment of the crash.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.itv.com/news/central/2014-01-08/why-did-british-midland-plane-crash-on-the-m1-near-kegworth/|title=Why did British Midland plane crash on the M1 near Kegworth?|date=8 Jan 2014|work=ITV News|accessdate=13 January 2017|url-status=live|publisher=ITV|agency=ITV Report}}</ref>\n\n\n==Casualties==\nOf the 118 passengers on board, 39 were killed outright in the crash and eight died later of their injuries, for a total of 47 fatalities.

Starting with the Boeing 737-400 variant, Boeing had redesigned the system to use bleed air from both engines.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Several cabin staff and passengers noticed that the left engine had a stream of unburnt fuel igniting in the jet exhaust, but this information was not passed to the pilots because cabin staff assumed they were aware that the left engine was malfunctioning.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=106}}\n\nThe smell of smoke disappeared when the autothrottle was disengaged and the right engine shut down due to reduction of fuel to the damaged left engine as it reverted to manual throttle.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=99}} In the event of a malfunction, pilots were trained to check all meters and review all decisions, and Captain Hunt proceeded to do so. Whilst he was conducting the review, however, he was interrupted by a transmission from East Midlands Airport informing him he could descend further to {{convert|12000|ft|m}} in preparation for the diverted landing. He did not resume the review after the transmission ended, and instead commenced descent.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The vibration indicators were smaller than on the previous versions of the 737 in which the pilots had the majority of their experience.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=69}}\n\nThe dials on the two vibration gauges (one for each engine) were small and the LED needle went around the outside of the dial as opposed to the inside of the dial as in the previous 737 series aircraft. The pilots had received no simulator training on the new model, as no simulator for the 737-400 existed in the UK at that time. At the time, vibration indicators were known for being unreliable<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|pages=69\u201370}} (and normally ignored by pilots), but unknown to the pilots, this was one of the first aircraft to have a very accurate vibration readout.<ref name=BBC/>\n\n[[File:Site of Kegworth aeroplane disaster - geograph.org.uk - 165281.jpg|thumb|left|May 2006 photograph of the site of the disaster]]\n\n===Engine malfunction===\nAnalysis of the engine from the crash determined that the fan blades (LP Stage 1 compressor) of the uprated [[CFM International CFM56]] engine used on the 737-400 were subject to abnormal amounts of vibration when operating at high power settings above {{convert|10000|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|pages=118\u2013120}} As it was an upgrade to an existing engine, in-flight testing was not mandatory, and the engine had only been tested in the laboratory. Upon this discovery the remaining 99 [[Boeing 737]]-400s then in service were grounded and the engines modified. Following the crash, it is now mandatory to test all newly designed and significantly redesigned [[turbofan]] engines under representative flight conditions.\n\nThis unnoticed vibration created excessive [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] in the fan blades, and on G-OBME this caused one of the fan blades to break off. This damaged the engine terminally and also upset its delicate balance, causing a reduction in power and an increase in vibration. The autothrottle attempted to compensate for this by increasing the fuel flow to the engine. The damaged engine was unable to burn all the additional fuel, with much of it igniting in the exhaust flow, creating a large trail of flame behind the engine.\n[[File:St Annes Cathedral, Belfast, July 2010 (20).JPG|right|thumb|upright|Memorial scroll in St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe official report into the disaster made 31 safety recommendations.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|pages=149\u2013152|}}\n\nEvaluation of the injuries sustained led to considerable improvements in aircraft safety and emergency instructions for passengers.<ref name=BBC/> These were derived from a research programme funded by the CAA and carried out by teams from the [[University of Nottingham]] and Hawtal Whiting Structures (an engineering consultancy company).

It's the right one\".<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=3}} In previous versions of the 737, the left air conditioning pack, fed with compressor bleed air from the left (number 1) engine, supplied air to the flight deck, while the right air conditioning pack, fed from the right (number 2) engine, supplied air to the passenger cabin. On the 737-400 this division of air is blurred; the left pack feeds the flight deck but also feeds the aft passenger cabin, while the right feeds the forward passenger cabin. The pilots had been used to the older version of the aircraft and did not realise that this aircraft (which had been flown by British Midland for only 520 hours over a two-month period) was different. The captain later claimed that his perception of smoke as coming forward from the passenger cabin led them to assume the fault was in the right engine.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=98}} The pilots throttled back the working right engine instead of the malfunctioning left engine.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=98}} They had no way of visually checking the engines from the cockpit, and the cabin crew&nbsp;\u2014 who did not hear the captain refer to the right hand engine in his cabin address&nbsp;\u2014 did not inform them that smoke and flames had been seen from the left engine.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=5}}\n\nWhen the pilots shut down the right engine, they could no longer smell the smoke, which led them to believe that they had correctly dealt with the problem. As it turned out, this was a coincidence: when the [[autothrottle]] was disengaged prior to shutting down the right engine, the fuel flow to both engines was reduced, and the excess fuel which had been igniting in the left engine exhaust disappeared; therefore, the ongoing damage was reduced, the smell of smoke ceased, and the vibration reduced, although it would still have been visible on cockpit instruments.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=99}}\n\nDuring the final approach to the [[East Midlands Airport]], the pilots selected increased thrust from the operating, damaged engine. This led to an engine fire that caused the engine to cease operating entirely. The [[ground proximity warning system]] (GPWS) activated, sounding several \"glideslope\" warnings. The pilots attempted to restart the right engine by [[Flameout#Engine restart|windmilling]], but the aircraft was by now flying at 185&nbsp;km/h (115&nbsp;mph), too slow for a restart. At 20:24:33, captain Hunt broadcast to the passengers via the aircraft's public address system: \"Prepare for crash landing,\" instructing passengers to take the brace position. The stick shaker then activated. Just before crossing the [[M1 motorway]] at 20:24:43, the tail and main landing gear struck the ground and the aircraft bounced back into the air and over the motorway, knocking down trees and a lamp post before crashing on the far embankment approximately 475 metres (<abbr title=\"0.3 mile\">519 yd</abbr>) short of the active [[runway]]'s paved surface and approximately 630 metres (<abbr title=\"0.4 mile\">689 yd</abbr>) from its threshold. The aircraft broke into three sections.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=7\u20138|}} This was adjacent to the motorway; remarkably, there were no vehicles travelling on that part of the M1 at the moment of the crash.<ref>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.itv.com/news/central/2014-01-08/why-did-british-midland-plane-crash-on-the-m1-near-kegworth/|title=Why did British Midland plane crash on the M1 near Kegworth?|date=8 Jan 2014|work=ITV News|accessdate=13 January 2017|url-status=live|publisher=ITV|agency=ITV Report}}</ref>\n\n==Casualties==\nOf the 118 passengers on board, 39 were killed outright in the crash and eight died later of their injuries, for a total of 47 fatalities.

Starting with the Boeing 737-400 variant, Boeing had redesigned the system to use bleed air from both engines.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Several cabin staff and passengers noticed that the left engine had a stream of unburnt fuel igniting in the jet exhaust, but this information was not passed to the pilots because cabin staff assumed they were aware that the left engine was malfunctioning.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=106}}\n\nThe smell of smoke disappeared when the autothrottle was disengaged and the right engine shut down due to reduction of fuel to the damaged left engine as it reverted to manual throttle.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=99}} In the event of a malfunction, pilots were trained to check all meters and review all decisions, and Captain Hunt proceeded to do so. Whilst he was conducting the review, however, he was interrupted by a transmission from East Midlands Airport informing him he could descend further to {{convert|12000|ft|m}} in preparation for the diverted landing. He did not resume the review after the transmission ended, and instead commenced descent.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} The vibration indicators were smaller than on the previous versions of the 737 in which the pilots had the majority of their experience.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|page=69}}\n\nThe dials on the two vibration gauges (one for each engine) were small and the LED needle went around the outside of the dial as opposed to the inside of the dial as in the previous 737 series aircraft. The pilots had received no simulator training on the new model, as no simulator for the 737-400 existed in the UK at that time. At the time, vibration indicators were known for being unreliable<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|pages=69\u201370}} (and normally ignored by pilots), but unknown to the pilots, this was one of the first aircraft to have a very accurate vibration readout.<ref name=BBC/>\n\n[[File:Site of Kegworth aeroplane disaster - geograph.org.uk - 165281.jpg|thumb|left|May 2006 photograph of the site of the disaster]]\n\n===Engine malfunction===\nAnalysis of the engine from the crash determined that the fan blades (LP Stage 1 compressor) of the uprated [[CFM International CFM56]] engine used on the 737-400 were subject to abnormal amounts of vibration when operating at high power settings above {{convert|10000|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|pages=118\u2013120}} As it was an upgrade to an existing engine, in-flight testing was not mandatory, and the engine had only been tested in the laboratory. Upon this discovery the remaining 99 [[Boeing 737]]-400s then in service were grounded and the engines modified. Following the crash, it is now mandatory to test all newly designed and significantly redesigned [[turbofan]] engines under representative flight conditions.\n\nThis unnoticed vibration created excessive [[Fatigue (material)|metal fatigue]] in the fan blades, and on G-OBME this caused one of the fan blades to break off. This damaged the engine terminally and also upset its delicate balance, causing a reduction in power and an increase in vibration. The autothrottle attempted to compensate for this by increasing the fuel flow to the engine. The damaged engine was unable to burn all the additional fuel, with much of it igniting in the exhaust flow, creating a large trail of flame behind the engine.\n[[File:St Annes Cathedral, Belfast, July 2010 (20).JPG|right|thumb|upright|Memorial scroll in St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast]]\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe official report into the disaster made 31 safety recommendations.<ref name=\"aaib_4/1990\" />{{rp|pages=149\u2013152|}}\n\nEvaluation of the injuries sustained led to considerable improvements in aircraft safety and emergency instructions for passengers.<ref name=BBC/> These were derived from a research programme funded by the CAA and carried out by teams from the [[University of Nottingham]] and Hawtal Whiting Structures (an engineering consultancy company).

He resumed his career after [[World War I]], entering but abandoning the Tour again in 1919 but placing third in the [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]] classic in 1920. In 1923 he completed the Tour de France and finished in eighth place. In the 1924 and 1925 Tours, he rode with the Italian [[Automoto]] team led by [[Ottavio Bottecchia]], where he was perhaps the first [[cycling domestique|domestique]] in the history of the Tour. He placed third in 1924 and second in 1925.\n\nThe 1926 Tour was the longest in its history (5,745&nbsp;km), with 17 stages averaging 338&nbsp;km. Buysse, racing with his two brothers [[Jules Buysse|Jules]] and Michel, took the [[yellow jersey]] from Gustave Van Slembrouck on stage 10 by attacking during a furious storm on the [[Col d'Aspin]] in the [[Pyrenees]]. He gained almost an hour during the stage over his team leader Bottecchia who then abandoned. Buysse arrived in Paris as the champion despite suffering the loss of his daughter during the race.\n\nBuysse won a total of five stages of the Tour during his career: one in 1923; two in 1925 and two

In the 1924 and 1925 Tours, he rode with the Italian [[Automoto]] team led by [[Ottavio Bottecchia]], where he was perhaps the first [[cycling domestique|domestique]] in the history of the Tour. He placed third in 1924 and second in 1925.\n\nThe 1926 Tour was the longest in its history (5,745&nbsp;km), with 17 stages averaging 338&nbsp;km. Buysse, racing with his two brothers [[Jules Buysse|Jules]] and Michel, took the [[yellow jersey]] from Gustave Van Slembrouck on stage 10 by attacking during a furious storm on the [[Col d'Aspin]] in the [[Pyrenees]]. He gained almost an hour during the stage over his team leader Bottecchia who then abandoned. Buysse arrived in Paris as the champion despite suffering the loss of his daughter during the race.\n\nBuysse won a total of five stages of the Tour during his career: one in 1923; two in 1925 and two in 1926.\n\n==Career achievements==\n===Major results===\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n;1913\n:Tour of Belgium for amateurs\n;1914\n:Brussels-Li\u00e8ge for amateurs\n;1922\n:Lier\n;1923\n:[[Six Days of Ghent]] (with [[Victor Standaert]])\n:[[1923 Tour de France|Tour de France]]:\n::8th place overall classification\n::Winner stage 8\n;1924\n:[[1924 Tour de France|Tour de France]]:\n::3rd place overall classification\n;1925\n:[[1925 Tour de France|Tour de France]]:\n::2nd place overall classification\n::Winner stages 11 and 12\n;1926\n:[[1926 Tour de France|Tour de France]]:\n::[[File:Jersey yellow.svg|20px]] '''Winner overall classification'''\n::Winner stages 10 and 11\n;1927\n:[[Stadsprijs Geraardsbergen]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n=== Grand Tour results timeline ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|\n!

He joined [[Namco]] in 1997, and was best known during his time with the company for writing music for a number of games in the ''[[Tales (video game series)|Tales]]'', ''[[Mr. Driller]]'', and ''[[God Eater]]'' franchises, He gained widespread recognition with his score for ''[[Tales of Legendia]]'' in 2005. Since then, he has also contributed music for several titles in the ''[[Tekken]]'', ''[[Ace Combat]]'', and ''[[The Idolmaster]]'' franchises. In addition to video games, Shiina has also composed soundtracks for various [[anime]] series and films, starting with the 2011 film ''Sakura no Ondo'', as well as composing and arranging songs for bands and other artists.\n\nShiina works is known for having strong and heavy, orchestral sounds. He left [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] in 2017, and is currently a freelance composer. Despite being freelance, he has continued to work with the company for various other projects, including the ''God Eater'' series, as well as other games such as ''[[Code Vein]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Yokohama]], Japan, Shiina was taught how to play the [[electronic organ]] from his parents when he was growing up.<ref name=\"SEMO\"/> Although he was not a dedicated musician before becoming a composer, he was at one time a member of a [[Megadeth]] cover band who also played [[J-pop]] music. Shiina enrolled at Dokkyo Junior High School. After being rejected by 46 companies, including a jewelry company, a finance company,  and a fast food company, he was hired by [[Namco]] (now [[Bandai Namco Games]]); he had little prior experience with video games.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nCreating music for old arcade releases using Namco's sound trackers felt more like computer programming than composing for Shiina, but he has said that the experience helped him out when he would have to use MIDI sounds in future games. The songs he composed for the first ''Mr. Driller'' were deemed unfitting for a puzzle game by some of the staff and they almost didn't make it into the final product.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nShiina's first solo project was ''Mr. Driller G''. He was given extensive access to live instruments and an incredible amount of creative freedom, setting the stage for his later work. The scores for future games in the ''[[Mr. Driller]]'' series would also be composed exclusively by Shiina.\n\nWhen he began writing songs for ''[[Tales of Legendia]]'', he originally tried to follow in the footsteps of the lead ''Tales'' series composer [[Motoi Sakuraba]], but was later inspired to develop his own style for it.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nIn September 2017, Shiina announced that he had retired from Bandai Namco.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Emily|title=Go Shiina retires from Bandai Namco|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/go-shiina-departs-bandai-namco/|publisher=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref> He is currently a freelance composer.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ja:\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af \u30d5\u30ed\u30e0 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\uff1a\u7279\u5225\u4f01\u753b\u3000\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u97f3\u697d\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u9078\u30762017\u5e74\u3053\u306e1\u679a|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/296/G029627/20171211122/index_2.html|website=4Gamer|accessdate=May 30, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nGo Shiina's music is characterized by dramatic melodies and unusual arrangements.

Many of Shiina's songs use live string sections, [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]], audio filter effects and artificial languages.\n\nHe has said that he can write music in any genre, as long as he is motivated, and has also stated that \"when I write a song, the time it takes me depends on whether I know the singer's natural voice. The genre doesn't matter...\" Shiina feels that there are two types of compositions: \"some tracks can stand alone as musical pieces, and some only work when you hear them in the game,\" and he often alters or leaves out certain songs when putting together albums. When composing vocal or instrumental tracks, he often sings the parts out loud.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nFor the soundtrack to ''[[God Eater]]'', Shiina explained that the creative nature of the story pushed him to be creative with the music as well. He looked around for a variety of instruments from many countries, and some of the styles and instruments featured in the score include [[Traditional Japanese music|Japanese traditional music]], [[Music of Africa|African rhythms]], and the Indian [[sitar]].<ref name=\"SEMO\"/> He has also done string arrangements for bands.<ref name=\"esteem\">{{cite

He joined [[Namco]] in 1997, and was best known during his time with the company for writing music for a number of games in the ''[[Tales (video game series)|Tales]]'', ''[[Mr. Driller]]'', and ''[[God Eater]]'' franchises, He gained widespread recognition with his score for ''[[Tales of Legendia]]'' in 2005. Since then, he has also contributed music for several titles in the ''[[Tekken]]'', ''[[Ace Combat]]'', and ''[[The Idolmaster]]'' franchises. In addition to video games, Shiina has also composed soundtracks for various [[anime]] series and films, starting with the 2011 film ''Sakura no Ondo'', as well as composing and arranging songs for bands and other artists.\n\nShiina works is known for having strong and heavy, orchestral sounds. He left [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] in 2017, and is currently a freelance composer. Despite being freelance, he has continued to work with the company for various other projects, including the ''God Eater'' series, as well as other games such as ''[[Code Vein]]''.\n\n==Biography==\nBorn in [[Yokohama]], Japan, Shiina was taught how to play the [[electronic organ]] from his parents when he was growing up.<ref name=\"SEMO\"/> Although he was not a dedicated musician before becoming a composer, he was at one time a member of a [[Megadeth]] cover band who also played [[J-pop]] music. Shiina enrolled at Dokkyo Junior High School. After being rejected by 46 companies, including a jewelry company, a finance company,  and a fast food company, he was hired by [[Namco]] (now [[Bandai Namco Games]]); he had little prior experience with video games.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nCreating music for old arcade releases using Namco's sound trackers felt more like computer programming than composing for Shiina, but he has said that the experience helped him out when he would have to use MIDI sounds in future games. The songs he composed for the first ''Mr. Driller'' were deemed unfitting for a puzzle game by some of the staff and they almost didn't make it into the final product.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nShiina's first solo project was ''Mr. Driller G''. He was given extensive access to live instruments and an incredible amount of creative freedom, setting the stage for his later work. The scores for future games in the ''[[Mr. Driller]]'' series would also be composed exclusively by Shiina.\n\nWhen he began writing songs for ''[[Tales of Legendia]]'', he originally tried to follow in the footsteps of the lead ''Tales'' series composer [[Motoi Sakuraba]], but was later inspired to develop his own style for it.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nIn September 2017, Shiina announced that he had retired from Bandai Namco.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McMillan|first1=Emily|title=Go Shiina retires from Bandai Namco|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/go-shiina-departs-bandai-namco/|publisher=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=October 1, 2017}}</ref> He is currently a freelance composer.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=ja:\u30df\u30e5\u30fc\u30b8\u30c3\u30af \u30d5\u30ed\u30e0 \u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30ef\u30fc\u30eb\u30c9\uff1a\u7279\u5225\u4f01\u753b\u3000\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u97f3\u697d\u30b3\u30f3\u30dd\u30fc\u30b6\u30fc\u304c\u9078\u30762017\u5e74\u3053\u306e1\u679a|url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/296/G029627/20171211122/index_2.html|website=4Gamer|accessdate=May 30, 2019|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\n==Musical style and influences==\nGo Shiina's music is characterized by dramatic melodies and unusual arrangements.

Many of Shiina's songs use live string sections, [[Slapping (music)|slap bass]], audio filter effects and artificial languages.\n\nHe has said that he can write music in any genre, as long as he is motivated, and has also stated that \"when I write a song, the time it takes me depends on whether I know the singer's natural voice. The genre doesn't matter...\" Shiina feels that there are two types of compositions: \"some tracks can stand alone as musical pieces, and some only work when you hear them in the game,\" and he often alters or leaves out certain songs when putting together albums. When composing vocal or instrumental tracks, he often sings the parts out loud.<ref name=\"CocoeBiz\"/>\n\nFor the soundtrack to ''[[God Eater]]'', Shiina explained that the creative nature of the story pushed him to be creative with the music as well. He looked around for a variety of instruments from many countries, and some of the styles and instruments featured in the score include [[Traditional Japanese music|Japanese traditional music]], [[Music of Africa|African rhythms]], and the Indian [[sitar]].<ref name=\"SEMO\"/> He has also done string arrangements for bands.<ref name=\"esteem\">{{cite
