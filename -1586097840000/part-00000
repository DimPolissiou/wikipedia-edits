[[Stutter|Stammering]] may be present, along with rapid speech. [[Panic attack]]s can also occur under intense fear and discomfort. Some sufferers may use [[Ethanol|alcohol]] or other [[Psychoactive drug|drugs]] to reduce fears and inhibitions at social events. It is common for sufferers of social phobia to [[self-medication|self-medicate]] in this fashion, especially if they are undiagnosed, untreated, or both; this can lead to [[alcoholism]], [[eating disorders]] or other kinds of substance abuse.

They may feel overly [[self-conscious]], pay high self-attention after the activity, or have high performance standards for themselves. According to the [[social psychology]] theory of [[impression management|self-presentation]], a sufferer attempts to create a well-mannered impression towards others but believe they are unable to do so. Many times, prior to the potentially anxiety-provoking social situation, sufferers may deliberately review what could go wrong and how to deal with each unexpected case. <!--example--> After the event, they may have the [[perception]] that they performed unsatisfactorily. Consequently, they will perceive anything that may have possibly been abnormal as embarrassing. These [[Automatic Negative Thoughts|thoughts]] may extend for weeks or longer. [[Cognitive distortion]]s are a hallmark, and are learned about in CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Thoughts are often self-defeating and inaccurate. Those with social phobia tend to interpret neutral or [[ambiguous]] conversations with a negative outlook, and many studies suggest that socially anxious individuals remember more negative memories than those less distressed.<ref name=\"furmark\">Furmark, Thomas.

During the presentation, the person may stutter a word, upon which he or she may worry that other people significantly noticed and think that their perceptions of him or her as a presenter have been tarnished. This cognitive thought propels further anxiety which compounds with further stuttering, sweating, and, potentially, a panic attack.\n\n===Behavioural aspects===\nSocial anxiety disorder is a persistent fear of one or more situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others and fears that he or she may do something or act in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing. It exceeds normal \"shyness\" as it leads to excessive social avoidance and substantial social or occupational impairment. Feared activities may include almost any type of social interaction, especially small groups, [[dating]], parties, talking to strangers, restaurants, interviews, etc.\n\nThose who suffer from social anxiety disorder fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous in the presence of people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations.<ref name=Schneier>{{cite journal|last=Schneier|first=Franklin|title=Social Anxiety Disorder|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=7 September 2006|volume=355|issue=10|pages=1029\u20131036|doi=10.1056/nejmcp060145|pmid=16957148}}</ref> People who suffer from this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is talking to them.<ref name=Schneier /><ref>{{cite web|last=Stein|first=Murray|title=Murray|publisher=council of University libraries}}</ref>\n\nAccording to psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]], [[phobias]] are controlled by [[escape response|escape]] and [[avoidance response|avoidance behaviors]]. For instance, a student may leave the room when talking in front of the class (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological or compulsive lying behavior in order to preserve self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids [[eye contact]] and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable [[Tremor|shaking]].<ref name=\"furmark\" /> A [[fight-or-flight response]] is then triggered in such events.\n\n===Physiological aspects===\nPhysiological effects, similar to those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobias.<ref name=\"physiology\">eNotes.

Eventually, mild social awkwardness can develop into symptoms of social anxiety or phobia.\n\n===Genetics===\nIt has been shown that there is a two to threefold greater risk of having social phobia if a first-degree relative also has the disorder.

They may feel overly [[self-conscious]], pay high self-attention after the activity, or have high performance standards for themselves. According to the [[social psychology]] theory of [[impression management|self-presentation]], a sufferer attempts to create a well-mannered impression towards others but believe they are unable to do so. Many times, prior to the potentially anxiety-provoking social situation, sufferers may deliberately review what could go wrong and how to deal with each unexpected case. <!--example--> After the event, they may have the [[perception]] that they performed unsatisfactorily. Consequently, they will perceive anything that may have possibly been abnormal as embarrassing. These [[Automatic Negative Thoughts|thoughts]] may extend for weeks or longer. [[Cognitive distortion]]s are a hallmark, and are learned about in CBT (cognitive-behavioral therapy). Thoughts are often self-defeating and inaccurate. Those with social phobia tend to interpret neutral or [[ambiguous]] conversations with a negative outlook, and many studies suggest that socially anxious individuals remember more negative memories than those less distressed.<ref name=\"furmark\">Furmark, Thomas.

During the presentation, the person may stutter a word, upon which he or she may worry that other people significantly noticed and think that their perceptions of him or her as a presenter have been tarnished. This cognitive thought propels further anxiety which compounds with further stuttering, sweating, and, potentially, a panic attack.\n\n===Behavioural aspects===\nSocial anxiety disorder is a persistent fear of one or more situations in which the person is exposed to possible scrutiny by others and fears that he or she may do something or act in a way that will be humiliating or embarrassing. It exceeds normal \"shyness\" as it leads to excessive social avoidance and substantial social or occupational impairment. Feared activities may include almost any type of social interaction, especially small groups, [[dating]], parties, talking to strangers, restaurants, interviews, etc.\n\nThose who suffer from social anxiety disorder fear being judged by others in society. In particular, individuals with social anxiety are nervous in the presence of people with authority and feel uncomfortable during physical examinations.<ref name=Schneier>{{cite journal|last=Schneier|first=Franklin|title=Social Anxiety Disorder|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=7 September 2006|volume=355|issue=10|pages=1029\u20131036|doi=10.1056/nejmcp060145|pmid=16957148}}</ref> People who suffer from this disorder may behave a certain way or say something and then feel embarrassed or humiliated after. As a result, they often choose to isolate themselves from society to avoid such situations. They may also feel uncomfortable meeting people they do not know, and act distant when they are with large groups of people. In some cases, they may show evidence of this disorder by avoiding eye contact, or blushing when someone is talking to them.<ref name=Schneier /><ref>{{cite web|last=Stein|first=Murray|title=Murray|publisher=council of University libraries}}</ref>\n\nAccording to psychologist [[B. F. Skinner]], [[phobias]] are controlled by [[escape response|escape]] and [[avoidance response|avoidance behaviors]]. For instance, a student may leave the room when talking in front of the class (escape) and refrain from doing verbal presentations because of the previously encountered anxiety attack (avoid). Major avoidance behaviors could include an almost pathological or compulsive lying behavior in order to preserve self-image and avoid judgement in front of others. Minor avoidance behaviors are exposed when a person avoids [[eye contact]] and crosses his/her arms to avoid recognizable [[Tremor|shaking]].<ref name=\"furmark\" /> A [[fight-or-flight response]] is then triggered in such events.\n\n===Physiological aspects===\nPhysiological effects, similar to those in other anxiety disorders, are present in social phobias.<ref name=\"physiology\">eNotes.

Social phobia is not caused by other mental disorders or by substance abuse.<ref>\"Social anxiety disorder.\" CareNotes. Truven Health Analytics Inc., 2012. Health Reference Center Academic.

Eventually, mild social awkwardness can develop into symptoms of social anxiety or phobia.\n\n===Genetics===\nIt has been shown that there is a two to threefold greater risk of having social phobia if a first-degree relative also has the disorder. This could be due to [[genetics]] and/or due to children acquiring social fears and avoidance through processes of [[observational learning]] or parental [[psychosocial]] education.

Benzodiazepines are not recommended as monotherapy for patients who have major depression in addition to social anxiety disorder and should be avoided in patients with a history of substance abuse.<ref name=Schneier />\n\nCertain [[anticonvulsant]] drugs such as [[gabapentin]] are effective in social anxiety disorder and may be a possible treatment alternative to [[benzodiazepine]]s.<ref name=\"pmid17502773\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Mula M, Pini S, Cassano GB | title = The role of anticonvulsant drugs in anxiety disorders: a critical review of the evidence | journal = J Clin Psychopharmacol | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 263\u201372 |date=June 2007  | pmid = 17502773 | doi = 10.1097/jcp.0b013e318059361a | url = }}</ref><ref name=\"SchatzbergCole2010\">{{cite book | author1 = Alan F.

The term ''sati'' also means \"to remember\". In the ''Satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na-sutta'' the term ''sati'' means to remember the [[dharma]]s, whereby the true nature of phenomena can be seen.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=942}} Sharf refers to the [[Milindapa\u00f1ha]], which explained that the arising of ''sati'' calls to mind the wholesome [[dhamma]]s such as the four foundations of mindfulness, the five faculties, the [[Bodhipakkhiy\u0101dhamm\u0101#Five powers|five powers]], the seven awakening-factors, the noble eightfold path, and the attainment of insight.{{sfn|Sharf|2014|pp=942\u201343}} According to Rupert Gethin, \n{{quote|[''sati''] should be understood as what allows awareness of the full range and extent of ''dhammas''; ''sati'' is an awareness of things in relation to things, and hence an awareness of their relative value. Applied to the ''satipa\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101nas'', presumably what this means is that ''sati'' is what causes the practitioner of yoga to \"remember\" that any feeling he may experience exists in relation to a whole variety or world of feelings that may be skillful or unskillful, with faults or faultless, relatively inferior or refined, dark or pure.\"{{sfn|Sharf|2014|p=943}}{{refn|group=note|Quotes from Gethin, Rupert M.L.

By over-emphasizing the nonjudgmental nature of mindfulness and arguing that our problems stem from conceptuality, contemporary authors are in danger of leading to a one-sided understanding of mindfulness as a form of therapeutically helpful spacious quietness. I think that it is important not to lose sight that mindfulness is not just a therapeutic technique but is a natural capacity that plays a central role in the cognitive process.

As cited by Renshaw and Cook, \u201cUnlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions\u201d.<ref name=\"Renshaw, T. L. 2016\" /> Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs. Yet, MBIs continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, \u201cMindfulness practices, particularly in relation to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche \u2013 one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future\u201d.<ref name=\"Choudhury & Moses 2016\" /> As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the \u201cbenefits\u201d and \u201cresults\u201d of MBIs are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.\n\nAvailable research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention. Semple, Lee, Rosa, & Miller argue, \u201cAnxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10826-009-9301-y |title=A Randomized Trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children: Promoting Mindful Attention to Enhance Social-Emotional Resiliency in Children |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=218\u201329 |year=2009 |last1=Semple |first1=Randye J |last2=Lee |first2=Jennifer |last3=Rosa |first3=Dinelia |last4=Miller |first4=Lisa F| name-list-format = vanc  }}</ref> They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems.

Studies have also demonstrated significant negative correlations between mindfulness and depression, neuroticism, absentmindedness, dissociation, rumination, cognitive reactivity, social anxiety, difficulties in emotion regulation, experiential avoidance, alexithymia, intensity of delusional experience in the context of psychosis, and general psychological symptoms.\u201d (References to underlying studies omitted from quotation.)\n\n===Effects on mindfulness===\nThe mechanisms that make people less or more mindful have researched less than the effects of mindfulness programmes, so we do not know much about what are the relevant components of mindfulness practice.

Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. The conflict is often presented in concern to the teacher's credentials and qualifications, rather than the student's actual practice.

As cited by Renshaw and Cook, \u201cUnlike most other approaches to contemporary school-based intervention, which are squarely grounded in behavioral, cognitive-behavioral, and ecological systems theories, MBIs have their origins in Eastern religious traditions\u201d.<ref name=\"Renshaw, T. L. 2016\" /> Some school administrators are concerned about implementing such practices, and parents have been reported to take their children out of mindfulness programs because of their personal religious beliefs. Yet, MBIs continue to be accepted by the mainstream in both primary and secondary schools because, \u201cMindfulness practices, particularly in relation to children who might otherwise be considered broken or unredeemable, fill a critical niche \u2013 one that allows its advocates to imagine a world where people can change, become more compassionate, resilient, reflective, and aware; a world with a viable future\u201d.<ref name=\"Choudhury & Moses 2016\" /> As mindfulness in education continues to develop, ethical consequences will remain a controversial issue because the generic description for the \u201cbenefits\u201d and \u201cresults\u201d of MBIs are largely concerned with individual and inward-focused achievement, rather than the original Buddhist ideal of global human connection.\n\nAvailable research reveals a relationship between mindfulness and attention. Semple, Lee, Rosa, & Miller argue, \u201cAnxiety can impair attention and promote emotionally reactive behaviors that interfere with the development of good study skills, so it seems reasonable that increased mindfulness would be associated with less anxiety\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10826-009-9301-y |title=A Randomized Trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children: Promoting Mindful Attention to Enhance Social-Emotional Resiliency in Children |journal=Journal of Child and Family Studies |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=218\u201329 |year=2009 |last1=Semple |first1=Randye J |last2=Lee |first2=Jennifer |last3=Rosa |first3=Dinelia |last4=Miller |first4=Lisa F| name-list-format = vanc  }}</ref> They conducted a randomized trial of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Children (MBCT-C) that found promise in managing anxiety for elementary school-aged children, and suggests that those who completed the program displayed fewer attention problems.

Studies have also demonstrated significant negative correlations between mindfulness and depression, neuroticism, absentmindedness, dissociation, rumination, cognitive reactivity, social anxiety, difficulties in emotion regulation, experiential avoidance, alexithymia, intensity of delusional experience in the context of psychosis, and general psychological symptoms.\u201d (References to underlying studies omitted from quotation.)\n\n===Effects on mindfulness===\nThe mechanisms that make people less or more mindful have researched less than the effects of mindfulness programmes, so we do not know much about what are the relevant components of mindfulness practice.

Criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. The conflict is often presented in concern to the teacher's credentials and qualifications, rather than the student's actual practice.

They were inspired to lead a life of renunciation.\n\nBrahmacharini Asha had in 1946 written an article entitled, ''\u2018Hindu Women\u2019s Right to Sannyasa\u2019'' published in Udbodhan magazine, in which she expressed her strong desire for the life of renunciation. \n\nFrom 1954 to 1958, Sri Sarada Math was a branch centre of the Ramakrishna Math at Belur. The Trustees of [[Belur Math]] assumed the responsibility of its administration. However, only the inmates of the Sri Sarada Math conducted the day-to-day work of the Math. When necessity arose, they sought advice from the senior monks of Belur Math. \n\nIn 1958, eight Brahmacharinis of the women\u2019s Math were tonsured and they performed the Shraddha ceremony. Then on 2 January 1959, in the Old Shrine of Belur Math, the President, Swami Sankarananda and other senior monks conducted the Viraja Homa, and the eight Brahmacharinis were ordained into formal Sannyasa. They were given the ochre robes and new names. Swami Madhavananda had compiled the names. They would be prefixed by \u2018Pravrajika\u2019 and ended with \u2018prana\u2019. So the names of the eight pioneer sannyasinis were [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Bharatiprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 1992), 48</ref>, [[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]], [[Pravrajika Muktiprana]], [[Pravrajika Dayaprana]], [[Pravrajika Vidyaprana]], [[Pravrajika Shraddhaprana]]<ref>Pravrajika Shraddhaprana (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineshwar, 2009), p.20</ref>, [[Pravrajika Bhaktiprana]], and [[Pravrajika Medhaprana]]. \n\nOn 26 August 1959, the Sri Sarada Math were recognised as an independent organisation and the full administration were handed over to the nuns. Seven of its Sannyasinis were elected to be the Trustees. The Trust deed was registered on 9 September 1959. With this, the President of the Sri Sarada Math was also given the responsibilities to give spiritual initiation (Mantra Diksha), brahmacharya initiation and the conferring of [[Sannyasa]] to eligible women. Thus, an independent Order of Sannyasinis were created. \n\nSri [[Sankaracharya]] did not sanction sannyasa for women. But [[Swami Vivekananda]] laid the foundation to admit women into the Puri [[Sampradaya]], one of the ten Orders of the Dasanami [[Sampradaya]] started by [[Sankaracharya]]. Not only this, the nuns were also given the right to confer Sannyasa upon other aspiring women. This honour was an epoch-making incident in the history of the Hindu religion. \n\nFrom the establishment of Sri Sarada Math in 1954 till it was legally independent in 1959, the total number of its members was 52. After that, many lay devotees of Ramakrishna came forward to help. In May 1960, the Trustees of the Sri Sarada Math established the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. The function of the Math gives emphasis on spiritual development (Atmano Mokshartham) while the Mission\u2019s main aim is service to society (Jagad Hitaya). Women devotees with faith in this ideal can become members of the Mission.\n\nFollowing the legal establishment of Ramakrisna Sarada Mission, the two centres run the Ramakrishna Mission for women, the Matri Bhavan (maternity hospital) in south Kolkata and the Women\u2019s Welfare Centre in central [[Kolkata]] were handed over to Ramakrishna Sarada Mission. \n\nWith donation from a devotee, Sri Devendranath Bhattacharya, the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission Vidyabhavan, a degree college was started in 1961. Later, some girls who received education at this college, have joined Sri Sarada Math and became nuns.\n\nIn 1963, the [[Ramakrishna Mission]] authorities handed over the Sister Nivedita Girls School to the Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Emblem and Motto ==\nThe emblem of the [[Ramakrishna Math]] designed by [[Swami Vivekananda]] was slightly modified to keep a separate identity. In Sri Sarada Math\u2019s emblem, the swan and snake are facing the opposite direction. Two small lotus buds were added to the blooming lotus. The sun has almost completely risen. \n\nThe motto of [[Ramakrishna Math]] and Mission, \u2018Atmano Mokshartham Jagad Hitaya Ca\u2019 is also shared by Sri Sarada Math and Ramakrishna Sarada Mission.\n\n== The Presidents ==\n=== Pravrajika Bharatiprana ===\nThe first president of the Math was [[Pravrajika Bharatiprana]] (1894-1973)<ref>''Pravrajika Bharatiprana'' (Sri Sarada Math: Dakshineswar), p.43</ref>. Formerly she was known as Sarala Devi, a disciple and personal attendant of [[Sri Sarada Devi]]. Following the guidance of her Guru and other disciples of [[Sri Ramakrishna]], Sarala Devi lived in [[Varanasi]] from 1927 to 1954, performing spiritual disciplines. She received the Kaula Sannyasa and the name Sri Bharati from [[Swami Saradananda]]. Assuming the leadership of the Sri Sarada Math, Bharatiprana served from December 1954 to January 1973, till her Mahasamadhi. \nHer pious life was written in [[Bengali language|Bengali]] as ''Bharatiprana Smriti Katha'' and later translated in [[English]] by Pravrajika Atmaprana as Pravrajika Bharatiprana.\n=== Pravrajika Mokshaprana ===\n[[Pravrajika Mokshaprana]] (1915-1999) was the second President.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mokshaprana.php</ref> She also served as the headmistress of Sister Nivedita's Girls' School from 1946 to 1948.\n\n=== Pravrajika Muktiprana ===\nPravrajika Muktiprana (1915-1994) was the third President of the Math.

[[Swami Vivekananda]] realized the dire necessity of women\u2019s Math which he expressed through his letters from 1894 to 1901. \n\n\u201cThere is no chance for the welfare of the world unless the condition of women is improved\u2026 Hence it is that my first endeavor is to start a Math for women.\u201d<ref>''Letters of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1993), p.201 \n</ref>\n\nMother (Sri Sarada Devi) has been born to revive\u2026[[Shakti]] in India; and making her the nucleus, once more will [[Gargi Vachaknavi|Gargis]] and [[Maitreyi|Maitreyis]] be born into the world\u2026 Hence it is her Math that I want first\u2026 Without the grace of [[Shakti]] nothing is to be accomplished\u2026. Hence we must first build a Math for Mother.\u201d<ref>Ibid, p.181\n</ref>\n\n\u201cBrother, in this terrible winter I am lecturing from place to place and fighting against odds, so that funds may be collected for Mother\u2019s Math.\u201d<ref>Ibid </ref>\n\n\u201cWith the Holy Mother (Sri Sarada Devi) as the centre of inspiration, a Math is to be established on the eastern bank of the [[Ganga]].\u201d<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda'' (Advaita Ashrama: Mayavati, 1989), vol.7, p.214\n</ref>\n\n\u201cIn the Women's Math there shall be no connection with monks, and in the Math for Men no connection with nuns.\u201d<ref>''Rules and Regulations of the Ramakrishna Math'', Belur, (1967), p.2</ref>\n\n== Activities == \n6th November 1981, the stone temple was consecrated as per the Hindu tradition.

Religious discourse and lectures are also done regularly.<ref>http://www.srisaradamath.org/mathhq.php</ref> \n\nThe training of brahmacharinis and novices are an essential activity of the Sri Sarada Math. \n\n== Publication ==\n''Nibodhata'', is the Bengali journal published every two months.
