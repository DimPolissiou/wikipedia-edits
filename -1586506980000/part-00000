It is a [[Prequel]] to ''[[Billa (2007 film)|Billa]]'' and focuses on how David, an ordinary man from the coastal regions of Sri Lanka, becomes Billa, a dreaded underworld don, with [[Ajith Kumar]] reprising the role of the titular character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/66818.html|title=Billa 2's plot revealed|publisher=IndiaGlitz|accessdate=28 January 2012}}</ref> [[Parvathy Omanakuttan]], [[Bruna Abdullah]], [[Vidyut Jammwal]] and [[Sudhanshu Pandey]] appear in supporting roles, all of them marking their debut in Tamil cinema. The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], while [[R. D. Rajasekhar]] handled the cinematography and [[Suresh Urs]] worked as the editor.\n\nThe film, produced by Wide Angle Creations in association with the [[Hinduja Group]] company IN Entertainment, was officially announced in November 2010, with [[Vishnuvardhan (director)|Vishnuvardhan]] as the director. Due to schedule clashes, Vishnuvardhan was replaced by Chakri Toleti, with a new script having been penned by a team involving Toleti, Sarath Mandava and Eric Felberg.\n\nPrincipal photography happened between July 2011 and December 2011. The filming primarily took place at [[Tamil Nadu]], Goa, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. ''Billa II'' was released worldwide on 13 July 2012 and a dubbed Telugu version titled ''David Billa'' was also simultaneously released in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] (then both states were combined under Andhra Pradesh state).<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/billa-2-to-release-wide-in-foreign-languages-news-tamil-mg0jN1dcgjg.html?scategory=tamil|title=Billa 2 to release wide in foreign languages!|publisher=Sify|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> The film garnered mixed reviews on release, though it collected decently at the box office because of the hype that created during pre-release. Eventually the film turned out to be one of the cults in Tamil films for its making and stylish presentation of protogonist.\n\n==Plot==\nDavid Billa ([[Ajith Kumar]]), an Sri Lankan refugee along with several others, arrives to the camp in [[Rameswaram]] where he befriends Ranjith ([[Yog Japee]]). The refugee camp is constantly terrorised by corrupt police officer Raghubir Sinha ([[Krishna Kumar (actor)|Krishna Kumar]]). Billa attacks Raghubir when he tries to forcefully detain one of his friends and for revenge he gets Billa tortured in police cell and vows to make him suffer. A few days later, Billa and Ranjith are hired to transport fish from Rameswaram to Chennai. But unknown to them, it was a plot by Raghubir to trap them as the truck they were driving had diamonds inside. But Billa realises the ploy and kills all the cops and drive the truck to its destination where they meet Selvaraj ([[Ilavarasu]]), who is pleased by Billa's loyalty and includes him in his business. Billa murders Raghubir at a [[brothel]].\n\nKotiswara Rao ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) visits Selvaraj and asks him if he could help in selling off the heroin he had brought along with him. Billa volunteers to sell it off and tries to deal the heroin to a local thug who refuses to pay for it in return. In a brutal scuffle that ensues where one of Billa's friends is slaughtered, Billa kills them all and goes directly to Koti's boss Abbasi ([[Sudhanshu Pandey]]) with the money and the heroin, who is very impressed by the former and recruits him. Abbasi is in business with Barovian mafia led by Dimitri ([[Vidyut Jammwal]]), who tells him that his arms consignment has been held by the Indian coastal guard and he asks for his help. Billa and Ranjith agree to retrieve the consignment for him and are congratulated by Dimitri for their work.\n\nBilla climbs the ladder of Abbasi's gang quickly. Later he learns of his sister death and brings his niece Jasmine ([[Parvathy Omanakuttan]]) with him. Billa and Koti travel to Russia to meet Dimitri, who happens to own an arms and ammunition manufacturing unit. Billa signs a deal with Dimitri without Abbasi's knowledge who learns this from Koti and is furious at Billa. Tensions further increase when Billa beats up Satish Kumar ([[Rohit Khurana]]), the son of an influential minister Praveen Kumar ([[Dinesh Lamba]]), when he tries to misbehave with Jasmine in a party. Abbasi expresses his discontent and vents at him. Billa, surprised and enraged at his ingratitude, walks away with Ranjith. Billa, Ranjith, and Ram (Sarath Mandava) plot to venture into the drug business on their own during the carnival. At the carnival, Billa is betrayed by Ram and is brutally attacked. However, he survives and finishes off the assailants, kills Abbasi and Ram, and becomes Goa's most powerful gangster. He begins a relationship with Abbasi's girlfriend Sameera ([[Bruna Abdullah]]).\n\nDimitri arrives to Goa and has a fallout with Billa when they try to negotiate a deal with Billa. So, Dimitri seeks to oust him. Dimitri seeks out the help of Koti, Satish, and Praveen to eliminate David. They proceed to kill Chief Minister Mohan Kanth ([[Madhusudhan Rao (actor)|Madhusudhan Rao]]), and the blame falls upon Billa. However, Billa is freed by threatening the judge and his family. After coming out, Billa rescues his niece from Koti's men and informs Sameera to take Jasmine to safety. But Sameera betrays Billa, informs the minister's son who hold Billa and Jasmine captives. Billa while being held to the ground and is mocked at by Satish, who slits Jasmine's throat. Enraged at her death, Billa overpowers and kills everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Dimitri is having an auction of his weapons, and Koti is present with him. He shows his factory in his computer via a series of webcams and much to everyone's shock, Billa is seen destroying his factory in Georgia. He also sees his consignment train go off course. He gets angered and kills Koti for not killing Billa, and he sets out himself to finish the task. The arms factory is destroyed by Billa and his friends. Dimitri arrives and follows his delivery train, when to his shock, the delivery train is blown by Billa, who would be waiting for him on his own helicopter. After an intense battle, Billa kills Dimitri. In the epilogue, Billa and Ranjith board a plane out of the country, and the loose threads (Sameera, Police and Lawyer) are eliminated by Billa's men.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as David Billa\n* [[Parvathy Omanakuttan]] as Jasmine\n* [[Bruna Abdullah]] as Sameera\n* [[Sudhanshu Pandey]] as Abbasi\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Russian Arms dealer Dimitri\n* [[Yog Japee]] as Ranjith\n* [[Manoj K.

The film's soundtrack and background score were composed by [[Yuvan Shankar Raja]], while [[R. D. Rajasekhar]] handled the cinematography and [[Suresh Urs]] worked as the editor.\n\nThe film, produced by Wide Angle Creations in association with the [[Hinduja Group]] company IN Entertainment, was officially announced in November 2010, with [[Vishnuvardhan (director)|Vishnuvardhan]] as the director. Due to schedule clashes, Vishnuvardhan was replaced by Chakri Toleti, with a new script having been penned by a team involving Toleti, Sarath Mandava and Eric Felberg.\n\nPrincipal photography happened between July 2011 and December 2011. The filming primarily took place at [[Tamil Nadu]], Goa, [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]] and in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. ''Billa II'' was released worldwide on 13 July 2012 and a dubbed Telugu version titled ''David Billa'' was also simultaneously released in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] (then both states were combined under Andhra Pradesh state).<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sify.com/movies/billa-2-to-release-wide-in-foreign-languages-news-tamil-mg0jN1dcgjg.html?scategory=tamil|title=Billa 2 to release wide in foreign languages!|publisher=Sify|date=26 June 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}</ref> The film garnered mixed reviews on release, though it collected decently at the box office because of the hype that created during pre-release. Eventually the film turned out to be one of the cults in Tamil films for it's making and stylish presentation of protogonist. \n\n==Plot==\nDavid Billa ([[Ajith Kumar]]), an Sri Lankan refugee along with several others, arrives to the camp in [[Rameswaram]] where he befriends Ranjith ([[Yog Japee]]). The refugee camp is constantly terrorised by corrupt police officer Raghubir Sinha ([[Krishna Kumar (actor)|Krishna Kumar]]). Billa attacks Raghubir when he tries to forcefully detain one of his friends and for revenge he gets Billa tortured in police cell and vows to make him suffer. A few days later, Billa and Ranjith are hired to transport fish from Rameswaram to Chennai. But unknown to them, it was a plot by Raghubir to trap them as the truck they were driving had diamonds inside. But Billa realises the ploy and kills all the cops and drive the truck to its destination where they meet Selvaraj ([[Ilavarasu]]), who is pleased by Billa's loyalty and includes him in his business. Billa murders Raghubir at a [[brothel]].\n\nKotiswara Rao ([[Manoj K. Jayan]]) visits Selvaraj and asks him if he could help in selling off the heroin he had brought along with him. Billa volunteers to sell it off and tries to deal the heroin to a local thug who refuses to pay for it in return. In a brutal scuffle that ensues where one of Billa's friends is slaughtered, Billa kills them all and goes directly to Koti's boss Abbasi ([[Sudhanshu Pandey]]) with the money and the heroin, who is very impressed by the former and recruits him. Abbasi is in business with Barovian mafia led by Dimitri ([[Vidyut Jammwal]]), who tells him that his arms consignment has been held by the Indian coastal guard and he asks for his help. Billa and Ranjith agree to retrieve the consignment for him and are congratulated by Dimitri for their work.\n\nBilla climbs the ladder of Abbasi's gang quickly. Later he learns of his sister death and brings his niece Jasmine ([[Parvathy Omanakuttan]]) with him. Billa and Koti travel to Russia to meet Dimitri, who happens to own an arms and ammunition manufacturing unit. Billa signs a deal with Dimitri without Abbasi's knowledge who learns this from Koti and is furious at Billa. Tensions further increase when Billa beats up Satish Kumar ([[Rohit Khurana]]), the son of an influential minister Praveen Kumar ([[Dinesh Lamba]]), when he tries to misbehave with Jasmine in a party. Abbasi expresses his discontent and vents at him. Billa, surprised and enraged at his ingratitude, walks away with Ranjith. Billa, Ranjith, and Ram (Sarath Mandava) plot to venture into the drug business on their own during the carnival. At the carnival, Billa is betrayed by Ram and is brutally attacked. However, he survives and finishes off the assailants, kills Abbasi and Ram, and becomes Goa's most powerful gangster. He begins a relationship with Abbasi's girlfriend Sameera ([[Bruna Abdullah]]).\n\nDimitri arrives to Goa and has a fallout with Billa when they try to negotiate a deal with Billa. So, Dimitri seeks to oust him. Dimitri seeks out the help of Koti, Satish, and Praveen to eliminate David. They proceed to kill Chief Minister Mohan Kanth ([[Madhusudhan Rao (actor)|Madhusudhan Rao]]), and the blame falls upon Billa. However, Billa is freed by threatening the judge and his family. After coming out, Billa rescues his niece from Koti's men and informs Sameera to take Jasmine to safety. But Sameera betrays Billa, informs the minister's son who hold Billa and Jasmine captives. Billa while being held to the ground and is mocked at by Satish, who slits Jasmine's throat. Enraged at her death, Billa overpowers and kills everyone.\n\nMeanwhile, in Russia, Dimitri is having an auction of his weapons, and Koti is present with him. He shows his factory in his computer via a series of webcams and much to everyone's shock, Billa is seen destroying his factory in Georgia. He also sees his consignment train go off course. He gets angered and kills Koti for not killing Billa, and he sets out himself to finish the task. The arms factory is destroyed by Billa and his friends. Dimitri arrives and follows his delivery train, when to his shock, the delivery train is blown by Billa, who would be waiting for him on his own helicopter. After an intense battle, Billa kills Dimitri. In the epilogue, Billa and Ranjith board a plane out of the country, and the loose threads (Sameera, Police and Lawyer) are eliminated by Billa's men.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajith Kumar]] as David Billa\n* [[Parvathy Omanakuttan]] as Jasmine\n* [[Bruna Abdullah]] as Sameera\n* [[Sudhanshu Pandey]] as Abbasi\n* [[Vidyut Jammwal]] as Russian Arms dealer Dimitri\n* [[Yog Japee]] as Ranjith\n* [[Manoj K.

The narrative is also framed within a police investigation involving interrogations of the main characters.\n\nMonths earlier, Jack's single mother, Karen, begins dating a man named Tom, who has a son Jack's age. Jack meets the son, Mark, and the two quickly become best friends. They also befriend a local girl named Sarah ([[Amandla Stenberg]]) when she defends them after they are assaulted by a group of thugs.

They later go out to the woods with some of Tom's guns and kill a squirrel.

Tensions between Tom and Karen over the raising of the boys gets worse until Karen discovers that Tom has been planning for Jack to join the Marines without her knowing, which infuriates her. Following an argument, Tom moves out of the house and takes Mark with him, which devastates Jack, who is clearly in love with Mark.\n\nMark leaves the school, leaving Jack with Sarah. The two start to date after Sarah is stood up at prom, but break it off when she realizes there is no chemistry between them. The two encounter Mark hanging out with a group of criminals, though Mark returns to Jack after the encounter and they make out again.\n\nThough Jack believes he and Mark will be a couple, Mark and Sarah reveal that they have started dating each other. After Sarah let the two talk Mark tells Jack that it will be easier this way. Feeling betrayed, Jack scuffles with Mark and pushes him, making Mark fall and hit his head on a rock. A distraught Jack carries Mark to the hospital, where Tom is informed that Mark will be fine. Mark convalesces at Karen's house, where he reveals to Jack that he doesn't remember what happened, and the two hold each other, which Tom notices. Meanwhile, the investigation takes a turn when it is revealed that Mark is dead.\n\nAs in the start of the film, Mark shows up at Jack's house with a battered face, presumably from Tom. Mark tells Jack that he wishes he were a girl. Jack puts on his mother's makeup and dress to try to seduce him, but Mark rebuffs his advances. The two get drunk before Mark appears with his father's guns, and the two go into the woods once more. The disoriented pair wanders around the area, before being disturbed by animal calls.
