Though the Goblin King, Jareth is never said to be a goblin himself, appearing instead as a handsome human. In an early draft of the ''Labyrinth'' script, however, he turned into a goblin when Sarah rejected him, suggesting that he was a goblin to begin with and his outer appearance was only an illusion.<ref name=\"screenplaydraft\">{{cite web|title=LABYRINTH: by Laura Phillips and Terry Jones|url=http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/script.txt|publisher=Astrolog.org|accessdate=January 26, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125210554/http://www.astrolog.org/labyrnth/script.txt|archivedate=25 January 2012}}</ref> Besides his goblin subjects, Jareth also reigns over the [[fairy|fairies]], [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]] and various creatures that dwell in the Labyrinth.<ref name=\"Film\">{{cite video |people=[[Jim Henson]] (director) |title=[[Labyrinth (1986 film)|Labyrinth]]  |type=film |publisher=[[TriStar Pictures]] |year=1986}}</ref>\n\nAccording to David Bowie, who portrayed the character, Jareth has reluctantly inherited his position and runs his kingdom under duress.<ref name=\"Notes\"/> Bowie said that Jareth \"would rather be down in [[Soho]]\" or some such place, but is resigned to his role as the Goblin King and \"runs [his kingdom] as well as he can\".<ref name=\"Inside\"/>\n\n=== Magical powers and abilities ===\nJareth's powers include the ability to form [[crystal ball|crystal orbs]] in his hands, which can create illusions of all types or allow him to view any place within his kingdom. He uses his crystals to show dreams, and offers a crystal to Sarah as a symbol of her dreams in exchange for her baby brother.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth is also a master of disguise. He can [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into a [[barn owl]], a form in which he appears at both the beginning and the end of the film. In another scene, he disguises himself as a blind [[Begging|beggar]], altering both his appearance and voice.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth also has the ability to reorder time. After Sarah belittles the Labyrinth as being too easy, Jareth moves time forward by three hours so that she has a stricter time limit in which to solve it. Although Sarah spends a total of ten hours in the Underground, when she returns to the human world only a couple of hours have passed.<ref name=\"Film\"/> The notion that Jareth is [[Immortality|immortal]] has been included in [[Jareth#Comic books|comic books based on the film]].\n\n=== Personality ===\nJareth is an mercurial being, prone to sudden changes of mood. He often grows impatient with his goblin subjects, annoyed at their lack of intelligence and having to remind them to laugh whenever he makes a joke. He uses intimidation and threats, such as that of the greatly feared Bog of Eternal Stench, to coerce his subjects into obeying his will. However, he also has a playful and affectionate side which is evident in his interactions with baby Toby. Jareth is highly emotional and often expresses his feelings through singing.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nBowie stated that Jareth is not evil;<ref name=\"Bravo\"/> however, he described the king as spoilt, childish and used to getting his own way.<ref name=\"Inside\"/> \"I think Jareth is, at best, a romantic; but at worst, he's a spoilt child, vain and temperamental \u2014 kind of like a rock 'n' roll star!\" Bowie said. He  added that the king is \"completely [[Infatuation|smitten]]\" by the character Sarah, admiring of her determination and virtue. According to Bowie, Jareth is lonely and longs for companionship, a sentiment which underlies his pleading for Sarah to remain with him in the Underground.<ref name=\"Notes\"/>\n\n[[Brian Henson]] has said that Jareth is emotionally immature and \"locked in a sort of teenage [[sensibility]] ... He\u2019s a little petulant and unpredictable and he's spoiled rotten\". However, Jareth \"learns his lesson\" about his faults by the end of the film, Henson said, remarking that \"''Labyrinth'' is both a [[coming of age story|coming of age]] for Sarah and a coming of age, in a way, for Jareth\".<ref name=\"Forbes\">{{cite magazine |last=Thompson |first=Simon |title=Jim Henson's 'Labyrinth' Returns To Theaters And Set To Become A Musical |magazine=[[Forbes]] |date=17 April 2018 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonthompson/2018/04/17/jim-hensons-labyrinth-returns-to-theaters-and-set-to-become-a-musical/#596822ed16fd | access-date= 14 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical response===\nAlthough ''Labyrinth'' received mixed reviews,<ref>{{cite web | title=Labyrinth (1986) | website=Rotten Tomatoes | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/labyrinth/}}</ref> Jareth has earned a positive reception from entertainment critics.

Though the Goblin King, Jareth is never said to be a goblin himself, appearing instead as a handsome human.

He uses his crystals to show dreams, and offers a crystal to Sarah as a symbol of her dreams in exchange for her baby brother.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth is also a master of disguise. He can [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into a [[barn owl]], a form in which he appears at both the beginning and the end of the film. In another scene, he disguises himself as a blind [[Begging|beggar]], altering both his appearance and voice.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth also has the ability to reorder time. After Sarah belittles the Labyrinth as being too easy, Jareth moves time forward by three hours so that she has a stricter time limit in which to solve it. Although Sarah spends a total of ten hours in the Underground, when she returns to the human world only a couple of hours have passed.<ref name=\"Film\"/> The notion that Jareth is [[Immortality|immortal]] has been included in [[Jareth#Comic books|comic books based on the film]].\n\n=== Personality ===\nJareth is an mercurial being, prone to sudden changes of mood. He often grows impatient with his goblin subjects, annoyed at their lack of intelligence and having to remind them to laugh whenever he makes a joke. He uses intimidation and threats, such as that of the greatly feared Bog of Eternal Stench, to coerce his subjects into obeying his will. However, he also has a playful and affectionate side which is evident in his interactions with baby Toby. Jareth is highly emotional and often expresses his feelings through singing.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nBowie stated that Jareth is not evil;<ref name=\"Bravo\"/> however, he described the king as spoilt, childish and used to getting his own way.<ref name=\"Inside\"/> \"I think Jareth is, at best, a romantic; but at worst, he's a spoilt child, vain and temperamental \u2014 kind of like a rock 'n' roll star!\" Bowie said. He  added that the king is \"completely [[Infatuation|smitten]]\" by the character Sarah, admiring of her determination and virtue. According to Bowie, Jareth is lonely and longs for companionship, a sentiment which underlies his pleading for Sarah to remain with him in the Underground.<ref name=\"Notes\"/>\n\n[[Brian Henson]] has said that Jareth is emotionally immature and \"locked in a sort of teenage [[sensibility]] ... He\u2019s a little petulant and unpredictable and he's spoiled rotten\".
