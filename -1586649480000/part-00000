He gained popularity as the lead vocalist and bass guitarist of British rock band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. After the group disbanded in 1968, he pursued a solo career and also played with several bands. \n\nIn the early 1960s, Bruce joined [[the Graham Bond Organisation]], where he met his future bandmate [[Ginger Baker]]. After leaving the Graham Bond Organisation, he joined with [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]], where he met [[Eric Clapton]], who also was his future bandmate. His time with the band was brief. In 1966, he joined [[Cream (band)|Cream]] with lead guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker. He co-wrote hits like \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\", \"[[White Room]]\" and \"[[I Feel Free]]\", with songwriter [[Pete Brown]]. After the band disbanded, Bruce formed his own blues rock band [[West, Bruce and Laing]] in 1972, with guitarist [[Leslie West]] and drummer [[Corky Laing]]. In the late 1960s, he started recording solo albums. His first solo album, ''[[Songs for a Tailor]]'', released in 1969, was a worldwide hit. His solo career spanned several decades. From the 1970s to 1990s, he played with several groups as a touring member. In 2005, he reunited with Cream, for concerts in [[Royal Albert Hall]] and [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. \n\nBruce is considered to be one of the most important and influential bass guitarists of all time. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine readers ranked him number eight on their list of \"10 Greatest Bass Guitarist Of All Time\".<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-top-ten-bassists-of-all-time-10325/8-jack-bruce-102949/|title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick the Top Ten Bassists of All Time|date=31 Mar 2011|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> He was inducted in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993<ref name=RockHall>{{cite news|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/cream|title=Cream: 1993 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee|date=|work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref>, and was awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2006<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/videos/jack-bruce-cream-lifetime-achievement-award-acceptance|title=Cream: Jack Bruce accepts Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of Cream|work=The Recording Academy}}</ref>, both as a member of Cream. \n\nHis first marriage was with [[Janet Godfrey]] in 1964, with whom he had two sons, Jonas and Malcolm. Their marriage ended in a divorce in 1981. His second marriage was with Margret Seyfer in 1982, with whom he had two daughters Natascha, Kyla and a son named Corin. He died of liver disease on 25 October, 2014 in England, aged 71. At the time of his death, he had a net worth of 20 million dollars.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1943-1962: Early life===\nBruce was born on 14 May 1943 in [[Bishopbriggs]], [[Lanarkshire]], Scotland, to Betty (Asher) and Charlie Bruce,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jack-bruce|title=Jack Bruce obituary|author=Alan Clayson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2014-10-26}}</ref> musical parents who moved frequently, resulting in the young Bruce attending 14 different schools, ending up at [[Bellahouston Academy]].

The band also included [[Electronic organ|organist]] [[Graham Bond]], saxophonist [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]] and drummer [[Ginger Baker]]. In 1963 the group broke up, and Bruce went on to form the Graham Bond Quartet with Bond, Baker and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They played an eclectic range of music genres, including [[bebop]], [[blues]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. As a result of [[session musician|session work]], Bruce switched from the upright bass to the electric [[bass guitar]]. The move to electric bass happened as McLaughlin was dropped from the band; he was replaced by Heckstall-Smith on saxophone, and the band pursued a more concise [[R&B]] sound and changed their name to [[the Graham Bond Organisation]]. The group released two studio albums and several singles but were not commercially successful.\n\nDuring the time that Bruce and Baker played with the Graham Bond Organisation, they were known for their hostility towards each other. There were numerous stories of the two sabotaging each other's equipment and fighting on stage. Relations grew so bad between the two that Bruce left the group in August 1965.<ref>{{cite book |first=Harry |last=Shapiro |title=Graham Bond: The Mighty Shadow |pages=85\u201386 |publisher=Crossroads Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1872747071}}</ref> After leaving, Bruce recorded a solo single, \"I'm Gettin Tired\", for [[Polydor Records]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> He joined [[John Mayall]] and his [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers|Bluesbreakers]] group, which featured guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. Bruce's stay was brief, and he did not contribute to any releases at the time, but recordings featuring him were later released, initially on ''[[Looking Back (John Mayall album)|Looking Back]]'' and ''Primal Solos''.\n\nAfter the Bluesbreakers, Bruce had his first commercial success as a member of [[Manfred Mann]] in 1966, including \"[[Pretty Flamingo]]\", which reached number one in the [[UK singles chart]] (one of two number one records of his career - the other being an uncredited bass part on [[The Scaffold]]'s \"[[Lily the Pink (song)|Lily the Pink]]\")<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\" /> as well as the freewheeling and groundbreaking [[jazz rock]] of ''[[Instrumental Asylum]]''. When interviewed on the edition of the [[VH1]] show ''[[Classic Albums]]'' which featured ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'', Mayall said that Bruce had been lured away by the lucrative commercial success of Manfred Mann, while Mann himself recalled that Bruce played his first gig with the band without any rehearsal, playing the songs straight through without error, commenting that perhaps the [[chord changes]] seemed obvious to Bruce.<ref name=\"classicalbums\">{{Cite episode |title=Cream - Disraeli Gears |series=[[Classic Albums]] |station=[[VH1]]|date=3 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nWhile with Manfred Mann, Bruce again collaborated with Clapton as a member of [[Eric Clapton's Powerhouse|Powerhouse]], which also featured [[Spencer Davis Group]] vocalist [[Steve Winwood]], credited as \"Steve Anglo\". Three tracks were featured on the [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] sampler album ''[[What's Shakin']]''. Two of the songs, \"Crossroads\" and \"Steppin' Out\", became staples in the live set of his next band, Cream.\n\n===1966-1968: Cream===\n{{main|Cream (band)}}\nIn July 1966 Bruce, [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Ginger Baker]] founded the [[power trio]] Cream, which gained international recognition playing [[blues-rock]] and [[jazz-rock|jazz-inflected rock]] music. Bruce sang most of the lead vocals, with Clapton backing him up and eventually assuming some leads himself.<ref name=\"classicalbums\" />\n\nWith his [[Gibson EB-3]] electric bass, Bruce became one of the most famous bassists in rock, winning musicians' polls and influencing the next generation of bassists such as [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[James Shaw (musician)|Jim Shaw]], [[Geddy Lee]], [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Jeff Berlin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bassplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=11837 |title=Cream Rises |first=Chris |last=Jisi |journal=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]] |date=November 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321163142/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/cream-rises/Nov-05/15324 |archivedate=21 March 2009}}</ref> Bruce co-wrote most of Cream's single releases with lyricist [[Pete Brown]], including the hits \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\", \"[[White Room]]\" and \"[[I Feel Free]]\". Cream broke up in 1968.<ref>{{Pop Chronicles|53}}</ref>\n\n===1970s: Post-Cream===\nCollaborative efforts with musicians, in many genres \u2013 [[hard rock]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[R&B]], [[jazz fusion|fusion]], [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]], [[world music]], [[third stream|third stream classical]] \u2013 continued as a theme of Bruce's career. Alongside these he produced a long line of highly regarded solo albums. In contrast to his collaborative works, the solo albums usually maintain a common theme: melodic songs with a complex musical structure, songs with lyrics frequently penned by Pete Brown and a core band of world-class musicians. This structure was loosened on his live solo albums and DVDs, where extended improvisations similar to those employed by Cream in live performance were sometimes still used.\n\nIn August 1968, before Cream officially disbanded, Bruce recorded a semi-acoustic [[free jazz]] album with [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]] and [[Jon Hiseman]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> This was issued in 1970 as Bruce's second solo album, ''[[Things We Like]]''. The album was a precursor to the [[jazz fusion]] boom in the early 1970s, and more recently has been sampled by many [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists [[Artifacts (group)|Artifacts]] and [[Smif-N-Wessun]].\n\nBruce's first solo release, ''[[Songs for a Tailor]]'', was issued in September 1969; it too featured Heckstall-Smith and Hiseman.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It was a worldwide hit, but after a brief supporting tour backed by [[Larry Coryell]] and [[Mitch Mitchell]], Bruce joined the [[jazz fusion]] group [[The Tony Williams Lifetime|Lifetime]], with drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], guitarist McLaughlin, and organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]], for its second album, ''Turn It Over'' (1970). For the group's third album, ''Ego'' (1971), [[Ron Carter]] replaced Bruce on bass, but Bruce contributed a guest vocal. Bruce then recorded his third solo album ''[[Harmony Row]]'', but this was not as commercially successful as ''Songs for a Tailor''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The song \"The Consul at Sunset\" from ''Harmony Row'', which was inspired by the [[Malcolm Lowry]] novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'', was released as a single in 1971 (Polydor 2058-153, b/w \"A Letter of Thanks\"), but did not chart.\n\n[[File:Jack Bruce Hamburg 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce performing in Hamburg, January 1972.]]\nIn 1972 Bruce formed a [[blues rock]] [[power trio]], [[West, Bruce & Laing]]. Besides Bruce, the group included singer/guitarist [[Leslie West]] and drummer [[Corky Laing]], both formerly of the Cream-influenced American band [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]]. West, Bruce & Laing produced two studio albums, ''[[Why Dontcha]]'' and ''[[Whatever Turns You On (album)|Whatever Turns You On]]'', and one live album, ''[[Live 'n' Kickin']]''.\n\nThe band's breakup was announced shortly before ''Live 'n' Kickin'''s release in early 1974, and Bruce released his fourth solo album ''[[Out of the Storm (Jack Bruce album)|Out of the Storm]]'' later that year. Also in 1974 he featured on the title track of [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[Apostrophe (')]]'', recorded in November 1972. Bruce was credited with bass and co-authorship on the improvised track. When asked about Zappa in a 1992 interview, Bruce tried to change the subject and jokingly insisted that he had played only cello parts. Outtakes from the session were released on the archival release ''The Crux Of The Biscuit'' in 2016. In 1973 Bruce recorded bass guitar for [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' album, playing on all but two tracks.\n\nA 1975 tour was lined up to support the ''Out of the Storm'' album with a band featuring former [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] and [[jazz]] keyboard player [[Carla Bley]], with whom he had collaborated in 1971 on ''[[Escalator over the Hill]]''. The tour was belatedly documented on ''[[Live at Manchester Free Trade Hall '75]]'' (2003),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudsandclocks.net/CD_reviews/bruceband_live75_E.html |title=The Jack Bruce Band: Live '75 \u2013 review |website=Cloudsandclocks.net |date=10 June 2003 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> but it ended with Taylor's departure, and sessions for a studio album were abandoned. During the next year, Bruce only resurfaced to play on [[Charlie Mariano]]'s ''Helen 12 Trees'' album.\n\nIn 1976, Bruce formed a new band (The Jack Bruce Band) with drummer [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] and keyboardist [[Tony Hymas]]. The group recorded an album, called ''[[How's Tricks]]''. A world tour followed, but the album was a commercial failure.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The follow-up album, ''[[Jet Set Jewel]]'', was rejected at the time by Bruce's record label [[RSO Records|RSO]] as not being marketable, and RSO ultimately dropped Bruce from their roster. In 1979 he toured with members from the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], reuniting him with John McLaughlin, and introducing him to drummer [[Billy Cobham]]. A 3-CD collection of his 1970s [[BBC]] recordings, entitled ''Spirit'', was released in 2008.\n\n===1980s===\nBy 1979, Bruce's drug habit had reached such a level that he had lost most of his money. Bruce contributed as a [[session musician]] to recordings by [[Cozy Powell]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Jon Anderson]] to raise money. By 1980 his career was back on track with his new band, Jack Bruce & Friends, consisting of drummer [[Billy Cobham]], guitarist [[Clem Clempson]] and keyboardist/guitarist [[David Sancious]]. After releasing an album, ''[[I've Always Wanted to Do This]]'', at the end of 1980, they undertook a long tour to support the record, but it was not a commercial success and they disbanded. In the early 1980s, he also joined up to play with friends from his Alexis Korner days in [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], the back-to-the-roots band that [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] had arranged, and Bruce appears on the album of the same name, recorded live in Germany in 1980. They also recorded a \"live in the studio\" album called ''Blues & Boogie Explosion'' for the German [[audiophile]] record label Jeton. That year he also collaborated on the [[Soft Machine]] album ''[[Land of Cockayne (album)|Land of Cockayne]]'' (1981).\n\nIn 1981, Bruce collaborated with guitarist [[Robin Trower]] and released two [[power trio]] albums, ''[[B.L.T. (album)|B.L.T.]]'' and ''[[Truce (album)|Truce]]'', the first of which was a minor hit in the US.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> By 1983, Bruce was no longer contracted to a major record company and released his next solo album, ''[[Automatic (Jack Bruce album)|Automatic]]'', on a minor German label, Intercord. A European tour followed to promote the album enlisting [[Bruce Gary]] from [[the Knack]] (who had also played in Bruce's 1975 band) on drums and Sancious from his 1980 band (Jack Bruce & Friends) on guitar and keyboards. In 1982, Bruce played with a short-lived ensemble ''A Gathering of Minds'', composed of Billy Cobham, [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Didier Lockwood]] and David Sancious at [[Montreux Jazz Festival|Montreux]]. In 1983, Bruce sang on tracks 5 and 6 of the Allan Holdsworth album ''[[Road Games (EP)|Road Games]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Bruce began working with the [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]/[[world music]] producer [[Kip Hanrahan]], and released the collaborative albums ''Desire Develops an Edge'', ''Vertical's Currency'', ''A Few Short Notes from the End Run'', ''Exotica'' and ''All Roads Are Made of the Flesh''. They were all critically successful, and in 2001 he went on to form his own band using Hanrahan's famous Cuban [[rhythm section]]. Other than his partnership with [[Lyrics|lyricist]] Pete Brown, Bruce's musical relationship with Hanrahan was the most consistent and long-lasting of his career.\n\nIn 1985, he sang lead and played [[blues harp]] on the song \"Silver Bullet\" with [[Anton Fier]]'s [[Golden Palominos]]. It appears on the album ''Visions of Excess''. In 1986 he re-recorded the Cream song \"I Feel Free\" and released it as a single to support an advertising campaign for the [[Renault 21]] motor car.\n\nIn 1989, Bruce secured his first major record deal in a decade, with [[Epic Records|Epic]], and recorded ''[[A Question of Time (album)|A Question of Time]]''. This included two tracks with [[Ginger Baker]] on drums, their first collaboration since Cream.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Baker then joined Bruce's live band and toured the United States at the turn of the decade.\n\n===1990s===\nBruce played at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1990, and was invited by the Irish [[blues rock]] performer, [[Rory Gallagher]] (who had a long-standing relationship with Bruce, having supported [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s farewell concert in the band [[Taste (band)|Taste]] in 1968) to perform a couple of songs together on stage. In 1991 he was one of the supporting musicians for [[Vivian Stanshall]]'s solo show \"Rawlinson Dog-ends\", but quit over a lack of adequate rehearsals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivarchive.org.uk/live.htm|title=Vivian's Live performances|accessdate=2015-07-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808080911/http://www.vivarchive.org.uk/live.htm|archivedate=8 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1993, a solo album, ''[[Somethin Els]]'', reunited him with Eric Clapton and brought belated, but widespread, critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackbruce.com/2008/Music/Albums/somethin_els.htm|title=Jack Bruce official website \u2013 Somethin Els (1993)|publisher=Jack Bruce Music|accessdate=15 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, Ginger Baker and a host of former Bruce band colleagues joined him for two special 50th birthdays concerts in Cologne, Germany, hosted by the TV show [[Rockpalast]]. Selections from these were released as the live double CD ''[[Cities of the Heart]]'', and much later as the DVD set ''Rockpalast: The 50th Birthdays Concerts''. One special guest was the Irish blues-rock guitarist [[Gary Moore]], who joined Bruce and Baker for a set of Cream classics. Inspired by this performance, the three formed the power trio [[Bruce-Baker-Moore|BBM]] and their subsequent (and only) album, ''Around the Next Dream'', was a top ten hit in the UK.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> However, the old arguments between Bruce and Baker arose again, and the subsequent tour was cut short and the band broke up. A low-key solo album, ''[[Monkjack]]'', followed in 1995, featuring Bruce on piano and vocals, accompanied only by the Funkadelic [[organ (music)|organist]] [[Bernie Worrell]].\n\nBruce then began work producing and arranging the soundtrack to the independently produced Scottish film ''[[The Slab Boys]]'', with; [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Edwyn Collins]], [[Eddi Reader]] and the [[the Proclaimers|Proclaimers]]. The soundtrack album appeared in 1997. In 1997 he returned to touring as a member of [[Ringo Starr]]'s [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]], which also featured [[Peter Frampton]] on guitar. At the gig in Denver, Colorado, the band was joined onstage by Ginger Baker, and Bruce, Baker and Frampton played a short set of Cream classics. Bruce continued to tour with Starr through 2000.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:JackBruce & fretless bass.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce playing a fretless [[Warwick Thumb SC|Warwick Thumb]] bass guitar at the Jazzfestival in [[Frankfurt]], Germany on 28 October 2006]]\nIn 2001, Bruce reappeared with a band featuring [[Bernie Worrell]], [[Vernon Reid]] of [[Living Colour]] on guitar and [[Kip Hanrahan]]'s three-piece Latin [[rhythm section]]. Hanrahan also produced the accompanying album ''[[Shadows in the Air]]'', which included a reunion with Eric Clapton on a new version of \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\". The band released another Hanrahan produced studio album, ''[[More Jack than God]]'', in 2003, and a live DVD, ''Live at the Canterbury Fayre''.\n\nBruce had suffered a period of declining health, after many years of addictions which he finally beat with clinical treatment, and in 2003 was diagnosed with [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/25/cream-bassist-jack-bruce-dies|title=Cream bassist, Jack Bruce, dies|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=25 October 2014}}</ref> In September 2003, he underwent a [[liver transplant]], which was almost fatal, as his body initially rejected the new organ.<ref>{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Dansby |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jack-bruce-on-the-mend-20031016 |title=Jack Bruce on the Mend |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=16 October 2003 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> He recovered, and in 2004 re-appeared to perform \"Sunshine of Your Love\" at a Rock Legends concert in Germany organised by the singer Mandoki.\n\nIn May 2005, he reunited with former Cream bandmates Clapton and Baker for a series of well-received concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4506185.stm |work=BBC News |title=Clapton returns for Cream dates |date=3 May 2005}}</ref> released as the album ''[[Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005]]'', and New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nIn between the UK and U.S. Cream dates, he also played live with [[Gary Moore]] and drummer [[Gary Husband]] at the [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]] tribute concert in London.\n\nSubsequent concert appearances by Bruce were sparse because of recovery after the transplant, but in 2006 he returned to the live arena with a show of Cream and solo classics performed with the German HR ([[Hessischer Rundfunk]]) Big Band. This was released on CD in Germany in 2007. In 2007, he made a brief concert appearance, opening a new rehearsal hall named in his honour at the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]], Glasgow with [[Clem Clempson]], keyboard player [[Ronnie Leahy]] and Husband.\n\nIn 2008, Bruce collaborated again with guitarist [[Robin Trower]] on the album ''Seven Moons''. It also featured Husband.\n\nIn May 2008, Bruce was 65 years old and to commemorate this milestone two box sets of recordings were released. ''Spirit'' is a three-CD collection of Bruce's BBC recordings from the 1970s. ''Can You Follow?'' is a six-CD retrospective anthology released by the Esoteric label in the UK. This anthology is a wide-ranging collection covering his music from 1963 to 2003 and, aside from his work with Kip Hanrahan, is a comprehensive overview of his career.\n\nImproved health led to Bruce playing a series of live outdoor concerts across the US starting in July 2008 as part of the Hippiefest Tour. He was supported by members of the late [[The Who|Who]] bassist [[John Entwistle]]'s the John Entwistle Band, and headlined at a tribute concert to the bassist.\n\nIn November 2008, he recorded a concert in [[Birmingham]], England for Radio Broadcast with the BBC Big Band, where he again played the Big Band arrangements of his classic songs. In December he was reunited with Ginger Baker at the drummer's Lifetime Achievement Award concert in London. They played jazz classics with saxophonist [[Courtney Pine]] and for the first time in 40 years played the Graham Bond\u2013Cream classic \"Traintime\".\n\nThe same month, Bruce, with guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], drummer [[Cindy Blackman]] and organist [[John Medeski]] played a series of [[Blue Note (jazz clubs)|Blue Note Club]] tribute concerts to [[the Tony Williams Lifetime]] in Japan. These shows were broadcast in high definition on television in Japan.\n\nIn 2009, Bruce performed in a series of concerts with Trower and Husband in Europe. Proposed dates in the U.S. in April were cancelled because of a further bout of ill health. Bruce recovered and the band played summer concerts in Italy, Norway and the UK during 2009. This promoted the release of the ''Seven Moons'' live CD and DVD, recorded in February during the European leg of the tour in [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands.\n\nDuring the Scottish dates of the 2009 tour Bruce was presented with an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate of Letters]] from [[Glasgow Caledonian University]] for services to the culture of [[Glasgow]] and music in general.\n\nIn August 2009, the 1983 Bruce solo album ''[[Automatic (Jack Bruce album)|Automatic]]'' was re-released, making his entire solo catalogue available on CD. In addition, all of the discs up to and including ''[[How's Tricks]]'' contain previously unreleased material.\n\nIn October 2009, Bruce performed at the 50th anniversary of [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's Club]] with the Ronnie Scott's Blues Band.\n\n===2010s===\n''Jack Bruce - Composing Himself: The Authorized Biography'' by [[Harry Shapiro (author)|Harry Shapiro]] was released by Jawbone Press in February 2010. Shapiro had previously written biographies of Bruce collaborators Alexis Korner, Graham Bond and Eric Clapton. The book followed memoirs from his Cream bandmates Clapton (''Clapton'', 2007) and Baker (''Hellraiser'', 2009). His songwriting partner, Pete Brown's, biography ''White Rooms & Imaginary Westerns'' was published in September 2010. They each have differing recollections of forming Cream, playing and writing together.\n\nOn 14 January, at the 2011 North American Music Merchants Show, Bruce became only the third recipient of the International Bassist Award, a lifetime achievement award for bassists, after [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Nathan Watts]].\n\nHis first independent CD release, ''Live at the Milky Way, Amsterdam 2001'', featuring The Cuicoland Express, his [[Latin American music|Latin-based]] band of the time, was issued in October 2010. The double album received an official worldwide release, distributed by EMI in February 2011. To support this release Bruce again played four dates in London at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with the Ronnie Scott's Blues Experience, followed by a further ten dates across the UK with the band. On 4 June 2011, Bruce played a special concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, which was celebrating its 60th anniversary. The evening celebrated the 50th anniversary of the [[British blues|blues in Great Britain]], and Bruce played with his Big Blues Band and special guest [[Joe Bonamassa]].\n\nBruce started 2012 playing the [[Gerry Rafferty]] tribute concert in Glasgow, followed by a date with the traditional Celtic band [[Lau (band)|Lau]]. [[BBC Scotland]] recorded a one-hour special on Bruce, which also included a performance with Lau. The completed documentary ''Jack Bruce \u2013 The Man behind the Bass'' was transmitted in February 2012 by BBC Scotland. It featured new interviews with Bruce, Clapton, Baker and Brown. It was transmitted again on 9 November 2014 on BBC2 Scotland and on 17 November 2014 on BBC4 in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01c6hw2|title=BBC Two - ArtWorks Scotland, Jack Bruce: The Man Behind the Bass|website=BBC}}</ref>\n\nFebruary 2012 saw Bruce playing in [[Havana]], Cuba, along with guitarist [[Phil Manzanera]], supporting the mambo band of Augusto Enriquez. March saw another residency at Ronnie Scott's in London supported by his Big Blues Band, followed by a UK tour. The concert at the Stables, Milton Keynes on 18 March was due to be recorded as an Instant Live CD release, but technical issues prevented this. The following evenings' performance at the same location was recorded and a 2CD version issued by Instant Live.\n\n''Spectrum Road'', a collaboration with [[Vernon Reid]], [[Cindy Blackman]] and [[John Medeski]] in tribute to [[The Tony Williams Lifetime]], was released in June 2012 by the US jazz record label [[Palmetto Records]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Jurek |first=Thom |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/spectrum-road-mw0002330321 |title=Spectrum Road \u2013 Spectrum Road : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> and was accompanied by a series of dates at large jazz festivals in North America and Europe throughout June and July.\n\nIn March 2014, Bruce released ''[[Silver Rails]]'' on the [[Esoteric Records|Esoteric Antenna]] label, his first solo studio album in over a decade.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://jackbruce.com/2008/NewsArchive/esoteric_release.htm|title=Jack Bruce to Release New Studio Album on Esoteric Antenna|accessdate=25 September 2013 |publisher=Esoteric Antenna}}</ref> ''Silver Rails'' was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, produced and mixed by Rob Cass and features contributions from Cream lyricist, [[Pete Brown]], [[Kip Hanrahan]] and wife Margrit Seyffer as well as musicians [[Robin Trower]], [[Cindy Blackman]], [[Phil Manzanera]], [[Uli Jon Roth]], [[John Medeski]] and [[Bernie Marsden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/feature-jack-bruce-still-going-strong-at-71/|title=Feature-Jack Bruce: Still going strong at 71|work=For Bass Players Only|date=2014-09-10}}</ref> The deluxe version of the album featured a behind the scenes documentary \"The Making of Silver Rails\" which was filmed on location at the studios and directed by Bruce's daughter Kyla Simone Bruce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetmosh.com/jack-bruce-interview-on-you-tube/|title=Jack Bruce interview on You Tube|work=PlanetMosh|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019130318/http://planetmosh.com/jack-bruce-interview-on-you-tube/|archivedate=19 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bruce's son Malcolm Bruce pre-produced the album and played guitar on several tracks, while Bruce's daughter [[Aruba Red]] was featured on \"Hidden Cities\" singing backing vocals.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1964 Bruce married [[Janet Godfrey]], who had been the secretary of the Graham Bond Organisation fan club and had collaborated with Bruce on two songs written for the group.<ref name=Welch/> The couple had two sons together, Jonas (Jo) Bruce, who grew up to play keyboards in his father's band and played with [[Afro Celt Sound System]], and Malcolm Bruce, who grew up to play the guitar with his father and played with Ginger Baker's son, Kofi.

He gained popularity as the lead vocalist and bass guitarist of British rock band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. After the group disbanded in 1968, he pursued a solo career and also played with several bands. \n\nIn the early 1960s, Bruce joined [[the Graham Bond Organisation]], where he met his future bandmate [[Ginger Baker]]. After leaving the Graham Bond Organisation, he joined with [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers]], where he met [[Eric Clapton]], who also was his future bandmate. His time with the band was brief. In 1966, he joined [[Cream (band)|Cream]] with lead guitarist Clapton and drummer Baker. He co-wrote hits like \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\", \"[[White Room]]\" and \"[[I Feel Free]]\", with songwriter [[Pete Brown]]. After the band disbanded, Bruce formed his own blues rock band [[West, Bruce and Laing]] in 1972, with guitarist [[Leslie West]] and drummer [[Corky Laing]]. In the late 1960s, he started recording solo albums. His first solo album, ''[[Songs for a Tailor]]'', released in 1969, was a worldwide hit. His solo career spanned several decades. From the 1970s to 1990s, he played with several groups as a touring member. In 2005, he reunited with Cream, for concerts in [[Royal Albert Hall]] and [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. \n\nBruce is considered to be one of the most important and influential bass guitarist of all time. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine readers ranked him number eight on their list of \"10 Greatest Bass Guitarist Of All Time\".<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-top-ten-bassists-of-all-time-10325/8-jack-bruce-102949/|title=Rolling Stone Readers Pick the Top Ten Bassists of All Time|date=31 Mar 2011|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> He was inducted in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1993<ref name=RockHall>{{cite news|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/cream|title=Cream: 1993 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Inductee|date=|work=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame}}</ref>, and was awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 2006<ref name=Grammy>{{cite news|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/videos/jack-bruce-cream-lifetime-achievement-award-acceptance|title=Cream: Jack Bruce accepts Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of Cream|work=The Recording Academy}}</ref>, both as a member of Cream. \n\nHis first marriage was with [[Janet Godfrey]] in 1964, with whom he had two sons, Jonas and Malcolm. Their marriage ended in a divorce in 1981. His second marriage was with Margret Seyfer in 1982, with whom he had two daughters Natascha, Kyla and a son named Corin. He died of liver disease on 25 October, 2014 in England, aged 71. At the time of his death, he had a net worth of 20 million dollars.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1943-1962: Early life===\nBruce was born on 14 May 1943 in [[Bishopbriggs]], [[Lanarkshire]], Scotland, to Betty (Asher) and Charlie Bruce,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/26/jack-bruce|title=Jack Bruce obituary|author=Alan Clayson|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=2014-10-26}}</ref> musical parents who moved frequently, resulting in the young Bruce attending 14 different schools, ending up at [[Bellahouston Academy]]. He began playing [[jazz bass]] in his teens and won a scholarship to study cello and [[musical composition]] at the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]] while playing in Jim McHarg's Scotsville Jazzband to support himself.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\">{{cite book |first=Martin C. |last=Strong |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |pages=127\u2013128 |isbn=978-1-84195-017-4}}</ref>\n\n===1962-1966: Early career===\nAfter leaving school he toured Italy, playing double bass with the Murray Campbell Big Band.<ref name=Welch>{{cite book |first=Chris |last=Welch |title=Cream: The Legendary Sixties Supergroup |publisher=Backbeat Books |year=2000 |isbn=978-0879306243}}</ref> In 1962 Bruce became a member of the London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firstfoot.com/good-scottish-pop/jackbruce.htm |title=Good Scottish Pop \u2013 Jack Bruce |website=Firstfoot.com |accessdate=11 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204062131/http://www.firstfoot.com/good-scottish-pop/jackbruce.htm |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> led by [[Alexis Korner]], in which he played the [[upright bass]]. The band also included [[Electronic organ|organist]] [[Graham Bond]], saxophonist [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]] and drummer [[Ginger Baker]]. In 1963 the group broke up, and Bruce went on to form the Graham Bond Quartet with Bond, Baker and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> They played an eclectic range of music genres, including [[bebop]], [[blues]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. As a result of [[session musician|session work]], Bruce switched from the upright bass to the electric [[bass guitar]]. The move to electric bass happened as McLaughlin was dropped from the band; he was replaced by Heckstall-Smith on saxophone, and the band pursued a more concise [[R&B]] sound and changed their name to [[the Graham Bond Organisation]]. The group released two studio albums and several singles but were not commercially successful.\n\nDuring the time that Bruce and Baker played with the Graham Bond Organisation, they were known for their hostility towards each other. There were numerous stories of the two sabotaging each other's equipment and fighting on stage. Relations grew so bad between the two that Bruce left the group in August 1965.<ref>{{cite book |first=Harry |last=Shapiro |title=Graham Bond: The Mighty Shadow |pages=85\u201386 |publisher=Crossroads Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1872747071}}</ref> After leaving, Bruce recorded a solo single, \"I'm Gettin Tired\", for [[Polydor Records]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> He joined [[John Mayall]] and his [[John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers|Bluesbreakers]] group, which featured guitarist [[Eric Clapton]]. Bruce's stay was brief, and he did not contribute to any releases at the time, but recordings featuring him were later released, initially on ''[[Looking Back (John Mayall album)|Looking Back]]'' and ''Primal Solos''.\n\nAfter the Bluesbreakers, Bruce had his first commercial success as a member of [[Manfred Mann]] in 1966, including \"[[Pretty Flamingo]]\", which reached number one in the [[UK singles chart]] (one of two number one records of his career - the other being an uncredited bass part on [[The Scaffold]]'s \"[[Lily the Pink (song)|Lily the Pink]]\")<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\" /> as well as the freewheeling and groundbreaking [[jazz rock]] of ''[[Instrumental Asylum]]''. When interviewed on the edition of the [[VH1]] show ''[[Classic Albums]]'' which featured ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'', Mayall said that Bruce had been lured away by the lucrative commercial success of Manfred Mann, while Mann himself recalled that Bruce played his first gig with the band without any rehearsal, playing the songs straight through without error, commenting that perhaps the [[chord changes]] seemed obvious to Bruce.<ref name=\"classicalbums\">{{Cite episode |title=Cream - Disraeli Gears |series=[[Classic Albums]] |station=[[VH1]]|date=3 November 2006}}</ref>\n\nWhile with Manfred Mann, Bruce again collaborated with Clapton as a member of [[Eric Clapton's Powerhouse|Powerhouse]], which also featured [[Spencer Davis Group]] vocalist [[Steve Winwood]], credited as \"Steve Anglo\". Three tracks were featured on the [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] sampler album ''[[What's Shakin']]''. Two of the songs, \"Crossroads\" and \"Steppin' Out\", became staples in the live set of his next band, Cream.\n\n===1966-1968: Cream===\n{{main|Cream (band)}}\nIn July 1966 Bruce, [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Ginger Baker]] founded the [[power trio]] Cream, which gained international recognition playing [[blues-rock]] and [[jazz-rock|jazz-inflected rock]] music. Bruce sang most of the lead vocals, with Clapton backing him up and eventually assuming some leads himself.<ref name=\"classicalbums\" />\n\nWith his [[Gibson EB-3]] electric bass, Bruce became one of the most famous bassists in rock, winning musicians' polls and influencing the next generation of bassists such as [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[James Shaw (musician)|Jim Shaw]], [[Geddy Lee]], [[Geezer Butler]] and [[Jeff Berlin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bassplayer.com/story.asp?storycode=11837 |title=Cream Rises |first=Chris |last=Jisi |journal=[[Bass Player (magazine)|Bass Player]] |date=November 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321163142/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/cream-rises/Nov-05/15324 |archivedate=21 March 2009}}</ref> Bruce co-wrote most of Cream's single releases with lyricist [[Pete Brown]], including the hits \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\", \"[[White Room]]\" and \"[[I Feel Free]]\". Cream broke up in 1968.<ref>{{Pop Chronicles|53}}</ref>\n\n===1970s: Post-Cream===\nCollaborative efforts with musicians, in many genres \u2013 [[hard rock]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[R&B]], [[jazz fusion|fusion]], [[avant-garde music|avant-garde]], [[world music]], [[third stream|third stream classical]] \u2013 continued as a theme of Bruce's career. Alongside these he produced a long line of highly regarded solo albums. In contrast to his collaborative works, the solo albums usually maintain a common theme: melodic songs with a complex musical structure, songs with lyrics frequently penned by Pete Brown and a core band of world-class musicians. This structure was loosened on his live solo albums and DVDs, where extended improvisations similar to those employed by Cream in live performance were sometimes still used.\n\nIn August 1968, before Cream officially disbanded, Bruce recorded a semi-acoustic [[free jazz]] album with [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]], [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]] and [[Jon Hiseman]].<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> This was issued in 1970 as Bruce's second solo album, ''[[Things We Like]]''. The album was a precursor to the [[jazz fusion]] boom in the early 1970s, and more recently has been sampled by many [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artists [[Artifacts (group)|Artifacts]] and [[Smif-N-Wessun]].\n\nBruce's first solo release, ''[[Songs for a Tailor]]'', was issued in September 1969; it too featured Heckstall-Smith and Hiseman.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> It was a worldwide hit, but after a brief supporting tour backed by [[Larry Coryell]] and [[Mitch Mitchell]], Bruce joined the [[jazz fusion]] group [[The Tony Williams Lifetime|Lifetime]], with drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], guitarist McLaughlin, and organist [[Larry Young (musician)|Larry Young]], for its second album, ''Turn It Over'' (1970). For the group's third album, ''Ego'' (1971), [[Ron Carter]] replaced Bruce on bass, but Bruce contributed a guest vocal. Bruce then recorded his third solo album ''[[Harmony Row]]'', but this was not as commercially successful as ''Songs for a Tailor''.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The song \"The Consul at Sunset\" from ''Harmony Row'', which was inspired by the [[Malcolm Lowry]] novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'', was released as a single in 1971 (Polydor 2058-153, b/w \"A Letter of Thanks\"), but did not chart.\n\n[[File:Jack Bruce Hamburg 1972.jpg|thumb|left|Bruce performing in Hamburg, January 1972.]]\nIn 1972 Bruce formed a [[blues rock]] [[power trio]], [[West, Bruce & Laing]]. Besides Bruce, the group included singer/guitarist [[Leslie West]] and drummer [[Corky Laing]], both formerly of the Cream-influenced American band [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]]. West, Bruce & Laing produced two studio albums, ''[[Why Dontcha]]'' and ''[[Whatever Turns You On (album)|Whatever Turns You On]]'', and one live album, ''[[Live 'n' Kickin']]''.\n\nThe band's breakup was announced shortly before ''Live 'n' Kickin'''s release in early 1974, and Bruce released his fourth solo album ''[[Out of the Storm (Jack Bruce album)|Out of the Storm]]'' later that year. Also in 1974 he featured on the title track of [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[Apostrophe (')]]'', recorded in November 1972. Bruce was credited with bass and co-authorship on the improvised track. When asked about Zappa in a 1992 interview, Bruce tried to change the subject and jokingly insisted that he had played only cello parts. Outtakes from the session were released on the archival release ''The Crux Of The Biscuit'' in 2016. In 1973 Bruce recorded bass guitar for [[Lou Reed]]'s ''[[Berlin (Lou Reed album)|Berlin]]'' album, playing on all but two tracks.\n\nA 1975 tour was lined up to support the ''Out of the Storm'' album with a band featuring former [[Rolling Stones]] guitarist [[Mick Taylor]] and [[jazz]] keyboard player [[Carla Bley]], with whom he had collaborated in 1971 on ''[[Escalator over the Hill]]''. The tour was belatedly documented on ''[[Live at Manchester Free Trade Hall '75]]'' (2003),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cloudsandclocks.net/CD_reviews/bruceband_live75_E.html |title=The Jack Bruce Band: Live '75 \u2013 review |website=Cloudsandclocks.net |date=10 June 2003 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> but it ended with Taylor's departure, and sessions for a studio album were abandoned. During the next year, Bruce only resurfaced to play on [[Charlie Mariano]]'s ''Helen 12 Trees'' album.\n\nIn 1976, Bruce formed a new band (The Jack Bruce Band) with drummer [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]] and keyboardist [[Tony Hymas]]. The group recorded an album, called ''[[How's Tricks]]''. A world tour followed, but the album was a commercial failure.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> The follow-up album, ''[[Jet Set Jewel]]'', was rejected at the time by Bruce's record label [[RSO Records|RSO]] as not being marketable, and RSO ultimately dropped Bruce from their roster. In 1979 he toured with members from the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]], reuniting him with John McLaughlin, and introducing him to drummer [[Billy Cobham]]. A 3-CD collection of his 1970s [[BBC]] recordings, entitled ''Spirit'', was released in 2008.\n\n===1980s===\nBy 1979, Bruce's drug habit had reached such a level that he had lost most of his money. Bruce contributed as a [[session musician]] to recordings by [[Cozy Powell]], [[Gary Moore]] and [[Jon Anderson]] to raise money. By 1980 his career was back on track with his new band, Jack Bruce & Friends, consisting of drummer [[Billy Cobham]], guitarist [[Clem Clempson]] and keyboardist/guitarist [[David Sancious]]. After releasing an album, ''[[I've Always Wanted to Do This]]'', at the end of 1980, they undertook a long tour to support the record, but it was not a commercial success and they disbanded. In the early 1980s, he also joined up to play with friends from his Alexis Korner days in [[Rocket 88 (band)|Rocket 88]], the back-to-the-roots band that [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] had arranged, and Bruce appears on the album of the same name, recorded live in Germany in 1980. They also recorded a \"live in the studio\" album called ''Blues & Boogie Explosion'' for the German [[audiophile]] record label Jeton. That year he also collaborated on the [[Soft Machine]] album ''[[Land of Cockayne (album)|Land of Cockayne]]'' (1981).\n\nIn 1981, Bruce collaborated with guitarist [[Robin Trower]] and released two [[power trio]] albums, ''[[B.L.T. (album)|B.L.T.]]'' and ''[[Truce (album)|Truce]]'', the first of which was a minor hit in the US.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> By 1983, Bruce was no longer contracted to a major record company and released his next solo album, ''[[Automatic (Jack Bruce album)|Automatic]]'', on a minor German label, Intercord. A European tour followed to promote the album enlisting [[Bruce Gary]] from [[the Knack]] (who had also played in Bruce's 1975 band) on drums and Sancious from his 1980 band (Jack Bruce & Friends) on guitar and keyboards. In 1982, Bruce played with a short-lived ensemble ''A Gathering of Minds'', composed of Billy Cobham, [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Didier Lockwood]] and David Sancious at [[Montreux Jazz Festival|Montreux]]. In 1983, Bruce sang on tracks 5 and 6 of the Allan Holdsworth album ''[[Road Games (EP)|Road Games]]''.\n\nIn 1983, Bruce began working with the [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]]/[[world music]] producer [[Kip Hanrahan]], and released the collaborative albums ''Desire Develops an Edge'', ''Vertical's Currency'', ''A Few Short Notes from the End Run'', ''Exotica'' and ''All Roads Are Made of the Flesh''. They were all critically successful, and in 2001 he went on to form his own band using Hanrahan's famous Cuban [[rhythm section]]. Other than his partnership with [[Lyrics|lyricist]] Pete Brown, Bruce's musical relationship with Hanrahan was the most consistent and long-lasting of his career.\n\nIn 1985, he sang lead and played [[blues harp]] on the song \"Silver Bullet\" with [[Anton Fier]]'s [[Golden Palominos]]. It appears on the album ''Visions of Excess''. In 1986 he re-recorded the Cream song \"I Feel Free\" and released it as a single to support an advertising campaign for the [[Renault 21]] motor car.\n\nIn 1989, Bruce secured his first major record deal in a decade, with [[Epic Records|Epic]], and recorded ''[[A Question of Time (album)|A Question of Time]]''. This included two tracks with [[Ginger Baker]] on drums, their first collaboration since Cream.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> Baker then joined Bruce's live band and toured the United States at the turn of the decade.\n\n===1990s===\nBruce played at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] in 1990, and was invited by the Irish [[blues rock]] performer, [[Rory Gallagher]] (who had a long-standing relationship with Bruce, having supported [[Cream (band)|Cream]]'s farewell concert in the band [[Taste (band)|Taste]] in 1968) to perform a couple of songs together on stage. In 1991 he was one of the supporting musicians for [[Vivian Stanshall]]'s solo show \"Rawlinson Dog-ends\", but quit over a lack of adequate rehearsals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vivarchive.org.uk/live.htm|title=Vivian's Live performances|accessdate=2015-07-25|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150808080911/http://www.vivarchive.org.uk/live.htm|archivedate=8 August 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1993, a solo album, ''[[Somethin Els]]'', reunited him with Eric Clapton and brought belated, but widespread, critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jackbruce.com/2008/Music/Albums/somethin_els.htm|title=Jack Bruce official website \u2013 Somethin Els (1993)|publisher=Jack Bruce Music|accessdate=15 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, Ginger Baker and a host of former Bruce band colleagues joined him for two special 50th birthdays concerts in Cologne, Germany, hosted by the TV show [[Rockpalast]]. Selections from these were released as the live double CD ''[[Cities of the Heart]]'', and much later as the DVD set ''Rockpalast: The 50th Birthdays Concerts''. One special guest was the Irish blues-rock guitarist [[Gary Moore]], who joined Bruce and Baker for a set of Cream classics. Inspired by this performance, the three formed the power trio [[Bruce-Baker-Moore|BBM]] and their subsequent (and only) album, ''Around the Next Dream'', was a top ten hit in the UK.<ref name=\"The Great Rock Discography\"/> However, the old arguments between Bruce and Baker arose again, and the subsequent tour was cut short and the band broke up. A low-key solo album, ''[[Monkjack]]'', followed in 1995, featuring Bruce on piano and vocals, accompanied only by the Funkadelic [[organ (music)|organist]] [[Bernie Worrell]].\n\nBruce then began work producing and arranging the soundtrack to the independently produced Scottish film ''[[The Slab Boys]]'', with; [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]], [[Edwyn Collins]], [[Eddi Reader]] and the [[the Proclaimers|Proclaimers]]. The soundtrack album appeared in 1997. In 1997 he returned to touring as a member of [[Ringo Starr]]'s [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band|All-Starr Band]], which also featured [[Peter Frampton]] on guitar. At the gig in Denver, Colorado, the band was joined onstage by Ginger Baker, and Bruce, Baker and Frampton played a short set of Cream classics. Bruce continued to tour with Starr through 2000.\n\n===2000s===\n[[File:JackBruce & fretless bass.jpg|thumb|right|Bruce playing a fretless [[Warwick Thumb SC|Warwick Thumb]] bass guitar at the Jazzfestival in [[Frankfurt]], Germany on 28 October 2006]]\nIn 2001, Bruce reappeared with a band featuring [[Bernie Worrell]], [[Vernon Reid]] of [[Living Colour]] on guitar and [[Kip Hanrahan]]'s three-piece Latin [[rhythm section]]. Hanrahan also produced the accompanying album ''[[Shadows in the Air]]'', which included a reunion with Eric Clapton on a new version of \"[[Sunshine of Your Love]]\". The band released another Hanrahan produced studio album, ''[[More Jack than God]]'', in 2003, and a live DVD, ''Live at the Canterbury Fayre''.\n\nBruce had suffered a period of declining health, after many years of addictions which he finally beat with clinical treatment, and in 2003 was diagnosed with [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/25/cream-bassist-jack-bruce-dies|title=Cream bassist, Jack Bruce, dies|work=The Guardian|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=25 October 2014}}</ref> In September 2003, he underwent a [[liver transplant]], which was almost fatal, as his body initially rejected the new organ.<ref>{{cite web|first=Andrew |last=Dansby |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/jack-bruce-on-the-mend-20031016 |title=Jack Bruce on the Mend |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=16 October 2003 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> He recovered, and in 2004 re-appeared to perform \"Sunshine of Your Love\" at a Rock Legends concert in Germany organised by the singer Mandoki.\n\nIn May 2005, he reunited with former Cream bandmates Clapton and Baker for a series of well-received concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4506185.stm |work=BBC News |title=Clapton returns for Cream dates |date=3 May 2005}}</ref> released as the album ''[[Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005]]'', and New York's [[Madison Square Garden]].\n\nIn between the UK and U.S. Cream dates, he also played live with [[Gary Moore]] and drummer [[Gary Husband]] at the [[Dick Heckstall-Smith]] tribute concert in London.\n\nSubsequent concert appearances by Bruce were sparse because of recovery after the transplant, but in 2006 he returned to the live arena with a show of Cream and solo classics performed with the German HR ([[Hessischer Rundfunk]]) Big Band. This was released on CD in Germany in 2007. In 2007, he made a brief concert appearance, opening a new rehearsal hall named in his honour at the [[Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama]], Glasgow with [[Clem Clempson]], keyboard player [[Ronnie Leahy]] and Husband.\n\nIn 2008, Bruce collaborated again with guitarist [[Robin Trower]] on the album ''Seven Moons''. It also featured Husband.\n\nIn May 2008, Bruce was 65 years old and to commemorate this milestone two box sets of recordings were released. ''Spirit'' is a three-CD collection of Bruce's BBC recordings from the 1970s. ''Can You Follow?'' is a six-CD retrospective anthology released by the Esoteric label in the UK. This anthology is a wide-ranging collection covering his music from 1963 to 2003 and, aside from his work with Kip Hanrahan, is a comprehensive overview of his career.\n\nImproved health led to Bruce playing a series of live outdoor concerts across the US starting in July 2008 as part of the Hippiefest Tour. He was supported by members of the late [[The Who|Who]] bassist [[John Entwistle]]'s the John Entwistle Band, and headlined at a tribute concert to the bassist.\n\nIn November 2008, he recorded a concert in [[Birmingham]], England for Radio Broadcast with the BBC Big Band, where he again played the Big Band arrangements of his classic songs. In December he was reunited with Ginger Baker at the drummer's Lifetime Achievement Award concert in London. They played jazz classics with saxophonist [[Courtney Pine]] and for the first time in 40 years played the Graham Bond\u2013Cream classic \"Traintime\".\n\nThe same month, Bruce, with guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], drummer [[Cindy Blackman]] and organist [[John Medeski]] played a series of [[Blue Note (jazz clubs)|Blue Note Club]] tribute concerts to [[the Tony Williams Lifetime]] in Japan. These shows were broadcast in high definition on television in Japan.\n\nIn 2009, Bruce performed in a series of concerts with Trower and Husband in Europe. Proposed dates in the U.S. in April were cancelled because of a further bout of ill health. Bruce recovered and the band played summer concerts in Italy, Norway and the UK during 2009. This promoted the release of the ''Seven Moons'' live CD and DVD, recorded in February during the European leg of the tour in [[Nijmegen]], Netherlands.\n\nDuring the Scottish dates of the 2009 tour Bruce was presented with an [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorate of Letters]] from [[Glasgow Caledonian University]] for services to the culture of [[Glasgow]] and music in general.\n\nIn August 2009, the 1983 Bruce solo album ''[[Automatic (Jack Bruce album)|Automatic]]'' was re-released, making his entire solo catalogue available on CD. In addition, all of the discs up to and including ''[[How's Tricks]]'' contain previously unreleased material.\n\nIn October 2009, Bruce performed at the 50th anniversary of [[Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club|Ronnie Scott's Club]] with the Ronnie Scott's Blues Band.\n\n===2010s===\n''Jack Bruce - Composing Himself: The Authorized Biography'' by [[Harry Shapiro (author)|Harry Shapiro]] was released by Jawbone Press in February 2010. Shapiro had previously written biographies of Bruce collaborators Alexis Korner, Graham Bond and Eric Clapton. The book followed memoirs from his Cream bandmates Clapton (''Clapton'', 2007) and Baker (''Hellraiser'', 2009). His songwriting partner, Pete Brown's, biography ''White Rooms & Imaginary Westerns'' was published in September 2010. They each have differing recollections of forming Cream, playing and writing together.\n\nOn 14 January, at the 2011 North American Music Merchants Show, Bruce became only the third recipient of the International Bassist Award, a lifetime achievement award for bassists, after [[Jaco Pastorius]] and [[Nathan Watts]].\n\nHis first independent CD release, ''Live at the Milky Way, Amsterdam 2001'', featuring The Cuicoland Express, his [[Latin American music|Latin-based]] band of the time, was issued in October 2010. The double album received an official worldwide release, distributed by EMI in February 2011. To support this release Bruce again played four dates in London at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club with the Ronnie Scott's Blues Experience, followed by a further ten dates across the UK with the band. On 4 June 2011, Bruce played a special concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London, which was celebrating its 60th anniversary. The evening celebrated the 50th anniversary of the [[British blues|blues in Great Britain]], and Bruce played with his Big Blues Band and special guest [[Joe Bonamassa]].\n\nBruce started 2012 playing the [[Gerry Rafferty]] tribute concert in Glasgow, followed by a date with the traditional Celtic band [[Lau (band)|Lau]]. [[BBC Scotland]] recorded a one-hour special on Bruce, which also included a performance with Lau. The completed documentary ''Jack Bruce \u2013 The Man behind the Bass'' was transmitted in February 2012 by BBC Scotland. It featured new interviews with Bruce, Clapton, Baker and Brown. It was transmitted again on 9 November 2014 on BBC2 Scotland and on 17 November 2014 on BBC4 in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01c6hw2|title=BBC Two - ArtWorks Scotland, Jack Bruce: The Man Behind the Bass|website=BBC}}</ref>\n\nFebruary 2012 saw Bruce playing in [[Havana]], Cuba, along with guitarist [[Phil Manzanera]], supporting the mambo band of Augusto Enriquez. March saw another residency at Ronnie Scott's in London supported by his Big Blues Band, followed by a UK tour. The concert at the Stables, Milton Keynes on 18 March was due to be recorded as an Instant Live CD release, but technical issues prevented this. The following evenings' performance at the same location was recorded and a 2CD version issued by Instant Live.\n\n''Spectrum Road'', a collaboration with [[Vernon Reid]], [[Cindy Blackman]] and [[John Medeski]] in tribute to [[The Tony Williams Lifetime]], was released in June 2012 by the US jazz record label [[Palmetto Records]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Jurek |first=Thom |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/spectrum-road-mw0002330321 |title=Spectrum Road \u2013 Spectrum Road : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=AllMusic |date=4 June 2012 |accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref> and was accompanied by a series of dates at large jazz festivals in North America and Europe throughout June and July.\n\nIn March 2014, Bruce released ''[[Silver Rails]]'' on the [[Esoteric Records|Esoteric Antenna]] label, his first solo studio album in over a decade.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://jackbruce.com/2008/NewsArchive/esoteric_release.htm|title=Jack Bruce to Release New Studio Album on Esoteric Antenna|accessdate=25 September 2013 |publisher=Esoteric Antenna}}</ref> ''Silver Rails'' was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, produced and mixed by Rob Cass and features contributions from Cream lyricist, [[Pete Brown]], [[Kip Hanrahan]] and wife Margrit Seyffer as well as musicians [[Robin Trower]], [[Cindy Blackman]], [[Phil Manzanera]], [[Uli Jon Roth]], [[John Medeski]] and [[Bernie Marsden]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbassplayersonly.com/feature-jack-bruce-still-going-strong-at-71/|title=Feature-Jack Bruce: Still going strong at 71|work=For Bass Players Only|date=2014-09-10}}</ref> The deluxe version of the album featured a behind the scenes documentary \"The Making of Silver Rails\" which was filmed on location at the studios and directed by Bruce's daughter Kyla Simone Bruce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://planetmosh.com/jack-bruce-interview-on-you-tube/|title=Jack Bruce interview on You Tube|work=PlanetMosh|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019130318/http://planetmosh.com/jack-bruce-interview-on-you-tube/|archivedate=19 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Bruce's son Malcolm Bruce pre-produced the album and played guitar on several tracks, while Bruce's daughter [[Aruba Red]] was featured on \"Hidden Cities\" singing backing vocals.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1964 Bruce married [[Janet Godfrey]], who had been the secretary of the Graham Bond Organisation fan club and had collaborated with Bruce on two songs written for the group.<ref name=Welch/> The couple had two sons together, Jonas (Jo) Bruce, who grew up to play keyboards in his father's band and played with [[Afro Celt Sound System]], and Malcolm Bruce, who grew up to play the guitar with his father and played with Ginger Baker's son, Kofi.

The field of players is smaller than those of the other major championships because it is an invitational event, held by the Augusta National Golf Club.\n\nThe tournament has a number of traditions. Since [[1949 Masters Tournament|1949]], a green jacket has been awarded to the champion, who must return it to the clubhouse one year after his victory, although it remains his personal property and is stored with other champions' jackets in a specially designated cloakroom. In most instances, only a first-time and currently reigning champion may remove his jacket from the club grounds. A golfer who wins the event multiple times uses the same green jacket awarded upon his initial win (unless he needs to be re-fitted with a new jacket).<ref>{{cite web |first=Brent |last=Kelley |title=Do Masters Champions Get to Keep the Green Jacket? |url=http://golf.about.com/od/majorchampionships/f/keep_jacket.htm |publisher=About.com}}</ref> The Champions Dinner, inaugurated by [[Ben Hogan]] in [[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], is held on the Tuesday before each tournament, and is open only to past champions and certain board members of the Augusta National Golf Club. Beginning in [[1963 Masters Tournament|1963]], legendary golfers, usually past champions, have hit an honorary tee shot on the morning of the first round to commence play. These have included [[Fred McLeod]], [[Jock Hutchinson]], [[Gene Sarazen]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Byron Nelson]], [[Arnold Palmer]], [[Jack Nicklaus]], and [[Gary Player]]. Since [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]], a [[Masters Tournament Par-3 contest|semi-social contest]] at the par-3 course has been played on Wednesday, the day before the first round.\n\nNicklaus has the most Masters wins, with six between 1963 and 1986. [[Tiger Woods]] has won five. Palmer has won four. Five have won three titles at Augusta: [[Jimmy Demaret]], [[Sam Snead]], [[Gary Player]], [[Nick Faldo]], and [[Phil Mickelson]]. Player, from [[South Africa]], was the first non-American player to win the tournament, in [[1961 Masters Tournament|1961]]; the second was [[Seve Ballesteros]] of [[Spain]], the champion in [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]] and [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]].\n\nThe Augusta National course first opened {{Years or months ago|1933}} in 1933 and has been modified many times by different architects. Among the changes: greens have been reshaped and, on occasion, entirely re-designed, bunkers have been added, water hazards have been extended, new tee boxes have been built, hundreds of trees have been planted, and several mounds have been installed.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\">{{cite book |title=The Making of the Masters: Clifford Roberts, Augusta National, and Golf's Most Prestigious Tournament |first=David |last=Owen |publisher=Simon & Schuster |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-684-85729-9}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:AugustaNationalMastersLogoFlowers.jpg|thumb|<center>Masters logo<br>at the club entrance</center>]]\n\n===Augusta National Golf Club===\n{{main|Augusta National Golf Club}}\nThe idea for Augusta National originated with [[Bobby Jones (golfer)|Bobby Jones]], who wanted to build a golf course after his retirement from the game.

The green sport coat is the official attire worn by members of Augusta National while on the club grounds; each Masters winner becomes an honorary member of the club. The recipient of the green jacket has it presented to him inside the Butler Cabin soon after the end of the tournament in a televised ceremony, and the presentation is then repeated outside near the 18th green in front of the patrons. Winners keep their jacket for the year after their victory, then return it to the club to wear whenever they are present on the club grounds. [[Sam Snead]] was the first Masters champion to be awarded the green jacket after he took his first Masters title in 1949.\n\nThe green jacket is only allowed to be removed from the Augusta National grounds by the reigning champion, after which it must remain at the club. Exceptions to this rule include Gary Player, who in his joy of winning mistakenly took his jacket home to South Africa after his 1961 victory (although he has always followed the spirit of the rule and has never worn the jacket);<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=lukas/070405 |title=The real story behind the green jacket |last=Lukas |first=Paul |work=ESPN |accessdate=November 18, 2008}}</ref> [[Seve Ballesteros]] who, in an interview with [[Peter Alliss]] from his home in Pedre\u00f1a, showed one of his two green jackets in his trophy room; and [[Henry Picard]], whose jacket was removed from the club before the tradition was well established, remained in his closet for a number of years, and is now on display at Canterbury Golf Club in [[Beachwood, Ohio]], where he was the club professional for many years.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1995/04/10/8093250/master-teacher-nearly-forgotten-now-teaching-pro-henry-picard-was-a-big-star-when-he-won-the-1938-masters |title=Master Teacher: Nearly forgotten now, teaching pro Henry Picard was a big star when he won the 1938 Masters |first=Rick |last=Lispey |magazine=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |date=April 10, 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |title=Michael Kernicki hosts Major Championship at Canterbury Golf Club |publisher=GolfGuide.com |accessdate=April 10, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111083303/http://www.ohiogolfandtravelguide.com/ohio/golf-news/michael-kernicki-hosts-major-championship-at-canterbury-golf-club.html |archivedate=November 11, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nBy tradition, the winner of the previous year's Masters Tournament puts the jacket on the current winner at the end of the tournament.

For each [[Eagle (golf)|eagle]] a player makes he receives a pair of crystal goblets.\n\nIn addition to the green jacket, winners of the tournament receive a gold medal.

Although concerns were raised that the event would conflict with the [[LPGA Tour]]'s [[ANA Inspiration]] (which has invited top amateur players to compete), Ridley stated that he had discussed the event with commissioner [[Mike Whan]], and stated that he agreed on the notion that any move to bolster the prominence of women's golf would be a \"win\" for the LPGA over time.

The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984.

Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff. Play begins on the 18th hole, followed by the adjacent 10th, repeating until one player remains.

Earlier playoffs were 18 holes on the following day, except for the first in [[1935 Masters Tournament|1935]], which was 36 holes; the last 18-hole playoff was in [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]], and none of the full-round playoffs went to additional holes.\n\n==Course==\nThe golf course was formerly a [[plant nursery]] and each hole is named after the tree or shrub with which it has become associated.<ref name=nursbeaut/><br>\nThe course layout in [[2019 Masters Tournament|2019]]:\n{|class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par!! !!Hole!!Name!!Yards!!Par\n|-\n|1||align=left|[[Tea Olive]]||445||4||rowspan=10| ||10||align=left|[[Camellia]]||495||4\n|-\n|2||align=left|[[Flowering dogwood|Pink Dogwood]]||575||5||11||align=left|[[White Dogwood]]||505||4\n|-\n|3||align=left|[[Peach|Flowering Peach]]||350||4||12||align=left|[[Forsythia|Golden Bell]]||155||3\n|-\n|4||align=left|[[Malus|Flowering Crab Apple]]||240||3||13||align=left|[[Azalea]]||510||5\n|-\n|5||align=left|[[Southern magnolia|Magnolia]]||495||4||14||align=left|[[Cunninghamia|Chinese Fir]]||440||4\n|-\n|6||align=left|[[Eastern Juniper|Juniper]]||180||3||15||align=left|[[Pyracantha|Firethorn]]||530||5\n|-\n|7||align=left|[[Cortaderia selloana|Pampas]]||450||4||16||align=left|[[Eastern Redbud|Redbud]]||170||3\n|-\n|8||align=left|[[Yellow Jessamine|Yellow Jasmine]]||570||5||17||align=left|[[Nandina]]||440||4\n|-\n|9||align=left|[[Prunus caroliniana|Carolina Cherry]]||460||4||18||align=left|[[American holly|Holly]]||465||4\n|-\n| colspan=2|'''Out'''||'''3,765'''||'''36'''|| colspan=2|'''In'''||'''3,710'''||'''36'''\n|-\n| colspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|<small>Source:</small><ref name=itcpgat11/><ref name=2012cstour>{{cite web|url=http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |publisher=PGA of America: Major Championships |title=Course Tour: 2012 Masters |accessdate=August 24, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827230002/http://www.majorschampionships.com/masters/2012/course/tour/index.cfm |archivedate=August 27, 2012 }}</ref>||colspan=2|'''Total'''||'''7,475'''||'''72'''\n|}\n\nLengths of the course for the Masters at the start of each decade:\n{|\n|\n* [[2010 Masters Tournament|2010]]: {{convert|7435|yd}}\n* [[2000 Masters Tournament|2000]]: {{convert|6985|yd}}\n* [[1990 Masters Tournament|1990]]: {{convert|6905|yd}}\n* [[1980 Masters Tournament|1980]]: {{convert|7040|yd|0}}\n|\n* [[1970 Masters Tournament|1970]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1960 Masters Tournament|1960]]: {{convert|6980|yd|0}}\n* [[1950 Masters Tournament|1950]]: {{convert|6900|yd|0}}\n* [[1940 Masters Tournament|1940]]: {{convert|6800|yd|0}}<ref name=itcpgat11/>\n|}\nThe course was lengthened to {{convert|7445|yd}} in [[2006 Masters Tournament|2006]].

Masters champions are automatically invited to play in the other three majors (the [[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]], [[The Open Championship]], and the [[PGA Championship]]) for the next five years (except for amateur winners, unless they turn pro within the five-year period), and earn a lifetime invitation to the Masters.

It invites winners of the most prestigious amateur tournaments in the world. Also, the current [[U.S. Amateur]] champion always plays in the same group as the defending Masters champion for the first two days of the tournament.\n\nAmateurs in the field are welcome to stay in the \"Crow's Nest\" atop the Augusta National clubhouse during the tournament. The Crow's Nest is {{convert|1200|sqft|-1}} with lodging space for five during the competition.\n\n===Opening tee shot===\nSince 1963, the custom in most years has been to start the tournament with an honorary opening tee shot at the first hole, typically by one or more legendary players. The original honorary starters were [[Jock Hutchison]] and [[Fred McLeod]]; this twosome led off every tournament from 1963 until 1973, when poor health prevented Hutchison from swinging a club. McLeod continued on until his death in 1976. Byron Nelson and Gene Sarazen started in 1981, and were then joined by Sam Snead in 1984. This trio continued until 1999 when Sarazen died, while Nelson stopped in 2001. Snead hit his final opening tee shot in 2002, a little over a month before he died.\n\nIn 2007, Arnold Palmer took over as the honorary starter.

Officially known as the \"Masters Club\", it includes only past winners of the Masters, although selected members of the Augusta National Golf Club have been included as honorary members, usually the chairman.\n\nThe defending champion, as host, selects the menu for the dinner. Frequently, Masters champions have served cuisine from their home regions prepared by the Masters chef. Notable examples have included [[haggis]], served by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[Sandy Lyle]] in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html#dinner |title=Masters Club |publisher=www.masters.org |accessdate=January 25, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109192302/http://www.masters.org/en_US/course/landmarks.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and [[bobotie]], a South African dish, served at the behest of 2008 champion [[Trevor Immelman]]. Other examples include German Bernhard Langer's 1986 Wiener schnitzel, Britain's Nick Faldo's fish and chips, Canadian Mike Weir's elk and wild boar, and Vijay Singh's seafood tom kah and chicken panang curry. In 1997, 1979 champion [[Fuzzy Zoeller]] created a media storm when he suggested that Tiger Woods refrain from serving collard greens and fried chicken, dishes commonly associated with Afro-American culture, at the dinner. The 2011 dinner of [[Phil Mickelson]] was a Spanish-themed menu in hopes that [[Seve Ballesteros]] would attend, but he was too sick to attend and died  weeks later.<ref>[http://www.golf.com/tour-news/2017/03/15/masters-champions-dinner-everything-you-need-know Masters Champions Dinner: Everything you need to know]</ref>\n\n===Caddies===\nUntil [[1983 Masters Tournament|1983]], all players in the Masters were required to use the services of an Augusta National Club [[caddie]],<ref name=trcdatag>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WFcaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=yiQEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6177%2C1789683 |newspaper=Times-News |location=Hendersonville, North Carolina |title=Tour caddies at Augusta? |date=November 12, 1982 |page=14}}</ref><ref name=alctrbgd>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3LUSAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mvkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6774%2C1068214 |newspaper=Spokane Chronicle |location=Washington |last=Wade |first=Harless |title=Tradition bagged at Masters |date=April 6, 1983 |page=C1}}</ref><ref name=mcadcol>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xMksAAAAIBAJ&sjid=chMEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6823%2C3348928 |newspaper=Sunday Star-News |location=Wilmington, North Carolina |last=Anderson |first=Dave |authorlink=Dave Anderson (sportswriter) |title=New Masters caddies collide |date=April 10, 1983 |page=6D}}</ref> who by club tradition was always an African American man.<ref name=\"nyt1990\"/> Indeed, club co-founder Clifford Roberts is reputed to have said, \"As long as I'm alive, golfers will be white, and caddies will be black.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Rick |last=Reilly |authorlink=Rick Reilly |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1997/04/21/225867/strokes-of-genius-overpowering-a-storied-course-and-a-stellar-field-tiger-woods-heralded-a-new-era-in-golf-with-an-awesome-12-shot-victory-in-the-masters |title=Strokes of Genius |date=April 21, 1997 |accessdate=February 9, 2016 |magazine=Sports Illustrated}}</ref> Since 1983\u2014six years after Roberts's death in 1977\u2014players have been allowed the option of bringing their own caddie to the tournament.\n\nThe Masters requires caddies to wear a uniform consisting of a white jumpsuit, a green Masters cap, and white tennis shoes.

Since [[1948 Masters Tournament|1948]], its final round has been scheduled for the second Sunday of April, with several exceptions. It ended on the first Sunday four times ([[1952 Masters Tournament|1952]], [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], [[1958 Masters Tournament|1958]], [[1959 Masters Tournament|1959]]) and the [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]] and [[1984 Masters Tournament|1984]] tournaments ended on April 15, the month's third Sunday.<ref name=\"Hist\"/> The first edition in [[1934 Masters Tournament|1934]] was held in late March and the next ten were in early April, with only the [[1942 Masters Tournament|1942]] event scheduled to end on the second Sunday.  The [[2020 Masters Tournament|2020]] event, postponed by the [[COVID-19]] pandemic, is slated to be held in the autumn, with it being the last major of the year.\n\nSimilar to the other majors, the tournament consists of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in groups of three for the first two rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time, such as the second round in 1983, fourth round in 2019, and is expected for all four rounds in 2020. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.<ref name=\"Owen 1999\" />\n\nOriginally, the Masters was the only tournament to use two-man pairings during the first two rounds. It was also the only event to re-pair based on the leaderboard before Friday's round, as most tournaments only do this on the weekend. This practice ended in the early 2000s, when the Masters switched to the more standard three-man groups and the groups are now kept intact on Friday, with players sharing the same playing partners in both of the first two rounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nAfter 36 holes of play, a cut-off score is calculated to reduce the size of the field for the weekend rounds. To \"make the cut\", players must be either in the top 50 places (ties counting), or within 10 strokes of the leader's score. These criteria have applied since [[2013 Masters Tournament|2013]].<ref name=cut>{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/golf/masters13/story/_/id/9156060/fall-tour-event-winners-get-masters-spot |title=Masters tweaks qualifications |first=Bob |last=Harig |work=ESPN |date=April 10, 2013 |access-date=April 16, 2013}}</ref> From 1957 to 1960, the top 40 scores (including ties) and those within 10 strokes of the leader made the cut. From 1961 to 2012, it was the top 44 (and ties) or within 10 strokes of the lead.<ref name=cut/> Before [[1957 Masters Tournament|1957]], there was no 36-hole cut and all of the invitees played four rounds, if desired.<ref name=\"Cut\">{{cite web |url=http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |title=Cut Information |publisher=www.masters.org |access-date=January 21, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119025225/http://www.masters.org/en_US/history/records/cutinfo.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cut, an additional 36 holes are played over the final two days. Should the fourth round fail to produce a winner, all players tied for the lead enter a [[Sudden death (sport)#Golf|sudden-death]] playoff.

In religious schools the role of the chaplain tends to be educational and liturgical. In secular schools the role of the chaplain tends to be that of a mentor and a provider of pastoral care services. Chaplains provide care for students by supporting them during times of crisis or need. Many chaplains run programs to promote the welfare of students, staff and parents including programs to help students deal with grief, anger or depression. Chaplains also build relationships with students by participating in extracurricular activities such as breakfast programs, lunchtime groups and sports groups.

Each day communities respond to numerous disasters or emergencies. Most often, these incidents are managed effectively at the local level. However, there are some incidents that may require a collaborative approach that includes personnel from: 1. Multiple jurisdictions, 2. A combination of specialties or disciplines, 3. Several levels of government, 4. Non-governmental organizations, and 5. The private sector. Chaplain Fellowship Disaster Response certifies first responder chaplain for crisis and disaster response.\n\n===Industrial chaplains===\n\n====Law enforcement and police====\nLaw enforcement or police chaplains work with and as part of local, regional, county, state, and national or federal law enforcement and provide a variety of services within the law enforcement community. They should not be confused with prison chaplains, whose primary ministry is to those who are incarcerated either awaiting trial or after conviction. The role of the law enforcement chaplain deals primarily with law enforcement personnel and agencies. The chaplain responds to these unique needs and challenges with religious guidance, reassuring and trustworthy presence, resources and counseling services. The law enforcement chaplain offers support to law enforcement officers, administrators, support staff, victims and their families, and occasionally even the families of accused or convicted offenders. Law enforcement chaplaincy is a ministry of presence and must have the proper training if they are working with law enforcement officers. Some ministries such as Chaplain Fellowship Ministries requires LEO chaplains to be certified in Public Safety Chaplaincy before becoming certified as a LEO chaplain. Most chaplains are uniformed and some may have a rank. They will always wear distinguishing insignia or markings to denote their chaplain rather than lawman status.\n\n====Fire departments====\nChaplains working with fire departments provide the same kind of support as do chaplains working with law enforcement agencies, and sometimes face even greater danger working with the wounded in often very dangerous surroundings.\n\nAt the scene of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], for example, [[New York City Fire Department]] chaplain Fr. [[Mychal Judge]] was killed by flying debris from the [[List of tenants in Two World Trade Center|South Tower]] when he re-entered the lobby of the [[List of tenants in One World Trade Center|North Tower]] of the World Trade Center, shortly after administering last rites to a wounded firefighter.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/27/nyregion/killed-on-9-11-fire-chaplain-becomes-larger-than-life.html?pagewanted=1|title=Killed on 9/11, Fire Chaplain Becomes Larger Than Life|date=September 27, 2002|newspaper=The New York Times|last1=Wakin|first1=Daniel J.}}</ref>\n\n====Labor====\n\nMany workplace chaplains (commonly called industrial chaplains) are sponsored by labor unions, including in some cases chaplains for police and firefighters. The [[United Auto Workers]] Union (UAW) sponsors a chaplaincy program for all of its local unions.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://uaw.org/pro-member-the-uaw-chaplaincy-program/ | title=PRO-Member: The UAW Chaplaincy Program| date=2015-05-15}}</ref> In New York City, the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|Electricians Union]] (IBEW Local 3) has affiliated [[Catholic]], [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]], [[Greek Orthodox]] and [[Masonic]] organizations with chaplains.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://local3ibew.org/club-directory | title=Club Directory}}</ref>\n\nUnion chaplains are often viewed as advantageous as they are accountable to the employees and not corporate management.\n\n====Corporate====\nSome businesses, large or small, employ chaplains for their staff or clientele.

Military chaplains have a long history; the first [[England|English]] military-oriented chaplains, for instance, were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the 8th century.  Land-based chaplains appeared during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the [[World War I|First World War]].\n\nChaplains are nominated, appointed, or commissioned in different ways in different countries. A military chaplain can be an army-trained soldier with additional [[theology|theological]] training or an ordained person nominated to the army by religious authorities. In the United Kingdom the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] employs chaplains but their authority comes from their sending church. Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week [[bespoke]] induction and training course including a short course at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain.  Naval chaplains called to service with the [[Royal Marines]] undertake a grueling five-month-long Commando Course and, if successful, wear the commandos' [[Green beret|Green Beret]].  British Army chaplains undertake seven weeks training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].  [[Royal Air Force]] chaplains must complete a 12-week Specialist Entrant course at the [[Royal Air Force College Cranwell|RAF College Cranwell]] followed by the Chaplains' Induction Course at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre Amport House of a further two weeks. The United States Navy will often give chaplain training to cadets seeking a theological route in the military.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chaplain Training|url=http://www.navy.com/dms/navy/downloads/pdf/officer/Chaplain-Candidate-Program-Brochure.pdf|access-date=January 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124181956/http://www.navy.com/dms/navy/downloads/pdf/officer/Chaplain-Candidate-Program-Brochure.pdf#|archive-date=January 24, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Additionally, they are granted instant employment as a Navy chaplain once ordained.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chaplain Jobs|url=http://www.navy.com/jobs/chaplain.html}}</ref> Additionally, in the United States military, chaplains must be endorsed by their religious affiliation in order to serve in any facet of the military.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goarmy.com/chaplain/requirements.jsp|title=Requirements|website=goarmy.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usafhc.af.mil/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113224027/http://www.usafhc.af.mil/ |archivedate=November 13, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In some cases, like that of the U.S. Navy, a Religious Program Specialist may be appointed to help alleviate some of the duties bestowed upon Naval chaplains.<ref>{{cite web|title=Religious Program Specialist|url=http://www.navy.com/careers/chaplain-support/religious-program-specialist.html}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Unifil catholic mass.jpg|thumb|[[French Army|French soldiers]] of the [[United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon|UNIFIL]] attending a Catholic Mass in [[Lebanon]]]]\n[[File:Resnicoff BeirutKippa.jpg|thumb|Jewish chaplain Rabbi [[Arnold Resnicoff]] wears a [[kippah]]/yarmulke made from a piece of a Catholic chaplain's [[Battledress|camouflage uniform]] after his own head covering had become bloodied when it was used to wipe the face of a wounded marine during the 1983 [[Beirut barracks bombing]].]]\n\nMilitary chaplains are normally accorded officer status, although [[Sierra Leone]] had a Naval Lance Corporal chaplain in 2001. In most navies, their badges and insignia do not differentiate their levels of responsibility and status. By contrast, in air forces and armies, they typically carry ranks and are differentiated by crosses or other equivalent religious insignia. However, United States military chaplains in every branch carry both rank and Chaplain Corps insignia.\n\nThough the [[Geneva Conventions]] does not state whether chaplains may bear arms, they specify (Protocol I, June 8, 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are [[non-combatants]]. In recent times both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed.  Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, make it an issue of individual conscience.  Captured chaplains are not considered Prisoners of War (Third Convention, August 12, 1949, Chapter IV Art 33) and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.\n[[File:Military chaplain.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy chaplain in [[Iraq]] studies his [[Bible]] for an upcoming service.]]\n\nInevitably, a significant number of serving chaplains have died in action. 100 chaplains of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] were [[killed in action]] during World War II: a casualty rate greater \"than any other branch of the services except the infantry and the Army Air Corps\" (Crosby, 1994, pxxiii). Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have won Britain's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]]). The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]] is a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|U.S. military decoration]] given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous [[Four Chaplains]], all of whom died in the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others. In addition to these, five other U.S. chaplains have been awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]: Chaplain ([[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|LCDR]]) [[Joseph T. O'Callahan]], [[United States Navy|USN]] ([[World War II]]); Chaplain ([[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]]) [[Emil Kapaun]], USA (Posthumous, [[Korean War]]); Chaplain ([[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]]) [[Vincent Capodanno]], USN (Posthumous, [[Vietnam War]]); Chaplain ([[Major (United States)|MAJ]]) [[Charles J. Watters]], [[United States Army|USA]] (Posthumous, Vietnam War); and Chaplain ([[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]]) [[Angelo J. Liteky]], USA (Vietnam).  (Later in life, Liteky changed his name to Charles, left the Catholic priesthood, became an anti-war activist, and renounced his Medal of Honor). Chaplain Fellowship Ministries military chaplains are nondenominational. To be considered for appointment to serve as a military chaplain, candidates must first be ordained and have an ecclesiastical endorsement by a valid religious faith group recognized by the Department of Defense. Candidates must meet all DOD requirements. The Chaplain Fellowship had military chaplains serving in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016035152/http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[United States European Command]] has co-sponsored an annual [[International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference]] every year since 1991 to consider the various issues affecting chaplaincy ministry and other military personnel.

Environmental chaplains may also bear witness to the Earth itself and represent the merging of science and spirituality.

The chaplain was freed from any obligation to reside in a particular place so could travel with the family, internationally if necessary, and minister to their spiritual needs. Further, the family could appoint a chaplain who reflected their own doctrinal views. Domestic chaplains performed family christenings, funerals and weddings and were able to conduct services in the family's private chapel, excusing the nobility from attending public worship.<ref name=\"gibson\">Gibson (1997) ''pp''1\u20136</ref>\n\nIn feudal times most laymen, and for centuries even most noblemen, were poorly educated and the chaplain would also be an important source of [[scholarship]] in the household, tutoring children and providing counsel to the family on matters broader than religion.<ref name=\"gibson\"/> Before the advent of the [[lawyer|legal profession]], modern [[bureaucracy]] and [[civil service]], the literate clergy were often employed as [[secretary|secretarial]] staff, as in a [[chancellor|chancery]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Hence the term ''clerk'', derived from Latin ''clericus'' (clergyman).{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} This made them very influential in temporal affairs. There was also a moral impact since they heard the confessions of the elite.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nThe domestic chaplain was an important part of the life of the [[peerage]] in [[England]] from the reign of [[Henry VIII]] to the middle of the 19th century. Up until 1840, [[Anglican]] domestic chaplains were regulated by [[law]] and enjoyed the substantial financial advantage of being able to purchase a [[license]] to hold two [[benefice]]s simultaneously while residing in neither.<ref name=\"gibson\"/>\n\nMany monarchies and major [[nobility|noble]] houses had, or still have, several domestic or private chaplains as part of their [[Ecclesiastical Household]], either following them or attached to a castle or other residence. Queen Elizabeth II has 36 Anglican chaplains, in addition to chaplains extraordinary and honorary chaplains appointed to minister to her. Castles with attached chaplains generally had at least one [[Chapel Royal]], sometimes as significant as a [[cathedral]]. A modern example is [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], also the home of the [[Order of the Garter]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Chaplain Office York Railway Station.JPG|thumb|Chaplain's Office, [[York railway station]]]]\n\nThere are also chaplains to private clubs, television or radio stations, family, community teams, groups such as [[Boys' Brigade|Boys']] and [[Girls' Brigade]] companies and [[Scouting|Scout]] troops, airports, cruise ships, nightclubs, and theaters.\n\nThe term can also refer to priests attached to [[Catholic]] [[convent]]s. There is also the position of [[Chaplain of His Holiness]], a title granted by the Pope to certain priests who become part of the Papal Household and work with the Papal Chapel. Prior to 1968 they were called Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains.\n\n{{anchor|examining chaplain}}In the [[Church of England]] and other Anglican churches, a Bishop's \"examining chaplain(s)\" are those (usually priests) who examine candidates for ordination and advise the bishop as to their suitability.

In religious schools the role of the chaplain tends to be educational and liturgical. In secular schools the role of the chaplain tends to be that of a mentor and a provider of pastoral care services. Chaplains provide care for students by supporting them during times of crisis or need. Many chaplains run programs to promote the welfare of students, staff and parents including programs to help students deal with grief, anger or depression. Chaplains also build relationships with students by participating in extracurricular activities such as breakfast programs, lunchtime groups and sports groups.

Each day communities respond to numerous disasters or emergencies. Most often, these incidents are managed effectively at the local level. However, there are some incidents that may require a collaborative approach that includes personnel from: 1. Multiple jurisdictions, 2. A combination of specialties or disciplines, 3. Several levels of government, 4. Non-governmental organizations, and 5. The private sector. Chaplain Fellowship Disaster Response certifies first responder chaplain for crisis and disaster response.\n\n===Industrial chaplains===\n\n====Law enforcement and police====\nLaw enforcement or police chaplains work with and as part of local, regional, county, state, and national or federal law enforcement and provide a variety of services within the law enforcement community. They should not be confused with prison chaplains, whose primary ministry is to those who are incarcerated either awaiting trial or after conviction. The role of the law enforcement chaplain deals primarily with law enforcement personnel and agencies. The chaplain responds to these unique needs and challenges with religious guidance, reassuring and trustworthy presence, resources and counseling services. The law enforcement chaplain offers support to law enforcement officers, administrators, support staff, victims and their families, and occasionally even the families of accused or convicted offenders. Law enforcement chaplaincy is a ministry of presence and must have the proper training if they are working with law enforcement officers. Some ministries such as Chaplain Fellowship Ministries requires LEO chaplains to be certified in Public Safety Chaplaincy before becoming certified as a LEO chaplain. Most chaplains are uniformed and some may have a rank. They will always wear distinguishing insignia or markings to denote their chaplain rather than lawman status.\n\n====Fire departments====\nChaplains working with fire departments provide the same kind of support as do chaplains working with law enforcement agencies, and sometimes face even greater danger working with the wounded in often very dangerous surroundings.\n\nAt the scene of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center (1973-2001)|World Trade Center]] in [[New York City]], for example, [[New York City Fire Department]] chaplain Fr.

Military chaplains have a long history; the first [[England|English]] military-oriented chaplains, for instance, were priests on board proto-naval vessels during the 8th century.  Land-based chaplains appeared during the reign of [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]]. The current form of military chaplain dates from the era of the [[World War I|First World War]].\n\nChaplains are nominated, appointed, or commissioned in different ways in different countries. A military chaplain can be an army-trained soldier with additional [[theology|theological]] training or an ordained person nominated to the army by religious authorities. In the United Kingdom the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] employs chaplains but their authority comes from their sending church. Royal Navy chaplains undertake a 16-week [[bespoke]] induction and training course including a short course at [[Britannia Royal Naval College]] and specialist fleet time at sea alongside a more experienced chaplain.  Naval chaplains called to service with the [[Royal Marines]] undertake a grueling five-month-long Commando Course and, if successful, wear the commandos' [[Green beret|Green Beret]].  British Army chaplains undertake seven weeks training at the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre [[Amport House]] and the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].

In most navies, their badges and insignia do not differentiate their levels of responsibility and status. By contrast, in air forces and armies, they typically carry ranks and are differentiated by crosses or other equivalent religious insignia. However, United States military chaplains in every branch carry both rank and Chaplain Corps insignia.\n\nThough the [[Geneva Conventions]] does not state whether chaplains may bear arms, they specify (Protocol I, June 8, 1977, Art 43.2) that chaplains are [[non-combatants]]. In recent times both the UK and US have required chaplains, but not medical personnel, to be unarmed.  Other nations, notably Norway, Denmark and Sweden, make it an issue of individual conscience.  Captured chaplains are not considered Prisoners of War (Third Convention, August 12, 1949, Chapter IV Art 33) and must be returned to their home nation unless retained to minister to prisoners of war.\n[[File:Military chaplain.jpg|left|thumb|A U.S. Navy chaplain in [[Iraq]] studies his [[Bible]] for an upcoming service.]]\n\nInevitably, a significant number of serving chaplains have died in action. 100 chaplains of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] were [[killed in action]] during World War II: a casualty rate greater \"than any other branch of the services except the infantry and the Army Air Corps\" (Crosby, 1994, pxxiii). Many have been decorated for bravery in action (five have won Britain's highest award for gallantry, the [[Victoria Cross]]). The [[Chaplain's Medal for Heroism]] is a special [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|U.S. military decoration]] given to military chaplains who have been killed in the line of duty, although it has to date only been awarded to the famous [[Four Chaplains]], all of whom died in the {{SS|Dorchester||2}} sinking in 1943 after giving up their lifejackets to others. In addition to these, five other U.S. chaplains have been awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]: Chaplain ([[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|LCDR]]) [[Joseph T. O'Callahan]], [[United States Navy|USN]] ([[World War II]]); Chaplain ([[Captain (United States O-3)|CPT]]) [[Emil Kapaun]], USA (Posthumous, [[Korean War]]); Chaplain ([[Lieutenant (navy)|LT]]) [[Vincent Capodanno]], USN (Posthumous, [[Vietnam War]]); Chaplain ([[Major (United States)|MAJ]]) [[Charles J.

(Later in life, Liteky changed his name to Charles, left the Catholic priesthood, became an anti-war activist, and renounced his Medal of Honor). Chaplain Fellowship Ministries military chaplains are nondenominational. To be considered for appointment to serve as a military chaplain, candidates must first be ordained and have an ecclesiastical endorsement by a valid religious faith group recognized by the Department of Defense. Candidates must meet all DOD requirements. The Chaplain Fellowship had military chaplains serving in Iraq and now in Afghanistan.\n\nIn 2006, training materials obtained by U.S. intelligence showed that insurgent snipers fighting in Iraq were urged to single out and attack engineers, medics, and chaplains on the theory that those casualties would demoralize entire enemy units.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |title=Iraqi Insurgent Snipers Target U.S. Medics, Engineers and Chaplains |publisher=Pensito Review |date=25 October 2006 |accessdate=21 March 2008 |first=Jon |last=Ponder |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016035152/http://www.pensitoreview.com/2006/10/25/iraqi-insurgent-snipers-target-us-medics-engineers-and-chaplains/ |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[United States European Command]] has co-sponsored an annual [[International Military Chiefs of Chaplains Conference]] every year since 1991 to consider the various issues affecting chaplaincy ministry and other military personnel.

Environmental chaplains may also bear witness to the Earth itself and represent the merging of science and spirituality.

Up until 1840, [[Anglican]] domestic chaplains were regulated by [[law]] and enjoyed the substantial financial advantage of being able to purchase a [[license]] to hold two [[benefice]]s simultaneously while residing in neither.<ref name=\"gibson\"/>\n\nMany monarchies and major [[nobility|noble]] houses had, or still have, several domestic or private chaplains as part of their [[Ecclesiastical Household]], either following them or attached to a castle or other residence. Queen Elizabeth II has 36 Anglican chaplains, in addition to chaplains extraordinary and honorary chaplains appointed to minister to her. Castles with attached chaplains generally had at least one [[Chapel Royal]], sometimes as significant as a [[cathedral]]. A modern example is [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], also the home of the [[Order of the Garter]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n===Other===\n[[File:Chaplain Office York Railway Station.JPG|thumb|Chaplain's Office, [[York railway station]]]]\n\nThere are also chaplains to private clubs, television or radio stations, family, community teams, groups such as [[Boys' Brigade|Boys']] and [[Girls' Brigade]] companies and [[Scouting|Scout]] troops, airports, cruise ships, nightclubs, and theaters.\n\nThe term can also refer to priests attached to [[Catholic]] [[convent]]s. There is also the position of [[Chaplain of His Holiness]], a title granted by the Pope to certain priests who become part of the Papal Household and work with the Papal Chapel. Prior to 1968 they were called Supernumerary Privy Chamberlains.\n\n{{anchor|examining chaplain}}In the [[Church of England]] and other Anglican churches, a Bishop's \"examining chaplain(s)\" are those (usually priests) who examine candidates for ordination and advise the bishop as to their suitability.

Wells, ''World Brain'', Garden City, Doubleday Doran, 1938 (p. 20).</ref>\n\n== Revised editions ==\nMany revised versions were produced during Wells's lifetime, and the author kept notes on factual corrections he received from around the world. The last revision in his lifetime was published in 1937. \n\nIn 1949 an expanded version was produced by [[Raymond Postgate]], who extended the narrative to include the [[Second World War]], and later up to 1969. Postgate wrote that \"readers wish to hear the views of Wells, not those of Postgate,\" and endeavoured to preserve Wells's voice throughout. In later editions [[G. P. Wells]], the author's son, updated the early chapters about [[prehistory]] to reflect current theories: previous editions had, for instance, given credence to [[Piltdown Man]] before it was exposed as a hoax. The final edition appeared in 1971, but earlier editions are still in print.\n\n== Organization of work ==\nThe third revised and rearranged edition is organised in chapters whose subjects are as follows:\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Ch. 1\u20132: The origins of the [[Earth]]\n* Ch. 3\u20136: [[Natural selection]] and the [[evolution]] of life\n* Ch. 7: Human origins\n* Ch. 8: [[Neanderthals]] and the early [[Paleolithic]] Age\n* Ch. 9: The later [[Paleolithic]] Age\n* Ch. 10: The [[Neolithic]] Age\n* Ch. 11: Early (prelinguistic) thought\n* Ch. 12: [[Race (human classification)|Races]]\n* Ch. 13: [[Language]]s\n* Ch. 14: The first civilisations\n* Ch. 15: Sea voyages and trading\n* Ch. 16: Writing\n* Ch. 17: Organized religion\n* Ch. 18: Social classes\n* Ch. 19: The [[Hebrews]]\n* Ch. 20: Aryan-speaking (or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]]) peoples\n* Ch. 21\u201323: The [[Ancient Greeks]]\n* Ch. 24: [[Alexandria]]\n* Ch. 25: [[Buddhism]]\n* Ch. 26\u201328: [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]\n* Ch. 29: [[Christianity]]\n* Ch. 30: Asia (50 BC - AD 650)\n* Ch. 31: [[Islam]]\n* Ch. 32: The [[Crusades]]\n* Ch. 33: The [[Mongols]]\n* Ch. 34: [[The Renaissance]] in Western Europe\n* Ch. 35: Political developments, including that of the [[great power]]\n* Ch. 36: The [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions\n* Ch. 37: [[Napoleon]]\n* Ch. 38: The Nineteenth century\n* Ch. 39: The [[World War I|Great War]]\n* Ch. 40: The Next Stage of History.\n}}\n\n== Overarching themes ==\n=== History as a quest for a common purpose ===\nFrom [[Neolithic]] times (12,000\u201310,000 years ago, by Wells's estimation) \"[t]he history of mankind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a history of more or less blind endeavours to conceive a common purpose in relation to which all men may live happily, and to create and develop a common stock of knowledge which may serve and illuminate that purpose.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 104 (Ch. XI, \u00a76).</ref>\n\n=== Recurrent conquest of civilisation by nomads ===\nWells was uncertain whether to place \"the beginnings of settled communities living in towns\" in [[Mesopotamia]] or [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 131 (Ch. XIV, \u00a71).</ref> He was equally unsure whether to consider the development of civilisation as something that arose from \"the widely diffused Heliolithic Neolithic culture\" or something that arose separately.<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), pp. 131\u201332 (Ch. XIV, \u00a71).</ref> Between the nomadic cultures that originated in the Neolithic Age and the settled civilisations to the south, he discerned that \"for many thousands of years there has been an almost rhythmic recurrence of conquest of the civilizations by the nomads.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 246 (Ch. XX, \u00a73).</ref> According to Wells, this dialectical antagonism reflected not only a struggle for power and resources, but a conflict of values:  \"Civilization, as this outline has shown, arose as a community of obedience, and was essentially a community of obedience.  But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [t]here was a continual influx of masterful will from the forests, parklands, and steppes. The human spirit had at last rebelled altogether against the blind obedience of the common life; it was seeking .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to achieve a new and better sort of civilization that should also be a community of will.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 843 (Ch. XXVI, \u00a75).</ref>  Wells regarded the democratic movements of modernity as an aspect of this movement.<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), pp. 842\u201343 (Ch. XXVI, \u00a75).</ref>\n\n=== Development of free intelligence ===\nWells saw in the [[bard]]s who were, he believed, common to all the \"Aryan-speaking peoples\" an important \"consequence of and a further factor in [the] development of spoken language which was the chief factor of all the human advances made in Neolithic times. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they mark a new step forward in the power and range of the human mind,\" extending the temporal horizons of the human imagination.<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 243 (Ch. XX, \u00a72).</ref>  He saw in the ancient Greeks another definitive advance of these capacities, \"the beginnings of what is becoming at last nowadays a dominant power in human affairs, the 'free intelligence of mankind'.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 204 (Ch. XVIII, \u00a73) (emphasis in original).</ref>  The first individual he distinguishes as embodying free intelligence is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]].<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 202 (Ch. XVIII, \u00a73).</ref>  The Hebrew prophets and the tradition they founded he calls \"a parallel development of the free conscience of mankind.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 234 (Ch. XIX, \u00a74).</ref> Much later, he singles out [[Roger Bacon]] as a precursor of \"a great movement in Europe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. toward reality\" that contributed to the development of \"intelligence\".<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), pp. 729\u201333 (Ch. XXXIV, \u00a76).</ref> But \"[i]t was only in the eighties of the nineteenth century that this body of inquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind. Then suddenly came [[Electricity|electric light and electric traction]], and the transmutation of forces, the possibility of sending ''power'' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 927 (Ch. XXXVIII, \u00a71).</ref>\n\n=== Rejection of racial or cultural superiority ===\nAlthough ''The Outline of History'' is marked here and there by [[Racialism|racialist]] thinking, Wells is firm in rejecting any theories of racial or, indeed, civilizational superiority.  On race, Wells writes that \"Mankind from the point of view of a biologist is an animal species in a state of arrested differentiation and possible admixture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [A]ll races are more or less mixed.\".<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 110 (Ch. XII, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132).</ref>  As for the claim that Western minds are superior, he states that upon examination \"this generalization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dissolves into thin air.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 556 (Ch. XXX, \u00a78).</ref>\n\n== Omitted aspects of world history ==\nA number of themes are downplayed in ''The Outline of History'':  [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] and [[Roman law]] figure among these. Others are altogether absent, in spite of Wells's own intellectual attachment to some of them:  [[romanticism]], the concept of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[feminism]], for example.\n\n== Composition of work ==\n=== Wells's methodology ===\nIn the years leading up to the writing of ''The Outline of History'' Wells was increasingly preoccupied by history, as many works testify. (See, for example, ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'', ''[[Marriage (novel)|Marriage]]'', ''[[An Englishman Looks at the World]]'', ''[[The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman]]'', ''[[Mr. Britling Sees It Through]]'', etc.) During World War I, he tried to promote a world history to be sponsored by the [[League of Nations Union]], of which he was a member. But no professional historian would commit to undertake it, and Wells, in a financially sound position thanks to the success of ''[[Mr. Britling Sees It Through]]'' and believing that his work would earn little, resolved to devote a year to the project. His wife Catherine (Jane) agreed to be his collaborator in typing, research, organisation, correspondence, and criticism. Wells relied heavily on the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (11th ed., 1911), and standard secondary texts. He made use of the [[London Library]], and enlisted as critical readers \"a team of advisers for comment and correction, chief among them [[Ernest Barker]], [[Harry Johnston]], [[E. Ray Lankester]], and [[Gilbert Murray]]. The sections were then rewritten and circulated for further discussion until Wells judged that they had reached a satisfactory standard.\"<ref>Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 252.</ref>  The bulk of the work was written between October 1918 and November 1919.\n\n=== Unproven allegations of plagiarism ===\n{{Undue weight section|date=November 2014}}\nIn 1927 a Canadian, [[Florence Deeks]], sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust. She claimed that he had stolen much of the content of ''The Outline of History'' from a work, ''The Web'', which she had submitted to the Canadian publisher Macmillan Canada, who held onto the manuscript for nearly nine months before rejecting it. The Ontario trial court found the evidence inadequate and dismissed the case.<ref>''Deeks v. Wells'', 1930 CarswellOnt, 167 [1930] 4 D.L.R. 513 (Ont. S.C.).</ref>  An appeal to the Ontario Appellate Division was dismissed,<ref>''Deeks v. Wells'', 1931 CarswellOnt 247 [1931] 4 D.L.R. 533 (Ont. S.C. App.Div.).</ref> as was a final appeal to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]],<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1932/1932_66.html ''Deeks v.

Wells |journal=Queen's Law Journal |volume=29 |page=680}}</ref>\n\nA book was produced in 2000 called \"The Spinster & the Prophet; Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past\", by [[A. B. McKillop]], a professor of history at Carleton University. This book examines the case Deeks had against Wells, for misappropriating information from her manuscript \"The Web\", which she had entrusted to MacMillan Canada. The records are unclear at points as to who handled it, and McKillop states that when she finally had the rejected manuscript back months later, she left it unopened for almost a year. In the meantime \"Outline of History\" came out, she bought a copy, and became suspicious that Wells had copied from her manuscript.\n\nMcKillop's story is mostly circumstantial, due to lack of hard facts in some areas, but the original material from MacMillan's records and Deeks were available for inspection and scrutiny. He paints a portrait of a woman pursuing her right for acknowledgement, and let down by a legal system that heavily favoured men at that time, both in Canada and in the UK. Deeks's three expert witnesses testified that there could be no doubt Wells had copied from her manuscript, which was returned to her well thumbed and worn with stains, as though someone had been perusing it for months.\n\nDeeks's original premise had been to produce a history of important women in history and their accomplishments. Later she modified it to be more a world history but with heavy accent on what we would now describe as feminism. Wells appeared to her to have used much of her work, having stripped the feminism from it. Some mistakes Deeks made in her manuscript were also seen in Wells book, and it was considered by her expert witnesses that in the time Wells wrote his \"Outline\", he could not have possibly done all the research, suggesting that a large part was copied from Deeks work.\n\nIn 2004 Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus in the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, published an article on Deeks v. Wells in the \u201cQueen's Law Journal\u201d. In it he re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book (described as \u201ca novel\u201d in the editorial introduction). While having some sympathy for Deeks, he \u201cchallenges the outpouring of public support\u201d for her. He argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with [[sexism]] from her lawyers, she did receive a fair trial. He goes on to say that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e. :2004).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Magnusson |first=Denis N. |date=Spring 2004 |title=Hell Hath No Fury: Copyright Lawyers' Lessons from Deeks v.

M. Forster]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].<ref>Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010)</ref>\n*[[Edward Shanks]] described ''The Outline'' as \"a wonderful book\". However, he also criticised what he saw as Wells's \"impatience\" and stated \"it is an unfortunate fact that Mr. Wells often seems to find himself in the position of scold to the entire human race\".<ref>Edward Shanks, \"The Work of Mr. H.G.

Becker|Carl Becker]] lauded the ''Outline'' and hailed Wells as \"a formidable ally\".<ref>Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010)</ref>\n* In 1925 [[G. K. Chesterton]], wrote ''[[The Everlasting Man]]'', a critique of ''The Outline of History'' from a [[Roman Catholic]] perspective.<ref>Dale, Alzina Stone, ''The Outline of Sanity : A Biography of G.K. Chesterton\nGrand Rapids, Mich. : Eerdmans, 1982. {{ISBN|9780802835505}} (p. 248)</ref> \n* In 1926 [[Hilaire Belloc]] wrote \"A Companion to Mr. Wells's \"Outline of History\". A devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Belloc was deeply offended by Wells's treatment of Christianity in ''The Outline of History''. Wells wrote a short book in rebuttal called ''Mr. Belloc Objects to \"The Outline of History.\u201d''  In 1926, Belloc published his reply, ''Mr. Belloc Still Objects''.<ref>Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010).</ref>\n* In 1934 [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] dismissed the criticism of ''The Outline of History'' and praised Wells's work in his ''[[A Study of History]]'': <blockquote>Mr. H. G. Wells's ''The Outline of History'' was received with unmistakable hostility by a number of historical specialists. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They seemed not to realize that, in re-living the entire life of Mankind as a single imaginative experience, Mr. Wells was achieving something which they themselves would hardly have dared to attempt ...

By an accident impossible to reconstruct, he (the small h horrified David) survived his own [[crucifixion]] and presumably died a few weeks later. A religion was founded on the freakish incident.

Wells, ''World Brain'', Garden City,\nDoubleday Doran, 1938 (p. 20).</ref>\n\n== Revised editions ==\nMany revised versions were produced during Wells's lifetime, and the author kept notes on factual corrections he received from around the world. The last revision in his lifetime was published in 1937. \n\nIn 1949 an expanded version was produced by [[Raymond Postgate]], who extended the narrative to include the [[Second World War]], and later up to 1969. Postgate wrote that \"readers wish to hear the views of Wells, not those of Postgate,\" and endeavoured to preserve Wells's voice throughout. In later editions [[G. P. Wells]], the author's son, updated the early chapters about [[prehistory]] to reflect current theories: previous editions had, for instance, given credence to [[Piltdown Man]] before it was exposed as a hoax. The final edition appeared in 1971, but earlier editions are still in print.\n\n== Organization of work ==\nThe third revised and rearranged edition is organised in chapters whose subjects are as follows:\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Ch. 1\u20132: The origins of the [[Earth]]\n* Ch. 3\u20136: [[Natural selection]] and the [[evolution]] of life\n* Ch. 7: Human origins\n* Ch. 8: [[Neanderthals]] and the early [[Paleolithic]] Age\n* Ch. 9: The later [[Paleolithic]] Age\n* Ch. 10: The [[Neolithic]] Age\n* Ch. 11: Early (prelinguistic) thought\n* Ch. 12: [[Race (human classification)|Races]]\n* Ch. 13: [[Language]]s\n* Ch. 14: The first civilisations\n* Ch. 15: Sea voyages and trading\n* Ch. 16: Writing\n* Ch. 17: Organized religion\n* Ch. 18: Social classes\n* Ch. 19: The [[Hebrews]]\n* Ch. 20: Aryan-speaking (or [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]]) peoples\n* Ch. 21\u201323: The [[Ancient Greeks]]\n* Ch. 24: [[Alexandria]]\n* Ch. 25: [[Buddhism]]\n* Ch. 26\u201328: [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]\n* Ch. 29: [[Christianity]]\n* Ch. 30: Asia (50 BC - AD 650)\n* Ch. 31: [[Islam]]\n* Ch. 32: The [[Crusades]]\n* Ch. 33: The [[Mongols]]\n* Ch. 34: [[The Renaissance]] in Western Europe\n* Ch. 35: Political developments, including that of the [[great power]]\n* Ch. 36: The [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution|French]] revolutions\n* Ch. 37: [[Napoleon]]\n* Ch. 38: The Nineteenth century\n* Ch. 39: The [[World War I|Great War]]\n* Ch. 40: The Next Stage of History.\n}}\n\n== Overarching themes ==\n=== History as a quest for a common purpose ===\nFrom [[Neolithic]] times (12,000\u201310,000 years ago, by Wells's estimation) \"[t]he history of mankind .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. is a history of more or less blind endeavours to conceive a common purpose in relation to which all men may live happily, and to create and develop a common stock of knowledge which may serve and illuminate that purpose.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 104 (Ch. XI, \u00a76).</ref>\n\n=== Recurrent conquest of civilisation by nomads ===\nWells was uncertain whether to place \"the beginnings of settled communities living in towns\" in [[Mesopotamia]] or [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]].<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 131 (Ch. XIV, \u00a71).</ref> He was equally unsure whether to consider the development of civilisation as something that arose from \"the widely diffused Heliolithic Neolithic culture\" or something that arose separately.<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), pp. 131\u201332 (Ch. XIV, \u00a71).</ref> Between the nomadic cultures that originated in the Neolithic Age and the settled civilisations to the south, he discerned that \"for many thousands of years there has been an almost rhythmic recurrence of conquest of the civilizations by the nomads.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 246 (Ch. XX, \u00a73).</ref> According to Wells, this dialectical antagonism reflected not only a struggle for power and resources, but a conflict of values:  \"Civilization, as this outline has shown, arose as a community of obedience, and was essentially a community of obedience.  But .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [t]here was a continual influx of masterful will from the forests, parklands, and steppes. The human spirit had at last rebelled altogether against the blind obedience of the common life; it was seeking .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. to achieve a new and better sort of civilization that should also be a community of will.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 843 (Ch. XXVI, \u00a75).</ref>  Wells regarded the democratic movements of modernity as an aspect of this movement.<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), pp. 842\u201343 (Ch. XXVI, \u00a75).</ref>\n\n=== Development of free intelligence ===\nWells saw in the [[bard]]s who were, he believed, common to all the \"Aryan-speaking peoples\" an important \"consequence of and a further factor in [the] development of spoken language which was the chief factor of all the human advances made in Neolithic times. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. they mark a new step forward in the power and range of the human mind,\" extending the temporal horizons of the human imagination.<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 243 (Ch. XX, \u00a72).</ref>  He saw in the ancient Greeks another definitive advance of these capacities, \"the beginnings of what is becoming at last nowadays a dominant power in human affairs, the 'free intelligence of mankind'.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 204 (Ch. XVIII, \u00a73) (emphasis in original).</ref>  The first individual he distinguishes as embodying free intelligence is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]].<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 202 (Ch. XVIII, \u00a73).</ref>  The Hebrew prophets and the tradition they founded he calls \"a parallel development of the free conscience of mankind.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 234 (Ch. XIX, \u00a74).</ref> Much later, he singles out [[Roger Bacon]] as a precursor of \"a great movement in Europe .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. toward reality\" that contributed to the development of \"intelligence\".<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), pp. 729\u201333 (Ch. XXXIV, \u00a76).</ref> But \"[i]t was only in the eighties of the nineteenth century that this body of inquiry began to yield results to impress the vulgar mind. Then suddenly came [[Electricity|electric light and electric traction]], and the transmutation of forces, the possibility of sending ''power'' .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. began to come through to the ideas of ordinary people.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 927 (Ch. XXXVIII, \u00a71).</ref>\n\n=== Rejection of racial or cultural superiority ===\nAlthough ''The Outline of History'' is marked here and there by [[Racialism|racialist]] thinking, Wells is firm in rejecting any theories of racial or, indeed, civilizational superiority.  On race, Wells writes that \"Mankind from the point of view of a biologist is an animal species in a state of arrested differentiation and possible admixture .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [A]ll races are more or less mixed.\".<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 110 (Ch. XII, \u00a7\u00a71\u20132).</ref>  As for the claim that Western minds are superior, he states that upon examination \"this generalization .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. dissolves into thin air.\"<ref>H.G. Wells, ''The Outline of History'', 3rd ed. rev. (NY: Macmillan, 1921), p. 556 (Ch. XXX, \u00a78).</ref>\n\n== Omitted aspects of world history ==\nA number of themes are downplayed in ''The Outline of History'':  [[Ancient Greek philosophy]] and [[Roman law]] figure among these. Others are altogether absent, in spite of Wells's own intellectual attachment to some of them:  [[romanticism]], the concept of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and [[feminism]], for example.\n\n== Composition of work ==\n=== Wells's methodology ===\nIn the years leading up to the writing of ''The Outline of History'' Wells was increasingly preoccupied by history, as many works testify. (See, for example, ''[[The New Machiavelli]]'', ''[[Marriage (novel)|Marriage]]'', ''[[An Englishman Looks at the World]]'', ''[[The Wife of Sir Isaac Harman]]'', ''[[Mr. Britling Sees It Through]]'', etc.) During World War I, he tried to promote a world history to be sponsored by the [[League of Nations Union]], of which he was a member. But no professional historian would commit to undertake it, and Wells, in a financially sound position thanks to the success of ''[[Mr. Britling Sees It Through]]'' and believing that his work would earn little, resolved to devote a year to the project. His wife Catherine (Jane) agreed to be his collaborator in typing, research, organisation, correspondence, and criticism. Wells relied heavily on the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' (11th ed., 1911), and standard secondary texts. He made use of the [[London Library]], and enlisted as critical readers \"a team of advisers for comment and correction, chief among them [[Ernest Barker]], [[Harry Johnston]], [[E. Ray Lankester]], and [[Gilbert Murray]]. The sections were then rewritten and circulated for further discussion until Wells judged that they had reached a satisfactory standard.\"<ref>Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010), p. 252.</ref>  The bulk of the work was written between October 1918 and November 1919.\n\n=== Unproven allegations of plagiarism ===\n{{Undue weight section|date=November 2014}}\nIn 1927 a Canadian, [[Florence Deeks]], sued Wells for infringement of copyright and breach of trust. She claimed that he had stolen much of the content of ''The Outline of History'' from a work, ''The Web'', which she had submitted to the Canadian publisher Macmillan Canada, who held onto the manuscript for nearly nine months before rejecting it. The Ontario trial court found the evidence inadequate and dismissed the case.<ref>''Deeks v. Wells'', 1930 CarswellOnt, 167 [1930] 4 D.L.R. 513 (Ont. S.C.).</ref>  An appeal to the Ontario Appellate Division was dismissed,<ref>''Deeks v. Wells'', 1931 CarswellOnt 247 [1931] 4 D.L.R. 533 (Ont. S.C.

Wells |journal=Queen's Law Journal |volume=29 |page=680}}</ref>\n\nA book was produced in 2000 called \"The Spinster & the Prophet; Florence Deeks, H. G. Wells, and the Mystery of the Purloined Past\", by [[A. B. McKillop]], a professor of history at Carleton University. This book examines the case Deeks had against Wells, for misappropriating information from her manuscript \"The Web\", which she had entrusted to MacMillan Canada. The records are unclear at points as to who handled it, and McKillop states that when she finally had the rejected manuscript back months later, she left it unopened for almost a year. In the meantime \"Outline of History\" came out, she bought a copy, and became suspicious that Wells had copied from her manuscript.\n\nMcKillop's story is mostly circumstantial, due to lack of hard facts in some areas, but the original material from MacMillan's records and Deeks were available for inspection and scrutiny. He paints a portrait of a woman pursuing her right for acknowledgement, and let down by a legal system that heavily favoured men at that time, both in Canada and in the UK. Deeks's three expert witnesses testified that there could be no doubt Wells had copied from her manuscript, which was returned to her well thumbed and worn with stains, as though someone had been perusing it for months.\n\nDeeks's original premise had been to produce a history of important women in history and their accomplishments. Later she modified it to be more a world history but with heavy accent on what we would now describe as feminism. Wells appeared to her to have used much of her work, having stripped the feminism from it. Some mistakes Deeks made in her manuscript were also seen in Wells book, and it was considered by her expert witnesses that in the time Wells wrote his \"Outline\", he could not have possibly done all the research, suggesting that a large part was copied from Deeks work.\n\nIn 2004 Denis N. Magnusson, Professor Emeritus in the Faculty of Law, Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, published an article on Deeks v. Wells in the \u201cQueen's Law Journal\u201d. In it he re-examines the case in relation to McKillop's book (described as \u201ca novel\u201d in the editorial introduction). While having some sympathy for Deeks, he \u201cchallenges the outpouring of public support\u201d for her. He argues that she had a weak case that was not well presented, and though she may have met with [[sexism]] from her lawyers, she did receive a fair trial. He goes on to say that the law applied is essentially the same law that would be applied to a similar case today (i.e. :2004).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Magnusson |first=Denis N. |date=Spring 2004 |title=Hell Hath No Fury: Copyright Lawyers' Lessons from Deeks v.

M. Forster]] and [[Beatrice Webb]].<ref>Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010)</ref>\n*[[Edward Shanks]] described ''The Outline'' as \"a wonderful book\".

A devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Belloc was deeply offended by Wells's treatment of Christianity in ''The Outline of History''. Wells wrote a short book in rebuttal called ''Mr. Belloc Objects to \"The Outline of History.\u201d''  In 1926, Belloc published his reply, ''Mr. Belloc Still Objects''.<ref>Michael Sherborne, ''H.G. Wells: Another Kind of Life'' (Peter Owen, 2010).</ref>\n* In 1934 [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] dismissed the criticism of ''The Outline of History'' and praised Wells's work in his ''[[A Study of History]]'': <blockquote>Mr. H. G. Wells's ''The Outline of History'' was received with unmistakable hostility by a number of historical specialists. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. They seemed not to realize that, in re-living the entire life of Mankind as a single imaginative experience, Mr. Wells was achieving something which they themselves would hardly have dared to attempt ... In fact, the purpose and value of Mr. Wells's book seem to have been better appreciated by the general public than by the professional historians of the day.<ref>Toynbee, A.J. ''A Study of History'', Vol I, Oxford University Press, 1934.</ref></blockquote> Toynbee went on to refer to ''The Outline'' several times in ''A Study of History'', offering his share of criticism but maintaining a generally positive view of the book.\n*Also in 1934 [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] stated that ''The Outline of History'' was a major influence on his own work, ''[[Glimpses of World History]]''.<ref>Nehru, Jawaharlal.

Finding a copy of Wells's ''Outline of History'', it turns out to be identical to the one he knows until 1903, at which point the alternate Wells records the invention of [[anti-gravity]], a fast human expansion into space, a brutal war for the conquest of [[Mars]] which Wells strongly denounces, followed by a titanic conflict with [[Arcturus]].\n* In [[Satyajit Ray]]'s 1959 film [[Apur Sansar (The World of Apu)|Apur Sansar]] the book, wrapped in a white cloth cover with only the title visible, is seen on the bookshelf of the protagonist Apurba Roy.\n* In [[John Updike]]'s 1961 story \"[[Pigeon Feathers and Other Stories|Pigeon Feathers]]\" the young protagonist finds a copy of ''Outline of History'' and is surprised and disturbed by Wells's descriptions of [[Jesus]]. Updike describes Wells's account of Jesus as:\n<blockquote>He had been an obscure political agitator, a kind of hobo, in a minor colony of the Roman Empire. By an accident impossible to reconstruct, he (the small h horrified David) survived his own [[crucifixion]] and presumably died a few weeks later. A religion was founded on the freakish incident. The credulous imagination of the times retrospectively assigned miracles and supernatural pretensions to Jesus; a myth grew, and then a church, whose theology at most points was in direct contradiction of the simple, rather communistic teachings of the Galilean.<ref>{{cite book|last=Updike|first=John|title=The Early Stories 1953\u20131975|year=2003|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-345-46336-6|pages=14|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=1cCm29iOlwYC |page=14 }} }}  Note, however, that Wells does not assert (at least in the 3rd revised edition of ''The Outline of History'') that Jesus \"survived his own crucifixion and presumably died a few weeks later\"; rather, Wells says that after Jesus's death and burial \"presently came a whisper among [the disciples] and stories, rather discrepant stories&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\" (see Ch. XXIX, \u00a74).</ref></blockquote>\n* [[William Golding]] used Wells's description of the Neanderthals as a basis in creating his own Neanderthal tribe in his 1955 novel, [[The Inheritors (William Golding)|''The Inheritors'']].<ref>{{Google books |id=OqZaAAAAMAAJ |page=47 |title=The Art of William Golding }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel|Guns, Germs and Steel: A Short History of Everybody for the Last 13,000 Years]]'' ([[Jared Diamond]])\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n*[http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/Wells-Outline/Outline_of_History.htm Full text of the 1920 edition of ''The Outline of History'']\n*{{Internet Archive collection | id= OutlineOfHistory | name= Outline of History }}\n*[http://www.salon.com/books/review/2002/11/07/mckillip/ Salon.com's review] of A.

The company is a unit of the [[Canal+ Group]], owned by [[Vivendi]].\n\n==Background==\nThe company was founded in 1988 by [[Pierre Lescure]] as a spin-off of the [[Canal+]] pay-TV network. The original function was to focus on French and [[Europe]]an productions, but later made strategic deals with American production companies. StudioCanal's most notable productions from its early years include ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'', ''[[Basic Instinct]]'', ''[[Cliffhanger (film)|Cliffhanger]]'', ''[[Under Siege]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', and the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' movie. In those days, it was known as either Le Studio Canal+ or simply Canal+.\n\nOther films the company financed include ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'', ''[[Bully (2001 film)|Bully]]'', and ''[[Bridget Jones's Diary (film)|Bridget Jones's Diary]]''. StudioCanal also funded the last third of [[David Lynch]]'s film ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Drive]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|166924|Mulholland Drive}}</ref> StudioCanal also financed French-language films, such as ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' (which became the second-highest-grossing [[French-language]] film in the [[United States]] in the last two decades) and ''[[Intimate Strangers (2004 film)|Intimate Strangers]]'' (which is being remade by Hollywood-based [[Paramount Pictures]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117967389.html?categoryid=2607&cs=1|publisher=Variety|first=Matthew|last=Ross|title=Kelly Fremon|date=June 21, 2007}}</ref>). The biggest box office hits for StudioCanal have been ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'' which grossed US$519 million, ''Basic Instinct'' which grossed US$352 million and ''[[The Tourist (2010 film)|The Tourist]]'' which grossed US$278 million worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=terminator2.htm|title=Terminator 2: Judgment Day|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=basicinstinct.htm|title=Basic Instinct|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=tourist.htm|title=The Tourist|publisher=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=August 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Film library==\nStudioCanal acquired film libraries from studios that either became defunct or had merged with it over the years; as a result, the company's library is one of the largest in the world, with over 6,000 titles.\n\nStudioCanal owns the libraries of the following companies:\n* [[Carolco Pictures]],<ref name=carolco1>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=The rise and fall of Carolco|date=March 11, 2014|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/233689/the-rise-and-fall-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name=carolco2>{{cite web|last=Lambie|first=Ryan|title=Exclusive: CEO Alex Bafer Tells Us About The Return of Carolco|date=January 26, 2015|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/carolco/243077/exclusive-ceo-alex-bafer-tells-us-about-the-return-of-carolco|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n**The Vista Organization\n**Seven Arts (joint venture with [[New Line Cinema]])\n*Paravision International, including:\n** Parafrance Films\n** [[De Laurentiis Entertainment Group]],<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg>{{cite web|last=Hammer|first=Joshua|title=Total Free Fall|date=March 8, 1992|work=[[Newsweek]]|url=http://www.newsweek.com/total-free-fall-195938|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> including:\n*** [[Embassy Pictures]]<ref name=carolco1/><ref name=carolco2/><ref name=deg/><ref>{{cite web|last=Friendly|first=David T.|title=De Laurentiis Rejoins The Ranks--at Embassy|date=November 16, 1985|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1985-11-16/entertainment/ca-2810_1_major-studios|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref>\n* Lumiere Pictures and Television<ref>{{cite web|last=Hopewell|first=John|title=Lumiere rocks to French classics|date=October 20, 2012|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|url=https://variety.com/2012/film/news/lumiere-rocks-to-french-classics-1118061036/|accessdate=April 24, 2015}}</ref> (currently owned as a result of parent company [[Canal+ Group]]'s acquisition of cinema operator [[UGC (cinema operator)|UGC]] who acquired those companies, via [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon Films]]), including:\n** [[EMI Films]],<ref name=ealing/><ref>\"A.B.
