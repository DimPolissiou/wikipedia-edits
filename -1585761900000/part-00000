The term ''expulsion'' is often used as a [[synonym]] for deportation, though expulsion is more often used in the context of [[international law]], while deportation is more used in [[municipal law|national (municipal) law]].<ref>[[Jean-Marie Henckaerts]] in his book 'Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'' wrote: \"As far as deportation is concerned, there is no general feature that clearly sets it apart from expulsion. Both term basically indicate the same phenomenon. [...] The only difference seems to be one of preferential use, expulsion being more an international term while deportation is more used in municipal law. [...] One study [discusses this distinction] but immediately adds that in modern practice both terms have become interchangeable.\" See {{cite book|author=Jean-Marie Henckaerts|title=Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s3kaTLyAKo0C&pg=PA5|date=6 July 1995|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=90-411-0072-5|pages=5\u20136}}</ref> [[Forced displacement]] or forced migration of an individual or a group may be caused by deportation, for example [[ethnic cleansing]], and other reasons.\n\n==Definition==\n\nDefinitions of deportation apply equally to nationals and foreigners.<ref>Henckaerts, ''Mass Expulsion in Modern International Law and Practice'', 1995, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Nonetheless, in the common usage the expulsion of foreign nationals is usually called deportation, whereas the expulsion of nationals is called [[extradition]], banishment, [[exile]], or [[penal transportation]]. For example, in the [[United States]]:\n<blockquote>\n\"Strictly speaking, transportation, extradition, and deportation, although each has the effect of removing a person from the country, are different things, and have different purposes. Transportation is by way of punishment of one convicted of an offense against the laws of the country. Extradition is the surrender to another country of one accused of an offense against its laws, there to be tried, and, if found guilty, punished. Deportation is the removal of an alien out of the country, simply because his presence is deemed inconsistent with the public welfare and without any punishment being imposed or contemplated either under the laws of the country out of which he is sent or of those of the country to which he is taken.\"<ref>''[[Fong Yue Ting v. United States]]'', 149 U.S. 697, at 709 (1893).</ref></blockquote>\n\nExpulsion is an act by a public authority to remove a person or persons against his or her will from the territory of that state. A successful expulsion of a person by a country is called a deportation.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=27}}\n\nAccording to the European Court of Human Rights, collective expulsion is any measure compelling non-nationals, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual non-national of the group. Mass expulsion may also occur when members of an ethnic group are sent out of a state regardless of nationality. Collective expulsion, or expulsion en masse, is prohibited by several instruments of international law.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=35}}\n\n==History==\n\nDeportations widely occurred in ancient history, and is well-recorded particularly in [[ancient Mesopotamia]].<ref name=iranica />\n\n===In Assyrian Empire===\n* Mass deportations of conquered nations, including Jewish [[Assyrian captivity]].\n\n===In Achaemenid Empire===\nDeportation was practiced as a policy toward rebellious people in [[Achaemenid Empire]].

If ethnic groups are affected by this, it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. The rationale is often that these groups might assist the enemy in war or insurrection.

Some historians have estimated the number of deaths from the deportation to be as high as 1 in 3 among some populations.<ref>In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia''. Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87113-906-5}}. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929\u20131953''. Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7190-6377-9}}. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C.

For example, in the [[United States]]:\n<blockquote>\n\"Strictly speaking, transportation, extradition, and deportation, although each has the effect of removing a person from the country, are different things, and have different purposes. Transportation is by way of punishment of one convicted of an offense against the laws of the country. Extradition is the surrender to another country of one accused of an offense against its laws, there to be tried, and, if found guilty, punished. Deportation is the removal of an alien out of the country, simply because his presence is deemed inconsistent with the public welfare and without any punishment being imposed or contemplated either under the laws of the country out of which he is sent or of those of the country to which he is taken.\"<ref>''[[Fong Yue Ting v. United States]]'', 149 U.S. 697, at 709 (1893).</ref></blockquote>\n\nExpulsion is an act by a public authority to remove a person or persons against his or her will from the territory of that state. A successful expulsion of a person by a country is called a deportation.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=27}}\n\nAccording to the European Court of Human Rights, collective expulsion is any measure compelling non-nationals, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual non-national of the group. Mass expulsion may also occur when members of an ethnic group are sent out of a state regardless of nationality. Collective expulsion, or expulsion en masse, is prohibited by several instruments of international law.{{sfn|IOM|2011|p=35}}\n\n==History==\n\nDeportations widely occurred in ancient history, and is well-recorded particularly in [[ancient Mesopotamia]].<ref name=iranica />\n\n===In Assyrian Empire===\n* Mass deportations of conquered nations, including Jewish [[Assyrian captivity]].\n\n===In Achaemenid Empire===\nDeportation was practiced as a policy toward rebellious people in [[Achaemenid Empire]].

If ethnic groups are affected by this, it may also be referred to as [[population transfer]]. The rationale is often that these groups might assist the enemy in war or insurrection. For example, the American state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] deported 400 female mill workers during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] on the suspicion they were Northern sympathizers.<ref>Dillman, ''The Roswell Mills and A Civil War Tragedy: Excerpts from Days Gone by in Alpharetta and Roswell, Georgia'', 1996; Hitt, ''Charged with Treason: The Ordeal of 400 Mill Workers During Military Operations in Roswell, Georgia, 1864\u20131865'', 1992.</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Joseph Stalin]] (see [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union]]) ordered the deportation of [[Volga German]]s, [[Chechens]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Ukrainians]] and others to areas away from the front, including central and western Soviet Union. Some historians have estimated the number of deaths from the deportation to be as high as 1 in 3 among some populations.<ref>In one estimate, based on a report by [[Lavrenti Beria]] to [[Joseph Stalin]], 150,000 of 478,479 deported Ingush and Chechen people (or 31.3 percent) died within the first four years of the resettlement. See: Kleveman, Lutz. ''The New Great Game: Blood and Oil in Central Asia''. Jackson, Tenn.: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-87113-906-5}}. Another scholar puts the number of deaths at 22.7 percent: Extrapolating from [[NKVD]] records, 113,000 Ingush and Chechens died (3,000 before deportation, 10,000 during deportation, and 100,000 after resettlement) in the first three years of the resettlement out of 496,460 total deportees. See: Naimark, Norman M. ''Fires of Hatred: Ethnic Cleansing in Twentieth-Century Europe''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-674-00994-0}}. A third source says a quarter of the 650,000 deported Chechens, Ingush, Karachais and Kalmyks died within four years of resettlement. See: Mawdsley, Evan. ''The Stalin Years: The Soviet Union 1929\u20131953''. Manchester, England: Manchester University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-7190-6377-9}}. However, estimates of the number of deportees sometimes varies widely. Two scholars estimated the number of Chechen and Ingush deportees at 700,000, which would halve the percentage estimates of deaths. See: Fischer, Ruth and Leggett, John C.
