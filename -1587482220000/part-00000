Her future self asks her to prevent her \"biggest regrets\", which has something to do with the new transfer student from [[Tokyo]], a boy named Kakeru Naruse. At first skeptical, Naho begins to believe the letters as they accurately predict events. When the letter asks her not to invite Kakeru to go out for the first day, Naho and her friends (Hiroto Suwa, Takako Chino, Saku Hagita and Azusa Murasaka) decide to invite him anyway. Kakeru ends up not attending school for the next two weeks.\n\nTo prevent another mistake, Naho resolves to do what the letters order her to do, such as volunteering on a [[softball]] round, encouraging Kakeru to join the [[soccer]] team, objecting to him pursuing a relationship with an upperclassman, and insisting that the two watch the fireworks alone. Naho learns from the letters that in the future Kakeru is dead, having died by [[suicide]] around [[Valentine's Day]] in the same school year in which he enrolled.\n\nDuring the [[Bon Festival]], Kakeru explains to Naho the reason for his absence: his mother died by suicide because of a mental breakdown caused by him leaving her for friends, and not taking her to the hospital on the day of enrollment as he promised. This causes Naho to also feel guilty, as she feels they share responsibility for Kakeru's mother's death. Later on, Suwa tells Naho that he has also received letters from his future self, asking him to be a good friend to Kakeru and save him from his death. Suwa hides the fact that he and Naho are married and have a child in the future, as he realizes Naho and Kakeru are in love. Although he has feelings for Naho, his future self realizes by saving Kakeru, he is giving up a future with Naho. Because he knows of their feelings, he listens to the letters and supports them as much as possible.  Later, Azusa, and Hagita, and Chino admit they have received similar letters. They all agree that though they may not be able to change the fate of their future selves, they may create a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] where Kakeru is still alive.\n\nTo cheer up Kakeru, the five friends organize a celebration for his 17th birthday, in which Kakeru confesses his feelings to a surprised Naho. The five also join the relay race team to back Kakeru. With his friends' encouragement, Kakeru wins the race. As his reward for winning the race, Kakeru kisses Naho. However, on [[New Year's Eve]], Naho and Kakeru argue over the latter's grandmother's health. The two become distant over the following weeks, up until the day that Kakeru is supposed to die by suicide, as Naho manages to confess her feelings as well as telling Kakeru to share his plan for suicide.\n\nOn the night of Kakeru's supposed death, the friends' plan to meet up is interrupted as Kakeru does not arrive on time. The five search throughout Matsumoto and manage to stop him from getting hit by a truck. Kakeru apologizes, telling them that he had been thinking of suicide, but at the last second decided not to after realizing that doing so would mean that he would never see his friends again.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Naho Takamiya|\u9ad8\u5bae\u83dc\u7a42|Takamiya Naho}} \n:{{Voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|Jill Harris}}<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/10/18/fall-2016-simuldub-english-cast-announcements-for-the-love-of-dubs/|title=Fall 2016 SimulDub\u2122 English Cast Announcements \u2013 For The Love of Dubs - Funimation \u2013 Blog!|website=www.funimation.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n:A high school girl who receives a letter from herself ten years in the future, informing herself that she will meet a guy named Kakeru who she must keep an eye on.

Naho begins her story about the moments that she regrets in her life and decides to tell her 16 year old counterpart how to deal with her misfortunes. 10 years earlier, Naho wakes up late and receives a letter, which comes from her adult self. She reads the first page of the letter at school which accurately tells her that she was late that day. It also says that a transfer student will sit next to her, and it happens. Kakeru Naruse introduces himself and sits next to Naho. As the class dismisses early, Naho and her friends decide to take a stroll, get acquainted and make friends with Kakeru. At night, Naho reads the letter again and notices the similarity between her writing and contents of her diary and the letter. The following day, Naho notices Kakeru's absence. In PE class, she reads the letter saying that she regrets not joining in the softball game. A returning Kakeru chats with Naho regarding joining a sports club and her injured foot due to the size of her shoe. At the softball game, Naho's teammates invite her to play and she is hesitant at first. But because of the letter and a little inspiration from Kakeru, she stands up and plays as the batter in their softball game. Naho hits a home run, winning the game. Their class also emerges as champion because Suwa wins the boys' football game. Naho now completely believes that the contents of the letter are real and will happen, and as she reads the next pages, it reveals that Kakeru will die. The letter asks Naho for a favour: that she must watch closely over Kakeru.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Letter 02\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 02\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1902}})\n| DirectedBy      = Takayuki Kuriyama\n| WrittenBy       = Y\u016bko Kakihara\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|7|11}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep2\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/02.html|title=Episode 2: \"LETTER 02\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Naho continues reading the letter, learning that Kakeru will die soon. As she progresses through the letter, she learns that Kakeru doesn't bring any lunch to school and that her future self regrets never making lunch for him. The letter tells her to make lunch for Kakeru and she does so. However, the next day Naho hesitates giving Kakeru the lunch she prepared. After school, Kakeru notices Naho's bag which contains the bento meant for him. However, Naho rudely dismisses Kakeru, but later apologizes. Kakeru decides to accompany and take a stroll in the park with Naho, during which he explains his 2-week long absence to her. He reveals that his mother had committed suicide on the first day of class, and Naho realizes that was the day she and her friends asked him to hang out with them instead of going home. To comfort Kakeru, Naho finally gives him the bento she made and Kakeru smiles. Afterwards, Naho decides that she will protect Kakeru and make sure that he is happy.

However, Suwa announces that Kakeru will be staying in the football club for good. Naho realizes that every moment mentioned in the letter will soon change for the future. She reads again the letter, this time is about a girl named Ueda Rio who is interested in Kakeru. The letter tells that Ueda will confess her feelings to Kakeru and later they will start dating. As the class ends early, Naho and friends play rock-paper-scissors to determine who will buy drinks and it happened Kakeru loses. As Kakeru buys their drinks, Ueda approaches him. Naho questions Kakeru if he likes Ueda and Kakeru admits that he like Ueda. Again, Ueda approaches Kakeru and after a brief talk, Ueda leaves smiling. Naho looks again to the letter that she should check the case of her eraser borrowed by Kakeru and look for the enclosed note, asking Naho if he should date Ueda. Naho replies to Kakeru's note and leaves it to his locker, but it is too late when she learns that Kakeru and Ueda are now officially dating. Emotionally devastated, Naho left her friends and goes home, drinks the orange juice given by Kakeru and apologizing to her future self, seemingly regretting due to her lack of initiative.

Naho, as she read few parts of the letter, avoids Kakeru while the latter is seemingly initiates a conversation with her. Meanwhile, Takako and Azusa dislike Ueda and trying to ask Naho if she hides something. As Naho evades Kakeru and her friends' question, Naho becomes emotional and Suwa approached Naho.

Naho continues to realize that there are discrepancies between her world and the letter she received from the future (as her letter tells her that all 6 friends will go out together but it ends up being just her and Kakeru, as everyone else cites various reasons that they cannot join). While overlooking the city, Kakeru uses this opportunity to present Naho with a hairpin as thanks for the bentos she makes for him. He also invites her out during the weekend to the library to study. With Naho's help, Kakeru receives the highest score in the chemistry test. Their Science teacher gives a short exposition on the concept of time travel and the theory of alternate / parallel universes. Naho suddenly realizes that the letter hasn't changed despite her present changing, probably due to the fact that she has perhaps created a new timeline with the choices she has made. She is devastated to think that despite everything she has done, nothing will change for her future self. As the world has changed, an event where Kakeru asks Naho to watch the fireworks alone together at the end of their school festival is never triggered. Naho then forces herself to ask Kakeru to watch the fireworks with her. Kakeru asks Suwa for permission to see the fireworks alone with Naho as he and the others are aware that Suwa actually likes Naho. Suwa however, has made up his mind to support Kakeru and Naho instead. During the school festival, Naho is ambushed by Ueda and her lackeys who bully her into showing the hairpin that Kakeru bought for her, but she is saved by Suwa who shows up and takes her back to their friends at the pool. She later thanks Suwa for everything that he has ever done for her, as her letter tells her to never take his kindness and friendship for granted. The letter reveals that in the future, Suwa was the one who \"saved her heart\".\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Letter 06\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 06\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1906}})\n| DirectedBy      = Taku Yamada\n| WrittenBy       = Mariko Kunisawa\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|8|8}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep6\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/06.html|title=Episode 6: \"LETTER 06\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In the evening Kakeru asks Naho to meet at the pool as he wants to talk with Suwa, who persuades Kakeru to go and make Naho happy.

Ueda then heads to the pool with the intention to watch the fireworks with Kakeru, but is stopped at the gate by Suwa and Hagita who inform her that Kakeru is looking for her elsewhere. The fireworks start and Naho is distraught, until Asuza and Takako run into her and quickly take the cartons, telling Naho to hurry to Kakeru. By the time she arrives, the fireworks have stopped, but Kakeru notices that Naho is wearing the hairpin he gave her.

Later, Naho reads ahead in her letter and discovers that Kakeru will die in an accident near his home on February 15th.

In the present, the 6 friends decide to meet at the Matsumoto bon festival a few days later but Naho and Kakeru find themselves alone when the other four pretend to be late. While visiting a shrine, Kakeru lets slip that he asked God to pass on a message to his mother. As her letter tells her to try to get Kakeru to open up about his mother, Naho finally manages to force Kakeru to reveal that he believes his mother's death was his fault, that his refusal to go with her to the hospital on the day of the opening ceremony led her to commit suicide. Naho is unable to comfort him and is upset as she doesn't know what to do. She is visited by Suwa the next day and decides that she can't save Kakeru on her own.

After school, Suwa and Naho discuss their decision to go against the letters suggested path, and Naho builds the resolve to put her letter away and go off of what she feels Kakeru wants in her heart more than what her future self seems to think.  The next day, Hagita asks Asuza to hang out with him after school.  Kakeru also asks Naho to walk to the school gates with him.  In the locker room however, she trips and falls into Kakeru's arms, and is too embarrassed or unsure to accept his efforts to hold her hand.  The same issue repeats the next day, and in both cases Kakeru excuses himself.  Naho is confronted by everyone else in the group, and Asuza and Takako both reveal their letters.  Furthermore they suggest that Kakeru may not have anything wrong with him other than the rejections felt from not getting to hold Naho's hand.  Hagita is pushed into also revealing his letter by Asuza, confirming that everyone has received letters from the future.  Together, they strengthen their resolve to save their friend.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = Letter 09\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 09\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1909}})\n| DirectedBy      = Hideki Tonokatsu <br/> Keiko Oyamada\n| WrittenBy       = Mariko Kunisawa\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|8|29}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep9\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/09.html|title=Episode 9: \"LETTER 09\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Everyone except for Kakeru continue to discuss their support for Naho, saying the only way they feel that Kakeru will truly be happy is if he is with her.  Naho begins making a more conscious effort to do what she feels she needs to do to improve upon the relationship.  After school, the group meets up to discuss their efforts to make it all work out, but when Kakeru asks they cover it up and suggest they are deciding on the race order.  Asuza begins to look into her letter from her present day self, and discovers that her birthday will fall on a rainy day.  The umbrella she receives as a gift from Hagita she lends to Kakeru when he asks Naho to let him walk under hers, and her present day self wonders what would've happened if she hadn't.  Despite the sunny forecast, everyone but Kakeru now feature an umbrella, unlike Asuza's present recollection of just Naho and Asuza having one.  In the end, Naho and Kakeru use Naho's umbrella and walk home, and eventually leads to holding one another hands.  Kakeru gets closer to Naho, but when he says suggests that he would like to be able to go out with her on a date, that he will wait for her to want to do so.  Naho is unable to say this yet.  The scene shifts nine days forward to the day of the athletic meet, where Naho reads her letter from her future self once more.  She learns that Kakeru is unable to tell the rest of the group about his mother.  Suwa decides to ask his parents to invite Kakeru's grandmother along to the meet and offer her a ride, which improves Kakeru's spirits at the time.  During the group photo however, he begins to think about his mother again, and still seems to be troubled by his past.  The group minus Kakeru gets together again, where Asuza wonders how those he hasn't told yet should help him if he doesn't want to tell them.  Suwa tries to get Kakeru fired up by suggesting he might start asking her out, Kakeru responds that he would be ok with that, and cites that moving away might be a reality and he wouldn't want to hurt Naho.  The closing scene has Kakeru doubting himself and how he responded verbally to Suwa when his actions show otherwise.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Letter 10\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 10\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1910}})\n| DirectedBy      = Takanori Yano\n| WrittenBy       = Ayumu Hisao\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|4}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep10\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/10.html|title=Episode 10: \"LETTER 10\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Kakeru's friends notice something is amiss because of the way he is acting.  Hagita's future self noticed that Kakeru had injured himself during the Pole-Toppling game.  Hagita, Asuza, Suwa, and Takako eventually catch up to Naho and Kakeru, whom were sent on an errand by a teacher.  They confront Kakeru about why he is down during the meet when they had hoped it would be a happier time for him, hoping that he might open up to them about some of what is bothering him.  Kakeru eventually caves about his mother being gone, and how he is unsure if he should be having fun without her.  Together, they help Kakeru realize that there are people that care for him all around him, and that it's ok to be true to his own feelings, good or bad.  Kakeru gets his ankle treated while the rest of the group finish the errand, and all six compete in the race.  After the race, Kakeru's grandmother talks about how he wasn't smiling much after she divorced his father as a kid, until he managed to finish first in the final race of the meet.  His grandmother said that she was so happy when he finally smiled back then, and that she was probably happy right now that he was able to smile again.  Meanwhile, Naho thinks about the letter, and how they have diverted from both the mistake and the suggested alternative that her future self suggested.  Naho and Kakeru meet at the conclusion of the race, where Kakeru manages to take a reward he was promised for winning the race.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| Title           = Letter 11\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 11\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1911}})\n| DirectedBy      = Hideki Tonokatsu\n| WrittenBy       = Mariko Kunisawa\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|11}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep11\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/11.html|title=Episode 11: \"LETTER 11\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The group each takes one photo that was taken by Suwa's father.  The story shifts to the future group, where Suwa hopes that Kakeru is ok with him stealing his girl.  They begin to each question what they could've done differently, but it hits Suwa the hardest as he was the only one who really knew how both sides felt.  Naho comments about how she still would've married him, citing how happy she was when she got his confession in high school.  The date of the confession was New Year's Eve.  Shifting back to the present, Suwa suggests that they spend New Year's Eve as a group, but Suwa doesn't want to go.  Takako then alerts him to what she receives from her future self, and asks him if he really wants to let go of his chance to be with Naho so easily.  The episode shifts back to a class discussion about parallel worlds which explains a lot about how the future will stay the same regardless of their decisions.  He will still always marry Naho in that world, but in this world he wants to make a choice to support Kakeru and Naho.  Kakeru couldn't make the Christmas date because of his grandmother being sick.  The future letter wanted Kakeru to stay with her on New Years despite his grandmothers condition, and he refused to do so.  She tries to get him to stay because they meet his grandmother in the letter too, meaning she lives through in that future.  This leads to Naho making the same mistake, and the fight happens again.  After encouragement from the group, Suwa meets up with Naho and says he will support them no matter what, but remains firm to not confessing his love for Naho.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| Title           = Letter 12\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 12\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1912}})\n| DirectedBy      = Nobuo Tomizawa\n| WrittenBy       = Ayumu Hisao\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|18}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep12\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/12.html|title=Episode 12: \"LETTER 12\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the story of Kakeru moving to the area, and covers the day of his mother's suicide, and some of the events that led to his eventual suicide in the future timeline.  While most of the details are hashed out in notes from the future, the end of the flashback of the future timeline shows when Kakeru found his mothers phone and the unsent message that he never received from her.  He learns things that he didn't know about her situation, including his father's violent past that led to the divorce that he blamed his mother for.  It allows him to gain resolve needed to commit suicide to be with his mother again.  After a brief visit to Naho's future timeline, the story resumes in the present.  Naho read in the letter that she never was able to talk the same way with Kakeru again, and she makes a point to apologize to him for what happened on New Years, which her future self was never able to accomplish.  While she does accomplish this goal, there is still a rift between the two that she can't seem to get through.  The future selves of the 5 group members meet at the designated spot, where they lament inviting Kakeru to go with them on that day.  They discuss that a researcher believes that there is a black hole in the same location as the Bermuda Triangle, and they decide to send letters out to see in hopes of reaching their past selves.  The episode concludes with Naho telling Kakeru to wait until valentines day.  Her thoughts suggest that she remains committed to seeing him through his troubles, regardless of whether or not he likes her or hates her.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| Title           = Last Letter\n| AltTitle        = Saigo no Tegami\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u624b\u7d19}})\n| DirectedBy      = Keiko Oyamada\n| WrittenBy       = Y\u016bko Kakihara\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|25}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep13\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/13.html|title=Episode 13: \"LAST LETTER\"|accessdate=September 25, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Leading up to Kakeru's final day, Naho struggles with being able to deliver her chocolate to Kakeru.  The future letter outlines the four different chances that she will have, but the first three times she missed her opportunity.  Her last chance she has Kakeru leaves earlier than anticipated, and she hurries to catch up.  On the way there, she collides with Ueda and drops the chocolate and it gets stepped on.  This does not change her resolve to chasing after Kakeru.  She meets him in the locker room, where he attempts to decline receiving the chocolate.  She confronts him about avoiding her, and he suggests that he felt like he hurt her on New Years Day.  She delivers the message sent by text in the future \"I'm not hurt\".  Furthermore, she expresses her commitment to Kakeru regardless of fights that occur, and apologizes again to Kakeru. He admits that he was trying to distance himself because he didn't want to hurt her anymore.  He admits every time she wanted to be with him, it made him happy, and that he struggled to keep his distance.  She finally expresses her desire to go out with him on a date, and reminds him that if she asked him if he would go out on a date he'd do it.  Despite his attempts to avoid Naho and the date, she eventually gets her point across that she is ok with all of his faults, and embraces him in a hug.  After a brief scene, he requests the chocolate that Naho has behind her back still, and the rest of the group onlooking cheers them on in much the same way they stood up for Ueda earlier on.  Kakeru's last day in the future timeline finally occurs.  Each member of the group gives Kakeru gifts in attempt to lift his spirits as high as possible.  Naho provides him a lunch for the first time since the Ueda issue a months earlier.  Kakeru even turns down the walk home, suggesting he is going to the hospital with his grandma (this was something he had refused the opportunity to do in the future timeline).\n\nSmall changes occur throughout the episode that differ from the letters, but the group is still worried about 8pm that night.  The future group talks about the paradox that would occur if the timelines were connected, and further convince themselves that they have said goodbye to Kakeru for the final time in their own time.  But they are satisfied with sending the letters knowing that if there are parallel timelines that they save him, that it is more than worth it to them to try it.  The present timeline returns, and Kakeru looks at his mother's phone in the current timeline just like future timeline.  This was the event that pushed him to commit suicide previously.  While he lasts beyond the 8pm timeline that the even occurred in the past, he makes the same effort to take his own life again, walking in-front of an oncoming truck.  However, this time he couldn't bring himself to do it and got out of the way at the last moment, citing that friendship made him reconsider.  Specifically, the friends he had made had led him to consider their feelings as well.  The group all shows him the letters that they received from the future, and suggest that they had attempted to make amends for previous mistakes.  They also provide letters from their future for him to read.  In the end, Suwa tells him it's his fault for trying to die and that he won't forgive him if he does, and then apologizes for inviting him to join them during the opening ceremony.  All of the friends embrace.  Afterward, they walk back and learn that someone vandalized his bike (Hagita...), which is why he walked instead and was late.  He writes a letter to his future self for the capsule that differs from the future timeline, and occurs on a day beyond when he otherwise would be living in the future timeline.  The group takes the time to put together a time capsule in much the same way they had earlier in the future's timeline.  This breaks the chain of events, and the future world suggests that they will ensure it never happens as they will always be there for Kakeru.\n}}\n|}\n\n===Film===\nAn [[anime]] theatrical film, titled {{nihongo|''Orange: Future''|\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8 -\u672a\u6765-|Orenji -Mirai-}}, was announced at the end of the television anime's final episode.

Her future self asks her to prevent her \"biggest regrets\", which has something to do with the new transfer student from [[Tokyo]], a boy named Kakeru Naruse. At first skeptical, Naho begins to believe the letters as they accurately predict events. When the letter asks her not to invite Kakeru to go out for the first day, Naho and her friends (Hiroto Suwa, Takako Chino, Saku Hagita and Azusa Murasaka) decide to invite him anyway. Kakeru ends up not attending school for the next two weeks.\n\nTo prevent another mistake, Naho resolves to do what the letters order her to do, such as volunteering on a [[softball]] round, encouraging Kakeru to join the [[soccer]] team, objecting to him pursuing a relationship with an upperclassman, and insisting that the two watch the fireworks alone. Naho learns from the letters that in the future Kakeru is dead, having died by [[suicide]] around [[Valentine's Day]] in the same school year in which he enrolled.\n\nDuring the [[Bon Festival]], Kakeru explains to Naho the reason for his absence: his mother died by suicide because of a mental breakdown caused by him leaving her for friends, and not taking her to the hospital on the day of enrollment as he promised. This causes Naho to also feel guilty, as she feels they share responsibility for Kakeru's mother's death. Later on, Suwa tells Naho that he has also received letters from his future self, asking him to be a good friend to Kakeru and save him from his death. Suwa hides the fact that he and Naho are married and have a child in the future, as he realizes Naho and Kakeru are in love. Although he has feelings for Naho, his future self realizes by saving Kakeru, he is giving up a future with Naho. Because he knows of their feelings, he listens to the letters and supports them as much as possible.  Later, Azusa, and Hagita, and Chino admit they have received similar letters. They all agree that though they may not be able to change the fate of their future selves, they may create a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] where Kakeru is still alive.\n\nTo cheer up Kakeru, the five friends organize a celebration for his 17th birthday, in which Kakeru confesses his feelings to a surprised Naho. The five also join the relay race team to back Kakeru. With his friends' encouragement, Kakeru wins the race. As his reward for winning the race, Kakeru kisses Naho. However, on [[New Year's Eve]], Naho and Kakeru argue over the latter's grandmother's health. The two become distant over the following weeks, up until the day that Kakeru is supposed to die by suicide, as Naho manages to confess her feelings as well as telling Kakeru to share his plan for suicide.\n\nOn the night of Kakeru's supposed death, the friends' plan to meet up is interrupted as Kakeru does not arrive on time. The five search throughout Matsumoto and manage to stop him from getting hit by a truck. Kakeru apologizes, telling them that he had been thinking of suicide, but at the last second decided not to after realizing that doing so would mean that he would never see his friends again.\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Naho Takamiya|\u9ad8\u5bae\u83dc\u7a42|Takamiya Naho}} \n:{{Voiced by|[[Kana Hanazawa]]|Jill Harris}}<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.funimation.com/blog/2016/10/18/fall-2016-simuldub-english-cast-announcements-for-the-love-of-dubs/|title=Fall 2016 SimulDub\u2122 English Cast Announcements \u2013 For The Love of Dubs - Funimation \u2013 Blog!|website=www.funimation.com|access-date=2016-11-10}}</ref>\n:A high school girl who receives a letter from herself ten years in the future, informing herself that she will meet a guy named Kakeru who she must keep an eye on.

Naho begins her story about the moments that she regrets in her life and decides to tell her 16 year old counterpart how to deal with her misfortunes. 10 years earlier, Naho wakes up late and receives a letter, which comes from her adult self. She reads the first page of the letter at school which accurately tells her that she was late that day. It also says that a transfer student will sit next to her, and it happens. Kakeru Naruse introduces himself and sits next to Naho. As the class dismisses early, Naho and her friends decide to take a stroll, get acquainted and make friends with Kakeru. At night, Naho reads the letter again and notices the similarity between her writing and contents of her diary and the letter. The following day, Naho notices Kakeru's absence. In PE class, she reads the letter saying that she regrets not joining in the softball game. A returning Kakeru chats with Naho regarding joining a sports club and her injured foot due to the size of her shoe. At the softball game, Naho's teammates invite her to play and she is hesitant at first. But because of the letter and a little inspiration from Kakeru, she stands up and plays as the batter in their softball game. Naho hits a home run, winning the game. Their class also emerges as champion because Suwa wins the boys' football game. Naho now completely believes that the contents of the letter are real and will happen, and as she reads the next pages, it reveals that Kakeru will die. The letter asks Naho for a favour: that she must watch closely over Kakeru.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| Title           = Letter 02\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 02\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1902}})\n| DirectedBy      = Takayuki Kuriyama\n| WrittenBy       = Y\u016bko Kakihara\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|7|11}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep2\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/02.html|title=Episode 2: \"LETTER 02\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Naho continues reading the letter, learning that Kakeru will die soon.

After school, Kakeru notices Naho's bag which contains the bento meant for him. However, Naho rudely dismisses Kakeru, but later apologizes. Kakeru decides to accompany and take a stroll in the park with Naho, during which he explains his 2-week long absence to her. He reveals that his mother had committed suicide on the first day of class, and Naho realizes that was the day she and her friends asked him to hang out with them instead of going home. To comfort Kakeru, Naho finally gives him the bento she made and Kakeru smiles. Afterwards, Naho decides that she will protect Kakeru and make sure that he is happy.

Naho continues to realize that there are discrepancies between her world and the letter she received from the future (as her letter tells her that all 6 friends will go out together but it ends up being just her and Kakeru, as everyone else cites various reasons that they cannot join). While overlooking the city, Kakeru uses this opportunity to present Naho with a hairpin as thanks for the bentos she makes for him. He also invites her out during the weekend to the library to study. With Naho's help, Kakeru receives the highest score in the chemistry test. Their Science teacher gives a short exposition on the concept of time travel and the theory of alternate / parallel universes. Naho suddenly realizes that the letter hasn't changed despite her present changing, probably due to the fact that she has perhaps created a new timeline with the choices she has made. She is devastated to think that despite everything she has done, nothing will change for her future self. As the world has changed, an event where Kakeru asks Naho to watch the fireworks alone together at the end of their school festival is never triggered. Naho then forces herself to ask Kakeru to watch the fireworks with her. Kakeru asks Suwa for permission to see the fireworks alone with Naho as he and the others are aware that Suwa actually likes Naho. Suwa however, has made up his mind to support Kakeru and Naho instead. During the school festival, Naho is ambushed by Ueda and her lackeys who bully her into showing the hairpin that Kakeru bought for her, but she is saved by Suwa who shows up and takes her back to their friends at the pool. She later thanks Suwa for everything that he has ever done for her, as her letter tells her to never take his kindness and friendship for granted. The letter reveals that in the future, Suwa was the one who \"saved her heart\".\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = Letter 06\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 06\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1906}})\n| DirectedBy      = Taku Yamada\n| WrittenBy       = Mariko Kunisawa\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|8|8}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep6\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/06.html|title=Episode 6: \"LETTER 06\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = In the evening Kakeru asks Naho to meet at the pool as he wants to talk with Suwa, who persuades Kakeru to go and make Naho happy.

In the present, the 6 friends decide to meet at the Matsumoto bon festival a few days later but Naho and Kakeru find themselves alone when the other four pretend to be late. While visiting a shrine, Kakeru lets slip that he asked God to pass on a message to his mother. As her letter tells her to try to get Kakeru to open up about his mother, Naho finally manages to force Kakeru to reveal that he believes his mother's death was his fault, that his refusal to go with her to the hospital on the day of the opening ceremony led her to commit suicide. Naho is unable to comfort him and is upset as she doesn't know what to do. She is visited by Suwa the next day and decides that she can't save Kakeru on her own.

Along with Suwa, they make sure not to force him to run in the race initially, and he concedes that he is in fact nervous that he might fall and lose the race for the team.  Prior to alerting his class about his decision, Asuza and Takako pressure Suwa into talking to them, feeling that he is hiding something from them.  The entire group of friends each elect to volunteer for roles in the race, and Kakeru decides that he will run the race with his friends.  After school, Suwa and Naho discuss their decision to go against the letters suggested path, and Naho builds the resolve to put her letter away and go off of what she feels Kakeru wants in her heart more than what her future self seems to think.  The next day, Hagita asks Asuza to hang out with him after school.  Kakeru also asks Naho to walk to the school gates with him.  In the locker room however, she trips and falls into Kakeru's arms, and is too embarrassed or unsure to accept his efforts to hold her hand.  The same issue repeats the next day, and in both cases Kakeru excuses himself.  Naho is confronted by everyone else in the group, and Asuza and Takako both reveal their letters.  Furthermore they suggest that Kakeru may not have anything wrong with him other than the rejections felt from not getting to hold Naho's hand.  Hagita is pushed into also revealing his letter by Asuza, confirming that everyone has received letters from the future.  Together, they strengthen their resolve to save their friend.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 9\n| Title           = Letter 09\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 09\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1909}})\n| DirectedBy      = Hideki Tonokatsu <br/> Keiko Oyamada\n| WrittenBy       = Mariko Kunisawa\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|8|29}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep9\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/09.html|title=Episode 9: \"LETTER 09\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Everyone except for Kakeru continue to discuss their support for Naho, saying the only way they feel that Kakeru will truly be happy is if he is with her.  Naho begins making a more conscious effort to do what she feels she needs to do to improve upon the relationship.  After school, the group meets up to discuss their efforts to make it all work out, but when Kakeru asks they cover it up and suggest they are deciding on the race order.  Asuza begins to look into her letter from her present day self, and discovers that her birthday will fall on a rainy day.  The umbrella she receives as a gift from Hagita she lends to Kakeru when he asks Naho to let him walk under hers, and her present day self wonders what would've happened if she hadn't.  Despite the sunny forecast, everyone but Kakeru now feature an umbrella, unlike Asuza's present recollection of just Naho and Asuza having one.  In the end, Naho and Kakeru use Naho's umbrella and walk home, and eventually leads to holding one another hands.  Kakeru gets closer to Naho, but when he says suggests that he would like to be able to go out with her on a date, that he will wait for her to want to do so.  Naho is unable to say this yet.  The scene shifts nine days forward to the day of the athletic meet, where Naho reads her letter from her future self once more.  She learns that Kakeru is unable to tell the rest of the group about his mother.  Suwa decides to ask his parents to invite Kakeru's grandmother along to the meet and offer her a ride, which improves Kakeru's spirits at the time.  During the group photo however, he begins to think about his mother again, and still seems to be troubled by his past.  The group minus Kakeru gets together again, where Asuza wonders how those he hasn't told yet should help him if he doesn't want to tell them.  Suwa tries to get Kakeru fired up by suggesting he might start asking her out, Kakeru responds that he would be ok with that, and cites that moving away might be a reality and he wouldn't want to hurt Naho.  The closing scene has Kakeru doubting himself and how he responded verbally to Suwa when his actions show otherwise.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 10\n| Title           = Letter 10\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 10\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1910}})\n| DirectedBy      = Takanori Yano\n| WrittenBy       = Ayumu Hisao\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|4}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep10\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/10.html|title=Episode 10: \"LETTER 10\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Kakeru's friends notice something is amiss because of the way he is acting.  Hagita's future self noticed that Kakeru had injured himself during the Pole-Toppling game.  Hagita, Asuza, Suwa, and Takako eventually catch up to Naho and Kakeru, whom were sent on an errand by a teacher.  They confront Kakeru about why he is down during the meet when they had hoped it would be a happier time for him, hoping that he might open up to them about some of what is bothering him.  Kakeru eventually caves about his mother being gone, and how he is unsure if he should be having fun without her.  Together, they help Kakeru realize that there are people that care for him all around him, and that it's ok to be true to his own feelings, good or bad.  Kakeru gets his ankle treated while the rest of the group finish the errand, and all six compete in the race.  After the race, Kakeru's grandmother talks about how he wasn't smiling much after she divorced his father as a kid, until he managed to finish first in the final race of the meet.  His grandmother said that she was so happy when he finally smiled back then, and that she was probably happy right now that he was able to smile again.  Meanwhile, Naho thinks about the letter, and how they have diverted from both the mistake and the suggested alternative that her future self suggested.  Naho and Kakeru meet at the conclusion of the race, where Kakeru manages to take a reward he was promised for winning the race.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 11\n| Title           = Letter 11\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 11\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1911}})\n| DirectedBy      = Hideki Tonokatsu\n| WrittenBy       = Mariko Kunisawa\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|11}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep11\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/11.html|title=Episode 11: \"LETTER 11\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The group each takes one photo that was taken by Suwa's father.  The story shifts to the future group, where Suwa hopes that Kakeru is ok with him stealing his girl.  They begin to each question what they could've done differently, but it hits Suwa the hardest as he was the only one who really knew how both sides felt.  Naho comments about how she still would've married him, citing how happy she was when she got his confession in high school.  The date of the confession was New Year's Eve.  Shifting back to the present, Suwa suggests that they spend New Year's Eve as a group, but Suwa doesn't want to go.  Takako then alerts him to what she receives from her future self, and asks him if he really wants to let go of his chance to be with Naho so easily.  The episode shifts back to a class discussion about parallel worlds which explains a lot about how the future will stay the same regardless of their decisions.  He will still always marry Naho in that world, but in this world he wants to make a choice to support Kakeru and Naho.  Kakeru couldn't make the Christmas date because of his grandmother being sick.  The future letter wanted Kakeru to stay with her on New Years despite his grandmothers condition, and he refused to do so.  She tries to get him to stay because they meet his grandmother in the letter too, meaning she lives through in that future.  This leads to Naho making the same mistake, and the fight happens again.  After encouragement from the group, Suwa meets up with Naho and says he will support them no matter what, but remains firm to not confessing his love for Naho.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| Title           = Letter 12\n| AltTitle        = Tegami 12\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u624b\u7d1912}})\n| DirectedBy      = Nobuo Tomizawa\n| WrittenBy       = Ayumu Hisao\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|18}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep12\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/12.html|title=Episode 12: \"LETTER 12\"|accessdate=September 21, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = The episode begins with the story of Kakeru moving to the area, and covers the day of his mother's suicide, and some of the events that led to his eventual suicide in the future timeline.  While most of the details are hashed out in notes from the future, the end of the flashback of the future timeline shows when Kakeru found his mothers phone and the unsent message that he never received from her.  He learns things that he didn't know about her situation, including his father's violent past that led to the divorce that he blamed his mother for.  It allows him to gain resolve needed to commit suicide to be with his mother again.  After a brief visit to Naho's future timeline, the story resumes in the present.  Naho read in the letter that she never was able to talk the same way with Kakeru again, and she makes a point to apologize to him for what happened on New Years, which her future self was never able to accomplish.  While she does accomplish this goal, there is still a rift between the two that she can't seem to get through.  The future selves of the 5 group members meet at the designated spot, where they lament inviting Kakeru to go with them on that day.  They discuss that a researcher believes that there is a black hole in the same location as the Bermuda Triangle, and they decide to send letters out to see in hopes of reaching their past selves.  The episode concludes with Naho telling Kakeru to wait until valentines day.  Her thoughts suggest that she remains committed to seeing him through his troubles, regardless of whether or not he likes her or hates her.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 13\n| Title           = Last Letter\n| AltTitle        = Saigo no Tegami\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u6700\u5f8c\u306e\u624b\u7d19}})\n| DirectedBy      = Keiko Oyamada\n| WrittenBy       = Y\u016bko Kakihara\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|9|25}}\n| Aux4            = <ref name=\"Ep13\">{{cite web|url=http://orange-anime.com/story/13.html|title=Episode 13: \"LAST LETTER\"|accessdate=September 25, 2016|language=Japanese}}</ref>\n| ShortSummary    = Leading up to Kakeru's final day, Naho struggles with being able to deliver her chocolate to Kakeru.  The future letter outlines the four different chances that she will have, but the first three times she missed her opportunity.  Her last chance she has Kakeru leaves earlier than anticipated, and she hurries to catch up.  On the way there, she collides with Ueda and drops the chocolate and it gets stepped on.  This does not change her resolve to chasing after Kakeru.  She meets him in the locker room, where he attempts to decline receiving the chocolate.  She confronts him about avoiding her, and he suggests that he felt like he hurt her on New Years Day.  She delivers the message sent by text in the future \"I'm not hurt\".  Furthermore, she expresses her commitment to Kakeru regardless of fights that occur, and apologizes again to Kakeru. He admits that he was trying to distance himself because he didn't want to hurt her anymore.  He admits every time she wanted to be with him, it made him happy, and that he struggled to keep his distance.  She finally expresses her desire to go out with him on a date, and reminds him that if she asked him if he would go out on a date he'd do it.  Despite his attempts to avoid Naho and the date, she eventually gets her point across that she is ok with all of his faults, and embraces him in a hug.  After a brief scene, he requests the chocolate that Naho has behind her back still, and the rest of the group onlooking cheers them on in much the same way they stood up for Ueda earlier on.  Kakeru's last day in the future timeline finally occurs.  Each member of the group gives Kakeru gifts in attempt to lift his spirits as high as possible.  Naho provides him a lunch for the first time since the Ueda issue a months earlier.  Kakeru even turns down the walk home, suggesting he is going to the hospital with his grandma (this was something he had refused the opportunity to do in the future timeline).\n\nSmall changes occur throughout the episode that differ from the letters, but the group is still worried about 8pm that night.  The future group talks about the paradox that would occur if the timelines were connected, and further convince themselves that they have said goodbye to Kakeru for the final time in their own time.  But they are satisfied with sending the letters knowing that if there are parallel timelines that they save him, that it is more than worth it to them to try it.  The present timeline returns, and Kakeru looks at his mother's phone in the current timeline just like future timeline.  This was the event that pushed him to commit suicide previously.  While he lasts beyond the 8pm timeline that the even occurred in the past, he makes the same effort to take his own life again, walking in-front of an oncoming truck.  However, this time he couldn't bring himself to do it and got out of the way at the last moment, citing that friendship made him reconsider.  Specifically, the friends he had made had led him to consider their feelings as well.  The group all shows him the letters that they received from the future, and suggest that they had attempted to make amends for previous mistakes.  They also provide letters from their future for him to read.  In the end, Suwa tells him it's his fault for trying to die and that he won't forgive him if he does, and then apologizes for inviting him to join them during the opening ceremony.  All of the friends embrace.  Afterward, they walk back and learn that someone vandalized his bike (Hagita...), which is why he walked instead and was late.  He writes a letter to his future self for the capsule that differs from the future timeline, and occurs on a day beyond when he otherwise would be living in the future timeline.  The group takes the time to put together a time capsule in much the same way they had earlier in the future's timeline.  This breaks the chain of events, and the future world suggests that they will ensure it never happens as they will always be there for Kakeru.\n}}\n|}\n\n===Film===\nAn [[anime]] theatrical film, titled {{nihongo|''Orange: Future''|\u30aa\u30ec\u30f3\u30b8 -\u672a\u6765-|Orenji -Mirai-}}, was announced at the end of the television anime's final episode.

It opened in 1969, and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]]. The hall was used for concerts, dance and entertainment events, as well as conferences and congresses. After several years of reconstruction, including the installation of a new concert hall, it reopened in April 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|last=J\u00fcrgen Tietz|url=https://www.nzz.ch/feuilleton/dresdens-neuer-konzertsaal-spaete-harmonien-ld.1289905|title=Sp\u00e4te Harmonien {{!}} NZZ|work=Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung|access-date=2020-03-14|language=de}}</ref>\n\nThe building is, however, not in the unadorned [[International Style (architecture)|international style]] unlike the other buildings on the \"Altmarkt\" square. It is a stand-alone building with a floor area of around 700 meters squared. It forms the second part of the \"Altmarkt\" square, and faces Wilsdruffer Strasse.  Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt,]] which has been undergoing a reconstruction project since 2005, it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the [[firebombing of Dresden]] on 13 February 1945. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the Kulturpalast was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were then to be implemented in the GDR. Important principles were: a central square, cityscape-forming high-rise buildings and wide main roads. The Kulturpalast was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was a planned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on [[Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe]] but they were never built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate the Kulturpalast's fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", colloquially known as ''Kulti'', it fulfils the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture. Afterward the house was closed and completely cleared out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dnn.de|title=Letzte Vorstellung im Dresdner Kulturpalast \u2013 Proteste gegen Umbau halten an.|last=|first=|date=2012-07-23|website=|language=de|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-12-13}}</ref>\n\n== Building ==\n[[File:Weg der Roten Fahne.jpg|thumb|Wall painting ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag)]]\n\n=== Until 2012 ===\nBefore 2012, the multi-functional ballroom with up to 2435 seats (formerly 2740) could be transformed into an auditorium completely furnished with fixed rows of seats and elevation or into a banquet hall with a flat floor in the area of the parquet in front of the stage thanks to the special \"tilting parquet\".\n\nThe banquet hall was optimized for multi-functionality in its room acoustics and had been adapted for use as a concert hall or for electronically amplified music or speech events through variable absorption or reflection surfaces.\n\nIn addition to the large hall, the Kulturpalast had a studio theatre with 192 seats, seminar, rehearsal and performance rooms, foyer levels, office wings and a restaurant with conference facilities.\n\nOutwardly, the ballroom is distinguished by the roof, which protrudes from the cuboid base structure and has the base area of a symmetrical trapezoid.\n\n=== Wall Painting ===\n[[File:Der Weg der roten Fahne-Inschriften.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the wall painting]]\nThe 30 meter by 10.5 meter mural ''Der Weg der [[Red flag (politics)|Roten Fahne]]'' (The way of the red flag) on the west side of the building has been designated a cultural monument since 2001. In 1968 Gerhard Bondzin was commissioned to develop the designs. The mural was realized until 1969 by a working group of the [[Dresden Academy of Fine Arts]]. The working title was: \u201e1849 - 1969: 120 Jahre Kampf der revolution\u00e4ren Kr\u00e4fte der Stadt f\u00fcr Fortschritt und Sozialismus\u201c (1849 - 1969: 120 years of struggle of the revolutionary forces of the city for progress and socialism).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saechsische.de/der-weg-der-roten-fahne-haelt-fuer-die-ewigkeit-2658892.html|title=\"Der Weg der roten Fahne\" h\u00e4lt f\u00fcr die Ewigkeit|website=www.saechsische.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> In addition to Bondzin (artistic director), the artists' collective included Alfred Hesse (participation in transmission work), Gerhard Stengel (artistic technology), Gerhard Pr\u00e4kelt (architect), Emil Spiess (study organization), Martin H\u00e4nisch (type design), Wolfgang Richter (specialist instructor) and students in the 3rd and 4th year of the mural design course.

The fountains were later removed in the course of the construction work for the underground car park at Altmarkt. These were [[terrazzo]] pools measuring 7.90 by 8.55 metres.

The studio stage, seminar rooms and other used areas of the Kulturpalast were to be redesigned as the venue for the Herkuleskeule (Leg of Hercules) and the library operations of the Municipal Library. In addition to cost savings, this was intended to achieve an all-day opening and use of the building by different age and interest groups.\n\n=== Architecture competition ===\nTo achieve the conversion, the state capital announced an architectural competition in which the office of [[Gerkan, Marg and Partners|Gerkan, Marg and Partner]] won the first prize unanimously and with recommendation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dresden.de/de/rathaus/aktuelles/pressemitteilungen/archiv/2009/06/pm_110.php|title=Jury ermittelte Siegerentwurf zum Kulturpalastumbau|last=Dresden|website=www.dresden.de|language=de|access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref> The design envisaged a pure concert hall in the shape of a [[vineyard]] (similar to the hall of the [[Gewandhaus]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany), which should offer good conditions for the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\n=== Reopening 2017 ===\nAfter reconstruction and renovation, the Kulturpalast was reopened on April 28, 2017, with a festive concert by the Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2017-05-03|title=Ein zauberischer Dunst|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/|journal=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]|volume=|pages=12|via=}}</ref> The old festival hall was converted into the new concert hall with a reduced capacity of up to 1800 seats. Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at a time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose.

It opened in 1969, and had the largest multi-purpose hall in the city of [[Dresden]] [[Germany]]. The hall was used for concerts, dance and entertainment events, as well as conferences and congresses.

Is it stand-alone building with a floor area of around 700 meters squared, and it forms the second part of the \"Altmarkt\" square as well as facing Wilsdruffer Strasse, which cuts between them. Located east of Schlo\u00dfstra\u00dfe and southwest of nearby [[Neumarkt (Dresden)|Neumarkt,]] which has been undergoing a reconstruction project since 2005, it lies in the centre of the historic old town, which was largely destroyed during the [[firebombing of Dresden]] on 13 February 1945. \n\n== History ==\n[[File:19670211 Baustelle Kulturpalast, Frauenkirche.jpg|thumb|Foundations of the Kulturpalast (1967)]]\n\n=== Planning and construction ===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1985-0918-026, Dresden, Kulturpalast.jpg|thumb|Kulturpalast (1985)]]\nOriginally, the Kulturpalast was planned as a socialist-classicist ensemble building. After further planning, the intention was to erect a high-rise building in the style of the [[Seven Sisters (Moscow)|seven Moscow sister high-rise buildings]]. Following the \"[[The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design|16 Principles of Urban Development\"]] and the GDR's construction law in 1950, the principles of socialist urban development were then to be implemented in the GDR. Important principles were: a central square, cityscape-forming high-rise buildings and wide main roads. The Kulturpalast was originally intended to take over this function of the dominant high ground. However, the project was not realized in the 1950s.\n\nThe Kulturpalast was released in the 1960s as the cultural centre of the city and [[Bezirk Dresden|district of Dresden]]. It was also known as a cuboid building with an eaves of 19.35 m, based on the architectural planning of Leopold Wiel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de/|title=Index@www.Kulturpalast-Dresden-Erhalten.de|website=www.kulturpalast-dresden-erhalten.de|access-date=2020-03-14}}</ref> Initially there was a planned third floor and a grandstand for the parades on [[Ernst-Th\u00e4lmann-Stra\u00dfe]] but they were never built.\n\n=== Fire protection refurbishment 2007 ===\nDue to improperly carried out reconstruction work in the 1990s, it became necessary to renovate the Kulturpalast's fire protection equipment, which required a five-month closure from 19 March 2007. In the weeks before the renovation work began, fire engines were positioned directly next to the Palace of Culture during events.\n\n=== Last years before the renovation ===\nSince 2008, the Kulturpalast has been a listed building. The \"Palast\", colloquially known as ''Kulti'', it fulfils the functions of a town hall and has an important function in the cultural life of the city. It is operated by the ''Konzert- und Kongressgesellschaft mbH Dresden''. The main user is the [[Dresden Philharmonic|Dresden Philharmonic Orchestra]].\n\nEvery year it served as the main venue for the [[Internationales Dixieland Festival Dresden|Dixieland Festival]]. In 2011, it was used as an organization centre, main information and venue for the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]].\n\nOn July 23, 2012, ''Das Br\u00fcckenm\u00e4nnchen l\u00e4dt ein \u2013 Der kleine Vampir'' (The Bridge Manikin Invites - The Little Vampire) was the last performance before the reconstruction of the Palace of Culture.

Thus, the Dresden Philharmonic has regained its traditional venue. The new concert hall is also used by international orchestras for concerts. Its acoustics are praised by musicians, audiences and press alike.\n\nIn addition, the Dresden Municipal Libraries (Central Library) and the Dresden cabaret \"Die Herkuleskeuleule\" have now also found their new home here. This means that the building can be opened and used all day long.\n\nThe problem of an adequate multifunctional hall was not addressed or solved in this context but remains open (as of 2017).\n\n== Organ ==\n=== Jehmlich-Organ from 1970 ===\nThe [[Jehmlich Orgelbau Dresden|Jehmlich company]] installed an organ in the Great Hall as Opus 905 in 1970. A pipe organ in a large state cultural institution was still something special at a time when the socialist cultural policy was slow to open up to music with organ parts.\n\nThe instrument had 24 [[Organ stop|stops]] distributed over two [[Manual (music)|manuals]] and [[Pedal keyboard|pedal]]. The disposition corresponding to a universal organ was developed in cooperation with the Dresden organ scientist Prof. Frank-Harald Gre\u00df. The organ with the dimensions (W \u00d7 H \u00d7 D) 7.4 m \u00d7 7.4 m \u00d7 1.5 m stood on a mobile steel frame on which it could be pushed onto the stage on rails specially laid for this purpose. However, this mobility and the shortage of money set clear limits to the size of the organ, which at that time had a very modest capacity for a hall with well over 2000 seats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jehmlich-orgelbau.de/orgelprojekte/cottbus-propsteikirche/|title=Cottbus, Kath.

Legend states that one of the prisoners condemned to death, walked his final miles singing of how much he loved his country, and how much he hated to say goodbye to it.
