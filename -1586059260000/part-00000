The IRIS mission will accomplish this by tracing the flow of energy and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] into the [[solar corona|corona]] using [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry|spectrometry]] and imaging. IRIS is designed to provide significant new information to increase the understanding of [[Solar transition region|energy transport]] into the corona and [[solar wind]] and provide an archetype for all stellar [[atmosphere]]s. The unique instrument capabilities, coupled with state of the art 3-D modeling, will fill a large gap in our knowledge of this dynamic region of the solar atmosphere. The mission will extend the scientific output of existing heliophysics spacecraft that follow the effects of energy release processes from the sun to Earth.

Such information improves our understanding of the fundamental processes that are involved in generating solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These super-energetic solar eruptive events are the most extreme drivers of space weather and present significant dangers in space and on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Missions \u2013 RHESII \u2013 NASA Science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/rhessi/|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601145541/http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/rhessi/|archive-date=2013-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Solar Dynamics Observatory===\n\nNASA's [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) mission was launched in 2010 and is currently studying solar activity and how it causes [[space weather]]. Space weather affects not only our lives on Earth, but Earth itself, and everything outside its atmosphere ([[astronaut]]s and [[satellite]]s out in space and even the other [[planet]]s). SDO is helping us understand where the sun's energy comes from, how the inside of the sun works, and how energy is stored and released in the sun's atmosphere. By better understanding the sun and how it works, we will be able to better predict and better forecast space weather events.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/releases/2013/13-002.html Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission]. NASA.\n2013.</ref>\n\n===Solar and Heliospheric Observatory===\n\nA joint ESA/NASA mission, the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]], or SOHO, studies the sun, from deep inside its core to the outer corona and solar wind. SOHO has been capturing images of the dynamic flares and coronal mass ejections on the sun since 1996. The mission has provided an unprecedented breadth and depth of information about the sun, with a unique combination of instruments that study its interior through the hot and dynamic atmosphere to the solar wind and its interaction with the interstellar medium. Its coronagraphs&nbsp;\u2013 images that observe the sun's atmosphere by blocking out the bright sun in the middle&nbsp;\u2013 remain a key component for forecasting the speed, direction and strength of coronal mass ejections as they erupt from the sun. In addition to watching the sun, SOHO has become the most prolific discoverer of comets in astronomical history: as of 2012, over 2000 comets have been found by SOHO.<ref name=SOHO>{{cite web|title=NASA \u2013 SOHO|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/soho/}}</ref>\n\n===STEREO===\n\nThe Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or [[STEREO]], mission employs two nearly identical space-based observatories to provide the stereoscopic measurements to study the sun. With a pair of viewpoints, scientists are able to see the structure and evolution of solar storms as they blast from the sun and travel out through space. STEREO's instruments provide a unique combination of observations to help understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejections and to characterize how they propagate through the Solar System. STEREO also helps determine what powers the acceleration of energetic particles from the sun and provides information on the structure of the solar wind.<ref name=STEREO>{{cite web|title=NASA \u2013 STEREO|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===THEMIS===\n\n[[THEMIS]] answers fundamental questions concerning a type of space weather called a substorm that can abruptly and explosively release solar wind energy stored within Earth's magnetotail. Substorms cause auroras at high latitudes, and THEMIS seeks to understand this process. Originally five spacecraft, THEMIS now consists of three, as two were repurposed to study the moon in the [[ARTEMIS]] mission. The mission also relies on a dedicated array of ground observatories located in Canada and the northern United States.<ref name=THEMIS />\n\n===TIMED===\n\nThe Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, or [[TIMED]], mission  explores Earth's mesosphere and lower thermosphere (40\u201350 miles up), the least explored and understood region of the atmosphere. Solar events, as well as temperature changes in the stratosphere can perturb this region, but the overall structure of and responses to these effects are not understood. Advances in remote sensing technology employed by TIMED enable it to explore this region on a global basis from space.<ref name=TIMED>{{cite web|title=Missions \u2013 TIMED \u2013 NASA Science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/timed/|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601141622/http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/timed/|archive-date=2013-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===TWINS===\n\nThe instruments on the Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers, or [[TWINS]], provide stereo imaging of Earth's magnetosphere\u2014the region surrounding the planet, controlled by Earth's magnetic field and containing the Van Allen radiation belts and other energetic charged particles.

The Voyager spacecraft were built and continue to be operated by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], in Pasadena, Calif. On December 4, 2012,  [[1,000,000,000|eleven billion]] miles from Earth, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a \"magnetic highway\" that connects our [[Solar System]] to [[interstellar space]]. The \"magnetic highway\" is a place in the far reaches of the Solar System where the sun's magnetic field connects to the magnetic field of interstellar space. In this region, the sun's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines, allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in. In recent years, the speed of the solar wind around Voyager 1 has slowed to zero, and the intensity of the magnetic field has increased.<ref name= voy1>This content is in the Public Domain on NASA's website.\n*{{cite web\n | last = Philips\n | first = Tony\n | title = Voyager 1 in a Magnetic Transition Zone\n | website = NASA Science \u2013 Science News\n | publisher = NASA\n | date = December 4, 2012\n | url = http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/03dec_voyager1/\n | format = Full text HTML article\n | doi = \n | accessdate = 2013-06-08\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130516014831/http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/03dec_voyager1/\n | archive-date = May 16, 2013\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\n===Additional Projects===\n\nThe ''Space Physics Data Facility'' (SPDF) is a project of the Heliospheric Science Division (HSD) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

The IRIS mission will accomplish this by tracing the flow of energy and [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] through the [[chromosphere]] and [[solar transition region|transition region]] into the [[corona]] using [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry|spectrometry]] and imaging. IRIS is designed to provide significant new information to increase the understanding of [[Solar transition region|energy transport]] into the corona and [[solar wind]] and provide an archetype for all stellar [[atmosphere]]s. The unique instrument capabilities, coupled with state of the art 3-D modeling, will fill a large gap in our knowledge of this dynamic region of the solar atmosphere. The mission will extend the scientific output of existing heliophysics spacecraft that follow the effects of energy release processes from the sun to Earth.

Such information improves our understanding of the fundamental processes that are involved in generating solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These super-energetic solar eruptive events are the most extreme drivers of space weather and present significant dangers in space and on Earth.<ref>{{cite web|title=Missions \u2013 RHESII \u2013 NASA Science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/rhessi/|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601145541/http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/rhessi/|archive-date=2013-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Solar Dynamics Observatory===\n\nNASA's [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO) mission was launched in 2010 and is currently studying solar activity and how it causes [[space weather]]. Space weather affects not only our lives on Earth, but Earth itself, and everything outside its atmosphere ([[astronaut]]s and [[satellite]]s out in space and even the other [[planet]]s). SDO is helping us understand where the sun's energy comes from, how the inside of the sun works, and how energy is stored and released in the sun's atmosphere. By better understanding the sun and how it works, we will be able to better predict and better forecast space weather events.<ref>[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/releases/2013/13-002.html Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission]. NASA.\n2013.</ref>\n\n===Solar and Heliospheric Observatory===\n\nA joint ESA/NASA mission, the [[Solar and Heliospheric Observatory]], or SOHO, studies the sun, from deep inside its core to the outer corona and solar wind. SOHO has been capturing images of the dynamic flares and coronal mass ejections on the sun since 1996. The mission has provided an unprecedented breadth and depth of information about the sun, with a unique combination of instruments that study its interior through the hot and dynamic atmosphere to the solar wind and its interaction with the interstellar medium. Its coronagraphs&nbsp;\u2013 images that observe the sun's atmosphere by blocking out the bright sun in the middle&nbsp;\u2013 remain a key component for forecasting the speed, direction and strength of coronal mass ejections as they erupt from the sun. In addition to watching the sun, SOHO has become the most prolific discoverer of comets in astronomical history: as of 2012, over 2000 comets have been found by SOHO.<ref name=SOHO>{{cite web|title=NASA \u2013 SOHO|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/soho/}}</ref>\n\n===STEREO===\n\nThe Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or [[STEREO]], mission employs two nearly identical space-based observatories to provide the stereoscopic measurements to study the sun. With a pair of viewpoints, scientists are able to see the structure and evolution of solar storms as they blast from the sun and travel out through space. STEREO's instruments provide a unique combination of observations to help understand the causes and mechanisms of coronal mass ejections and to characterize how they propagate through the Solar System. STEREO also helps determine what powers the acceleration of energetic particles from the sun and provides information on the structure of the solar wind.<ref name=STEREO>{{cite web|title=NASA \u2013 STEREO|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/stereo/main/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===THEMIS===\n\n[[THEMIS]] answers fundamental questions concerning a type of space weather called a substorm that can abruptly and explosively release solar wind energy stored within Earth's magnetotail. Substorms cause auroras at high latitudes, and THEMIS seeks to understand this process. Originally five spacecraft, THEMIS now consists of three, as two were repurposed to study the moon in the [[ARTEMIS]] mission. The mission also relies on a dedicated array of ground observatories located in Canada and the northern United States.<ref name=THEMIS />\n\n===TIMED===\n\nThe Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics, or [[TIMED]], mission  explores Earth's mesosphere and lower thermosphere (40\u201350 miles up), the least explored and understood region of the atmosphere. Solar events, as well as temperature changes in the stratosphere can perturb this region, but the overall structure of and responses to these effects are not understood. Advances in remote sensing technology employed by TIMED enable it to explore this region on a global basis from space.<ref name=TIMED>{{cite web|title=Missions \u2013 TIMED \u2013 NASA Science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/timed/|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601141622/http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/timed/|archive-date=2013-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===TWINS===\n\nThe instruments on the Two Wide-Angle Imaging Neutral-Atom Spectrometers, or [[TWINS]], provide stereo imaging of Earth's magnetosphere\u2014the region surrounding the planet, controlled by Earth's magnetic field and containing the Van Allen radiation belts and other energetic charged particles. TWINS enables three-dimensional global visualization of this region, leading to greatly enhanced understanding of the connections between different areas of the magnetosphere and their relation to the solar wind.<ref name=TWINS>{{cite web|title=Missions \u2013 TWINS A & B \u2013 NASA science|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/twins/|access-date=2013-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130601152119/http://science1.nasa.gov/missions/twins/|archive-date=2013-06-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Van Allen Probes===\n\nThe [[Van Allen Probes]] consist of twin spacecraft studying the extreme and dynamic regions of space known as the Van Allen Radiation Belts that surround Earth. The radiation belts intensify or weaken over time as part of the much larger space weather system driven by the energy and material that erupt off the sun's surface and fill the entire Solar System.<ref name=VAP>{{cite web|title=NASA \u2013 Van Allen Probes|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/rbsp/main/index.html}}</ref>\n\n===Voyager mission===\n\nThe [[Voyager spacecraft|Voyager mission]]s ([[Voyager 1]] and [[Voyager 2]]) are a part of NASA's [[Heliophysics System Observatory]], sponsored by the Heliophysics Division of the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. The Voyager spacecraft were built and continue to be operated by NASA's [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]], in Pasadena, Calif. On December 4, 2012,  [[1,000,000,000|eleven billion]] miles from Earth, NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft has entered a \"magnetic highway\" that connects our [[Solar System]] to [[interstellar space]]. The \"magnetic highway\" is a place in the far reaches of the Solar System where the sun's magnetic field connects to the magnetic field of interstellar space. In this region, the sun's magnetic field lines are connected to interstellar magnetic field lines, allowing particles from inside the heliosphere to zip away and particles from interstellar space to zoom in. In recent years, the speed of the solar wind around Voyager 1 has slowed to zero, and the intensity of the magnetic field has increased.<ref name= voy1>This content is in the Public Domain on NASA's website.\n*{{cite web\n | last = Philips\n | first = Tony\n | title = Voyager 1 in a Magnetic Transition Zone\n | website = NASA Science \u2013 Science News\n | publisher = NASA\n | date = December 4, 2012\n | url = http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/03dec_voyager1/\n | format = Full text HTML article\n | doi = \n | accessdate = 2013-06-08\n | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130516014831/http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2012/03dec_voyager1/\n | archive-date = May 16, 2013\n | url-status = dead\n }}</ref>\n\n===Additional Projects===\n\nThe ''Space Physics Data Facility'' (SPDF) is a project of the Heliospheric Science Division (HSD) at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

(2004) \"Principles and Principlism.\" In: Khushf G. (eds) ''Handbook of Bioethics: Taking Stock of the Field from a Philosophical Perspective''. ''Philosophy and Medicine'', vol 78.

The Commission came into existence on July 12, 1974 when the [[National Research Act]] (Pub. L. 93-348) was signed into law.<ref>Department of Health, E. (2014). \"The Belmont Report. Ethical principles and guidelines for the protection of human subjects of research.\" ''The Journal of the American College of Dentists'', 81(3), 4.</ref> After four years of monthly deliberations, the Commission met in February 1976 for four days at the Smithsonian Institution's Belmont Conference Center which resulted in a statement of three basic ethical principles: autonomy, beneficence, and justice, for biomedical and behavioural research. Second, in the book entitled ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'' (1979), [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James Childress]], stated that the following four ''prima facie'' principles lie at the core of moral reasoning in health care: respect for autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. In the opinion of Beauchamp and Childress, these four principles are part of a \"common morality\"; an approach that \"takes its basic premises directly from the morality shared by the members of society \u2013 that is, unphilosophical common sense and tradition\".<ref>Beauchamp, T. L. and Childress, J. F. (1994) ''Principles of Medical Ethics'', New York: Oxford University Press, page 100</ref> \n[[File:Georgetown campus picture.jpg|thumb|Georgetown campus picture]]\nThe four principles are sometimes referred to as the 'Georgetown Principles' or the 'Georgetown mantra', so-called because both Beauchamp and Childress were based at Georgetown University when the first edition of Principles of Biomedical Ethics was published.\n\nThe principlist approach is derived from normative ethical theories, but it is not aligned to any one single theory. Whilst Beauchamp and Childress<ref name=\"auto\">Beauchamp, T. L. and Childress, J. F. (2001) ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics'', 5th ed., New York: Oxford University Press.</ref> claim that these principles are commonly understood and accepted within society, and thus have a broad degree of support, they also assert that they are drawn from two normative ethical traditions: the duty-based moral philosophy (deontological approach) of [[Immanuel Kant]] and the outcome-based (consequentialist) ethics of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]].\n\n==The four principles==\n\nThese ethical principles can be elucidated in slightly different ways, but the explanations provided by Beauchamp and Childress <ref name=\"auto\"/> can be summarised as follows:\n\n'''Respect for autonomy'''\nThis principle refers to the capacity of an individual to be self-determining and to make decisions for themselves without undue pressure, coercion or other forms of persuasion. It is contrasted with the notion of paternalism which occurs when actions of a health care practitioner override or do not seek to respect the wishes of the patient, believing that they are better able to decide what is in the patient's best interests. Whether or not the doctor knows best, s/he has no right to make important decisions on behalf of competent patients, as a general principle. Even where the doctor acts in the patient's interests, it is important that the patient's own choices and wishes be respected.\n\nRespect for autonomy is operationalised through the requirement for [[informed consent]] whereby people who have the capacity for self-determination must be fully informed before being asked for their consent.\n\n'''Beneficence'''\nThis principle describes an obligation to act for the benefit of others. Acting in this way might involve preventing or removing harm, or it might involve the active promotion of some good (health, for example). The aim of beneficent action is to produce the \u2018best\u2019 one can out of a range of possibilities. It can involve cost/benefit analysis such that the \u2018best\u2019 here will be the possible action in which the benefits produced maximally outweigh the costs or the risks. Put simply, it is to act always in the best interests of the patient.\n\n'''Non-maleficence'''\nDuties of non-maleficence require us to refrain from causing deliberate harm or intentional avoidance of actions that might be expected to cause harm. Generally, obligations of non-maleficence are more stringent than obligations of beneficence, but again a cost/benefit analysis may need to be undertaken to identify the best possible action. In some situations harm may be unavoidable and then we must be sure that the benefits outweigh the harm.\n\n'''Justice'''\nThe principle of justice requires that we do what we can to ensure that costs and benefits are fairly distributed. It is possible to obey the principle of non-maleficence and the\nprinciple of beneficence, yet still not behave in an ethical manner, for these two principles say nothing about how benefits should be apportioned. In a given case it may well be that we can only procure a major benefit for some people by slightly harming the interests of others. The principle of beneficence may say we should go ahead, but then the benefits and costs would be unfairly distributed.\n\n==Principlism as a practical approach==\n\nPrinciplism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.\n\n== Principlism as a matter of debate ==\n\nPrinciplism has been subjected to challenges since first introduced by Beauchamp and Childress in 1979. The term \u2018principlism\u2019 itself was first presented, not by Beauchamp and Childress, but by two of the most vocal critics, Danner Clouser and [[Bernard Gert]]. Clouser and Gert assert that the principled approach lacks theoretical unity; the principles lack any systematic relationship because they are drawn from conflicting moral theories, and hence often lead to conflicting conclusions.<ref>Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1990) 'A critique of principlism', Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, 15(2), 219-236. Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1994) Morality vs. principlism, New York: John Wiley and Sons.</ref><br>\nThe apparent \u2018pick and mix\u2019 selection of certain theories and principles, without an underlying theoretical basis, is a cause of great concern for Clouser who states:\n''It is a kind of relativism espoused (perhaps unwittingly) by many books (usually anthologies) of bioethics. They parade before the reader a variety of \u2018\u2018theories\u2019\u2019 of ethics\u2014 Kantianism, deontology, utilitarianism, other forms of consequentialism, and the like\u2014 and say, in effect, choose whichever of the competing theories, maxims, principles, or rules suits you for any particular case. Just take your choice! They each have flaws\u2014 which are always pointed out\u2014but on balance, the authors seem to be saying, they are probably all equally good!'' <ref>Clouser, K. D. (1995) \u2018Common Morality as an Alternative to Principlism\u2019, Kennedy. Inst. Ethics J., 5(3), 219-36, p 224.</ref><br>\n\nOthers have objected to the choice or limitations of the particular principles, such as Herissone-Kelly <ref>Herissone-Kelly, P. (2003) 'The principlist approach to bioethics and its stormy journey overseas', in H\u00e4yry, M. and Takala, T. eds. Scratching the surface of bioethics, New York : Rodopi, 65-77.</ref> who questions the argument that Beauchamp and Childress present in support of their global applicability, and Walker <ref>Walker, T. (2009) 'What principlism misses', Journal of Medical Ethics, 35(4), 229- 231.</ref>, who believes that more principles need to be added if they are truly to represent a common sense morality. Additionally, it has been suggested, that application of a principlist approach serves to exclude the moral agent, who performs the act, from the moral judgements; in order to see what is good and not merely what are the rights involved, we must consider the virtue and intentions of the person acting.<ref>MacIntyre, A. (1988) After Virtue, 1984., Whose Justice? Which Rationality?, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press.</ref> For example, H\u00e4yry, in his scrutiny of the objection that the \u2018Georgetown principles\u2019 are not truly representative of European values (being more aligned with Americam liberalism), points to the lack of representation of virtue ethics within their chosen principles: \u2018''By ignoring moral (and religious) virtues, and thereby all deliberations about the ideal nature of a good, virtuous human being, Beauchamp and Childress left their views wide open to accusations of short-sighted hedonism; excessive individualism and sneaking nihilism''\u2019.<ref>H\u00e4yry, M. (2003) 'European values in bioethics: why, what, and how to be used?', Theoretical Medicine And Bioethics, 24(3), 199-214, p.201.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there are also staunch supporters of principlism such as [[Raanan Gillon]] who has claimed that the four principles can explain and justify all the substantive moral claims in medical ethics. According to Gillon, these principles provide a transcultural, transnational, transreligious, and transphilosophical framework for ethical analysis.<ref>Gillon, R. (1994) Principles of health care ethics, New-Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> <ref>Gillon, R. (1998) 'Bioethics overview', Encyclopedia of applied ethics, 1, 305-317.</ref> <ref>Gillon, R. (2003) 'Ethics needs principles\u2014four can encompass the rest\u2014and respect for autonomy should be \u2018first among equals\u2019', Journal of Medical Ethics, 29(5), 307-312.</ref> \n\nIn spite of any shortcomings of the principlist approach in bioethical analysis, the perceived benefits have been significant as evidenced by its pervasive use. Principlism is by far the most dominant approach to ethical analysis in healthcare and the book Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress remains the most influential book in modern bioethics.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bioethics]]\n[[Category:Medical ethics]]\n[[Category:Autonomy]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]\n[[Category:Meta-ethics]]\n[[Category:Professional ethics]]\n", "text_old": "'''Principlism''' is an [[applied ethics]] approach to the examination of moral dilemmas that is based upon the application of certain ethical principles.

Acting in this way might involve preventing or removing harm, or it might involve the active promotion of some good (health, for example). The aim of beneficent action is to produce the \u2018best\u2019 one can out of a range of possibilities. It can involve cost/benefit analysis such that the \u2018best\u2019 here will be the possible action in which the benefits produced maximally outweigh the costs or the risks. Put simply, it is to act always in the best interests of the patient.\n\n'''Non-maleficence'''\nDuties of non-maleficence require us to refrain from causing deliberate harm or intentional avoidance of actions that might be expected to cause harm. Generally, obligations of non-maleficence are more stringent than obligations of beneficence, but again a cost/benefit analysis may need to be undertaken to identify the best possible action. In some situations harm may be unavoidable and then we must be sure that the benefits outweigh the harm.\n\n'''Justice'''\nThe principle of justice requires that we do what we can to ensure that costs and benefits are fairly distributed. It is possible to obey the principle of non-maleficence and the\nprinciple of beneficence, yet still not behave in an ethical manner, for these two principles say nothing about how benefits should be apportioned. In a given case it may well be that we can only procure a major benefit for some people by slightly harming the interests of others. The principle of beneficence may say we should go ahead, but then the benefits and costs would be unfairly distributed.\n\n==Principlism as a practical approach==\n\nPrinciplism has evolved into a practical approach for ethical decision-making that focuses on the common ground moral principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice. The practicality of this approach is that principlism can be derived from, is consistent with, or at the very least is not in conflict with a multitude of ethical, theological, and social approaches towards moral decision-making. This pluralistic approach is essential when making moral decisions institutionally, pedagogically, and in the community as pluralistic interdisciplinary groups by definition cannot agree on particular moral theories or their epistemic justifications. However, pluralistic interdisciplinary groups can and do agree on intersubjective principles. In the development of a principlistic moral framework it is not a [[Necessary and sufficient conditions|necessary condition]] that the epistemic origins and justifications of these principles be established. Rather the sufficient condition is that most individuals and societies, would agree that both prescriptively and descriptively there is wide agreement with the existence and acceptance of the general values of autonomy, nonmaleficence, beneficence, and justice.\n\n== Principlism as a matter of debate ==\n\nPrinciplism has been subjected to challenges since first introduced by Beauchamp and Childress in 1979. The term \u2018principlism\u2019 itself was first presented, not by Beauchamp and Childress, but by two of the most vocal critics, Danner Clouser and [[Bernard Gert]]. Clouser and Gert assert that the principled approach lacks theoretical unity; the principles lack any systematic relationship because they are drawn from conflicting moral theories, and hence often lead to conflicting conclusions.<ref>Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1990) 'A critique of principlism', Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, 15(2), 219-236. Clouser, K. D. and Gert, B. (1994) Morality vs. principlism, New York: John Wiley and Sons.</ref><br>\nThe apparent \u2018pick and mix\u2019 selection of certain theories and principles, without an underlying theoretical basis, is a cause of great concern for Clouser who states:\n''It is a kind of relativism espoused (perhaps unwittingly) by many books (usually anthologies) of bioethics. They parade before the reader a variety of \u2018\u2018theories\u2019\u2019 of ethics\u2014 Kantianism, deontology, utilitarianism, other forms of consequentialism, and the like\u2014 and say, in effect, choose whichever of the competing theories, maxims, principles, or rules suits you for any particular case. Just take your choice! They each have flaws\u2014 which are always pointed out\u2014but on balance, the authors seem to be saying, they are probably all equally good!'' <ref>Clouser, K. D. (1995) \u2018Common Morality as an Alternative to Principlism\u2019, Kennedy. Inst. Ethics J., 5(3), 219-36, p 224.</ref><br>\n\nOthers have objected to the choice or limitations of the particular principles, such as Herissone-Kelly <ref>Herissone-Kelly, P. (2003) 'The principlist approach to bioethics and its stormy journey overseas', in H\u00e4yry, M. and Takala, T. eds. Scratching the surface of bioethics, New York : Rodopi, 65-77.</ref> who questions the argument that Beauchamp and Childress present in support of their global applicability, and Walker <ref>Walker, T. (2009) 'What principlism misses', Journal of Medical Ethics, 35(4), 229- 231.</ref>, who believes that more principles need to be added if they are truly to represent a common sense morality. Additionally, it has been suggested, that application of a principlist approach serves to exclude the moral agent, who performs the act, from the moral judgements; in order to see what is good and not merely what are the rights involved, we must consider the virtue and intentions of the person acting.<ref>MacIntyre, A. (1988) After Virtue, 1984., Whose Justice? Which Rationality?, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press.</ref> For example, H\u00e4yry, in his scrutiny of the objection that the \u2018Georgetown principles\u2019 are not truly representative of European values (being more aligned with Americam liberalism), points to the lack of representation of virtue ethics within their chosen principles: \u2018''By ignoring moral (and religious) virtues, and thereby all deliberations about the ideal nature of a good, virtuous human being, Beauchamp and Childress left their views wide open to accusations of short-sighted hedonism; excessive individualism and sneaking nihilism''\u2019.<ref>H\u00e4yry, M. (2003) 'European values in bioethics: why, what, and how to be used?', Theoretical Medicine And Bioethics, 24(3), 199-214, p.201.</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, there are also staunch supporters of principlism such as [[Raanan Gillon]] who has claimed that the four principles can explain and justify all the substantive moral claims in medical ethics. According to Gillon, these principles provide a transcultural, transnational, transreligious, and transphilosophical framework for ethical analysis.<ref>Gillon, R. (1994) Principles of health care ethics, New-Jersey: Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> <ref>Gillon, R. (1998) 'Bioethics overview', Encyclopedia of applied ethics, 1, 305-317.</ref> <ref>Gillon, R. (2003) 'Ethics needs principles\u2014four can encompass the rest\u2014and respect for autonomy should be \u2018first among equals\u2019', Journal of Medical Ethics, 29(5), 307-312.</ref> \n\nIn spite of any shortcomings of the principlist approach in bioethical analysis, the perceived benefits have been significant as evidenced by its pervasive use. Principlism is by far the most dominant approach to ethical analysis in healthcare and the book Principles of Biomedical Ethics by Beauchamp and Childress remains the most influential book in modern bioethics.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Bioethics]]\n[[Category:Medical ethics]]\n[[Category:Autonomy]]\n[[Category:Ethical theories]]\n[[Category:Meta-ethics]]\n[[Category:Professional ethics]]\n", "name_user": "Jprg1966", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Origins of Principlism", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principlism"}

O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos, and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions.

When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay.

A strictly objective third person narration would not be conducive to having an intimate tie with Parker. By looking through the lens of Parker's experience, the reader is able to empathize with Parker; the reader can see the extent to which Parker is struggling. The viewpoint of this story helps to create a very strong protagonist in Parker.\n\nThe story also uses [[irony]] as an effective element. In \"Parker's Back,\" O'Connor presents one ironic situation after another. The situational irony is effective at catching the reader by surprise, so that the story is more riveting. Irony is an element that O'Connor uses commonly in her stories. For example, Parker's marriage to Sarah Ruth is ironic. Parker, with his hedonistic lifestyle of drinking, cursing, tattoos, and apathy toward religion was the antithesis of Sarah Ruth. And yet Sarah Ruth marries Parker, and their marriage\u2014though rocky\u2014does not end in divorce within the story.\n\nO'Connor continues this irony with Parker beginning a relationship with God through his experience of gaining a tattoo. The reader may expect\u2014with the negativity surrounding Parker's tattoos\u2014that he would not find God through them. And yet, ironically, Parker's encountering the tattoo image of Christ proves to be a profound experience.  There is also irony also at the end of the story when Parker returns home to display his tattoo for Sarah Ruth. He expects her to approve of his new-found relationship with Christ, but she denounces his tattoo and throws him out of the house.\n\nThe story uses [[symbols]] to tell Parker's life story. The tattoos he receives are a summary of his life. O'Connor suggests that they are major symbols of his most important things in life, however, they are all linked to something he did wrong in the past. Parker has tattoos all over his body, except for his back. The tattoo that fills his back is shows that Parker had a troubled life before he was able to finally find peace.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Works by Flannery O'Connor}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Parker's Back}}\n[[Category:Short stories by Flannery O'Connor]]\n[[Category:1964 short stories]]\n", "text_old": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\n{{Infobox short story | <!-- See [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Novels]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Books]] -->\n| name          = Parker's Back\n| title_orig    =\n| translator    =\n| author        = [[Flannery O'Connor]]\n| country       = [[United States]]\n| language      = [[English language|English]]\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Southern Gothic]]\n| published_in  = ''[[Everything That Rises Must Converge]]''\n| publication_type = single author anthology\n| publisher     =\n| media_type    =\n| pub_date      = 1965\n| english_pub_date =\n| preceded_by   =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n\"'''Parker's Back'''\" is a short story by American author [[Flannery O'Connor]]. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" was published in 1965 in her final short story collection, ''Everything That Rises Must Converge''. O'Connor, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], often used religious themes in her work and examined the depth of human nature. As O\u2019Connor once revealed in an interview, \"All fiction is about human nature. What kind of human nature you write about depends on the amount and kind of your talent, not on what you may consider correct behavior to be. The best forms of behavior are not more desirable than the worst for fiction, if the writer sees the situation he is creating under the aspect of Truth and follows the necessities of his art.\"<ref name=\"Magee 1\">{{cite book|last=Magee|first=Rosemary M|title=Conversations with Flannery O'Connor|url=https://archive.org/details/conversationswit00ocon|url-access=registration|year=1987|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson}}</ref>\n\nHolding this belief, O\u2019Connor would many times use seemingly shocking methods to get her messages across, as her characters all experience brokenness and pain in various ways. \"Parker\u2019s Back\" provides one of those such characters, who moves from a hedonistic, painless lifestyle to a life of true sacrifice and pain for God.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n\"Parker\u2019s Back\" takes place in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] in the early 1960's following the life of protagonist, O. E. Parker, a religiously estranged man. He later on moves to developing a tenuous interest in religion, motivated by the lack of shared priorities with his wife. The story starts with Parker and his Biblically-named wife, [[Sarah]] [[Book of Ruth|Ruth]], on the front porch of their country house. Sarah Ruth is \"snapping beans\" on the front porch and Parker, lost in thought, occasionally makes sharp comments to her. The reader is given insight into the attitude and thoughts of Parker. Parker does not think highly of Sarah Ruth and questions why he continues to stay with her. Parker scorns Sarah Ruth\u2019s [[fundamentalist Christian]] attitudes, for she disapproves of his smoking, drinking, and tattoos.\n\nThe [[protagonist]] begins to contemplate his relationship with Sarah Ruth and how his life has developed. As a young boy, Parker is described as being less-than-ordinary and quite earnest. One day, he saw a man at a fair who was layered with tattoos. For the first time in his life, Parker felt wonder and awe; he recognized a greater sense of purpose. He desired that wonder and awe in his life. Parker then proceeded to get his first tattoo, and decides that they are worth it so he began working to pay for more. He fell into a bad crowd and began to drink, smoke, and sleep around. His mother was upset by his lifestyle, and she tried to interfere religiously to make him change his ways. Finally reaching her limit, his mother dragged him to a revival, and upon arrival at the church, Parker runs away.\n\nParker then lies about his age and joins the Navy. As he comes into the ports during his Naval service, Parker begins to acquire more tattoos. He obtains an eagle, along with several other animals, royalty, and even some obscenities in places that are not visible. Parker departs from the Navy without official leave, but they chase him down, imprison him for nine months, and give him a dishonorable discharge. Afterwards, Parker settles down in the country and begins to pick up odd jobs, only keeping them for as long as he feels like working.\n\nOne day, as Parker is selling apples in the countryside, his truck breaks down. He senses that someone is watching him; he loudly curses and pretends to hurt himself. The next thing he knows, a young woman is hitting him with a broom. Parker meets this woman, who happens to be his future wife, Sarah Ruth. He returns over the next few days finding himself attracted to Sarah, yet he does not know why. Despite her constant back-and-forth attitude, Parker continues to pursue Sarah Ruth, going as far as to tell her his full name so that he could learn hers. Ultimately, in order to bed Sarah Ruth, Parker marries her. However, this improved nothing in their relationship. Sarah Ruth was constantly judging Parker for having too many tattoos and Parker was constantly deciding that he would not return home to her, but he always found himself returning.\n\nWhen Parker finishes contemplating his relationship with Sarah Ruth, he thinks about getting a new tattoo. The only bare place on his body for a tattoo is his back; even though Parker did not wish to get a tattoo any place he could not see it, he desires to obtain one in order to win Sarah Ruth over, and to cease her constant nagging. While at work, Parker rides a tractor in a field, however, he is so busy contemplating what tattoo to get that he pays no attention to where he is going and crashes into a tree his boss explicitly told him to not hit. The tractor is destroyed, and in the resulting fire that destroys both machine and tree, Parker's tension comes to a head and he runs to his truck, driving the 50 miles it takes to get into the city. He runs into the tattoo salon, and demands to see the book of tattoos pertaining to God, feeling that when he found the right one, there would be a sign. As he flips through the book of tattoos, one particular image of Christ catches Parker's attention so much so that he turns back to it after flipping past it.\n\nGoing against the tattoo artist's suggestion for the image, Parker asks to have the tattoo of the [[Byzantine]] Christ put on his back, exactly as it is done in the book. While reluctant at first, the tattoo artist begins the procedure of putting this tattoo on Parker\u2019s back. That night, Parker sleeps in the city's homeless shelter and returns to the tattoo shop the next morning to have the image finished. The tattoo artist mocks Parker about the possibility of being \"saved\", and Parker explains that he is getting the tattoo in order to make his wife back off about how he is a sinner. After the tattoo is finished, Parker originally refuses to look at it, however, the tattoo artist ultimately forces him to look at it. Parker is unhappy with the way the tattoo looks, while the artist reminds him that it was Parker's choice, and that he would have recommended something different. Parker then goes to a pool hall he has frequently visited in the past. After the men figure out that Parker has a new tattoo, they lift up his shirt to look at it. After seeing it, they begin to mock Parker for his \"new-found faith\". Parker is thrown out of the bar for starting a fight, and after laying in the dirt for some time afterwards, drives back to his house out in the country.\n\nOnce he reaches his house, Parker knocks on the door, begging for Sarah Ruth to let him in. At first, Sarah Ruth refuses, but she opens the door after Parker refers to himself by his full given name, [[Obadiah]] [[Elihu (Job)|Elihue]]. Once inside, Parker shows Sarah Ruth his tattoo, hoping for a positive reaction\u2014that she will be glad to hear that he has supposedly accepted Christ. However, Sarah Ruth flies into a fury, claiming that God doesn't \"look\" like anything because he has no corporeal form. She then begins screaming that Parker is committing idolatry, and that she will not tolerate that in her house. Sarah Ruth begins beating Parker's back with a broom, until he is bruised and left with welts on his back. She then proceeds to shake the broom out of the window to \"get the taint of him off it\". The story ends with Parker crying up against the tree in the front yard as Sarah Ruth watches dispassionately.\n\n== Byzantine Christ ==\nWhen Parker sought a tattoo for his back, he knew that he wanted to procure a tattoo of Christ. As he flipped through the book of tattoo designs, the tattoo of Christ with piercing eyes stopped him. As Parker continued to look at the picture, the eyes of Christ looked into him, and Parker felt compelled to choose that tattoo. The tattoo that Parker obtained was one of the Byzantine Christ, the [[Pantocrator]]. The Pantocrator was glorified by the Byzantine Empire through its literal definition as \"all-powerful or Almighty Christ\". This image is a popular [[icon]] among the Eastern Catholic and Orthodox Churches.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Homik|first=Heidi|last2=Parsons|first2=Mikeal|year=2015|title=Christ Pantocrator, Alpha and Omega, surrounded by angels, the elect, and Mary, Mother of God, Dome of Paradise, by Giusto de' Menabuoi (1320-1391)|url=http://www.christiancentury.org/archives/Vol132-Issue23|journal=Christian Century|volume=132|pages=47|via=}}</ref> The Christ Pantocrator is a wooden panel that dates back to the 6th century and from St. Catherine's monastery from Egypt. The wooden panel is to be considered one of the oldest icons for Byzantine religions. The book that's in the hands seems to be a gospel book, and it has some jewels on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=Robin |title=Christ Pantocrator |url=http://projects.leadr.msu.edu/medievalart/exhibits/show/iconography_of_christ/christ_pantocrator |website=Medieval Art}}</ref>\n\nParker\u2019s tattoo of the Byzantine Christ helps him to see the deeper mysteries of God. When he looks at the image of Christ, he looks through the \u201cwindow\u201d of the iconic image and sees the depth of God\u2019s love, as he gives his life to Christ. Parker sees that his previous, hedonistic views in life are false, and that suffering\u2014at the hands of Sarah Ruth\u2014for Christ is the way to fulfillment.\n\n\"But Parker\u2019s back is now Christ\u2019s face and the welts, rising redly on one, also disfigure the other. The bond between the two is irrevocable and Parker\u2019s only comfort now is the supreme comfort\u2014that he has a tree, a cross, to lean on, that in his suffering he experiences only what Christ himself felt. The spirit of utter mutuality and unity, what his tattoos have always up to now lacked, descends on him and he realizes the terrible cost. The Word has become flesh on his own flesh.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Baumgaertner|first=Jill|title=Flannery O'Connor: A Proper Scaring|year=1999|publisher=Cornerstone Press|location=Chicago}}</ref>\n\nThe reason that Sarah Ruth does not accept his tattoo is because, her faith does not approve of idolatry. She believes that Christ is a \"spirit\", and that \"he has no face\". Sarah Ruth follows the God of the Hebrew people, who have established that God cannot be seen, which differs from other branches of faith.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Writing on the Flesh: Tattoos and Taboos in \"Parker's Back\"|journal = The Southern Literary Journal|volume = 14|issue = 2|pages = 8\u201318|last=Bleikasten|first=Andr\u00e9|date=1982|jstor = 20077673}}</ref>\n\n== Literary technique ==\nO'Connor uses a variety of literary techniques. In her stories, she is willing to use unconventional means to provide an original look at reality. As she revealed in a correspondence about notable American novelist and literary critic [[Caroline Gordon]], \"no Caroline didn\u2019t mean the tattoos in Parker\u2019s Back were the heresy. Sarah Ruth was the heretic\u2014the notion that you can worship in pure spirit. Caroline gave me a lot of advice about the story but most of it I\u2019m ignoring. She thinks every story must be built according to the pattern of the Roman arch and she would enlarge the beginning and the end, but I\u2019m letting it lay. I did well to write it at all.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=O'Connor|first=Flannery|title=The Habit of Being|year=1979|publisher=The Noonday Press|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThis story is narrated in [[Third-person narrative|Third-person]] through the viewpoint of Parker.

This pair lies physically near the red dwarf star [[AU Microscopii]], which may mean they form a wide triple star system.<ref name=\"Caballero2009\"/>\n\n==Observational history==\nIn 1926, Dutch-American astronomer [[Willem Jacob Luyten]] reported that the lines in the [[spectrum]] of this star underwent variation. A photographic plate taken in June 23, 1895, showed bright lines of hydrogen that were much weaker on a plate taken June 29, 1895. A photograph taken on July 1, 1903, showed no such lines. The net variation in brightness of the star was small, not exceeding 0.5 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]. Luyten noted that the star has a large [[proper motion]], changing its position by 0.43 [[second of arc|seconds of arc]] between 1899 and 1923.<ref name=\"Luyten1926\"/>\n\nBy 1927, the object was found to be a pair of stars with an [[angular separation]] of 2.95 [[arcsecond]]s. Both were shown to be of 'dwarf Me' type, indicating they are [[red dwarf]]s with [[emission line]]s in their spectrum. This was the first such pair of matching dwarf Me stars to be discovered. The first [[parallax]] measurements of the pair showed an annual shift of about 0.1 [[arcsecond]]s, while their [[radial velocity]] was measured to be +5&nbsp;km/s away from the Sun. A nearby star HD 197981, later named [[AU Microscopii]], was shown to have a similar radial velocity of +10&nbsp;km/s. For this reason it was suggested that the three stars are physically associated.<ref name=\"HumasonAdmasJoy1926\"/>\n\nFollowing the discovery in 1949 that certain types of [[variable star]]s are characterized by rapid but brief changes in brightness, accompanied by [[emission line]]s in their spectrum,<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/> in 1954 both HD 196982 A and B were listed as suspected [[flare star]]s by Czech solar physicist [[Zden\u011bk \u0160vestka]].<ref name=\"Svestka1954\"/>\n\nWith the introduction of [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric instruments]] to astronomy, the variability of stars could now be monitored over intervals of time. Measurements of HD 196982 during 1969 showed them to be the most active [[flare star]]s known at that time: over a period of 16.31 hours, 54 flares were observed. The flares increased the combined magnitude of the pair by more than 0.05 for more than half of this observation period.<ref name=\"Kunkel1970\"/> By 1972, the pair had received the [[variable star designation]] AT Microscopii.<ref name=\"Kukarkin1972\"/>\n\n==Properties==\nPosition measurements of the pair made with the [[Hipparcos]] spacecraft show an annual [[parallax]] shift of 0.0935 [[second of arc|seconds of arc]], which is equivalent to a distance of about {{Convert|35|ly|pc|abbr=on}} from the Sun.<ref name=\"van_Leeuwen_2007\"/> It is a [[binary star]] system with an [[angular separation]] of 4.0 [[arcseconds]].<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/> Both members are pre-[[main sequence]], [[red dwarf]] stars and are among the youngest of this type in the neighborhood of the Sun.<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/> Relative to the Sun, component A has about 27% of the mass and 3.6% of the luminosity, while component B has 25% of the mass and 3.3% of the luminosity.<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\"/>\n\nBoth members of this system have active [[stellar corona]]e, show luminosity variations of the [[BY Draconis variable|BY Draconis type]], and are [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] emitters.<ref name=\"Caballero2009\"/> The average flare rate for the pair is 2.8 per hour.<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/><ref name=\"AA383_548\"/> Their X-ray spectrum is consistent with a plasma density of around {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> cm<sup>\u22123</sup>}} and a [[magnetic field]] strength of at least 100&nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]] in the flare regions.<ref name=\"StepanovTsapKopylova2006\"/> Neither star shows any indication of [[lithium]] in their spectrum, having depleted this element through [[nuclear fusion]] at their cores.<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\"/>\n\nThis binary system is located in close proximity to the young star [[AU Microscopii]], with a [[projected separation]] of {{nowrap|46,400 \u00b1 500 [[astronomical unit]]s}}. This indicates that the three may form a wide hierarchical triple system, with the AT Microscopii pair orbiting AU Microscopii over a [[orbital period|period]] of 10 million years.<ref name=\"Caballero2009\"/> All three stars are candidate members of the [[Beta Pictoris moving group]], one of the nearest [[Stellar kinematics|associations of stars]] that share a common motion through space. This group averages a distance of about {{Convert|100|ly|pc|abbr=on}} from the Earth, but are scattered across a volume roughly {{Convert|100|ly|pc|abbr=on}} in diameter. Estimates for the age of this group range between 10\u201321 million years.<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=24em|refs=\n<ref name=\"van_Leeuwen_2007\">{{citation\n | first     = F.\n | last      = van Leeuwen\n |date=November 2007\n | title     = Validation of the new Hipparcos reduction\n | journal   = Astronomy and Astrophysics\n | volume    = 474\n | issue     = 2\n | pages     = 653\u2013664\n | bibcode   = 2007A&A...474..653V\n | doi       = 10.1051/0004-6361:20078357\n | arxiv     = 0708.1752\n | postscript= .\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\">{{citation\n | last1     = McCarthy\n | first1    = Kyle\n | last2     = White\n | first2    = Russel J.\n |date=June 2012\n | title     = The Sizes of the Nearest Young Stars\n | journal   = The Astronomical Journal\n | volume    = 143\n | issue     = 6\n | page      = 134\n | bibcode   = 2012AJ....143..134M\n | doi       = 10.1088/0004-6256/143/6/134\n | arxiv     = 1201.6600\n | postscript= .\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Caballero2009\">{{citation\n | last1     = Caballero\n | first1    = J.

This pair lies physically near the red dwarf star [[AU Microscopii]], which may mean they form a wide triple star system.<ref name=\"Caballero2009\"/>\n\n==Observational history==\nIn 1926, Dutch-American astronomer [[Willem Jacob Luyten]] reported that the lines in the [[spectrum]] of this star underwent variation. A photographic plate taken in June 23, 1895, showed bright lines of hydrogen that were much weaker on a plate taken June 29, 1895. A photograph taken on July 1, 1903, showed no such lines. The net variation in brightness of the star was small, not exceeding 0.5 in [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]]. Luyten noted that the star has a large [[proper motion]], changing its position by 0.43 [[second of arc|seconds of arc]] between 1899 and 1923.<ref name=\"Luyten1926\"/>\n\nBy 1927, the object was found to be a pair of stars with an [[angular separation]] of 2.95 [[arcsecond]]s. Both were shown to be of 'dwarf Me' type, indicating they are [[red dwarf]]s with [[emission line]]s in their spectrum. This was the first such pair of matching dwarf Me stars to be discovered. The first [[parallax]] measurements of the pair showed an annual shift of about 0.1 [[arcsecond]]s, while their [[radial velocity]] was measured to be +5&nbsp;km/s away from the Sun. A nearby star HD 197981, later named [[AU Microscopii]], was shown to have a similar radial velocity of +10&nbsp;km/s. For this reason it was suggested that the three stars are physically associated.<ref name=\"HumasonAdmasJoy1926\"/>\n\nFollowing the discovery in 1949 that certain types of [[variable star]]s are characterized by rapid but brief changes in brightness, accompanied by [[emission line]]s in their spectrum,<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/> in 1954 both HD 196982 A and B were listed as suspected [[flare star]]s by Czech solar physicist [[Zden\u011bk \u0160vestka]].<ref name=\"Svestka1954\"/>\n\nWith the introduction of [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometric instruments]] to astronomy, the variability of stars could now be monitored over intervals of time. Measurements of HD 196982 during 1969 showed them to be the most active [[flare star]]s known at that time: over a period of 16.31 hours, 54 flares were observed. The flares increased the combined magnitude of the pair by more than 0.05 for more than half of this observation period.<ref name=\"Kunkel1970\"/> By 1972, the pair had received the [[variable star designation]] AT Microscopii.<ref name=\"Kukarkin1972\"/>\n\n==Properties==\nPosition measurements of the pair made with the [[Hipparcos]] spacecraft show an annual [[parallax]] shift of 0.0935 [[second of arc|seconds of arc]], which is equivalent to a distance of about {{Convert|35|ly|pc|abbr=on}} from the Sun.<ref name=\"van_Leeuwen_2007\"/> It is a [[binary star]] system with an [[angular separation]] of 4.0 [[arcseconds]].<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/> Both members are pre-[[main sequence]], [[red dwarf]] stars and are among the youngest of this type in the neighborhood of the Sun.<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/> Relative to the Sun, component A has about 27% of the mass and 3.6% of the luminosity, while component B has 25% of the mass and 3.3% of the luminosity.<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\"/>\n\nBoth members of this system have active [[corona]]e, show luminosity variations of the [[BY Draconis variable|BY Draconis type]], and are [[X-ray astronomy|X-ray]] emitters.<ref name=\"Caballero2009\"/> The average flare rate for the pair is 2.8 per hour.<ref name=\"Kunkel1973\"/><ref name=\"AA383_548\"/> Their X-ray spectrum is consistent with a plasma density of around {{nowrap|3 \u00d7 10<sup>10</sup> cm<sup>\u22123</sup>}} and a [[magnetic field]] strength of at least 100&nbsp;[[Gauss (unit)|G]] in the flare regions.<ref name=\"StepanovTsapKopylova2006\"/> Neither star shows any indication of [[lithium]] in their spectrum, having depleted this element through [[nuclear fusion]] at their cores.<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\"/>\n\nThis binary system is located in close proximity to the young star [[AU Microscopii]], with a [[projected separation]] of {{nowrap|46,400 \u00b1 500 [[astronomical unit]]s}}. This indicates that the three may form a wide hierarchical triple system, with the AT Microscopii pair orbiting AU Microscopii over a [[orbital period|period]] of 10 million years.<ref name=\"Caballero2009\"/> All three stars are candidate members of the [[Beta Pictoris moving group]], one of the nearest [[Stellar kinematics|associations of stars]] that share a common motion through space. This group averages a distance of about {{Convert|100|ly|pc|abbr=on}} from the Earth, but are scattered across a volume roughly {{Convert|100|ly|pc|abbr=on}} in diameter. Estimates for the age of this group range between 10\u201321 million years.<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=24em|refs=\n<ref name=\"van_Leeuwen_2007\">{{citation\n | first     = F.\n | last      = van Leeuwen\n |date=November 2007\n | title     = Validation of the new Hipparcos reduction\n | journal   = Astronomy and Astrophysics\n | volume    = 474\n | issue     = 2\n | pages     = 653\u2013664\n | bibcode   = 2007A&A...474..653V\n | doi       = 10.1051/0004-6361:20078357\n | arxiv     = 0708.1752\n | postscript= .\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"McCarthyWhite2012\">{{citation\n | last1     = McCarthy\n | first1    = Kyle\n | last2     = White\n | first2    = Russel J.\n |date=June 2012\n | title     = The Sizes of the Nearest Young Stars\n | journal   = The Astronomical Journal\n | volume    = 143\n | issue     = 6\n | page      = 134\n | bibcode   = 2012AJ....143..134M\n | doi       = 10.1088/0004-6256/143/6/134\n | arxiv     = 1201.6600\n | postscript= .\n}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Caballero2009\">{{citation\n | last1     = Caballero\n | first1    = J.

The film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic [[Greece|Greek]] politician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] in 1963. With its satirical view of Greek politics, its dark sense of humor, and its downbeat ending, the film captures the director's outrage about the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|junta that ruled Greece]] at the time of its making.\n\nThe film stars [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as the investigating magistrate (an [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]] of [[Christos Sartzetakis]] who later served as president of Greece from 1985 to 1990). International stars [[Yves Montand]] and [[Irene Papas]] also appear, but despite their star billing have very little screen time. [[Jacques Perrin]], who co-produced, plays a key role as a photojournalist. The film's title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan ({{lang-el|\u0396\u03b5\u03b9}}, {{IPA-el|\u02c8zi|IPA}}) meaning \"he lives,\" in reference to Lambrakis.\n\n''Z'' was the first film&mdash;and one of only a handful&mdash;to be nominated for both the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. It won the latter, as well as the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]], and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film]]; at the [[27th Golden Globe Awards]], the producers of ''Z'' refused the award to protest against the film's exclusion from the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture - Drama]] category.<ref name=GlobeRefusal>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/trivia-0|title=Trivia|work=Golden Globes website|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with the closing moments of a rather dull government lecture and slide show on agricultural policy, after which the leader of the security police of a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] military-dominated government takes over the podium for an impassioned speech describing the government's program to combat [[leftism]], using the metaphors of \"a [[mildew]] of the mind\", an [[infiltration tactic|infiltration]] of \"[[-ism|isms]]\", or \"sunspots\". \n\nThe scene shifts to preparations for a [[political rally|rally]] of the opposition faction where the [[pacifist]] Deputy is to give a speech advocating nuclear disarmament. There have been attempts by the government to prevent the speech's delivery. The venue has been changed to a much smaller hall, logistical problems have appeared out of nowhere, and the people handing out leaflets about the change of venue are attacked by thugs under the command of the police. On his way to the venue, the Deputy is hit on the head by a right-wing [[anticommunist]] protestor,  some of whom are sponsored by the government, but carries on with his sharp speech. As the Deputy crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The injury eventually proves fatal, and the police manipulate witnesses to force the conclusion that the Deputy was simply run over by a [[drunk driving|drunken driver]].\n\nHowever, the police do not control the hospital, where the [[autopsy]] disproves their interpretation. The [[inquisitorial system|examining magistrate]], with the assistance of a photojournalist (Perrin), now uncovers sufficient evidence to indict not only the two right-wing militants who committed the murder, but also four high-ranking military police officers. The action of the film concludes with one of the Deputy's associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments. The widow looks distressed, appearing not to believe things will change for the better.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice's being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the Deputy's close associates die or are deported, and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents. The heads of the government do resign after public disapproval, but, before elections are carried out, a [[coup d'etat]] occurs and the military seize power. They ban [[modern art]], [[popular music]] and [[avant-garde]] novelists, as well as [[Modern elementary mathematics|modern mathematics]], classic and modern philosophers, and the use of the term \"[[Zeta|\u0396]]\" ({{lang-el|z\u00edta}}, or {{lang-el|zi}} used by protesters against the former government), which referred to The Deputy and means: \"He lives.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as The Examining Magistrate (based on [[Christos Sartzetakis]])\n* [[Yves Montand]] as The Deputy ([[Grigoris Lambrakis]])\n* [[Irene Papas]] as Helene, the Deputy's wife\n* [[Pierre Dux]] as The General (the main antagonist, based on [[Konstantinos Mitsou]])\n* [[Jacques Perrin]] as Photojournalist (Giorgos Bertsos)\n* [[Charles Denner]] as Manuel\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as Public prosecutor\n* [[Georges G\u00e9ret]] as Nick\n* [[Bernard Fresson]] as Matt\n* [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] as Vago (Emmanouel Emmannouilidis - man who struck Lambrakis)\n* [[Julien Guiomar]] as The Colonel (based on Efthimios Kamoutsis)\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Nick's sister\n* [[Renato Salvatori]] as Yago (Spyro Gotzamanis - the driver)\n* Clotilde Joanno as Shoula\n* [[Maurice Baquet]] as The Mason (Manolis Hatziapostolou)\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darrieu]] as Barone\n* [[Jean Bouise]] as Georges Pirou\n* [[Jean-Pierre Miquel]] as Pierre\n* Van Doude as The Hospital Director\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as Ilya Coste\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gobbi as Jimmy, the boxer\n* Guy Mairesse as Dumas\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]] as Nick's mother\n* Eva Simonet as Niki\n* [[Hassan El-Hassani]] as a military officer\n* Sid Ahmed Agoumi as The General's driver\n* [[Raoul Coutard]] (''uncredited'') as the English Surgeon\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bonnot]] (''uncredited'') as the final voiceover\n* [[Said Kabouya]] (''uncredited'') as the valet\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Theatre Champs Elysees 35.jpg|thumb|267px|Ballet scenes were shot at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris]]\n\nThe 1963 murder of Greek politician and physician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] and subsequent [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military junta]] served as the basis for the story.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2014 |title=Cinematic Terror: A Global History of Terrorism on Film |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |p=105 |isbn=978-1441158093}}</ref> Among Costa-Gavras' references to the actual events was the frequency with which the military compared ideologies to diseases, seen when the General compares [[-isms]] to [[mildew]].<ref name=\"Costa\">{{cite AV media |last=[[Costa-Gavras]] |first= |date=2002 |title=Z Commentary Track |medium=DVD |publisher=Wellspring Media}}</ref> The Magistrate was based on real-life Greek jurist [[Christos Sartzetakis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Oliver Boyd Barrett |author2=David Herrera |author3=James A.

It is about how even moral victories are corrupted. It will make you weep and will make you angry. It will tear your guts out...When the Army junta staged its coup in 1967, the right-wing generals and the police chief were cleared of all charges and 'rehabilitated.' Those responsible for unmasking the assassination now became political criminals. These would seem to be completely political events, but the young director Costa-Gavras has told them in a style that is almost unbearably exciting. ''Z'' is at the same time a political cry of rage and a brilliant suspense thriller. It even ends in a chase: Not through the streets but through a maze of facts, alibis and official corruption.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19691230/REVIEWS/912300301/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |newspaper=The Chicago Sun-Times |title=Z |date=December 30, 1969 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, \"''Z'' was the third feature film from Greek-born Costa-Gavras, but it is the movie that captured him to the world's attention, winning a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.

film|political]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] film directed by [[Costa-Gavras]], with a screenplay by Gavras and [[Jorge Sempr\u00fan]], based on the 1966 novel of the same name by [[Vassilis Vassilikos]]. The film presents a thinly fictionalized account of the events surrounding the assassination of democratic [[Greece|Greek]] politician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] in 1963. With its satirical view of Greek politics, its dark sense of humor, and its downbeat ending, the film captures the director's outrage about the [[Greek military junta of 1967\u201374|junta that ruled Greece]] at the time of its making.\n\nThe film stars [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as the investigating magistrate (an [[Analogue (literature)|analogue]] of [[Christos Sartzetakis]] who later served as president of Greece from 1985 to 1990). International stars [[Yves Montand]] and [[Irene Papas]] also appear, but despite their star billing have very little screen time. [[Jacques Perrin]], who co-produced, plays a key role as a photojournalist. The film's title refers to a popular Greek protest slogan ({{lang-el|\u0396\u03b5\u03b9}}, {{IPA-el|\u02c8zi|IPA}}) meaning \"he lives,\" in reference to Lambrakis.\n\n''Z'' was the first film&mdash;and one of only a handful&mdash;to be nominated for both the [[Academy Awards]] for [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]]. It won the latter, as well as the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]], and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign-Language Foreign Film]]; at the [[27th Golden Globe Awards]], the producers of ''Z'' refused the award to protest against the film's exclusion from the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture - Drama]] category.<ref name=GlobeRefusal>{{cite web|url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/trivia-0|title=Trivia|work=Golden Globes website|accessdate=2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe story begins with the closing moments of a rather dull government lecture and slide show on agricultural policy, after which the leader of the security police of a [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] military-dominated government takes over the podium for an impassioned speech describing the government's program to combat [[leftism]], using the metaphors of \"a [[mildew]] of the mind\", an [[infiltration tactic|infiltration]] of \"[[-ism|isms]]\", or \"sunspots\". \n\nThe scene shifts to preparations for a [[political rally|rally]] of the opposition faction where the [[pacifist]] Deputy is to give a speech advocating nuclear disarmament. There have been attempts by the government to prevent the speech's delivery. The venue has been changed to a much smaller hall, logistical problems have appeared out of nowhere, and the people handing out leaflets about the change of venue are attacked by thugs under the command of the police. On his way to the venue, the Deputy is hit on the head by a right-wing [[anticommunist]] protestor,  some of whom are sponsored by the government, but carries on with his sharp speech. As the Deputy crosses the street from the hall after giving his speech, a delivery truck speeds past him and a man on the open truck bed strikes him down with a club. The injury eventually proves fatal, and the police manipulate witnesses to force the conclusion that the Deputy was simply run over by a [[drunk driving|drunken driver]].\n\nHowever, the police do not control the hospital, where the [[autopsy]] disproves their interpretation. The [[inquisitorial system|examining magistrate]], with the assistance of a photojournalist (Perrin), now uncovers sufficient evidence to indict not only the two right-wing militants who committed the murder, but also four high-ranking military police officers. The action of the film concludes with one of the Deputy's associates rushing to see his widow to give her the surprising news of the officers' indictments. The widow looks distressed, appearing not to believe things will change for the better.\n\nAn [[epilogue]] provides a synopsis of the subsequent turns of events. Instead of justice's being served, the prosecutor is mysteriously removed from the case, several key witnesses die under suspicious circumstances, the assassins receive relatively short sentences, the officers receive only administrative reprimands, the Deputy's close associates die or are deported, and the photojournalist is sent to prison for disclosing official documents. The heads of the government resign after public disapproval, but, before elections are carried out, a [[Coup d'etat]] occurs and the military seize power. They ban [[modern art]], [[popular music]] and [[avant-garde]] novelists, as well as [[Modern elementary mathematics|modern mathematics]], classic and modern philosophers, and the use of the term \"[[Zeta|\u0396]]\" ({{lang-el|z\u00edta}}, or {{lang-el|zi}} which was used by protesters against the former government), which referred to The Deputy and means: \"He lives.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] as The Examining Magistrate (based on [[Christos Sartzetakis]])\n* [[Yves Montand]] as The Deputy ([[Grigoris Lambrakis]])\n* [[Irene Papas]] as Helene, the Deputy's wife\n* [[Pierre Dux]] as The General (the main antagonist, based on [[Konstantinos Mitsou]])\n* [[Jacques Perrin]] as Photojournalist (Giorgos Bertsos)\n* [[Charles Denner]] as Manuel\n* [[Fran\u00e7ois P\u00e9rier]] as Public prosecutor\n* [[Georges G\u00e9ret]] as Nick\n* [[Bernard Fresson]] as Matt\n* [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] as Vago (Emmanouel Emmannouilidis - man who struck Lambrakis)\n* [[Julien Guiomar]] as The Colonel (based on Efthimios Kamoutsis)\n* [[Magali No\u00ebl]] as Nick's sister\n* [[Renato Salvatori]] as Yago (Spyro Gotzamanis - the driver)\n* Clotilde Joanno as Shoula\n* [[Maurice Baquet]] as The Mason (Manolis Hatziapostolou)\n* [[G\u00e9rard Darrieu]] as Barone\n* [[Jean Bouise]] as Georges Pirou\n* [[Jean-Pierre Miquel]] as Pierre\n* Van Doude as The Hospital Director\n* [[Jean Dast\u00e9]] as Ilya Coste\n* Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Gobbi as Jimmy, the boxer\n* Guy Mairesse as Dumas\n* [[Andr\u00e9e Tainsy]] as Nick's mother\n* Eva Simonet as Niki\n* [[Hassan El-Hassani]] as a military officer\n* Sid Ahmed Agoumi as The General's driver\n* [[Raoul Coutard]] (''uncredited'') as the English Surgeon\n* [[Fran\u00e7oise Bonnot]] (''uncredited'') as the final voiceover\n* [[Said Kabouya]] (''uncredited'') as the valet\n}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Theatre Champs Elysees 35.jpg|thumb|267px|Ballet scenes were shot at the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] in Paris]]\n\nThe 1963 murder of Greek politician and physician [[Grigoris Lambrakis]] and subsequent [[Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974|military junta]] served as the basis for the story.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shaw |first=Tony |date=2014 |title=Cinematic Terror: A Global History of Terrorism on Film |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |p=105 |isbn=978-1441158093}}</ref> Among Costa-Gavras' references to the actual events was the frequency with which the military compared ideologies to diseases, seen when the General compares [[-isms]] to [[mildew]].<ref name=\"Costa\">{{cite AV media |last=[[Costa-Gavras]] |first= |date=2002 |title=Z Commentary Track |medium=DVD |publisher=Wellspring Media}}</ref> The Magistrate was based on real-life Greek jurist [[Christos Sartzetakis]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Oliver Boyd Barrett |author2=David Herrera |author3=James A.

That said, Costa-Gavras has stated that the Zapruder film had not been widely circulated in Europe at the time and that Kennedy's assassination did not influence the production.<ref name=\"cine\">{{cite journal |title=Costa-Gavras Talks About Z |journal=Cin\u00e9asta |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=12\u201316 |jstor=43551774 |year=1969 }}</ref>\n\n[[Principal photography]] took place in [[Algiers]] at actor [[Jacques Perrin]]'s suggestion, which the filmmakers approved for its [[Mediterranean]] environment and because the Ministry of Culture was accommodating.<ref name=\"Costa\"/> In Algiers, [[Hotel St. Georges]] and the central square were filming locations, while Paris' [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es]] was used for the ballet scenes.<ref name=\"Costa\"/> [[Marcel Bozzuffi]] performed his own stunts wrestling on the \"Kamikaze\" vehicle due to the production's lack of budget for professional stunt performers.<ref name=\"Costa\"/>\n\nCosta-Gavras chose ''Z'' as the title of the film based on its common occurrence in Greek [[graffiti]], for \"He lives\" (or even \"Lambrakis you live; be our guide!\" [\u039b\u03b1\u03bc\u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7 \u03b6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b5\u03c3\u03cd \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2 \u03bf\u03b4\u03b7\u03b3\u03b5\u03af\u03c2!; ''Lambr\u00e1ki zis, es\u00fd mas odig\u00eds!'']); Costa-Gavras acknowledged a one-letter film title was unconventional and said [[Yves Montand]] expressed concern it would be confused with ''[[Zorro]]'', but Costa-Gavras said the novelty of the idea won him over.<ref name=\"Costa\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe soundtrack, by [[Mikis Theodorakis]], was a hit record. The Greek junta had placed the composer under house arrest but he was able to give his approval to Costa-Gavras for the use of existing musical pieces.\n\nThe film features, but does not credit, [[Pierre Henry]]'s contemporary hit song, \"[[Psych\u00e9 Rock]]\". The soundtrack as released on [[LP album|LP]] and [[CD]] replaces Henry's song with a similar track written by Theodorakis named \"Caf\u00e9 Rock.\"\n\n# Main Title (Antonis) from the \"[[Mauthausen Trilogy]]\" of Mikis Theodorakis\n# The Smiling Youth \n# The Chase-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# Cafe Rock\n# Arrival of Helen-The Smiling Youth\n# Batucada\n# The Smiling Youth (Bouzouki Version)\n# The Smiling Youth\n# Who's Not Talking About Easter\n# Finale-The Smiling Youth\n# Murmur of the Heart\n# In This Town\n\n\"The Happy Youth\" and \"Who's Not Talking About Easter\" were among the poems adapted from [[Brendan Behan]]'s play ''[[The Hostage (play)|The Hostage]]'' by Theodorakis in 1962.

It is about how even moral victories are corrupted. It will make you weep and will make you angry. It will tear your guts out...When the Army junta staged its coup in 1967, the right-wing generals and the police chief were cleared of all charges and 'rehabilitated.' Those responsible for unmasking the assassination now became political criminals. These would seem to be completely political events, but the young director Costa-Gavras has told them in a style that is almost unbearably exciting. ''Z'' is at the same time a political cry of rage and a brilliant suspense thriller. It even ends in a chase: Not through the streets but through a maze of facts, alibis and official corruption.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19691230/REVIEWS/912300301/1023 |last=Ebert |first=Roger |newspaper=The Chicago Sun-Times |title=Z |date=December 30, 1969 |accessdate=2011-02-02}}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, [[James Berardinelli]] wrote, \"''Z'' was the third feature film from Greek-born Costa-Gavras, but it is the movie that captured him to the world's attention, winning a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar.

{"title_page": "List of Knights of Sidonia characters", "text_new": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Knights of Sidonia'' characters}}\n{{notability|date=January 2020}}\nThis is a list of the characters for the [[manga]]/[[anime]] series ''[[Knights of Sidonia]]'' by [[Tsutomu Nihei]].\n\n==Main characters==\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Nagate Tanikaze}}|\u8c37\u98a8 \u9577\u9053|Tanikaze Nagate}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]}}\n:The series main protagonist, who was raised by his grandfather Hiroki Sait\u014d deep inside ''Sidonia'', thus he did not undergo the special genetic treatment to develop the ability to sustain himself through photosynthesis and must eat on a daily basis like a regular human for nutrition. Later it is revealed he is actually Sait\u014d's clone, inheriting not only engineered features like fast wound recovery and immortality, but also Sait\u014d's natural talent as a pilot and warrior. Trained since childhood on a Garde simulator, Nagate is entrusted with Sait\u014d's Garde, the legendary Type-17 {{Nihongo|\"Tsugumori\"|\u7d99\u885b}}, and just like his \"grandfather,\" he eventually becomes ''Sidonia''{{'}}s top ace, saving the ship from the Gauna invasion on several occasions. Nagate later is entrusted with most advanced units, like the first prototype of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s Type-19, an upgraded version of Tsugumori, the {{Nihongo|\"Tsugumori Custom 2\"|\u7d99\u885b\u6539\u4e8c|Tsugumori kai ni}}, and the first prototype of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s Type-20, labeled {{Nihongo|\"Yukimori\"|\u52ab\u885b}}. Initially assigned the call number TS-028, he is later designated unit 704 when he is promoted to full pilot status. Nagate later fathers a child with Tsumugi, whose consciousness now resides in one of the captured Crimson Hawk Moth samples, after ''Sidonia'' defeats the Large Mass Union Ship and colonizes the Lem star system.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Shizuka Hoshijiro}}|\u661f\u767d \u9591|Hoshijiro Shizuka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:A fellow Garde pilot, ranked number two among the trainees, who Nagate meets and becomes his love interest. Initially assigned to call number TS-336, she is assigned to unit 702 when she is promoted to full pilot. She is later killed and absorbed by Gauna 490, which uses her DNA and memories to develop a powerful Garde-like Gauna known as {{Nihongo|Crimson [[Sphingidae|Hawk Moth]]|\u7d05\u5929\u86fe|Benisuzume}}. A placenta sample resembling her is also retrieved by Nagate, and Ochiai impregnates it using human DNA to create Tsumugi and Kanata.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tsumugi Shiraui|\u767d\u7fbd\u8863 \u3064\u3080\u304e|Shiraui Tsumugi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:A Gauna/human hybrid created by Kunato Developments for fighting against the Gauna. Tsumugi is similar in size to a Garde, but has a Gauna-like appearance in the shape of a young woman wearing a dress. Tsumugi eventually becomes friends with Nagate and Izana, usually interacting with them using a tentacle she sneaks in through the ship's ventilation system while the rest of her body stays in her chambers. Tsumugi displays a gentle, curious, child-like demeanor under most circumstances, but her prowess in combat is rivaled only by Nagate's. Just like Shizuka, she eventually develops feelings for Nagate and much to her surprise, he ends up accepting them, despite her inhuman form. Tsumugi is equipped with an organic artificial kabi cannon and retractable claws made of artificial kabi. She also has a hollow chest cavity holding an organic cockpit that allows a pilot to direct and support her in battle. Tsumugi naturally generates Heigus particles within her body and is able to easily out-fly even the most advanced Garde models. Tsumugi eventually sacrifices her hybrid body to rescue Nagate from the Lem star after his battle with Chimera Ochiai, using her body as shield to protect him from the heat. Her consciousness is later transferred to one of the captured Hoshijiro-like Gauna samples from the Crimson Hawk Moths and she enters a true relationship with Nagate, eventually giving birth to a daughter, {{Nihongo|Nodoka|\u9577\u9591}}. According to Tsumugi, Hoshijiro's memories still reside within her new body, though they are vague.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Izana Shinatose}}|\u79d1\u6238\u702c \u30a4\u30b6\u30ca|Shinatose Izana}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aki Toyosaki]]|[[Melissa Fahn]]}}\n:Belonging to an [[intersex]] [[third gender]] that originated during the hundreds of years of human emigration into space, Izana is also a Garde pilot and quickly becomes Nagate's best friend and eventual roommate, later falling in love with him. This attraction causes Izana's body to undergo a transformation into that of a female. Izana loses an arm and a leg during a battle against the Gauna and has them replaced with prosthetic limbs that allow her to operate complex machinery with far more skill than an ordinary person. A system is also installed on Izana's Garde unit that funnels sensor and radar information directly into her brain via her artificial arm, granting her unparalleled detection abilities surpassing even ''Sidonia''{{'}}s systems. She is often assigned to recon and spotting duties in battle. Initially TS-291, Izana is later assigned to unit 723. Ten years after the destruction of the Large Mass Union Ship and ''Sidonia''{{'}}s colonization of the Lem star system. Izana is one of several crew members to depart on a repaired ''Sidonia'' to parts unknown. Izana is referred to using [[gender neutral]] pronouns in the original Japanese dialogue. Because the English language lacks an appropriate equivalent, she is often referred to using feminine pronouns for the sake of simplicity.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Yuhata Midorikawa}}|\u7dd1\u5ddd \u7e88|Midorikawa Yuhata}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hisako Kanemoto]]|[[Marieve Herington]]}}\n:A friend of Nagate and Izana, she later develops feelings for Nagate and competes with Izana for his attention. Initially a Garde pilot in-training with the call number TS-256, she is promoted to commander's aide after Seii returns to full-time piloting duty, eventually moving into Nagate's home. Yuhata makes a hobby of building and customizing [[plamo|plastic model]] kits of Garde units in her spare time. Ten years after ''Sidonia'' colonizes the Lem star system, Yuhata undergoes a [[gender reassignment]] process and becomes male. Yuhata also becomes commander of a repaired ''Sidonia'', which continues on in search of more planets to colonize.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Teruru Ichigaya}}|\u5e02\u30f6\u8c37 \u30c6\u30eb\u30eb|Ichigaya Teruru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yukari Tamura]]}}\n:A [[gynoid]] developed with the purpose of avoiding detection from the Gauna, she is the sole survivor of a colonization expedition on the planet Lem VII. Despite refusing Nagate's help, claiming that he is responsible for the Gauna attacking ''Sidonia'', she is rescued by him nonetheless and, without a place to return to, she is taken under his guard. Teruru claims to be unconcerned towards Nagate, but her actions usually imply otherwise. She later joins the war effort as the pilot of one of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s new ''Mizuki''-class warships. Her body has a special automatic defense mechanism built in, which activates when she feels threatened or flustered. This causes her artificial skin to harden, leaving her with a more robotic, puppet-like appearance. Being a machine, Teruru is able to survive in the vacuum of space without support, even if her body is severely damaged. Teruru is one of several crew members who decide to stay on the repaired ''Sidonia'', departing to search for more planets to colonize.\n\n==Garde Pilots==\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Norio Kunato}}|\u5c90\u795e \u6d77\u82d4\u592b|Kunato Norio}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takahiro Sakurai]]|[[Todd Haberkorn]]}}\n:A fellow male Garde pilot with long white hair, heir of Kunato Developments, the company developing the Type-18 Gardes that currently compose the majority of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s main force. Norio ranked first during pilot training and had little respect for other trainees, developing a rivalry with Nagate given the special treatment he receives, unaware of his background or circumstances. He is initially assigned the call number TS-001, and is later assigned to unit 701 before becoming unable to pilot out of anxiety from guilt for directly causing Hoshijiro's death. His body is later taken over by Ochiai's mind and discarded once Ochiai's plan to transfer his mind to Kanata's body is complete. Norio barely survives, albeit with no memories of his time under Ochiai's control, and becomes a pilot once more. Having trained on a Tsugumori combat simulator since childhood just like Nagate, Kunato is entrusted with the Tsugumori Custom 2 after Nagate receives the more advanced Yukimori. Kunato is one of several crew members to stay on ''Sidonia'' once it is repaired.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Eiko Yamano}}|\u5c71\u91ce \u6804\u5b50|Yamano Eiko}}\n:{{Voiced by|Nanako Mori|[[Karen Strassman]]}}\n:A brown-haired female Garde pilot with the call number TS-290, Yamano is hostile and curt towards Nagate and is similarly cold and unfriendly towards her other squadmates. Yamano is in Nagate's squad during his first mission outside ''Sidonia'' and is quickly killed by the target Gauna, making her the first Gauna-related death in a century. Said Gauna takes on her form, causing much distress for her squadmates and causing Nagate to experience recurring nightmares until he eliminates the Gauna.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Mochikuni Akai}}|\u8d64\u4e95 \u6301\u56fd|Akai Mochikuni}}\n:{{Voiced by|S\u014dma Sait\u014d|[[Grant George]]}}\n:Leader of the Akai squad and designated unit 001. He was the youngest Gravity Cup winner and held it for 13 successive cups. Akai is killed along with his entire squad, including his girlfriend and Yuhata's older brother, during a Gauna attack on ''Sidonia''.<ref name=\"en_vol_1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.com/book/223591/knights-of-sidonia-volume-1-by-tsutomu-nihei|title=''Knights of Sidonia'', volume 1|publisher=[[Random House]]|accessdate=2013-05-17}}</ref>\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Hinata Momose}}|\u767e\u702c\u65e5\u5411|Momose Hinata}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiromi Igarashi]]|[[Becca Ordonez]]}}\n:Mochikuni Akai's girlfriend and member of his squad, designated unit 002. She is killed during a battle against Gauna 487.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Kashiwade Aoki}}|\u9752\u6728 \u67cf\u624b|Aoki Kashiwade}}\n:{{Voiced by|Shinobu Matsumoto|[[Christopher Corey Smith|Steve Heiser]]}}\n:Member of the Akai squad and designated unit 003. He is killed during a battle against Gauna 487.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Izumo Midorikawa}}|\u7dd1\u5ddd \u51fa\u96f2|Midorikawa Izumo}}\n:{{Voiced by|Yuto Suzuki|[[Doug Erholtz]]}}\n:Yuhata Midorikawa's older brother and a member of the Akai squad, designated unit 004. He is killed during a battle against Gauna 487.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ittan Samari}}|\u30b5\u30de\u30ea \u30a4\u30c3\u30bf\u30f3|Samari Ittan}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Atsuko Tanaka (voice actress)|Atsuko Tanaka]]|[[Cindy Robinson]]}}\n:Leader of the Samari squad and designated unit 005. A senior pilot and the original test pilot for the Type-19, before it was reassigned to Nagate due to an emergency. She is the highest ranked pilot following the deaths of the Akai squad, usually acting as field commander during missions. It is implied that Samari enters a relationship with Seii following the colonization of the Lem system.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Tonami}}|\u571f\u6d6a}}\n:Member of the original Samari squad and designated unit 006. He is killed during a battle against Gauna 492 when a Heigus particle blast is reflected back.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nihei|first=Tsutomu|title=Knights of Sidonia Vol. 3|publisher=Vertical inc, New York|isbn=9781935654827|page=67}}</ref>\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|K\u014dichi Tsuruuchi}}|\u5f26\u6253 \u653b\u5e02|Tsuruuchi K\u014dichi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dsuke Toriumi]]|[[Spike Spencer]]}}\n:Leader of the Tsuruuchi squad and former member of the Samari squad, designated unit 007. A running gag is Tsuruuchi making advances on Samari just to be rejected by her with comic results. During the fight against Chimera Ochiai, Tsuruuchi sacrifices himself in an attempt to take it down.

Seii is one of the more serious and experienced Garde pilots. In the manga, Seii wears a distinctive vintage helmet that covers most of his face. Seii is the one who initially spreads the rumor about Samari photosynthesizing with male pilots who rack up high kill counts to boost pilot morale. It is implied that he eventually enters a relationship with Samari and fathers several children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|D\u014d Imada}}|\u4eca\u7530}}\n: Leader of the Imada squad (Nakazono squad in the anime), designated unit 139.

She is critically injured in the battle against Gauna 488, the same battle Shizuka was killed in, remaining in a coma for several months. En holds some distaste for Nagate, thinking he is a pervert for walking in on her and her sisters naked more than once.

She wears a mask in public to hide her emotions and the fact that she is ageless. She was formerly a Garde pilot and friends with Nagate's grandfather, becoming his legal guardian after he emerges from the underworks. Kobayashi cares about Nagate, but is forced by the Immortal Ship Committee to assign him to all missions available, which many see as a death sentence due to the low survival rate of pilots after successive sorties. This is actually the Committee's intention, as they want Nagate to be killed before someone discovers his natural immortality. After the Immortal Ship Committee attempts to impeach and replace her, Kobayashi orders their deaths instead, assuming full control of the ship to pool its resources on the war against the Gauna without questioning. Kobayashi has a habit of spending her off time blending in with the general population, made easier by the fact that only a select few people actually know what she looks like under her mask. After the assault on the Large Mass Union Ship, Kobayashi discards her mask for good. She later elects to stay on Lem VII once it is colonized, passing command of the repaired ''Sidonia'' to Yuhata Midorikawa.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Hiroki Sait\u014d}}|\u658e\u85e4 \u30d2\u30ed\u30ad|Sait\u014d Hiroki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|[[Michael McConnohie]]}}\n:Nagate's 'grandfather' who also taught Nagate how to pilot Gardes. Sait\u014d was ''Sidonia''{{'}}s former ace pilot who saved the ship from being overrun by the Gauna 100 years before the events of the series. This was accomplished by retrieving and using the Kabizashi that Ochiai had discarded. After the battle, Sait\u014d disappeared, just to reappear 80 years later, with his body growing old after renouncing his immortality, as he chose to die naturally. Several advanced immortal clones were grown from his DNA and when Sait\u014d learned that the clones grown for him were going to have his memories implanted on them, he stole one of the infants and raised him by himself as a regular child, who would grow up as Nagate Tanikaze. He also taught Nagate all his piloting expertise before dying.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Yure Shinatose}}|\u79d1\u6238\u702c \u30e6\u30ec|Shinatose Yure}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]|[[Becca Ordonez]]}}\n:Izana's grandmother and an immortal crew member. Dr. Shinatose was the scientist who devised the plan to repopulate ''Sidonia'' with genetically engineered clones after its population was devastated and almost decimated in the Fourth Defensive War against the Gauna. The survivors included 25 council members and 392 citizens. Dr. Shinatose's plan would increase ''Sidonia''{{'}}s population to 500,000 in 100 years (six generations), while accounting for the lost food production facilities by genetically altering its future population to photosynthesize, reducing the need to consume food to once per week. Dr. Shinatose later oversaw the development of the Gauna/human hybrid Tsumugi. Yure is among the crew members who colonize Lem VII.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Lala Hiyama}}|\u30d2\u5c71 \u30e9\u30e9\u30a1|Hiyama Rar\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Barbara Goodson]]}}\n:A talking bear who serves as \"dorm mother,\" taking care of Nagate's living quarters and making his food until he starts living by himself. Hiyama, a member of the original Immortal Ship Committee, was formerly a Garde pilot and served with Kobayashi and Sait\u014d, with whom she participated in the exploration mission to an alien artifact where the Kabizashi were first discovered 600 years before the start of the series. Her bear body is actually an advanced cybernetic life support suit that sustains her human body, which is severely deteriorated due to being subjected to a severe Gauna infection, leaving only her brain unscathed. It is unknown why the suit looks like a bear, though during a flashback, she is seen in an earlier model resembling a bulky diving suit. Hiyama's right hand was lost sometime in the past and was replaced with a three-fingered mechanical claw, though it does not hinder her in any way. She strongly dislikes being addressed by her given name and only ever gave the privilege to Sait\u014d, violently attacking anyone else who addresses her as Lala. As she sees Sait\u014d and Nagate as one and the same, Nagate is the only other person who can get away with calling her Lala. Hiyama is possibly a nod to Nihei's manga ''Biomega'', which features a supporting character named Kozlov, who is also a bear missing a hand. After the war, Hiyama decides to stay on ''Sidonia'' as it departs from Lem-VII in search for more planets to colonize.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ochiai}}|\u843d\u5408}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takehito Koyasu]]|[[Pete Sepenuk]]}}\n:The series' major antagonist, he is a scientist and researcher on the Gauna's behavior and biology who once discarded all of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s Kabizashi, certain that it attracts the Gauna to them, but this has not stopped the ship from being attacked and almost overrun by the aliens. He escaped execution because a large part of Sidionia's data was transferred to a separate database that can only be accessed through his brain, thus his memories were sealed and his brain transferred to a clone of his. However, a copy of his memories was stored in a separate location and later transferred to Kunato's body, allowing him to resume his research, leading to the advent of Tsumugi and Kanata. Ochiai finally reveals himself when he transfers his memories to Kanata's body, assuming control of the Chimera and leaving ''Sidonia'', believing that the Gauna are a superior life form. Chimera Ochiai later reappears during the assault on the Large Mass Union Ship, intending to gather enough Heigus particles to use his organic Gravitational Beam Emitter and destroy ''Sidonia''. He is eventually killed within the Lem star by Nagate.\n\n==Other characters==\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Numi Tahiro}}|\u7530\u5bdb \u30cc\u30df|Tahiro Numi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Sat\u014d]]|[[Reba Buhr]]}}\n:A female scientist working in the Extraterrestrial Research Division (ERD) studying the Gauna and assigned to research a human-like sample extracted by Nagate. One observation she has regarding the Hoshijiro ena is that is always looks in the direction of the Kabizashi, this information is immediately classified. She is later put under mind control by Ochiai and put to work under him until she is forced to kill herself upon being questioned by her research on the Gauna.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Sasaki}}|\u4f50\u3005\u6728}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takako Honda]]|[[Cindy Robinson]]}}\n:Head of {{Nihongo|Toha Heavy Industries|\u6771\u4e9c\u91cd\u5de5|T\u014da J\u016bk\u014d}} R&D.

He also is responsible for the maintenance of Teruru's artificial body.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Mozuku Kunato}}|\u5c90\u795e \u6d77\u860a|Kunato Mozuku}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]]|[[Erin Fitzgerald]]}}\n:Kunato's 'sister' who is killed and restored by Ochiai after he possesses the body of her brother, brainwashing her to take part on his plans. The brainwashed Mozuku participates into some battles piloting Tsumugi, before the Chimera becomes confident enough to sortie without assistance. Her original personality is eventually restored and she elects to remain on ''Sidonia'' once it is repaired.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Crimson Hawk Moth|Crimson [[Sphingidae|Hawk Moth]]}}|\u7d05\u5929\u86fe|Benisuzume}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:Also known by the official designations Gauna 489, Gauna 490, and Gauna 491, the \"Crimson Hawk Moths\" are a trio of powerful and persistent Gauna that initially take the form of red, organic copies of Shizuka Hoshijiro's Garde, unit 702, possessing the same specifications as a Type-18 unit down to the ability to transmit radio messages over Hoshijiro's frequency. In the first encounter against the trio, Gauna 489 is destroyed, while Nagate is able to retrieve a piece of Gauna 491's placenta, which is a near perfect copy of Hoshijiro, possessing simple, infantile intelligence and wearing an organic \"suit.\" Gauna 491 is eventually taken by Ochiai (inhabiting Kunato's body), impregnated, and used to create the Chimeras Kanata and Tsumugi, evidently dying in the process. Gauna 490 continues to pursue and attack ''Sidonia'' several times, eventually evolving into a form resembling a giant, [[biomechanoid|biomechanical]] Hoshijiro and doing battle with Nagate and Tsumugi in the planet Lem IX's atmosphere. True Body of Gauna 490 is eventually destroyed in close combat by Nagate, and its placenta, having invaded Nagate's cockpit during the battle and again resembling Hoshijiro, is recovered and placed in storage. Tsumugi's consciousness is later transferred to one of the captured samples, overwriting what little remained of Hoshijiro's personality.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Kanata}}|\u304b\u306a\u305f}}\n:A second Gauna/Human hybrid, far more powerful than Tsumugi, but mentally unstable. Instead of being destroyed, she was put into sleep, as Captain Kobayashi is interested in the Gravitational Beam Emitter, a powerful long range weapon installed on her right eye that could help ''Sidonia'' get rid of the Gauna threat for good. Once the weapon is mass produced, Kobayashi gives orders to dismantle Kanata, but its body is hijacked by Ochiai. Nagate eventually destroys Kanata's body along with Ochiai's consciousness during a battle within the Lem star's [[stellar corona|corona]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ry\u014dko Takahashi}}|\u9ad8\u6a4b \u4eae\u5b50|Takahashi Ry\u014dko}}\n:{{Voiced by|Charmaine Tan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afachan.asia/2014/03/interview-with-our-knights-of-sidonia-audition-winner|title=Interview with our Knights of Sidonia Audition Winner \u2013 Charmaine Tan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518194727/http://www.afachan.asia/2014/03/interview-with-our-knights-of-sidonia-audition-winner/|archivedate=2014-05-18}}</ref>|[[Erin Fitzgerald]]}}\n:An Aide Controller whose face is always covered by a mask.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Tsutomu Nihei}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Knights of Sidonia]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Knights of Sidonia'' characters}}\n{{notability|date=January 2020}}\nThis is a list of the characters for the [[manga]]/[[anime]] series ''[[Knights of Sidonia]]'' by [[Tsutomu Nihei]].\n\n==Main characters==\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Nagate Tanikaze}}|\u8c37\u98a8 \u9577\u9053|Tanikaze Nagate}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ry\u014dta \u014csaka]]|[[Johnny Yong Bosch]]}}\n:The series main protagonist, who was raised by his grandfather Hiroki Sait\u014d deep inside ''Sidonia'', thus he did not undergo the special genetic treatment to develop the ability to sustain himself through photosynthesis and must eat on a daily basis like a regular human for nutrition. Later it is revealed he is actually Sait\u014d's clone, inheriting not only engineered features like fast wound recovery and immortality, but also Sait\u014d's natural talent as a pilot and warrior. Trained since childhood on a Garde simulator, Nagate is entrusted with Sait\u014d's Garde, the legendary Type-17 {{Nihongo|\"Tsugumori\"|\u7d99\u885b}}, and just like his \"grandfather,\" he eventually becomes ''Sidonia''{{'}}s top ace, saving the ship from the Gauna invasion on several occasions. Nagate later is entrusted with most advanced units, like the first prototype of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s Type-19, an upgraded version of Tsugumori, the {{Nihongo|\"Tsugumori Custom 2\"|\u7d99\u885b\u6539\u4e8c|Tsugumori kai ni}}, and the first prototype of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s Type-20, labeled {{Nihongo|\"Yukimori\"|\u52ab\u885b}}. Initially assigned the call number TS-028, he is later designated unit 704 when he is promoted to full pilot status. Nagate later fathers a child with Tsumugi, whose consciousness now resides in one of the captured Crimson Hawk Moth samples, after ''Sidonia'' defeats the Large Mass Union Ship and colonizes the Lem star system.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Shizuka Hoshijiro}}|\u661f\u767d \u9591|Hoshijiro Shizuka}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:A fellow Garde pilot, ranked number two among the trainees, who Nagate meets and becomes his love interest. Initially assigned to call number TS-336, she is assigned to unit 702 when she is promoted to full pilot. She is later killed and absorbed by Gauna 490, which uses her DNA and memories to develop a powerful Garde-like Gauna known as {{Nihongo|Crimson [[Sphingidae|Hawk Moth]]|\u7d05\u5929\u86fe|Benisuzume}}. A placenta sample resembling her is also retrieved by Nagate, and Ochiai impregnates it using human DNA to create Tsumugi and Kanata.\n\n;{{Nihongo|Tsumugi Shiraui|\u767d\u7fbd\u8863 \u3064\u3080\u304e|Shiraui Tsumugi}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:A Gauna/human hybrid created by Kunato Developments for fighting against the Gauna. Tsumugi is similar in size to a Garde, but has a Gauna-like appearance in the shape of a young woman wearing a dress. Tsumugi eventually becomes friends with Nagate and Izana, usually interacting with them using a tentacle she sneaks in through the ship's ventilation system while the rest of her body stays in her chambers. Tsumugi displays a gentle, curious, child-like demeanor under most circumstances, but her prowess in combat is rivaled only by Nagate's. Just like Shizuka, she eventually develops feelings for Nagate and much to her surprise, he ends up accepting them, despite her inhuman form. Tsumugi is equipped with an organic artificial kabi cannon and retractable claws made of artificial kabi. She also has a hollow chest cavity holding an organic cockpit that allows a pilot to direct and support her in battle. Tsumugi naturally generates Heigus particles within her body and is able to easily out-fly even the most advanced Garde models. Tsumugi eventually sacrifices her hybrid body to rescue Nagate from the Lem star after his battle with Chimera Ochiai, using her body as shield to protect him from the heat. Her consciousness is later transferred to one of the captured Hoshijiro-like Gauna samples from the Crimson Hawk Moths and she enters a true relationship with Nagate, eventually giving birth to a daughter, {{Nihongo|Nodoka|\u9577\u9591}}. According to Tsumugi, Hoshijiro's memories still reside within her new body, though they are vague.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Izana Shinatose}}|\u79d1\u6238\u702c \u30a4\u30b6\u30ca|Shinatose Izana}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Aki Toyosaki]]|[[Melissa Fahn]]}}\n:Belonging to an [[intersex]] [[third gender]] that originated during the hundreds of years of human emigration into space, Izana is also a Garde pilot and quickly becomes Nagate's best friend and eventual roommate, later falling in love with him. This attraction causes Izana's body to undergo a transformation into that of a female. Izana loses an arm and a leg during a battle against the Gauna and has them replaced with prosthetic limbs that allow her to operate complex machinery with far more skill than an ordinary person. A system is also installed on Izana's Garde unit that funnels sensor and radar information directly into her brain via her artificial arm, granting her unparalleled detection abilities surpassing even ''Sidonia''{{'}}s systems. She is often assigned to recon and spotting duties in battle. Initially TS-291, Izana is later assigned to unit 723. Ten years after the destruction of the Large Mass Union Ship and ''Sidonia''{{'}}s colonization of the Lem star system. Izana is one of several crew members to depart on a repaired ''Sidonia'' to parts unknown. Izana is referred to using [[gender neutral]] pronouns in the original Japanese dialogue. Because the English language lacks an appropriate equivalent, she is often referred to using feminine pronouns for the sake of simplicity.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Yuhata Midorikawa}}|\u7dd1\u5ddd \u7e88|Midorikawa Yuhata}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hisako Kanemoto]]|[[Marieve Herington]]}}\n:A friend of Nagate and Izana, she later develops feelings for Nagate and competes with Izana for his attention. Initially a Garde pilot in-training with the call number TS-256, she is promoted to commander's aide after Seii returns to full-time piloting duty, eventually moving into Nagate's home. Yuhata makes a hobby of building and customizing [[plamo|plastic model]] kits of Garde units in her spare time. Ten years after ''Sidonia'' colonizes the Lem star system, Yuhata undergoes a [[gender reassignment]] process and becomes male. Yuhata also becomes commander of a repaired ''Sidonia'', which continues on in search of more planets to colonize.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Teruru Ichigaya}}|\u5e02\u30f6\u8c37 \u30c6\u30eb\u30eb|Ichigaya Teruru}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Yukari Tamura]]}}\n:A [[gynoid]] developed with the purpose of avoiding detection from the Gauna, she is the sole survivor of a colonization expedition on the planet Lem VII. Despite refusing Nagate's help, claiming that he is responsible for the Gauna attacking ''Sidonia'', she is rescued by him nonetheless and, without a place to return to, she is taken under his guard. Teruru claims to be unconcerned towards Nagate, but her actions usually imply otherwise. She later joins the war effort as the pilot of one of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s new ''Mizuki''-class warships. Her body has a special automatic defense mechanism built in, which activates when she feels threatened or flustered. This causes her artificial skin to harden, leaving her with a more robotic, puppet-like appearance. Being a machine, Teruru is able to survive in the vacuum of space without support, even if her body is severely damaged. Teruru is one of several crew members who decide to stay on the repaired ''Sidonia'', departing to search for more planets to colonize.\n\n==Garde Pilots==\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Norio Kunato}}|\u5c90\u795e \u6d77\u82d4\u592b|Kunato Norio}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takahiro Sakurai]]|[[Todd Haberkorn]]}}\n:A fellow male Garde pilot with long white hair, heir of Kunato Developments, the company developing the Type-18 Gardes that currently compose the majority of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s main force. Norio ranked first during pilot training and had little respect for other trainees, developing a rivalry with Nagate given the special treatment he receives, unaware of his background or circumstances. He is initially assigned the call number TS-001, and is later assigned to unit 701 before becoming unable to pilot out of anxiety from guilt for directly causing Hoshijiro's death. His body is later taken over by Ochiai's mind and discarded once Ochiai's plan to transfer his mind to Kanata's body is complete. Norio barely survives, albeit with no memories of his time under Ochiai's control, and becomes a pilot once more. Having trained on a Tsugumori combat simulator since childhood just like Nagate, Kunato is entrusted with the Tsugumori Custom 2 after Nagate receives the more advanced Yukimori. Kunato is one of several crew members to stay on ''Sidonia'' once it is repaired.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Eiko Yamano}}|\u5c71\u91ce \u6804\u5b50|Yamano Eiko}}\n:{{Voiced by|Nanako Mori|[[Karen Strassman]]}}\n:A brown-haired female Garde pilot with the call number TS-290, Yamano is hostile and curt towards Nagate and is similarly cold and unfriendly towards her other squadmates. Yamano is in Nagate's squad during his first mission outside ''Sidonia'' and is quickly killed by the target Gauna, making her the first Gauna-related death in a century. Said Gauna takes on her form, causing much distress for her squadmates and causing Nagate to experience recurring nightmares until he eliminates the Gauna.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Mochikuni Akai}}|\u8d64\u4e95 \u6301\u56fd|Akai Mochikuni}}\n:{{Voiced by|S\u014dma Sait\u014d|[[Grant George]]}}\n:Leader of the Akai squad and designated unit 001.

A running gag is Tsuruuchi making advances on Samari just to be rejected by her with comic results. During the fight against Chimera Ochiai, Tsuruuchi sacrifices himself in an attempt to take it down. He is later discovered alive, albeit severely injured, and manages to eventually make a full recovery.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ichir\u014d Seii}}|\u52e2\u5a01 \u4e00\u90ce|Seii Ichir\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomohiro Tsuboi]]|[[Joe Ochman|Joey Lotsko]]}}\n:Leader of the Seii squad and designated unit 026, Seii is initially assistant commander before passing his post to Yuhata Midorikawa. Seii is one of the more serious and experienced Garde pilots. In the manga, Seii wears a distinctive vintage helmet that covers most of his face. Seii is the one who initially spreads the rumor about Samari photosynthesizing with male pilots who rack up high kill counts to boost pilot morale. It is implied that he eventually enters a relationship with Samari and fathers several children.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|D\u014d Imada}}|\u4eca\u7530}}\n: Leader of the Imada squad (Nakazono squad in the anime), designated unit 139.

She is critically injured in the battle against Gauna 488, the same battle Shizuka was killed in, remaining in a coma for several months. En holds some distaste for Nagate, thinking he is a pervert for walking in on her and her sisters naked more than once. She also blames him for the accident that injured her.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|H\u014d Honoka}}|\u4ec4 \u70fd|Honoka H\u014d}}\n:Pilot of unit TS-205, then unit 705.

She and En are often found together, with Ren being the more polite and level-headed of the two, especially where Nagate is involved. Ren defends En's behavior by stating that because of the way the Honokas are raised, they are immature despite being physically teenagers and have difficulty controlling their emotions.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ro Honoka}}|\u4ec4 \u7089|Honoka Ro}}\n:Pilot of unit 707.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Y\u014d Honoka}}|\u4ec4 \u71ff|Honoka Y\u014d}}\n:Pilot of unit 708.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Sh\u014d Honoka}}|\u4ec4 \u7092|Honoka Sh\u014d}} \n:The youngest of the Honoka sisters from the second batch of eleven, considered the most skilled pilot among them.

It soon emerges from the Gauna cluster and is revealed to be a giant.

She wears a mask in public to hide her emotions and the fact that she is ageless. She was formerly a Garde pilot and friends with Nagate's grandfather, becoming his legal guardian after he emerges from the underworks. Kobayashi cares about Nagate, but is forced by the Immortal Ship Committee to assign him to all missions available, which many see as a death sentence due to the low survival rate of pilots after successive sorties. This is actually the Committee's intention, as they want Nagate to be killed before someone discovers his natural immortality. After the Immortal Ship Committee attempts to impeach and replace her, Kobayashi orders their deaths instead, assuming full control of the ship to pool its resources on the war against the Gauna without questioning. Kobayashi has a habit of spending her off time blending in with the general population, made easier by the fact that only a select few people actually know what she looks like under her mask. After the assault on the Large Mass Union Ship, Kobayashi discards her mask for good. She later elects to stay on Lem VII once it is colonized, passing command of the repaired ''Sidonia'' to Yuhata Midorikawa.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Hiroki Sait\u014d}}|\u658e\u85e4 \u30d2\u30ed\u30ad|Sait\u014d Hiroki}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rikiya Koyama]]|[[Michael McConnohie]]}}\n:Nagate's 'grandfather' who also taught Nagate how to pilot Gardes. Sait\u014d was ''Sidonia''{{'}}s former ace pilot who saved the ship from being overrun by the Gauna 100 years before the events of the series. This was accomplished by retrieving and using the Kabizashi that Ochiai had discarded. After the battle, Sait\u014d disappeared, just to reappear 80 years later, with his body growing old after renouncing his immortality, as he chose to die naturally. Several advanced immortal clones were grown from his DNA and when Sait\u014d learned that the clones grown for him were going to have his memories implanted on them, he stole one of the infants and raised him by himself as a regular child, who would grow up as Nagate Tanikaze. He also taught Nagate all his piloting expertise before dying.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Yure Shinatose}}|\u79d1\u6238\u702c \u30e6\u30ec|Shinatose Yure}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mamiko Noto]]|[[Becca Ordonez]]}}\n:Izana's grandmother and an immortal crew member. Dr. Shinatose was the scientist who devised the plan to repopulate ''Sidonia'' with genetically engineered clones after its population was devastated and almost decimated in the Fourth Defensive War against the Gauna. The survivors included 25 council members and 392 citizens. Dr. Shinatose's plan would increase ''Sidonia''{{'}}s population to 500,000 in 100 years (six generations), while accounting for the lost food production facilities by genetically altering its future population to photosynthesize, reducing the need to consume food to once per week. Dr. Shinatose later oversaw the development of the Gauna/human hybrid Tsumugi. Yure is among the crew members who colonize Lem VII.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Lala Hiyama}}|\u30d2\u5c71 \u30e9\u30e9\u30a1|Hiyama Rar\u0101}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Satomi Arai]]|[[Barbara Goodson]]}}\n:A talking bear who serves as \"dorm mother,\" taking care of Nagate's living quarters and making his food until he starts living by himself. Hiyama, a member of the original Immortal Ship Committee, was formerly a Garde pilot and served with Kobayashi and Sait\u014d, with whom she participated in the exploration mission to an alien artifact where the Kabizashi were first discovered 600 years before the start of the series. Her bear body is actually an advanced cybernetic life support suit that sustains her human body, which is severely deteriorated due to being subjected to a severe Gauna infection, leaving only her brain unscathed. It is unknown why the suit looks like a bear, though during a flashback, she is seen in an earlier model resembling a bulky diving suit. Hiyama's right hand was lost sometime in the past and was replaced with a three-fingered mechanical claw, though it does not hinder her in any way. She strongly dislikes being addressed by her given name and only ever gave the privilege to Sait\u014d, violently attacking anyone else who addresses her as Lala. As she sees Sait\u014d and Nagate as one and the same, Nagate is the only other person who can get away with calling her Lala. Hiyama is possibly a nod to Nihei's manga ''Biomega'', which features a supporting character named Kozlov, who is also a bear missing a hand. After the war, Hiyama decides to stay on ''Sidonia'' as it departs from Lem-VII in search for more planets to colonize.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ochiai}}|\u843d\u5408}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takehito Koyasu]]|[[Pete Sepenuk]]}}\n:The series' major antagonist, he is a scientist and researcher on the Gauna's behavior and biology who once discarded all of ''Sidonia''{{'}}s Kabizashi, certain that it attracts the Gauna to them, but this has not stopped the ship from being attacked and almost overrun by the aliens. He escaped execution because a large part of Sidionia's data was transferred to a separate database that can only be accessed through his brain, thus his memories were sealed and his brain transferred to a clone of his. However, a copy of his memories was stored in a separate location and later transferred to Kunato's body, allowing him to resume his research, leading to the advent of Tsumugi and Kanata. Ochiai finally reveals himself when he transfers his memories to Kanata's body, assuming control of the Chimera and leaving ''Sidonia'', believing that the Gauna are a superior life form. Chimera Ochiai later reappears during the assault on the Large Mass Union Ship, intending to gather enough Heigus particles to use his organic Gravitational Beam Emitter and destroy ''Sidonia''. He is eventually killed within the Lem star by Nagate.\n\n==Other characters==\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Numi Tahiro}}|\u7530\u5bdb \u30cc\u30df|Tahiro Numi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rina Sat\u014d]]|[[Reba Buhr]]}}\n:A female scientist working in the Extraterrestrial Research Division (ERD) studying the Gauna and assigned to research a human-like sample extracted by Nagate. One observation she has regarding the Hoshijiro ena is that is always looks in the direction of the Kabizashi, this information is immediately classified. She is later put under mind control by Ochiai and put to work under him until she is forced to kill herself upon being questioned by her research on the Gauna.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Sasaki}}|\u4f50\u3005\u6728}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takako Honda]]|[[Cindy Robinson]]}}\n:Head of {{Nihongo|Toha Heavy Industries|\u6771\u4e9c\u91cd\u5de5|T\u014da J\u016bk\u014d}} R&D.

Made redundant after Kunato began production of Type-18 as there were no need for hand-crafted parts. His works are requested again upon the development of the more refined Type-19. He also is responsible for the maintenance of Teruru's artificial body.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Mozuku Kunato}}|\u5c90\u795e \u6d77\u860a|Kunato Mozuku}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ayane Sakura]]|[[Erin Fitzgerald]]}}\n:Kunato's 'sister' who is killed and restored by Ochiai after he possesses the body of her brother, brainwashing her to take part on his plans. The brainwashed Mozuku participates into some battles piloting Tsumugi, before the Chimera becomes confident enough to sortie without assistance. Her original personality is eventually restored and she elects to remain on ''Sidonia'' once it is repaired.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Crimson Hawk Moth|Crimson [[Sphingidae|Hawk Moth]]}}|\u7d05\u5929\u86fe|Benisuzume}}\n:{{voiced by|[[Aya Suzaki]]|[[Stephanie Sheh]]}}\n:Also known by the official designations Gauna 489, Gauna 490, and Gauna 491, the \"Crimson Hawk Moths\" are a trio of powerful and persistent Gauna that initially take the form of red, organic copies of Shizuka Hoshijiro's Garde, unit 702, possessing the same specifications as a Type-18 unit down to the ability to transmit radio messages over Hoshijiro's frequency. In the first encounter against the trio, Gauna 489 is destroyed, while Nagate is able to retrieve a piece of Gauna 491's placenta, which is a near perfect copy of Hoshijiro, possessing simple, infantile intelligence and wearing an organic \"suit.\" Gauna 491 is eventually taken by Ochiai (inhabiting Kunato's body), impregnated, and used to create the Chimeras Kanata and Tsumugi, evidently dying in the process. Gauna 490 continues to pursue and attack ''Sidonia'' several times, eventually evolving into a form resembling a giant, [[biomechanoid|biomechanical]] Hoshijiro and doing battle with Nagate and Tsumugi in the planet Lem IX's atmosphere. True Body of Gauna 490 is eventually destroyed in close combat by Nagate, and its placenta, having invaded Nagate's cockpit during the battle and again resembling Hoshijiro, is recovered and placed in storage. Tsumugi's consciousness is later transferred to one of the captured samples, overwriting what little remained of Hoshijiro's personality.\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Kanata}}|\u304b\u306a\u305f}}\n:A second Gauna/Human hybrid, far more powerful than Tsumugi, but mentally unstable. Instead of being destroyed, she was put into sleep, as Captain Kobayashi is interested in the Gravitational Beam Emitter, a powerful long range weapon installed on her right eye that could help ''Sidonia'' get rid of the Gauna threat for good. Once the weapon is mass produced, Kobayashi gives orders to dismantle Kanata, but its body is hijacked by Ochiai. Nagate eventually destroys Kanata's body along with Ochiai's consciousness during a battle within the Lem star's [[corona]].\n\n;{{Nihongo|{{va|Ry\u014dko Takahashi}}|\u9ad8\u6a4b \u4eae\u5b50|Takahashi Ry\u014dko}}\n:{{Voiced by|Charmaine Tan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afachan.asia/2014/03/interview-with-our-knights-of-sidonia-audition-winner|title=Interview with our Knights of Sidonia Audition Winner \u2013 Charmaine Tan|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518194727/http://www.afachan.asia/2014/03/interview-with-our-knights-of-sidonia-audition-winner/|archivedate=2014-05-18}}</ref>|[[Erin Fitzgerald]]}}\n:An Aide Controller whose face is always covered by a mask.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Tsutomu Nihei}}\n\n[[Category:Lists of anime and manga characters|Knights of Sidonia]]\n", "name_user": "Netoholic", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOther characters:post-move link fix", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Knights_of_Sidonia_characters"}
