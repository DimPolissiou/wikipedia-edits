When joined by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]] as a fourth member, they are called '''Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young''' ('''CSNY'''). They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies, often tumultuous interpersonal relationships, political activism, and lasting influence on [[Music of the United States|American music]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|culture]].\n\nCSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby, Stills and Nash performed together informally in July of that year, discovering they harmonized well. Crosby had been asked to leave [[The Byrds]] in late 1967, and Stills' band [[Buffalo Springfield]] had broken up in early 1968; Nash left his band [[The Hollies]] in December, and by early 1969 the trio had signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. Their first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969, from which came two [[Top 40]] hits, \"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]. In order to tour the album, the trio hired drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and session bassist [[Greg Reeves]], though they still needed a keyboardist;  [[Ahmet Ertegun]] suggested [[Neil Young]], who had played with Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and after some initial reluctance, the trio agreed, signing him on as a full member. The band, now named Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, started their tour, and played their second gig at [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning hours of August 18, 1969. The first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', reached number one in several international charts in 1970, and remains their best selling album, going on to sell over 8 million copies with three hit singles. Four singles were released from the album including \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11], \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16], and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]. The group's second tour, which produced the live double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'' (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by [[John Barbata]], and tensions with Stills, which resulted in his being temporarily dismissed from the band. At the end of the tour the band split up.  The group have since reunited several times, sometimes with and sometimes without Young, and have released eight studio and four live albums.\n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and all three members were also inducted for their work in other groups (Crosby for [[the Byrds]], Stills for [[Buffalo Springfield]] and Nash for [[the Hollies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/alphabetical/ |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> Neil Young has also been inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield. They have not made a group studio album since 1999's ''[[Looking Forward]]'', and are inactive as of 2020. Whether or not this break is permanent remains to be seen, as the group has often been inactive for years at a time.\n\n==History==\n===CSN Formation and debut album: July 1968 \u2013 May 1969===\nPrior to the formation of CSN, each member of the band had belonged to another prominent group. David Crosby played guitar, sang and wrote songs with [[the Byrds]]; Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist and songwriter in the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] (which also featured [[Neil Young]]); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer and songwriter with [[The Hollies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/crosby-stills-nash-young-mn0000130036/biography|work=allmusic.com|author= William Ruhlmann|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Biography by William Ruhlmann}}</ref>\n\nCrosby had been sacked from the Byrds in October 1967 due to disagreements over his songwriting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kZBKDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT93#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=93|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|publisher=Hachette UK|date=23 Sep 2008 }}</ref> By early 1968, Buffalo Springfield had disintegrated, and after aiding in putting together the band's final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', Stills was without a band. Stills and Crosby began meeting informally and jamming. The result of one encounter in Florida on Crosby's [[schooner]] was the song \"[[Wooden Ships]]\", composed in collaboration with another guest, [[Paul Kantner]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 65</ref> Graham Nash had been introduced to Crosby when the Byrds had toured the United Kingdom in 1966, and when the Hollies ventured to California in 1968, Nash resumed his acquaintance with him.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 103</ref> At a party in July 1968 at [[Joni Mitchell]]'s house, Nash asked Stills and Crosby to repeat their performance of a new song by Stills, \"You Don't Have To Cry\", with Nash improvising a third part harmony.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 72\u20133</ref> The vocals gelled, and the three realized that they had a very good vocal chemistry. It is disputed by members of the group whether it was at the house of Joni Mitchell or [[Cass Elliot]]. Stephen Stills recalls that it was at the house of Cass Elliot \u2013 he would have been too intimidated to sing as a group in front of Joni Mitchell for the first time. Nash and Crosby insist that the location was Joni Mitchell's home.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/02/laurel-canyon-music-scene|title=An Oral History of Laurel Canyon, the Sixties and Seventies Music Mecca|author=Lisa Robinson|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCreatively frustrated with the Hollies, Nash decided to quit the band in December 1968, and flew to Los Angeles two days later. The trio stayed in London in early 1969 to rehearse for what turned out to be an unsuccessful audition with [[The Beatles]]' [[Apple Records]]. However, back in California, [[Ahmet Ertegun]], who had been a fan of Buffalo Springfield and was disappointed by that band's demise signed them to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 144.</ref> From the outset, given their previous experiences, the trio decided not to be locked into a group structure. They used their surnames as identification to ensure independence and a guarantee that the band could not continue without one of them, unlike both the Byrds and the Hollies. They picked up a management team in [[Elliot Roberts]] and [[David Geffen]], who got them signed to Atlantic and would help to gain clout for the group in the industry.<ref>McDonough, p. 252.</ref> Roberts kept the band focused and dealt with egos, while Geffen handled the business deals, since, in Crosby's words, they needed a \"shark\" and Geffen was it.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pg. 79</ref>\n\nStills was already signed to Atlantic Records through his Buffalo Springfield contract. Crosby had been released from his Byrds deal with Columbia, as he was considered to be unimportant and too difficult to work with. Nash, however, was still signed to [[Epic Records]] through The Hollies. Ertegun worked out a deal with [[Clive Davis]] to essentially trade Nash to Atlantic in exchange for [[Richie Furay]] (who was also signed to Atlantic by virtue of his membership in Buffalo Springfield) and [[Poco]], his new band.<ref>Robert Greenfield. ''The Last Sultan: The Life and Times of Ahmet Ertegun.'' Simon and Schuster. 2011. 202-3.</ref>\n\nThe trio's first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969. The eponymously titled album was a major hit in the United States, peaking at #6 on the ''Billboard'' album chart during a 107-week stay that spawned two [[Top 40]] hits (\"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]) and significant airplay on [[FM radio]]. The album ultimately earned a RIAA [[platinum album|triple platinum]] certification in 1999 and [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=379|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=305|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=crosby,%20stills&col=certification_date&ord=asc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> With the exceptions of drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker \"Captain Many Hands\" by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album's commercial impact.\n\n===CSNY, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu to 4 Way Street: August 1969 \u2013 April 1971===\nRetaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player. Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist [[Steve Winwood]], who was already occupied with the newly formed group [[Blind Faith]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 92</ref> Ertegun suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 163\u20134</ref> Stills and Nash initially held reservations; Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield, and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young. But after several meetings, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner. The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]].\n\nThey initially completed the rhythm section with former Buffalo Springfield bassist [[Bruce Palmer]]. However, Palmer was let go due to his persistent personal problems following rehearsals at the [[Cafe au Go Go]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]]; according to Crosby, \"Bruce Palmer was into [[drug injection|another instrument]] and his head was not where it should have been.\"<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\">Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94</ref> Teenaged [[Motown]] session bassist [[Greg Reeves]] joined in Palmer's place at the recommendation of [[Rick James]], a friend of the band.<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\"/>\n\nWith Young on board, the restructured group embarked on a four-leg, 39-date tour that ended with three European concerts in January 1970. Their first gig was on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. They mentioned they were going to someplace called [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] the next day, but that they had no idea where that was. Their one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969, was a [[baptism by fire]]. The crowd of industry friends looking on from offstage was intimidating and prompted Stills to say, \"This is only the second time we've performed in front of people. We're scared shitless.\" Their appearance at the festival and in the subsequent movie ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]],''<ref>Neil Young is notably absent from the documentary film. In an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeEWMnRcrTY interview in 2000 for VH1], he revealed that he objected to being photographed at close quarters, so the cameras avoided him. In February 2019, [https://www.jambase.com/article/woodstock-documentary-bill-gerber-neil-young-janis-joplin it was reported] that plans to release a restored version of the film would include footage of Young.</ref> along with recording the Joni Mitchell [[Woodstock (song)|song memorializing Woodstock]], boosted the visibility of the quartet. CSNY appeared at other prominent festivals that year. Footage from two performances from the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (held on the grounds of the [[Esalen Institute]] on September 13\u201314, 1969) appears in the movie ''[[Celebration at Big Sur]]''. They also appeared at the violence-plagued [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969 alongside [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and the headlining [[Rolling Stones]]. At the band's request, their performance was not included in the subsequent film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (1970).\n\nGreat anticipation had built for the expanded supergroup and their first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', which arrived in stores in March 1970. It topped the charts during a 97-week stay in the United States and generated three hit singles, including the Stills-sung cover of Mitchell's \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11] and both of Nash's contributions (\"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16] and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]). Certified [[Multi-platinum|septuple platinum]] by [[RIAA]], the album's domestic sales currently sit at over 8 million copies; as of 2017, it remains the highest-selling album of each member's career.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greasylake.org/the-circuit/index.php?/topic/106260-neil-young-bob-seger-and-crosby-stills-nash-youngusa-album-sales/|title=NEIL YOUNG, BOB SEGER and CROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG.....USA album sales|website=Greasy Lake Community}}</ref> ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' was also the first release on the Atlantic Records SD-7200 \"superstar\" line, created by the label for its highest-profile artists; subsequent solo albums by Crosby, Stills, and Nash would be the next releases in this series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlantic7200.html |title=Atlantic Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref>\n\nIn consultation with other band members, Stills fired Reeves from the group shortly before the beginning of their second American tour in April 1970 \"because [he] suddenly decided he was an [[Apache]] [[witch doctor]].\"<ref name=csn124>''Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography''. Zimmer & Diltz, pp. 124.</ref> He further opined that \"[Reeves] freaked too much on the bass and no one could keep up because [he] did not play one rhythm the same\u2026 he could play bass imaginatively, but he has to be predictable as well,\" while \"Greg also wanted to sing some of his songs on the CSN&Y show, which I thought was ludicrous, only because the songs weren't great. We'll sing any song if it's great, but not just because it happens to be written by our bass player.\"<ref name=csn124 /> He was replaced by Calvin \"Fuzzy\" Samuels, a homeless Jamaican musician recently discovered by Stills at [[Island Records]]' London studios. Shortly thereafter, Taylor (who frequently clashed with Young over the band's tempos during the first tour and ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' sessions) was also dismissed when Young threatened to leave the group following the first performance of the tour at the [[Denver Coliseum]] on May 12, 1970. Notwithstanding these previous tensions, Taylor would later assert that his dismissal served as a proxy for renewed conflict between Stills and Young in the aftermath of Reeves' firing. Shortly thereafter, drummer [[John Barbata]] (formerly of [[The Turtles]]) was hired for the remainder of the tour and associated recordings. A week before the Denver performance, Young and Crosby were staying at a house near [[San Francisco]] when reports of the [[Kent State shootings]] arrived, inspiring Young to write the protest song \"[[Ohio (1970 song)|Ohio]]\". Recorded and rush-released weeks later with the new rhythm section, it peaked at #14 in August 1970, providing another American [[Top 20]] hit for the group.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 127</ref>\n\nAs the 23-show tour progressed, the tenuous nature of the partnership was strained by Stills' alcohol and [[cocaine]] abuse and perceived [[megalomania]], culminating in an extended solo set not countenanced by the other band members at the [[Fillmore East]] when he was informed that [[Bob Dylan]] was in the audience. In this turbulent atmosphere, Crosby, Nash and Young decided to fire Stills during a two-night stint at Chicago's [[Auditorium Theatre]] in July 1970. Following his reinstatement, the tour ended as scheduled in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] on July 9, 1970; however, the group broke up immediately thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-actual-honest-to-god-reunion-of-crosby-stills-and-nash-19770602|title=The Actual, Honest-to-God Reunion of Crosby, Stills and Nash|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/wild-tales-graham-nash-opens-sex-drugs-music-behind-crosby-stills-nash-young-article-1.1442620|title=In 'Wild Tales,' Graham Nash opens up about sex, drugs and music behind Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|website=Nydailynews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1970|title=Sugar Mountain|website=Sugarmtn.org}}</ref> Concert recordings from that tour assembled by Nash produced the 1971 double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'', which also topped the charts during a 42-week stay. Although they would continue to collaborate in various and largely ephemeral permutations, the four members would not come back together in earnest until their 1974 reunion tour.\n\n===Individual activity===\n{{main|David Crosby|Stephen Stills|Graham Nash|Neil Young}}\nBetween September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young's ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' in September (which peaked at #8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" [#33]); Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|eponymous debut]] in November; Crosby's ''[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]'' in February, and Nash's ''[[Songs for Beginners]]'' in May. Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], Stills' entry (including two Top 40 hits, \"Love the One You're With\" [#14] and \"Sit Yourself Down\" [#37]) peaked the highest at #3. Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971's ''[[Stephen Stills 2]]'', which included two minor hits (\"Change Partners\" [#43]; \"Marianne\" [#42]) and peaked at #8. In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release ''[[Another Stoney Evening]]''.\n\n1972 proved to be another fruitful year for all the band members in their solo or duo efforts. Young achieved solo superstardom with the chart-topping ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' and two Top 40 singles, the #1 hit \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" and \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" (#31). Stills joined with former [[The Byrds|Byrd]] [[Chris Hillman]] to form the band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]], releasing a self-titled double album; although it did not generate any significant hits, counting the three CSN/CSNY records, ''[[Manassas (album)|Manassas]]'' became Stills' sixth Top Ten album in a row, peaking at #4. Nash and Young released Young's \"[[War Song]]\" as a joint single to support [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign; despite their intentions, the single failed to make a serious impression. Meanwhile, Nash and Crosby's touring was so successful and pleasant for them that they recorded and released their first album as a duo, ''[[Graham Nash David Crosby]]'', which eclipsed their recent solo efforts with a Top 40 hit (Nash's \"[[Immigration Man]]\" [#36]) while also peaking at #4.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 151</ref>\n\nThe group members fared less well in 1973. Young recorded two dark albums. The first, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'', chronicled his winter tour that followed the death of his Crazy Horse bandmate [[Danny Whitten]] from an alcohol/[[Valium]] overdose, a tour Crosby and Nash joined mid-way. A critical success despite his personal misgivings, it attained a RIAA gold certification before stalling at #22. The second album, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'', was so dark that [[Reprise Records]] refused to release it until 1975. Although it is widely regarded as his [[magnum opus]], it only reached #25. Crosby spearheaded and produced a [[Byrds (album)|reunion album]] of the original Byrds quintet which was a notable critical failure upon its release in March 1973. The most commercially successful Byrds album since 1966, it sold only marginally well by CSNY's standards, peaking at #20. Stills released a [[Down the Road (Manassas album)|second Manassas record]] in April 1973 and Nash recorded his [[Wild Tales (album)|second solo album]] (released in January 1974); again, neither disc sold to expectations, peaking respectively at #26 and #34.\n\n===CSNY, reconciliation and further estrangement: 1973 \u2013 1976===\n[[Image:CSNY 8-1974 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Stills (left), Crosby and Nash in 1974]]\n\nIn June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young met at Young's ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled ''Human Highway''. However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again. After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco's [[Winterland Ballroom]] in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-04-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-07-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref> Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=crosby+stills+nash+the+biography&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD8avLgrTWAhWDw4MKHXxCA48Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22big+tour%22&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> The quartet [[CSNY 1974|reassembled]] in earnest that summer, with sidemen [[Tim Drummond]] on bass, [[Russ Kunkel]] on drums, and [[Joe Lala]] on percussion, to rehearse at Young's ranch near [[Woodside, California]] before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.\n\nThe tour was directed by San Francisco-based impresario [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]].

Crosby, in particular,  was disillusioned by the bombastic nature of the performances, which he collectively dubbed the \"Doom Tour\": \"We had good monitors, but Stephen and Neil were punching well over 100 db from their half stacks. Graham and I simply couldn't do the harmonies when we couldn't hear ourselves. Also, when you play a stadium you almost have to do a [[Mick Jagger]] where you wave a sash around and prance about.

Under the stewardship of Graham's production company, the tour was plagued by profligate spending, exemplified by a litany of pillowcases embroidered with the band's new Mitchell-designed logo and the routine chartering of helicopters and private jets in lieu of ground transportation. Nash would later recall that \"the tour made just over eleven million dollars, which of course was a lot of money in those days. We all got less than a half million each. It was obvious that between Bill Graham, the promoters and a bunch of others, they all had a good time. Let's just put it that way.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/> According to road manager Chris O'Dell, \"One time they spilled cocaine on the carpet.

While Nash viewed the re-shuffling of items from only two albums and one single (typified by the exclusion of his \"Marrakesh Express\", a Top 40 hit) as absurd, it eventually topped the ''Billboard'' album chart in November.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 176</ref>\n\nAlthough tensions were high between Crosby, Stills and Young, the band reconvened at the [[Record Plant]] in [[Sausalito, California]] with [[The Albert Brothers]] in November to finish the long-gestating follow-up to ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu''. While several songs were completed and recorded (including Young's \"Human Highway\", still envisioned as the provisional title track; a take of Crosby's \"Homeward Through the Haze\" with Crosby on piano and [[Lee Sklar]] on bass; and Nash's [[anti-whaling]] opus \"Wind on the Water\"), Young left once again following a tumultuous argument. While Crosby, Stills and Nash (augmented by a variety of session musicians, including Sklar, Kunkel and [[Grateful Dead]] drummer [[Bill Kreutzmann]]) attempted to complete the album as a trio effort, the feud between Stills and Nash resurfaced, resulting in Stills destroying the master of \"Wind on the Water\" with a razor blade after Crosby and Nash objected to a harmony part on Stills' \"Guardian Angel\". Even though Stills characterized the razor blade incident as a joke, the sessions promptly dissolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=csn%20dave%20zimmer&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiftfnptp_SAhWJjFQKHYdwDesQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=homeward%20through%20the%20haze&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Crosby and Nash signed a separate contract with [[ABC Records]] and began to tour regularly again, playing a more intimate array of sports arenas, outdoor festivals and theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=artist:%28Crosby+%26+Nash%29+date:%5B1975-01-01+TO+1975-12-31%5D |title=Search for setlists: artist:(Crosby & Nash) date:[1975-01-01 TO 1975-12-31 |publisher=setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> During this period they produced two studio albums, ''[[Wind on the Water]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Whistling Down the Wire]]'' in 1976, and the 1977 concert album ''[[Crosby-Nash Live]]''. Along with Drummond (retained from the 1974 CSNY tour), they continued to use the sidemen from the ensemble known as [[The Section (band)|The Section]] from their first LP. This crack session group (wryly rechristened The Mighty Jitters by Crosby) contributed to records by a myriad of other Los Angeles-based artists in the seventies, such as [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. Throughout the mid-70s, Crosby and Nash also lent their harmonies to hits like Taylor's \"Mexico\" and Joni Mitchell's \"[[Free Man in Paris]]\".\n\nMeanwhile, Stills and Young returned to their own careers. They briefly united for a one-off album and tour credited to the Stills-Young Band, ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (1976). Although the [[Miami]]-based sessions briefly metamorphosed into the third attempt at a CSNY reunion album, Stills and Young wiped the vocal contributions of the other pair off the [[master recording|master tape]] when Crosby & Nash were obligated to leave the sessions to finish their own ''Whistling Down the Wire'' in Los Angeles.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 185\u20136</ref> As Stills and Young embarked on a tour to promote the album in the summer of 1976, the old tensions between the pair resurfaced, exacerbated by Stills' insistence that professional studio musicians back them rather than Young's preferred Crazy Horse. After a July 20, 1976, show in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], Young's tour bus took a different direction from Stills'. Waiting at their next stop in [[Atlanta]], Stills received a laconic telegram: \"Dear Stephen, Funny how things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.\"<ref>McDonough, pp. 501\u20132</ref> Young's management claimed that he was under doctor's orders to rest and recover from an apparent throat infection. Stills was contractually bound to finish the tour alone, though Young would make up dates with Crazy Horse later in the year.\n\n===CSN reform: 1976 \u2013 1985===\n\nLater in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash at one of their concerts in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio.\n\nLess than a year after reforming, Crosby, Stills & Nash released ''[[CSN (album)|CSN]]''. Recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami under the auspices of Ron and Howard Albert throughout late 1976 and early 1977, the album exemplified the meticulously stylized [[soft rock]] production ethos of the epoch and contained the band's highest-charting single, Nash's \"[[Just a Song Before I Go]]\" (#7); Stills' \"Fair Game\" also peaked at #43. The album peaked at #2 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the summer of 1977 during a 33-week stay, remaining at that position for the month of August and ultimately earning a RIAA [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification behind one of the best-selling LPs of all time, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/csn-mw0000676437/awards |title=CSN \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1977-06-17 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> As of 2017, it remains the trio configuration's best-selling album, outselling their debut by 200,000 records.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\"/>\n\nOn June 21, 1978, Crosby, Stills & Nash received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry, located at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/crosby-stills-and-nash|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/crosby-stills-nash/|title=Crosby Stills & Nash \u2013 Hollywood Star Walk \u2013 Los Angeles Times|website=Projects.latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter successful arena tours in 1977 and 1978, further work as a group was complicated by Crosby's newfound dependence on [[Crack cocaine|freebase cocaine]]. ''[[Earth & Sky (album)|Earth & Sky]]'', a 1980 Nash album, was envisaged as a Crosby & Nash project following aborted 1978 CSN sessions until Nash determined that Crosby was not in shape to participate after his colleague stopped a jam because his freebase pipe had fallen off of an amp and broken.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 314</ref>\n\nStills and Nash convened in 1980\u20131981 to record ''[[Daylight Again]]'' as a self-funded duo; however, Atlantic Records executives refused to reimburse their expenses or release the LP until Crosby was reinstated.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 353\u20134</ref> Crosby contributed \"Delta\" (his last original composition for several years) and a cover of [[Judy Henske]] and [[Craig Doerge]]'s \"Might as Well Have a Good Time\" along with some additional vocals on other tracks. Despite Crosby's condition and the relatively d\u00e9mod\u00e9 nature of the group in the wake of the ascendancy of [[new wave]] and [[contemporary R&B]], ''Daylight Again'' reached #8 in 1982 during a 41-week chart stay. The album contained two major hits, Nash's \"Wasted on the Way\" (#9) and Stills' \"[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|Southern Cross]]\" (#18); Stills' \"Too Much Love to Hide\" also charted at #69. While the album ultimately failed to sell as well as its predecessors in the new musical climate, it received a RIAA platinum certification in early 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/daylight-again-mw0000189646/awards |title=Daylight Again \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |date=1982-06-21 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=daylight%20again#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the success of ''Daylight Again'' inaugurated a new tradition of near-annual touring that persisted for over thirty years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/crosby-stills-and-nash-33d6f8a1.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash Tour Statistics|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref> the bottom soon fell out for Crosby, who was arrested and jailed on drug and weapons charges in [[Texas]] in May 1982. Having recorded a potential title song for the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that was never used, the band released it as a single and hastily assembled concert recordings around two studio tracks for the album ''[[Allies (CSN album)|Allies]]'', their lowest-charting record to date. Crosby was sentenced to two terms, but the conviction was overturned; arrested several more times, he finally turned himself in to the authorities in December 1985.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 438\u20139</ref> He would spend eight months in prison.\n\n===CSNY again: 1988 \u2013 present ===\n\nBased on a promise he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby's release from prison for ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N9aLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA318#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=318|title=CSNY: Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young|author= Peter Doggett|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date= 2 Apr 2019}}</ref> Stills and Crosby (enfeebled by myriad health problems from his fallow period that culminated in a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for the making of the album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band.<ref>McDonough, p. 625</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n38EhI2JaoC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=stills+freebase+american+dream&source=bl&ots=vISae80Ctk&sig=R4OpGLPLZ0Rj6jkQpfFDuJQl69E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LcHRUv_MFoLksASDwoCIDQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=stills%20freebase%20american%20dream&f=false |title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young ... \u2013 Barney Hoskyns \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref> It did make it to #16 on the ''Billboard'' chart during a 22-week stay, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour. The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert (\"Laughter, Love and Music\") at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.\n\nCSN recorded two more studio albums in the 1990s, ''[[Live It Up (CSN album)|Live It Up]]'' (1990) and ''[[After the Storm (CSN album)|After the Storm]]'' (1994); both albums sold poorly by previous standards and failed to attain RIAA certifications. A [[CSN (box set)|box set]] arrived in 1991, four [[compact disc|discs]] of expected group highlights amidst unexpected better tracks from various solo projects. Owing to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young's material earmarked for the box.  Ultimately, nineteen tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were credited to CSNY. The CSNY version of \"Human Highway\" leaked to the internet several years later.<ref>McDonough, p. 248</ref>\n\nIn 1994, CSN collaborated with [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] to contribute \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, ''[[Looking Forward]]''. The album was released at Young's behest via [[Reprise Records]] in October 1999. With writing credits mostly limited to band members and Young leveraging the ongoing success of his solo career by ensconcing himself as the first among equals with a plurality of songs, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at #26 (the group's highest chart placement since ''American Dream'') during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, ''Looking Forward'' was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major money-makers.\n\nCSN were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its members inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by comedian [[Phil Hartman]] during his first career as a graphic designer.\n\nVarious compilations of the band's configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and ''So Far'' being the most commercially successful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby's ''Voyage'' chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash's ''Reflections'' appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, ''[[Carry On (Stephen Stills album)|Carry On]]'', was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash.<ref>[http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211015258/http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm|date=December 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:csny-06-tour.jpg|thumb|left|One of the backdrops during the 2006 \"Freedom of Speech\" tour, as shown here, was the photos of American soldiers who had died in the war in Iraq.]]\n\nIn 2006, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young set off on their Freedom of Speech Tour in support of ''[[Living with War]]'', a Young solo album written in response to the [[Iraq War]].

With protest against the [[Vietnam War]] gearing up in 1970, the group (and Crosby in particular) made no secret of their political leanings.\n\nAs a group, they recorded one hit song in response to political events although they recorded other political songs as solo artists and in various combinations.

Their first tour was as CSNY, and was a four-leg, 39-date tour that started  on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. Their second gig was a one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969. During that tour they also appeared at the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (September 13\u201314, 1969), and the notorious [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969.  The tour ended with three European concerts in January 1970.  They were accompanied on the tour by [[Greg Reeves]] on bass, and [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] on drums.\n\nBefore the start of their second tour, Greg Reeves was replaced on bass by Calvin Samuels. The tour is notorious for the tensions within the band, and Dallas Taylor was fired, to be replaced by  [[John Barbata]] on drums, and Stephen Stills was temporarily sacked by the rest of the group.

When joined by Canadian singer-songwriter [[Neil Young]] as a fourth member, they are called '''Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young''' ('''CSNY'''). They are noted for their intricate vocal harmonies, often tumultuous interpersonal relationships, political activism, and lasting influence on [[Music of the United States|American music]] and [[counterculture of the 1960s|culture]]. \n\nCSN formed in 1968 shortly after Crosby, Stills and Nash performed together informally in July of that year, discovering they harmonized well. Crosby had been asked to leave [[The Byrds]] in late 1967, and Stills' band [[Buffalo Springfield]] had broken up in early 1968; Nash left his band [[The Hollies]] in December, and by early 1969 the trio had signed a recording contract with [[Atlantic Records]]. Their first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969, from which came two [[Top 40]] hits, \"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]. In order to tour the album, the trio hired drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and session bassist [[Greg Reeves]], though they still needed a keyboardist;  [[Ahmet Ertegun]] suggested [[Neil Young]], who had played with Stills in Buffalo Springfield, and after some initial reluctance, the trio agreed, signing him on as a full member. The band, now named Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, started their tour, and played their second gig at [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning hours of August 18, 1969. The first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', reached number one in several international charts in 1970, and remains their best selling album, going on to sell over 8 million copies with three hit singles. Four singles were released from the album including \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11], \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16], and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]. The group's second tour, which produced the live double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'' (1971), was fraught with arguments between Young and Taylor, which resulted in Taylor being replaced by [[John Barbata]], and tensions with Stills, which resulted in his being temporarily dismissed from the band. At the end of the tour the band split up.  The group have since reunited several times, sometimes with and sometimes without Young, and have released eight studio and four live albums. \n\nCrosby, Stills & Nash were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and all three members were also inducted for their work in other groups (Crosby for [[the Byrds]], Stills for [[Buffalo Springfield]] and Nash for [[the Hollies]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/alphabetical/ |title=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |date=2013-04-15 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> Neil Young has also been inducted as a solo artist and as a member of Buffalo Springfield. They have not made a group studio album since 1999's ''[[Looking Forward]]'', and are inactive as of 2020. Whether or not this break is permanent remains to be seen, as the group has often been inactive for years at a time.\n\n==History==\n===CSN Formation and debut album: July 1968 \u2013 May 1969===\nPrior to the formation of CSN, each member of the band had belonged to another prominent group. David Crosby played guitar, sang and wrote songs with [[the Byrds]]; Stephen Stills had been a guitarist, keyboardist, vocalist and songwriter in the band [[Buffalo Springfield]] (which also featured [[Neil Young]]); and Graham Nash had been a guitarist, singer and songwriter with [[The Hollies]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/crosby-stills-nash-young-mn0000130036/biography|work=allmusic.com|author= William Ruhlmann|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young Biography by William Ruhlmann}}</ref> \n\nCrosby had been sacked from the Byrds in October 1967 due to disagreements over his songwriting.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kZBKDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT93#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=93|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|publisher=Hachette UK|date=23 Sep 2008 }}</ref> By early 1968, Buffalo Springfield had disintegrated, and after aiding in putting together the band's final album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', Stills was without a band. Stills and Crosby began meeting informally and jamming. The result of one encounter in Florida on Crosby's [[schooner]] was the song \"[[Wooden Ships]]\", composed in collaboration with another guest, [[Paul Kantner]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 65</ref> Graham Nash had been introduced to Crosby when the Byrds had toured the United Kingdom in 1966, and when the Hollies ventured to California in 1968, Nash resumed his acquaintance with him.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 103</ref> At a party in July 1968 at [[Joni Mitchell]]'s house, Nash asked Stills and Crosby to repeat their performance of a new song by Stills, \"You Don't Have To Cry\", with Nash improvising a third part harmony.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 72\u20133</ref> The vocals gelled, and the three realized that they had a very good vocal chemistry. It is disputed by members of the group whether it was at the house of Joni Mitchell or [[Cass Elliot]]. Stephen Stills recalls that it was at the house of Cass Elliot \u2013 he would have been too intimidated to sing as a group in front of Joni Mitchell for the first time. Nash and Crosby insist that the location was Joni Mitchell's home.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2015/02/laurel-canyon-music-scene|title=An Oral History of Laurel Canyon, the Sixties and Seventies Music Mecca|author=Lisa Robinson|work=Vanity Fair|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nCreatively frustrated with the Hollies, Nash decided to quit the band in December 1968, and flew to Los Angeles two days later. The trio stayed in London in early 1969 to rehearse for what turned out to be an unsuccessful audition with [[The Beatles]]' [[Apple Records]]. However, back in California, [[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]], who had been a fan of Buffalo Springfield and was disappointed by that band's demise signed them to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 144.</ref> From the outset, given their previous experiences, the trio decided not to be locked into a group structure. They used their surnames as identification to ensure independence and a guarantee that the band could not continue without one of them, unlike both the Byrds and the Hollies. They picked up a management team in [[Elliot Roberts]] and [[David Geffen]], who got them signed to Atlantic and would help to gain clout for the group in the industry.<ref>McDonough, p. 252.</ref> Roberts kept the band focused and dealt with egos, while Geffen handled the business deals, since, in Crosby's words, they needed a \"shark\" and Geffen was it.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pg. 79</ref>\n\nStills was already signed to Atlantic Records through his Buffalo Springfield contract. Crosby had been released from his Byrds deal with Columbia, as he was considered to be unimportant and too difficult to work with. Nash, however, was still signed to [[Epic Records]] through The Hollies. Ertegun worked out a deal with [[Clive Davis]] to essentially trade Nash to Atlantic in exchange for [[Richie Furay]] (who was also signed to Atlantic by virtue of his membership in Buffalo Springfield) and [[Poco]], his new band.<ref>Robert Greenfield. ''The Last Sultan: The Life and Times of Ahmet Ertegun.'' Simon and Schuster. 2011. 202-3.</ref>\n\nThe trio's first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'', was released in May 1969. The eponymously titled album was a major hit in the United States, peaking at #6 on the ''Billboard'' album chart during a 107-week stay that spawned two [[Top 40]] hits (\"[[Suite: Judy Blue Eyes]]\" [#21] and \"[[Marrakesh Express]]\" [#28]) and significant airplay on [[FM radio]]. The album ultimately earned a RIAA [[platinum album|triple platinum]] certification in 1999 and [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=379|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299784/crosby-stills-nash/chart?f=305|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash \u2013 Chart history \u2013 Billboard|website=Billboard.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=crosby,%20stills&col=certification_date&ord=asc#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> With the exceptions of drummer [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)|Dallas Taylor]] and a handful of rhythm and acoustic guitar parts from Crosby and Nash, Stills (accorded the moniker \"Captain Many Hands\" by his bandmates) handled most of the instrumentation (including every lead guitar, bass and keyboard part) on the album, which left the band in need of additional personnel to be able to tour, a necessity given the debut album's commercial impact.\n\n===CSNY, D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu to 4 Way Street: August 1969 \u2013 April 1971===\nRetaining Taylor, the band tried initially to hire a keyboard player. Stills initially approached virtuoso multi-instrumentalist [[Steve Winwood]], who was already occupied with the newly formed group [[Blind Faith]].<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 92</ref> Erteg\u00fcn suggested former Buffalo Springfield member Neil Young, also managed by Elliot Roberts, as a fairly obvious choice; though principally a guitarist, Young was a proficient keyboardist and could alternate on the instrument with Stills and Nash in a live context.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 163\u20134</ref> Stills and Nash initially held reservations; Stills because of his history with Young in Buffalo Springfield, and Nash because of his personal unfamiliarity with Young. But after several meetings, the trio expanded to a quartet with Young a full partner. The terms of the contract allowed Young full freedom to maintain a parallel career with his new band, [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]].\n\nThey initially completed the rhythm section with former Buffalo Springfield bassist [[Bruce Palmer]]. However, Palmer was let go due to his persistent personal problems following rehearsals at the [[Cafe au Go Go]] in New York City's [[Greenwich Village]]; according to Crosby, \"Bruce Palmer was into [[drug injection|another instrument]] and his head was not where it should have been.\"<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\">Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94</ref> Teenaged [[Motown]] session bassist [[Greg Reeves]] joined in Palmer's place at the recommendation of [[Rick James]], a friend of the band.<ref name=\"Zimmer and Diltz, p. 94\"/>\n\nWith Young on board, the restructured group embarked on a four-leg, 39-date tour that ended with three European concerts in January 1970. Their first gig was on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. They mentioned they were going to someplace called [[Woodstock, New York|Woodstock]] the next day, but that they had no idea where that was. Their one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969, was a [[baptism by fire]]. The crowd of industry friends looking on from offstage was intimidating and prompted Stills to say, \"This is only the second time we've performed in front of people. We're scared shitless.\" Their appearance at the festival and in the subsequent movie ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]],''<ref>Neil Young is notably absent from the documentary film. In an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeEWMnRcrTY interview in 2000 for VH1], he revealed that he objected to being photographed at close quarters, so the cameras avoided him. In February 2019, [https://www.jambase.com/article/woodstock-documentary-bill-gerber-neil-young-janis-joplin it was reported] that plans to release a restored version of the film would include footage of Young.</ref> along with recording the Joni Mitchell [[Woodstock (song)|song memorializing Woodstock]], boosted the visibility of the quartet. CSNY appeared at other prominent festivals that year. Footage from two performances from the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (held on the grounds of the [[Esalen Institute]] on September 13\u201314, 1969) appears in the movie ''[[Celebration at Big Sur]]''. They also appeared at the violence-plagued [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969 alongside [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]] and the headlining [[Rolling Stones]]. At the band's request, their performance was not included in the subsequent film ''[[Gimme Shelter (1970 film)|Gimme Shelter]]'' (1970).\n\nGreat anticipation had built for the expanded supergroup and their first album with Young, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'', which arrived in stores in March 1970. It topped the charts during a 97-week stay in the United States and generated three hit singles, including the Stills-sung cover of Mitchell's \"[[Woodstock (song)|Woodstock]]\" [#11] and both of Nash's contributions (\"[[Teach Your Children]]\" [#16] and \"[[Our House (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Our House]]\" [#30]). Certified [[Multi-platinum|septuple platinum]] by [[RIAA]], the album's domestic sales currently sit at over 8 million copies; as of 2017, it remains the highest-selling album of each member's career.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.greasylake.org/the-circuit/index.php?/topic/106260-neil-young-bob-seger-and-crosby-stills-nash-youngusa-album-sales/|title=NEIL YOUNG, BOB SEGER and CROSBY, STILLS, NASH & YOUNG.....USA album sales|website=Greasy Lake Community}}</ref> ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' was also the first release on the Atlantic Records SD-7200 \"superstar\" line, created by the label for its highest-profile artists; subsequent solo albums by Crosby, Stills, and Nash would be the next releases in this series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/atlantic/atlantic7200.html |title=Atlantic Album Discography, Part 6 |publisher=Bsnpubs.com |date=2005-10-06 |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref>\n\nIn consultation with other band members, Stills fired Reeves from the group shortly before the beginning of their second American tour in April 1970 \"because [he] suddenly decided he was an [[Apache]] [[witch doctor]].\"<ref name=csn124>''Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography''.

We'll sing any song if it's great, but not just because it happens to be written by our bass player.\"<ref name=csn124 /> He was replaced by Calvin \"Fuzzy\" Samuels, a homeless Jamaican musician recently discovered by Stills at [[Island Records]]' London studios. Shortly thereafter, Taylor (who frequently clashed with Young over the band's tempos during the first tour and ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu'' sessions) was also dismissed when Young threatened to leave the group following the first performance of the tour at the [[Denver Coliseum]] on May 12, 1970. Notwithstanding these previous tensions, Taylor would later assert that his dismissal served as a proxy for renewed conflict between Stills and Young in the aftermath of Reeves' firing. Shortly thereafter, drummer [[John Barbata]] (formerly of [[The Turtles]]) was hired for the remainder of the tour and associated recordings. A week before the Denver performance, Young and Crosby were staying at a house near [[San Francisco]] when reports of the [[Kent State shootings]] arrived, inspiring Young to write the protest song \"[[Ohio (1970 song)|Ohio]]\". Recorded and rush-released weeks later with the new rhythm section, it peaked at #14 in August 1970, providing another American [[Top 20]] hit for the group.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 127</ref>\n\nAs the 23-show tour progressed, the tenuous nature of the partnership was strained by Stills' alcohol and [[cocaine]] abuse and perceived [[megalomania]], culminating in an extended solo set not countenanced by the other band members at the [[Fillmore East]] when he was informed that [[Bob Dylan]] was in the audience. In this turbulent atmosphere, Crosby, Nash and Young decided to fire Stills during a two-night stint at Chicago's [[Auditorium Theatre]] in July 1970. Following his reinstatement, the tour ended as scheduled in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] on July 9, 1970; however, the group broke up immediately thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-actual-honest-to-god-reunion-of-crosby-stills-and-nash-19770602|title=The Actual, Honest-to-God Reunion of Crosby, Stills and Nash|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/wild-tales-graham-nash-opens-sex-drugs-music-behind-crosby-stills-nash-young-article-1.1442620|title=In 'Wild Tales,' Graham Nash opens up about sex, drugs and music behind Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|website=Nydailynews.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarmtn.org/year.php?year=1970|title=Sugar Mountain|website=Sugarmtn.org}}</ref> Concert recordings from that tour assembled by Nash produced the 1971 double album ''[[4 Way Street]]'', which also topped the charts during a 42-week stay. Although they would continue to collaborate in various and largely ephemeral permutations, the four members would not come back together in earnest until their 1974 reunion tour.\n\n===Individual activity===\n{{main|David Crosby|Stephen Stills|Graham Nash|Neil Young}}\nBetween September 1970 and May 1971, each of the quartet released high-profile solo albums: Young's ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' in September (which peaked at #8 and included his first Top 40 solo hit, \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart\" [#33]); Stills' [[Stephen Stills (album)|eponymous debut]] in November; Crosby's ''[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]'' in February, and Nash's ''[[Songs for Beginners]]'' in May. Although all four solo LPs placed in the Top 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], Stills' entry (including two Top 40 hits, \"Love the One You're With\" [#14] and \"Sit Yourself Down\" [#37]) peaked the highest at #3. Stills was the first to release a second post-CSNY solo album, 1971's ''[[Stephen Stills 2]]'', which included two minor hits (\"Change Partners\" [#43]; \"Marianne\" [#42]) and peaked at #8. In the fall of 1971, Crosby and Nash embarked on a successful theater tour accompanied only by their acoustic guitars and a piano, as captured on the 1998 archival release ''[[Another Stoney Evening]]''.\n\n1972 proved to be another fruitful year for all the band members in their solo or duo efforts. Young achieved solo superstardom with the chart-topping ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' and two Top 40 singles, the #1 hit \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" and \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" (#31). Stills joined with former [[The Byrds|Byrd]] [[Chris Hillman]] to form the band [[Manassas (band)|Manassas]], releasing a self-titled double album; although it did not generate any significant hits, counting the three CSN/CSNY records, ''[[Manassas (album)|Manassas]]'' became Stills' sixth Top Ten album in a row, peaking at #4. Nash and Young released Young's \"[[War Song]]\" as a joint single to support [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign; despite their intentions, the single failed to make a serious impression. Meanwhile, Nash and Crosby's touring was so successful and pleasant for them that they recorded and released their first album as a duo, ''[[Graham Nash David Crosby]]'', which eclipsed their recent solo efforts with a Top 40 hit (Nash's \"[[Immigration Man]]\" [#36]) while also peaking at #4.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 151</ref>\n\nThe group members fared less well in 1973. Young recorded two dark albums. The first, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'', chronicled his winter tour that followed the death of his Crazy Horse bandmate [[Danny Whitten]] from an alcohol/[[Valium]] overdose, a tour Crosby and Nash joined mid-way. A critical success despite his personal misgivings, it attained a RIAA gold certification before stalling at #22. The second album, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'', was so dark that [[Reprise Records]] refused to release it until 1975. Although it is widely regarded as his [[magnum opus]], it only reached #25. Crosby spearheaded and produced a [[Byrds (album)|reunion album]] of the original Byrds quintet which was a notable critical failure upon its release in March 1973. The most commercially successful Byrds album since 1966, it sold only marginally well by CSNY's standards, peaking at #20. Stills released a [[Down the Road (Manassas album)|second Manassas record]] in April 1973 and Nash recorded his [[Wild Tales (album)|second solo album]] (released in January 1974); again, neither disc sold to expectations, peaking respectively at #26 and #34.\n\n===CSNY, reconciliation and further estrangement: 1973 \u2013 1976===\n[[Image:CSNY 8-1974 (1).jpg|thumb|right|Stills (left), Crosby and Nash in 1974]]\n\nIn June and July 1973, Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young met at Young's ranch in California and a recording studio in Hawaii for a working vacation, ostensibly to record a new album, tentatively titled ''Human Highway''. However, the bickering that had sunk the band in 1970 quickly resumed, scattering the group again. After spontaneously reconvening for an acoustic set at a Manassas concert at San Francisco's [[Winterland Ballroom]] in October, the quartet failed once again to commit to a reunion; however, three days later, the CSN configuration performed an acoustic set at another Manassas Winterland show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-04-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concertvault.com/crosby-stills-nash-and-young/winterland-october-07-1973.html|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young concert|website=Concertvault.com}}</ref> Over the next few months, Roberts finally prevailed upon the group to realize their commercial potential, culminating in Stills announcing a CSNY summer tour and the projected studio album at a solo concert in March 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=crosby+stills+nash+the+biography&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjD8avLgrTWAhWDw4MKHXxCA48Q6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22big+tour%22&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref> The quartet [[CSNY 1974|reassembled]] in earnest that summer, with sidemen [[Tim Drummond]] on bass, [[Russ Kunkel]] on drums, and [[Joe Lala]] on percussion, to rehearse at Young's ranch near [[Woodside, California]] before embarking on the two-month, 31-date tour.\n\nThe tour was directed by San Francisco-based impresario [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]].

Crosby, in particular,  was disillusioned by the bombastic nature of the performances, which he collectively dubbed the \"Doom Tour\": \"We had good monitors, but Stephen and Neil were punching well over 100 db from their half stacks. Graham and I simply couldn't do the harmonies when we couldn't hear ourselves. Also, when you play a stadium you almost have to do a [[Mick Jagger]] where you wave a sash around and prance about. I can't quite do that. We did what we could, but I don't know how many people in the audience really got it. A lot of them were there for the tunes.

Under the stewardship of Graham's production company, the tour was plagued by profligate spending, exemplified by a litany of pillowcases embroidered with the band's new Mitchell-designed logo and the routine chartering of helicopters and private jets in lieu of ground transportation. Nash would later recall that \"the tour made just over eleven million dollars, which of course was a lot of money in those days. We all got less than a half million each. It was obvious that between Bill Graham, the promoters and a bunch of others, they all had a good time. Let's just put it that way.\"<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\"/> According to road manager Chris O'Dell, \"One time they spilled cocaine on the carpet.

While Nash viewed the re-shuffling of items from only two albums and one single (typified by the exclusion of his \"Marrakesh Express\", a Top 40 hit) as absurd, it eventually topped the ''Billboard'' album chart in November.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, p. 176</ref>\n\nAlthough tensions were high between Crosby, Stills and Young, the band reconvened at the [[Record Plant]] in [[Sausalito, California]] with [[The Albert Brothers]] in November to finish the long-gestating follow-up to ''D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu''. While several songs were completed and recorded (including Young's \"Human Highway\", still envisioned as the provisional title track; a take of Crosby's \"Homeward Through the Haze\" with Crosby on piano and [[Lee Sklar]] on bass; and Nash's [[anti-whaling]] opus \"Wind on the Water\"), Young left once again following a tumultuous argument. While Crosby, Stills and Nash (augmented by a variety of session musicians, including Sklar, Kunkel and [[Grateful Dead]] drummer [[Bill Kreutzmann]]) attempted to complete the album as a trio effort, the feud between Stills and Nash resurfaced, resulting in Stills destroying the master of \"Wind on the Water\" with a razor blade after Crosby and Nash objected to a harmony part on Stills' \"Guardian Angel\". Even though Stills characterized the razor blade incident as a joke, the sessions promptly dissolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NRB6NnYW7_IC&printsec=frontcover&dq=csn%20dave%20zimmer&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiftfnptp_SAhWJjFQKHYdwDesQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&q=homeward%20through%20the%20haze&f=false|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Biography|author=Dave Zimmer|date=23 September 2008|publisher=Da Capo Press|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nShortly thereafter, Crosby and Nash signed a separate contract with [[ABC Records]] and began to tour regularly again, playing a more intimate array of sports arenas, outdoor festivals and theaters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/search?query=artist:%28Crosby+%26+Nash%29+date:%5B1975-01-01+TO+1975-12-31%5D |title=Search for setlists: artist:(Crosby & Nash) date:[1975-01-01 TO 1975-12-31 |publisher=setlist.fm |date= |accessdate=2015-08-24}}</ref> During this period they produced two studio albums, ''[[Wind on the Water]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Whistling Down the Wire]]'' in 1976, and the 1977 concert album ''[[Crosby-Nash Live]]''. Along with Drummond (retained from the 1974 CSNY tour), they continued to use the sidemen from the ensemble known as [[The Section (band)|The Section]] from their first LP. This crack session group (wryly rechristened The Mighty Jitters by Crosby) contributed to records by a myriad of other Los Angeles-based artists in the seventies, such as [[Carole King]], [[James Taylor]], and [[Jackson Browne]]. Throughout the mid-70s, Crosby and Nash also lent their harmonies to hits like Taylor's \"Mexico\" and Joni Mitchell's \"[[Free Man in Paris]]\".\n\nMeanwhile, Stills and Young returned to their own careers. They briefly united for a one-off album and tour credited to the Stills-Young Band, ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (1976). Although the [[Miami]]-based sessions briefly metamorphosed into the third attempt at a CSNY reunion album, Stills and Young wiped the vocal contributions of the other pair off the [[master recording|master tape]] when Crosby & Nash were obligated to leave the sessions to finish their own ''Whistling Down the Wire'' in Los Angeles.<ref>Zimmer and Diltz, pp. 185\u20136</ref> As Stills and Young embarked on a tour to promote the album in the summer of 1976, the old tensions between the pair resurfaced, exacerbated by Stills' insistence that professional studio musicians back them rather than Young's preferred Crazy Horse. After a July 20, 1976, show in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], Young's tour bus took a different direction from Stills'. Waiting at their next stop in [[Atlanta]], Stills received a laconic telegram: \"Dear Stephen, Funny how things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach. Neil.\"<ref>McDonough, pp. 501\u20132</ref> Young's management claimed that he was under doctor's orders to rest and recover from an apparent throat infection. Stills was contractually bound to finish the tour alone, though Young would make up dates with Crazy Horse later in the year.\n\n===CSN reform: 1976 \u2013 1985===\n\nLater in 1976, Stills approached Crosby and Nash at one of their concerts in Los Angeles, setting the stage for the return of the trio. \n\nLess than a year after reforming, Crosby, Stills & Nash released ''[[CSN (album)|CSN]]''. Recorded at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami under the auspices of Ron and Howard Albert throughout late 1976 and early 1977, the album exemplified the meticulously stylized [[soft rock]] production ethos of the epoch and contained the band's highest-charting single, Nash's \"[[Just a Song Before I Go]]\" (#7); Stills' \"Fair Game\" also peaked at #43. The album peaked at #2 on the ''Billboard'' chart in the summer of 1977 during a 33-week stay, remaining at that position for the month of August and ultimately earning a RIAA [[platinum album|quadruple platinum]] certification behind one of the best-selling LPs of all time, [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s ''[[Rumours (album)|Rumours]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/csn-mw0000676437/awards |title=CSN \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=1977-06-17 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref> As of 2017, it remains the trio configuration's best-selling album, outselling their debut by 200,000 records.<ref name=\"greasylake.org\"/>\n\nOn June 21, 1978, Crosby, Stills & Nash received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for their contributions to the music industry, located at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/crosby-stills-and-nash|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash {{!}} Hollywood Walk of Fame|website=Walkoffame.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/crosby-stills-nash/|title=Crosby Stills & Nash \u2013 Hollywood Star Walk \u2013 Los Angeles Times|website=Projects.latimes.com|access-date=2016-12-01}}</ref>\n\nAfter successful arena tours in 1977 and 1978, further work as a group was complicated by Crosby's newfound dependence on [[Crack cocaine|freebase cocaine]]. ''[[Earth & Sky (album)|Earth & Sky]]'', a 1980 Nash album, was envisaged as a Crosby & Nash project following aborted 1978 CSN sessions until Nash determined that Crosby was not in shape to participate after his colleague stopped a jam because his freebase pipe had fallen off of an amp and broken.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, p. 314</ref>\n\nStills and Nash convened in 1980\u20131981 to record ''[[Daylight Again]]'' as a self-funded duo; however, Atlantic Records executives refused to reimburse their expenses or release the LP until Crosby was reinstated.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 353\u20134</ref> Crosby contributed \"Delta\" (his last original composition for several years) and a cover of [[Judy Henske]] and [[Craig Doerge]]'s \"Might as Well Have a Good Time\" along with some additional vocals on other tracks. Despite Crosby's condition and the relatively d\u00e9mod\u00e9 nature of the group in the wake of the ascendancy of [[new wave]] and [[contemporary R&B]], ''Daylight Again'' reached #8 in 1982 during a 41-week chart stay. The album contained two major hits, Nash's \"Wasted on the Way\" (#9) and Stills' \"[[Southern Cross (Crosby, Stills and Nash song)|Southern Cross]]\" (#18); Stills' \"Too Much Love to Hide\" also charted at #69. While the album ultimately failed to sell as well as its predecessors in the new musical climate, it received a RIAA platinum certification in early 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/daylight-again-mw0000189646/awards |title=Daylight Again \u2013 Crosby, Stills & Nash &#124; Awards |website=AllMusic |date=1982-06-21 |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=daylight%20again#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum \u2013 RIAA|website=Riaa.com}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the success of ''Daylight Again'' inaugurated a new tradition of near-annual touring that persisted for over thirty years,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/stats/crosby-stills-and-nash-33d6f8a1.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash Tour Statistics|website=Setlist.fm}}</ref> the bottom soon fell out for Crosby, who was arrested and jailed on drug and weapons charges in [[Texas]] in May 1982. Having recorded a potential title song for the film ''[[WarGames]]'' that was never used, the band released it as a single and hastily assembled concert recordings around two studio tracks for the album ''[[Allies (CSN album)|Allies]]'', their lowest-charting record to date. Crosby was sentenced to two terms, but the conviction was overturned; arrested several more times, he finally turned himself in to the authorities in December 1985.<ref>Crosby and Gottlieb, pp. 438\u20139</ref> He would spend eight months in prison.\n\n===CSNY again: 1988 \u2013 present ===\n\nBased on a promise he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby's release from prison for ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' in 1988.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=N9aLDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA318#v=onepage&q&f=false|page=318|title=CSNY: Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young|author= Peter Doggett|publisher=Simon and Schuster|date= 2 Apr 2019}}</ref> Stills and Crosby (enfeebled by myriad health problems from his fallow period that culminated in a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for the making of the album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band.<ref>McDonough, p. 625</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7n38EhI2JaoC&pg=PA263&lpg=PA263&dq=stills+freebase+american+dream&source=bl&ots=vISae80Ctk&sig=R4OpGLPLZ0Rj6jkQpfFDuJQl69E&hl=en&sa=X&ei=LcHRUv_MFoLksASDwoCIDQ&ved=0CEkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q=stills%20freebase%20american%20dream&f=false |title=Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young ... \u2013 Barney Hoskyns \u2013 Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-10}}</ref> It did make it to #16 on the ''Billboard'' chart during a 22-week stay, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour. The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. Several years later, CSNY reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert (\"Laughter, Love and Music\") at [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco on November 3, 1991.\n\nCSN recorded two more studio albums in the 1990s, ''[[Live It Up (CSN album)|Live It Up]]'' (1990) and ''[[After the Storm (CSN album)|After the Storm]]'' (1994); both albums sold poorly by previous standards and failed to attain RIAA certifications. A [[CSN (box set)|box set]] arrived in 1991, four [[compact disc|discs]] of expected group highlights amidst unexpected better tracks from various solo projects. Owing to certain difficulties, manager Roberts, no longer with the trio but still representing Young, pulled most of Young's material earmarked for the box.  Ultimately, nineteen tracks out of the seventy-seven in the set were credited to CSNY. The CSNY version of \"Human Highway\" leaked to the internet several years later.<ref>McDonough, p. 248</ref>\n\nIn 1994, CSN collaborated with [[Suzy Bogguss]], [[Alison Krauss]], and [[Kathy Mattea]] to contribute \"[[Teach Your Children]]\" to the [[AIDS]] benefit album ''[[Red Hot + Country]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].\n\nBy the late 1990s, CSN found themselves without a record contract. They began financing recordings themselves, and in 1999 Stills invited Young to guest on a few tracks. Impressed by their gumption, Young increased his level of input, turning the album into a CSNY project, ''[[Looking Forward]]''. The album was released at Young's behest via [[Reprise Records]] in October 1999. With writing credits mostly limited to band members and Young leveraging the ongoing success of his solo career by ensconcing himself as the first among equals with a plurality of songs, the disc was better received than the previous three albums from a critical standpoint. It also fared relatively well commercially, peaking at #26 (the group's highest chart placement since ''American Dream'') during a 9-week stay. However, in a reflection of the shifting financial landscape of the music industry, ''Looking Forward'' was most notable for laying the groundwork for the ensuing CSNY2K Tour (2000) and the CSNY Tour of America (2002), both of which were major money-makers.\n\nCSN were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1997; CSNY is the first band to have all its members inducted into the hall twice, although Young was inducted for his solo work (1995) and for Buffalo Springfield (1997). The CSN logo that Crosby, Stills and Nash used from the mid-1970s onward was designed by comedian [[Phil Hartman]] during his first career as a graphic designer.\n\nVarious compilations of the band's configurations have arrived over the years, the box set being the most comprehensive, and ''So Far'' being the most commercially successful. Individual retrospective box sets have also been released. In 2007, David Crosby's ''Voyage'' chronicled his work with various bands and as a solo artist. Graham Nash's ''Reflections'' appeared in early 2009 under the same auspices, quite near his 67th birthday. The box set for Stephen Stills, ''[[Carry On (Stephen Stills album)|Carry On]]'', was released in February 2013. Compilation and oversight of these releases has largely been managed by Nash.<ref>[http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211015258/http://www.4waysite.com/index5.htm|date=December 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:csny-06-tour.jpg|thumb|left|One of the backdrops during the 2006 \"Freedom of Speech\" tour, as shown here, was the photos of American soldiers who had died in the war in Iraq.]]\n\nIn 2006, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young set off on their Freedom of Speech Tour in support of ''[[Living with War]]'', a Young solo album written in response to the [[Iraq War]].

With protest against the [[Vietnam War]] gearing up in 1970, the group (and Crosby in particular) made no secret of their political leanings.\n\nAs a group, they recorded one hit song in response to political events although they recorded other political songs as solo artists and in various combinations.

The students were shot by [[Ohio National Guardsmen]] during an anti-war protest on the campus in May 1970.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Jerry Lewis  |author2=Hensley Thomas |title=THE MAY 4 SHOOTINGS AT KENT STATE UNIVERSITY: THE SEARCH  FOR HISTORICAL ACCURACY |url=http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/lewihen.htm |publisher=Dept.kent.edu |accessdate=12 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509131525/http://dept.kent.edu/sociology/lewis/LEWIHEN.htm |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nThe release of \"[[Ohio (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Ohio]]\" marked the boldest musical statement made to that date regarding the [[Vietnam War]], calling out [[Richard Nixon]] by name and voicing the counterculture's rage and despair at the events. Between \"Ohio\", their appearance in both the festival and movie of ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', and the runaway success of their two albums, the group found themselves in the position of enjoying a level of adulation far greater than experienced with their previous bands, as evidenced by the 27 Platinum certifications they received across seven albums.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nThe band has been continuously associated with political causes throughout its existence, the latest example being the song \"Almost Gone (The Ballad of Bradley Manning)\" which focuses on the length and conditions of [[Chelsea Manning]]'s pre-trial confinement.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lvrj.com/neon/crosby-stills-nash-playing-hard-rock-148226345.html|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash playing Hard Rock|newspaper=Las Vegas Review-Journal|accessdate=2012-04-20}}</ref>\n\nDespite their estrangement, Crosby,<ref>{{cite web|author=David Crosby|title=David Crosby on Twitter (30 Aug 2015)|url=https://twitter.com/thedavidcrosby/status/637808975279489024|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=David Crosby|title=David Crosby on Twitter (2 Jul 2015)|url=https://twitter.com/thedavidcrosby/status/616462823783313408|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> Nash,<ref name=\"SpinMedia\">{{cite web|author=Rachel Brodsky|title=Thurston Moore, Jeff Tweedy, Killer Mike, and More Sign Their Support For Bernie Sanders|url=http://www.spin.com/2015/09/thurston-moore-jeff-tweedy-killer-mike-bernie-sanders/|website=Spin.com|publisher=SpinMedia|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> and Young<ref name=\"SpinMedia\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Ben Kaye|title=Neil Young snubs Donald Trump, gives \"Rockin' in the Free World\" to Bernie Sanders|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/neil-young-snubs-donald-trump-gives-rockin-in-the-free-world-to-bernie-sanders/|website=Consequence of Sound|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=21 September 2015}}</ref> were all vocal in their support for [[2016 United States Presidential election|2016]] [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Presidential candidate]] [[Bernie Sanders]].\n\n==Influence==\n{{expand section|date=August 2019}}\n{{unsourced section|date=February 2020}}\n\nThe collective abilities allowed CSNY to straddle all the [[genre]]s of popular music eminent at the time, from [[country rock]] to confessional ballads, from acoustic guitars and voice to electric guitar, and three-part harmony. With [[The Beatles]]' break-up made public by April 1970, and with [[Bob Dylan]] in reclusive low-key activity since mid-1966, CSNY found itself as the adopted standard bearers for the [[Woodstock Nation]], serving an importance in society as counterculture figureheads equaled at the time in rock and roll only by [[The Rolling Stones]] or [[The Who]].

Their first tour was as CSNY, and was a four-leg, 39-date tour that started  on August 16, 1969, at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] in Chicago, with [[Joni Mitchell]] as their opening act. Their second gig was a one-hour show at the [[Woodstock|Woodstock Festival]] in the early morning of August 18, 1969. During that tour they also appeared at the [[Big Sur Folk Festival]] (September 13\u201314, 1969), and the notorious [[Altamont Free Concert]] on December 6, 1969.  The tour ended with three European concerts in January 1970.  They were accompanied on the tour by [[Greg Reeves]] on bass, and [[Dallas Taylor (drummer)| Dallas Taylor]] on drums. \n\nBefore the start of their second tour, Greg Reeves was replaced on bass by Calvin Samuels. The tour is notorious for the tensions within the band, and Dallas Taylor was fired, to be replaced by  [[John Barbata]] on drums, and Stephen Stills was temporarily sacked by the rest of the group. The tour started in Denver Coliseum on 12 May 1970, and finished after 22 dates at the [[Met Center]] in [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] on 9 July 1970, after which the group split up. The double live album ''[[4 Way Street]]'', released April 1971, was recorded at several dates on this tour.  \n\n\n'''[[CSNY 1974|1974 So Far Tour]]'''\n*Bass: [[Tim Drummond]]; Drums: [[Russ Kunkel]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[CSN (album)|1977 CSN Tour]]'''\n*Keyboards: [[Craig Doerge]] (replaced by Kim Bullard); Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: [[Joe Vitale (musician)| Joe Vitale]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[CSN (album)|1978 Tour]]'''\n*Keyboards: Kim Bullard; Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: [[Joe Vitale (musician)| Joe Vitale]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[No Nukes: The Muse Concerts for a Non-Nuclear Future| 1979 MUSE Concert]]'''\n*Keyboards: [[Craig Doerge]]; Bass: [[Tim Drummond]]; Drums: [[Russ Kunkel]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''[[Daylight Again| 1982 Daylight Again Tour]]'''\n*Guitar: Michael Stergis; Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Michael Hannah (Hannah replaced by [[James Newton Howard]]); Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: [[Joe Vitale (musician)| Joe Vitale]]; Percussion: Efrain Toro\n'''[[Allies (Crosby, Stills & Nash album)| 1983 Allies Tour]]'''\n*Guitar: Michael Stergis; Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Kim Bullard; Bass: [[Kenny Passarelli]]; Drums: Rick Jaeger; Percussion: Efrain Toro\n'''1984 Tour'''\n*Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Kim Bullard; Bass: [[Kenny Passarelli]] (replaced by [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]); Drums: [[Ian Wallace (drummer)| Ian Wallace]]; Percussion: [[Joe Lala]]\n'''1985 Tour'''\n*Keyboards: [[Mike Finnigan]] & Kim Bullard (Bullard replaced by [[Craig Doerge]]); Bass: [[George \"Chocolate\" Perry]]; Drums: Mark T.

Cartland said of Forbes-Robertson \"\"I do believe that once you know something nasty you can't erase it. That's why when I had my children ... I wouldn't read any racy novels -- because Blossom Forbes-Robertson, who `came out' with me in 1919, was born with an empty eye socket after her mother acted the role of a one-eyed woman\nduring pregnancy.

One of the first aircraft she owned was a [[de Havilland DH.60 Moth|De Havilland DH.60X Cirrus Moth]], registered G-EBZG, in 1928, after it had been damaged on landing at Shoreham, sold to Southern Aircraft Ltd, and rebuilt; it was then named \"Jemimah\".<ref name=\"Brown 1970 p17\">Brown 1970 p. 17.</ref>\n \nOf the aircraft Blossom helped design, the [[Miles Sparrowhawk]], is one of the most notable.

I wouldn't read any racy novels -- because Blossom Forbes-Robertson, who `came out' with me in 1919, was born with an empty eye socket after her mother acted the role of a one-eyed woman\nduring pregnancy.

Flight controllers work at computer consoles and use [[telemetry]] to monitor various technical aspects of a [[space mission]] in [[Real-time computing|real time]]. Each controller is an expert in a specific area and constantly communicates with additional experts in the \"back room\". The flight director, who leads the flight controllers, monitors the activities of a team of flight controllers, and has overall responsibility for success and safety.\n\nThis article primarily discusses NASA's flight controllers at the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in [[Houston]]. The various national and commercial flight control facilities have their own teams, which may be described on their own pages.\n\n== NASA's flight controllers ==\nThe room where the flight controllers work was called the mission operations control room (MOCR, pronounced \"moh-ker\"), and now is called the flight control room (FCR, pronounced \"ficker\"). The controllers are experts in individual systems, and make recommendations to the flight director involving their areas of responsibility. Any controller may call for an [[Abort (computing)|abort]] if the circumstances require it. Before significant events, the flight director will \"go around the room\", polling each controller for a go/no go decision, a procedure also known as a [[launch status check]]. If all factors are good, each controller calls for a go, but if there is a problem requiring a hold or an abort, the call is no go. Another form of this is stay/no stay, when the spacecraft has completed a maneuver and has now \"parked\" in relation to another body, including spacecraft, orbiting the Earth or the Moon, or the lunar landings.\n\nControllers in MOCR/FCR are supported by the \"backrooms\", teams of flight controllers located in other parts of the building or even at remote facilities. The backroom was formally called the staff support room (SSR), and is now called the multi-purpose support room (MPSR, pronounced \"mipser\"). Backroom flight controllers are responsible for the details of their assigned system and for making recommendations for actions needed for that system. \"Frontroom\" flight controllers are responsible for integrating the needs of their system into the larger needs of the vehicle and working with the rest of the flight control team to develop a cohesive plan of action, even if that plan is not necessarily in the best interests of the system they are responsible for. Within the chain of command of the MCC, information and recommendations flow from the backroom to the frontroom to Flight, and then, potentially, to the on board crew. Generally, a MOCR/FCR flight control team is made up of the more seasoned flight controllers than the SSR/MPSR, though senior flight controllers cycle back to support in the backroom periodically. One example of the usefulness of this system occurred during the descent of the [[Apollo 11]] [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] [[Apollo 11|''Eagle'']], when \"1202\" and \"1201\" program alarms came from the LM. GUIDO [[Steve Bales]], not sure whether to call for an abort, trusted the experts in the guidance backroom, especially [[Jack Garman]], who told him that the problem was a computer overload, but could be ignored if it was intermittent. Bales called \"Go!\", Flight Director [[Gene Kranz]] accepted the call and the mission continued to success. Without the support of the backroom, a controller might make a bad call based on faulty memory or information not readily available to the person on the console. The nature of quiescent operations aboard the International Space Station (ISS) today is such that the full team is not required for 24/7/365 support. FCR flight controllers accept responsibility for operations without MPSR support most of the time, and the MPSR is only staffed for high-intensity periods of activity, such as joint Shuttle/ISS missions.\n\nThe flight controllers in the FCR and MPSR are further supported by hardware and software designers, analysts and engineering specialists in other parts of the building or remote facilities. These extended support teams have more detailed analysis tools and access to development and test data that is not readily accessible to the flight control team. These support teams were referred to by the name of their room in Mission Control, the mission operations integration room (MOIR), and are now collectively referred to by the name of their current location, the mission evaluation room (MER). While the flight controllers and their backrooms are responsible for real-time decision making, the MOIR/MER provides the detailed data and history needed to solve longer-term issues.\n\n[[Unmanned space mission|Uncrewed U.S. space missions]] also have flight controllers but are managed from separate organizations, either the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] or the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] for deep-space missions or [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] for near-Earth missions.\n\nEach flight controller has a unique [[call sign]], which describes the position's responsibilities. The call sign and responsibility refer to the particular ''console'', not just the person, since missions are managed around the clock and with each shift change a different person takes over the console.\n\nFlight controller responsibilities have changed over time, and continue to evolve. New controllers are added, and tasks are reassigned to other controllers to keep up with changing technical systems. For example, the EECOM handled [[command and service module]] communication systems through [[Apollo 10]], which was afterward assigned to a new position called INCO.\n\n=== Responsibility ===\nFlight controllers are responsible for the success of the mission and for the lives of the astronauts under their watch. The Flight Controllers' Creed states that they must \"always be aware that suddenly and unexpectedly we may find ourselves in a role where our performance has ultimate consequences.\" Well-known actions taken by flight controllers include:\n\n* The [[Apollo 11]] [[Lunar Module]] computer was overloaded because the astronauts forgot to switch off their upper-stage radar before switching on the downward-pointing radar. Guidance officer [[Steve Bales]] had only a few seconds to determine whether it was safe to land anyway or to abort the mission mere feet above the Moon. Bales was later honored for his role in the mission, when he was selected to accept the [[NASA Group Achievement Award]] from President [[Richard Nixon]] on behalf of the [[Apollo 11]] mission operations team.\n* During the launch of [[Apollo 12]], the [[Saturn V]] was struck by lightning which knocked out all [[telemetry]] and multiple command module systems. Seconds before mission abort, EECOM controller [[John Aaron]] determined that switching to the backup electrical power distribution telemetry conditioning would reveal the true nature of the issue.\n* During Space Shuttle mission [[STS-51-F]], a [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engine]] failed during ascent to orbit. Subsequently, indications were received of a second engine beginning to fail, which would have caused a [[Space Shuttle abort modes|mission abort]], possibly including loss of the shuttle. Booster officer Jenny Howard Stein determined that the anomalous readings on the second engine were a sensor error and not an engine problem. At her direction the crew inhibited the sensor, which saved the mission and possibly the crew.\n\n== Common flight control positions ==\n[[Image:Flight Director insignia.png|thumb|Flight Director's insignia at JSC]]\nThere are some positions that have and will serve the same function in every vehicle's flight control team. The group of individuals serving in those positions may be different, but they will be called the same thing and serve the same function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/mcc/index.html|title=HSF|website=spaceflight.nasa.gov|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Flight director ===\n[[File:Eugene F. Kranz at his console at the NASA Mission Control Center.jpg|thumbnail|right|NASA chief flight director Gene Kranz at his console on May 30, 1965, in the Mission Operations Control Room, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]], [[Houston]].]]\nLeads the flight control team. ''Flight'' has overall operational responsibility for missions and payload operations and for all decisions regarding safe, expedient flight. This person monitors the other flight controllers, remaining in constant verbal communication with them via intercom channels called \"loops\".\n\n===Flight operations directorate (FOD) ===\n\nIs a representative of the senior management chain at JSC, and is there to help the flight director make those decisions that have no safety-of-flight consequences, but may have cost or public perception consequences. The FOD cannot overrule the flight director during a mission.  The former mission operations directorate (MOD) position was renamed FOD when the flight crew operations directorate (FCOD) was merged back with MOD beginning in August 2014.\n\n==={{anchor|CAPCOM}} Spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM)===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[STS-51-L Mission timeline]] -->\nGenerally, only the '''spacecraft communicator''' communicates directly with the crew of a crewed space flight. The acronym dates back to [[Project Mercury]] when the spacecraft was originally termed a \"capsule.\" [[NASA]] felt it important for all communication with the [[astronaut]]s in space to pass through a single individual in the [[Mission Control Center]]. That role was first designated the ''capsule communicator'' or '''CAPCOM''' and was filled by another astronaut, often one of the backup- or support-crew members. NASA believes that an astronaut is most able to understand the situation in the spacecraft and pass information in the clearest way.\n\nFor long-duration missions there is more than one CAPCOM, each assigned to a different shift team. After control of U.S. spaceflights moved to the Johnson Space Center in the early 1960s, each CAPCOM used the radio [[call sign|call-sign]] ''Houston''. When non-astronauts are communicating directly with the spacecraft, CAPCOM acts as the communications controller.\n\n{{As of | 2011}}, due to the shrinking size of the astronaut corps at the end of the Shuttle program, fewer astronauts are available to perform CAPCOM duties, so non-astronauts from the space flight training and flight controller branches also function as CAPCOM during ISS missions, while the role was filled solely by astronauts for the Apollo and Shuttle missions. Astronauts still take the CAPCOM position during critical events such as docking and EVA.\n\nIn the context of potential crewed missions to Mars, NASA Ames Research Center has conducted field trials of advanced computer-support for astronaut and remote science teams, to test the possibilities for automating CAPCOM.<ref>William Clancey, Maarten Sierhuis, Richard Alena, John Dowding, Jeffrey Graham, Shannon Rupert, Daniel Berrios, Kim Tyree, Robert Hirsh, W.

A private communication channel can be established between astronauts and the flight surgeon, to provide doctor\u2013patient confidentiality.\n\n===Public affairs officer (PAO)===\n\nProvides mission commentary to supplement and explain air-to-ground transmissions and flight control operations to the news media and the public. The individual filling this role is often referred to colloquially as ''The Voice of Mission Control''.\n\n== Apollo flight control positions ==\n\nThe flight control positions used during the Apollo era were predominantly identical to the positions used for the Mercury and Gemini vehicles. This was because of the similarity of the vehicle design of the capsules used for the three programs.\n\n===Booster systems engineer===\n\nThe booster systems engineer monitored and evaluated performance of propulsion-related aspects of the launch vehicle during prelaunch and ascent. During the Apollo program there were three booster positions, who worked only until [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI); after that, their consoles were vacated. Booster had the power to send an abort command to the spacecraft. All booster technicians were employed at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and reported to JSC for the launches.\n\n===Control officer===\n\nThe control officer was responsible for the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] guidance, navigation, and control systems \u2013 essentially the equivalent of the GNC for the lunar module.\n\n==={{anchor|EECOM}}Electrical, environmental, and consumables manager (EECOM)===\n\nThe EECOM monitored [[cryogenic]] levels for [[fuel cell]]s, and cabin cooling systems; electrical distribution systems; cabin pressure control systems; and vehicle lighting systems. EECOM originally stood for electrical, environmental and communication systems. The [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] EECOM was responsible for CSM communications through [[Apollo 10]]. Afterward the communication task was moved to a new console named INCO.\n\nPerhaps the most famous NASA EECOMs are [[Seymour Liebergot|Seymour \"Sy\" Liebergot]], the EECOM on duty at the time of the oxygen tank explosion on [[Apollo 13]], and [[John Aaron]], who designed the drastically-reduced power budget for its return.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_13_mission/hl_apollo13.html|title=Apollo 13 essay \u2013 Hamish Lindsay|website=www.honeysucklecreek.net|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref> Aaron also saved the [[Apollo 12]] mission by realizing that using the backup power supply for telemetry of analog capsule sensors would allow diagnosis of all the seemingly-unrelated problems caused by a lightning strike.\n\n==={{anchor|FAO}}Flight activities officer (FAO)===\n\nThe FAO planned and supported crew activities, checklists, procedures and schedules.\n\n==={{anchor|FLIGHT}}Flight director===\n\nThe flight directors held overall control of all of the individual positions in the MOCR. Some Apollo era directors were:\n* [[Gene Kranz]], ''White Flight''. Apollo missions 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16 and 17.\n* [[Glynn Lunney]], ''Black Flight''. Apollo missions 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15.\n* [[Gerry Griffin]], ''Gold Flight''. Apollo missions 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. \n* [[Milt Windler]], ''Maroon Flight''. Apollo missions 8, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15.\n* Cliff Charlesworth, ''Green Flight''. Apollo missions 8, 11 and 12.\n* M. P. (Pete) Frank, ''Orange Flight''. Apollo missions 9, 12, 16 and 17.\n\n==={{anchor|FDO}}Flight dynamics officer (FDO or FIDO)===\n\nResponsible for the flight path of the space vehicle, both atmospheric and [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]]. During lunar missions the FDO was also responsible for the lunar [[trajectory]]. The FDO monitored vehicle performance during the powered flight phase and assessed abort modes, calculated orbital maneuvers and resulting trajectories, and monitored vehicle flight profile and energy levels during [[reentry]].\n\n==={{anchor|GUIDO}}Guidance officer (GUIDANCE or GUIDO)===\n\nThe guidance officer monitored on board [[Apollo PGNCS|navigational systems]] and on board [[Apollo Guidance Computer|guidance computer]] software. Responsible for determining the position of the spacecraft in space. One well-known guidance officer was [[Steve Bales]], who gave the ''go'' call when the [[Apollo 11]] guidance computer came close to overloading during the first lunar descent.\n\n==={{anchor|GNC}}Guidance, navigation, and controls systems engineer (GNC)===\n\nThe GNC monitored all vehicle guidance, navigation, and control systems. Also responsible for propulsion systems such as the [[service propulsion system]] and reaction control system (RCS).\n\n===Integrated communications officer (INCO)===\n\nThe INCO was responsible for all data, voice and video communications systems, including monitoring the configuration of in-flight communications and [[instrumentation]] systems. Duties also included monitoring the [[telemetry]] link between the vehicle and the ground, and overseeing the [[uplink]] command and control processes. The position was formed from the combination of LEM and CSM communicator positions.\n\n===Network===\n\nSupervised the network of ground stations that relayed telemetry and communications from the spacecraft.\n\n===Organization and procedures officer (O&P)===\n\nSupervised the application of mission rules and established techniques to the conduct of the flight.\n\n===Retrofire officer (RETRO)===\n\nDrew up abort plans and was responsible for determination of [[retrorocket|retrofire]] times. During lunar missions the RETRO planned and monitored Trans Earth Injection (TEI) maneuvers, where the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo Service Module]] fired its engine to return to earth from the moon.\n\n===Telemetry, electrical, EVA mobility unit officer (TELMU)===\n\nMonitored the [[lunar module]] electrical and environmental systems, plus lunar astronaut spacesuits. Essentially the equivalent of the EECOM for the lunar module.\n\n== Shuttle and Space Station flight controllers ==\nNASA currently has a group of flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston for the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The [[Space Shuttle]] flight control team (as well as those for the earlier Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs) were also based there. Console manning for short-duration and extended operations differed in operational philosophy.\n\nThe Space Shuttle (and prior program) flight controllers worked relatively brief periods: The several minutes of ascent, the few days the vehicle was in orbit, and reentry. The duration of operations for Space Shuttle flight controllers was short and time-critical. A failure on the Shuttle could leave flight controllers little time for talking, putting pressure on them to respond quickly to potential failures. The Space Shuttle flight controllers generally had limited capability to send commands to the shuttle for system reconfigurations.\n\nIn contrast, the ISS flight controllers work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This allows the ISS flight controllers time to discuss off-[[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] telemetry. The ISS flight controllers have the opportunity to interface with many groups and engineering experts. The mentality of an ISS flight controller is to preempt a failure. Telemetry is closely monitored for any signatures that may begin to indicate future catastrophic failures. Generally, ISS flight controllers take a [[prophylactic]] approach to space vehicle operations. There are command capabilities that ISS flight controllers use to preclude a potential failure.\n\n==Shuttle flight control positions (1981-2011)==\nMany Apollo program mission control positions were carried forward to the Space Shuttle program. However, other positions were eliminated or redefined, and new positions were added.\n\nPositions remaining generally the same:\n* Booster\n* FAO\n* FDO\n* Guidance (became guidance and procedures officer, or GPO)\n* GNC\n* INCO (became ''instrumentation'' and communications officer)\n\nPositions eliminated or modified:\n* RETRO\n* EECOM (duties split up)\n* TELMU\n* CONTROL\n\nAfter retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, the operational concept of flight control of a launched crewed vehicle was used as the basis for the Boeing CST-100 Commercial Crew vehicle starting in 2019.\n\n===Assembly and checkout officer (ACO)/payloads===\n\nResponsible for all Space Shuttle-based activities related to construction and operation of the Space Station, including logistics and transfer items stored in a multi-purpose logistics module (MPLM) or [[Spacehab]]. Also responsible for all Shuttle payloads, from Spacehab to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] to deployable satellites. On Shuttle missions that did not dock with the ISS, this position was known as payloads.\n\n===Booster systems engineer (BOOSTER)===\n\nMonitored and evaluated performance of propulsion-related aspects of the launch vehicle during prelaunch and ascent, including the main engines and solid rocket boosters.<ref>{{cite web\n|url =http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1993_1995/95-056.html\n|title =Flight Control of STS-69 \n|last1 =Navias \n|first1 =Rob\n|publisher =Johnson Space Center\n|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100318075948/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1993_1995/95-056.html\n|archivedate =18 March 2010\n|url-status =live\n|accessdate =17 August 2013\n|quote =Booster Systems Engineer (BOOSTER) Monitors main engine and solid rocket booster performance during ascent phase\n}}</ref>\n\n===Data processing system engineer (DPS)===\n\nResponsible for data processing systems in a space flight.

Duties also included monitoring the telemetry link between the vehicle and the ground, and overseeing the uplink command and control processes. The INCO was the only position that uplinked commands to the orbiter. This position was a direct evolution of the integrated communications officer from the Apollo program.\n\n'''MPSR positions'''\n* ''RF COMM'': MPSR lead and responsible for the Ku-band and S-band communication systems.\n* ''INST'': Responsible for uplinking commands and telemetry flows.\n* ''DATA COMM'': Responsible for recording and downlinking telemetry that wasn't streamed live and the FM communication system.\n\n=== <span id=\"MMACS\"></span> Mechanical, maintenance, arm, and crew systems (MMACS) ===\nResponsible for [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] structural and mechanical systems, monitoring [[auxiliary power unit]]s and [[hydraulic]] systems, managing payload bay door, external tank umbilical door, vent door, radiator deploy/stow, [[Ku-band]] antenna deploy/stow, and payload retention latch operations, landing gear/deceleration systems (landing gear deploy, tires, brakes/antiskid, and drag chute deploy), and monitoring the orbiter docking system. MMACS also followed use of on board crew hardware and in-flight equipment maintenance. This represented another portion of the job formerly done by EECOM, with additional responsibilities added by the specific requirements of Space Shuttle operations. The MMACS officer served as the point of contact for PDRS, Booster, and EVA during periods in a mission when these positions did not require constant staffing.\n\n'''MPSR positions'''\n* ''MECH'' \u2013 provided expert support monitoring of mechanical, hydraulic, and landing gear systems\n* ''MECH 2'' \u2013 provided extra support during the dynamic ascent and entry phases of flight\n* ''IFM'' \u2013 In-flight maintenance support\n* ''Crew systems/escape'' \u2013 responsible for operations of on board crew hardware and the crew's launch and entry suits\n* ''Photo/TV'' \u2013 responsible for the \"loose\" camera operation and maintenance, such as still cameras and camcorders, and the integration of video into and out of the orbiter's TV monitors\n\n===Payload deployment and retrieval system (PDRS)===\n\nResponsible for [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] [[Remote Manipulator System|remote manipulator system]] (RMS) or \"robot arm\".\n\n===Propulsion engineer (PROP)===\n\nManaged the [[Reaction control system|reaction control]] thrusters and [[Orbital Maneuvering System|orbital maneuvering]] engines during all phases of flight, monitored fuel usage and propellant tank status, and calculated optimal sequences for thruster firings.\n\n====MPSR Positions====\n*OMS & RCS Engine Officer (OREO): Monitored health of shuttle on-orbit engines\n*Consumables: Monitored fuel usage and mass properties through the mission\n\n===Rendezvous (RNDZ)===\n\nResponsible for activities such as trajectory operations related to the rendezvous and docking/capture with another spacecraft, including [[Mir]], the ISS, and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n===Trajectory officer (TRAJ)===\n\nAssisted the FDO during time-critical operations, responsible for maintaining the various processors that helped determine the shuttle's current and potential trajectories.

If an emergency had occurred, such as loss of one or more main engine during a Space Shuttle launch, requiring the shuttle to land at one of the [[Space Shuttle abort modes|contingency landing site]]s in Africa, Europe or the Middle East, TALCOM would have assumed the role of CAPCOM providing communications with astronauts aboard the crippled orbiter. Like CAPCOM, the TALCOM role was filled by an astronaut. Three astronauts were deployed to the alternate landing sites in [[Zaragoza Air Base]] and [[Moron Air Base]] in Spain, and [[Istres Air Base]] in France. These astronauts flew aboard weather reconnaissance aircraft to provide support at the selected landing site.<ref name=\"FS-2006-01-004-KSC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/167472main_TALsites-06.pdf|title=Space Shuttle Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) Sites|date=December 2006|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref>\n\n== ISS flight control positions to 2010 ==\nThe International Space Station flight control positions used by NASA in Houston are different from those used by previous NASA programs. These differences exist primarily to stem the potential confusion that might otherwise follow from conflicting use of the same name in two different rooms during the same operations, such as when the space shuttle was conducting mated operations with the space station. There are also differences in the control positions because of differences in the operation of the two. The following is a list of those flight controllers located in Mission Control Center \u2013 Houston. There are several other control centers which house dozens of other flight controllers that support the vastly complex vehicle.\n\nPositions formerly used but eliminated or modified:\n\n* Assembly and checkout officer (ACO) \u2013 Retired position at end of shuttle. Was responsible for the integration of assembly and activation tasks for all ISS systems and elements. Coordinated with station and shuttle flight controllers on the execution of these operations. Was also the front room position to ACO Transfer who was responsible for the exchange of cargo between the shuttle and the ISS.\n* Cargo integration officer (CIO) \u2013 Former front room position that answered for ISO and PLUTO\n* Station duty officer (SDO) \u2013 During early phases of ISS, when the vehicle was free-flying (no shuttle present) and uncrewed, the SDO and GC were the only positions on duty, and would call in the appropriate personnel if any problems arose.\n\nStarting in 2001, the ISS flight control room has consolidated six of the below positions into just two, to reduce staffing during low-activity periods. This concept is known as Gemini. After Assembly complete, the Gemini concept was eliminated in the realignment of the core ISS flight control positions.\n* TITAN (Telemetry, Information Transfer, and Attitude Navigation) is responsible for Communication & Tracking (CATO), Command & Data Handling (ODIN), and Motion Control Systems (ADCO).\n* ATLAS (Atmosphere, Thermal, Lighting and Articulation Specialist) is responsible for Thermal Control (THOR), Environmental Control & Life Support (ECLSS), and Electrical Power Systems (PHALCON).

Flight controllers work at computer consoles and use [[telemetry]] to monitor various technical aspects of a [[space mission]] in [[Real-time computing|real time]]. Each controller is an expert in a specific area and constantly communicates with additional experts in the \"back room\". The flight director, who leads the flight controllers, monitors the activities of a team of flight controllers, and has overall responsibility for success and safety.\n\nThis article primarily discusses NASA's flight controllers at the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in [[Houston]]. The various national and commercial flight control facilities have their own teams, which may be described on their own pages.\n\n== NASA's flight controllers ==\nThe room where the flight controllers work was called the mission operations control room (MOCR, pronounced \"moh-ker\"), and now is called the flight control room (FCR, pronounced \"ficker\"). The controllers are experts in individual systems, and make recommendations to the flight director involving their areas of responsibility. Any controller may call for an [[Abort (computing)|abort]] if the circumstances require it. Before significant events, the flight director will \"go around the room\", polling each controller for a go/no go decision, a procedure also known as a [[launch status check]]. If all factors are good, each controller calls for a go, but if there is a problem requiring a hold or an abort, the call is no go. Another form of this is stay/no stay, when the spacecraft has completed a maneuver and has now \"parked\" in relation to another body, including spacecraft, orbiting the Earth or the Moon, or the lunar landings.\n\nControllers in MOCR/FCR are supported by the \"backrooms\", teams of flight controllers located in other parts of the building or even at remote facilities. The backroom was formally called the staff support room (SSR), and is now called the multi-purpose support room (MPSR, pronounced \"mipser\"). Backroom flight controllers are responsible for the details of their assigned system and for making recommendations for actions needed for that system. \"Frontroom\" flight controllers are responsible for integrating the needs of their system into the larger needs of the vehicle and working with the rest of the flight control team to develop a cohesive plan of action, even if that plan is not necessarily in the best interests of the system they are responsible for. Within the chain of command of the MCC, information and recommendations flow from the backroom to the frontroom to Flight, and then, potentially, to the on board crew. Generally, a MOCR/FCR flight control team is made up of the more seasoned flight controllers than the SSR/MPSR, though senior flight controllers cycle back to support in the backroom periodically. One example of the usefulness of this system occurred during the descent of the [[Apollo 11]] [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] [[Apollo 11|''Eagle'']], when \"1202\" and \"1201\" program alarms came from the LM. GUIDO [[Steve Bales]], not sure whether to call for an abort, trusted the experts in the guidance backroom, especially [[Jack Garman]], who told him that the problem was a computer overload, but could be ignored if it was intermittent. Bales called \"Go!\", Flight Director [[Gene Kranz]] accepted the call and the mission continued to success. Without the support of the backroom, a controller might make a bad call based on faulty memory or information not readily available to the person on the console. The nature of quiescent operations aboard the International Space Station (ISS) today is such that the full team is not required for 24/7/365 support. FCR flight controllers accept responsibility for operations without MPSR support most of the time, and the MPSR is only staffed for high-intensity periods of activity, such as joint Shuttle/ISS missions.\n\nThe flight controllers in the FCR and MPSR are further supported by hardware and software designers, analysts and engineering specialists in other parts of the building or remote facilities. These extended support teams have more detailed analysis tools and access to development and test data that is not readily accessible to the flight control team. These support teams were referred to by the name of their room in Mission Control, the mission operations integration room (MOIR), and are now collectively referred to by the name of their current location, the mission evaluation room (MER). While the flight controllers and their backrooms are responsible for real-time decision making, the MOIR/MER provides the detailed data and history needed to solve longer-term issues.\n\n[[Unmanned space mission|Uncrewed U.S. space missions]] also have flight controllers but are managed from separate organizations, either the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] or the Johns Hopkins University [[Applied Physics Laboratory]] for deep-space missions or [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] for near-Earth missions.\n\nEach flight controller has a unique [[call sign]], which describes the position's responsibilities. The call sign and responsibility refer to the particular ''console'', not just the person, since missions are managed around the clock and with each shift change a different person takes over the console.\n\nFlight controller responsibilities have changed over time, and continue to evolve. New controllers are added, and tasks are reassigned to other controllers to keep up with changing technical systems. For example, the EECOM handled [[command and service module]] communication systems through [[Apollo 10]], which was afterward assigned to a new position called INCO.\n\n=== Responsibility ===\nFlight controllers are responsible for the success of the mission and for the lives of the astronauts under their watch. The Flight Controllers' Creed states that they must \"always be aware that suddenly and unexpectedly we may find ourselves in a role where our performance has ultimate consequences.\" Well-known actions taken by flight controllers include:\n\n* The [[Apollo 11]] [[Lunar Module]] computer was overloaded because the astronauts forgot to switch off their upper-stage radar before switching on the downward-pointing radar. Guidance officer [[Steve Bales]] had only a few seconds to determine whether it was safe to land anyway or to abort the mission mere feet above the Moon. Bales was later honored for his role in the mission, when he was selected to accept the [[NASA Group Achievement Award]] from President [[Richard Nixon]] on behalf of the [[Apollo 11]] mission operations team.\n* During the launch of [[Apollo 12]], the [[Saturn V]] was struck by lightning which knocked out all [[telemetry]] and multiple command module systems. Seconds before mission abort, EECOM controller [[John Aaron]] determined that switching to the backup electrical power distribution telemetry conditioning would reveal the true nature of the issue.\n* During Space Shuttle mission [[STS-51-F]], a [[Space Shuttle Main Engine|main engine]] failed during ascent to orbit. Subsequently, indications were received of a second engine beginning to fail, which would have caused a [[Space Shuttle abort modes|mission abort]], possibly including loss of the shuttle. Booster officer Jenny Howard Stein determined that the anomalous readings on the second engine were a sensor error and not an engine problem. At her direction the crew inhibited the sensor, which saved the mission and possibly the crew.\n\n== Common flight control positions ==\n[[Image:Flight Director insignia.png|thumb|Flight Director's insignia at JSC]]\nThere are some positions that have and will serve the same function in every vehicle's flight control team. The group of individuals serving in those positions may be different, but they will be called the same thing and serve the same function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/shuttle/reference/mcc/index.html|title=HSF|website=spaceflight.nasa.gov|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Flight director ===\n[[File:Eugene F. Kranz at his console at the NASA Mission Control Center.jpg|thumbnail|right|NASA chief flight director Gene Kranz at his console on May 30, 1965, in the Mission Operations Control Room, [[Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center|Mission Control Center]], [[Houston]].]]\nLeads the flight control team. ''Flight'' has overall operational responsibility for missions and payload operations and for all decisions regarding safe, expedient flight. This person monitors the other flight controllers, remaining in constant verbal communication with them via intercom channels called \"loops\".\n\n===Flight operations directorate (FOD) ===\n\nIs a representative of the senior management chain at JSC, and is there to help the flight director make those decisions that have no safety-of-flight consequences, but may have cost or public perception consequences. The FOD cannot overrule the flight director during a mission.  The former mission operations directorate (MOD) position was renamed FOD when the flight crew operations directorate (FCOD) was merged back with MOD beginning in August 2014.\n\n==={{anchor|CAPCOM}} Spacecraft communicator (CAPCOM)===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[STS-51-L Mission timeline]] -->\nGenerally, only the '''spacecraft communicator''' communicates directly with the crew of a crewed space flight. The acronym dates back to [[Project Mercury]] when the spacecraft was originally termed a \"capsule.\" [[NASA]] felt it important for all communication with the [[astronaut]]s in space to pass through a single individual in the [[Mission Control Center]]. That role was first designated the ''capsule communicator'' or '''CAPCOM''' and was filled by another astronaut, often one of the backup- or support-crew members. NASA believes that an astronaut is most able to understand the situation in the spacecraft and pass information in the clearest way.\n\nFor long-duration missions there is more than one CAPCOM, each assigned to a different shift team. After control of U.S. spaceflights moved to the Johnson Space Center in the early 1960s, each CAPCOM used the radio [[call sign|call-sign]] ''Houston''. When non-astronauts are communicating directly with the spacecraft, CAPCOM acts as the communications controller.\n\n{{As of | 2011}}, due to the shrinking size of the astronaut corps at the end of the Shuttle program, fewer astronauts are available to perform CAPCOM duties, so non-astronauts from the space flight training and flight controller branches also function as CAPCOM during ISS missions, while the role was filled solely by astronauts for the Apollo and Shuttle missions. Astronauts still take the CAPCOM position during critical events such as docking and EVA.\n\nIn the context of potential crewed missions to Mars, NASA Ames Research Center has conducted field trials of advanced computer-support for astronaut and remote science teams, to test the possibilities for automating CAPCOM.<ref>William Clancey, Maarten Sierhuis, Richard Alena, John Dowding, Jeffrey Graham, Shannon Rupert, Daniel Berrios, Kim Tyree, Robert Hirsh, W.

The individual filling this role is often referred to colloquially as ''The Voice of Mission Control''.\n\n== Apollo flight control positions ==\n\nThe flight control positions used during the Apollo era were predominantly identical to the positions used for the Mercury and Gemini vehicles. This was because of the similarity of the vehicle design of the capsules used for the three programs.\n\n===Booster systems engineer===\n\nThe booster systems engineer monitored and evaluated performance of propulsion-related aspects of the launch vehicle during prelaunch and ascent. During the Apollo program there were three booster positions, who worked only until [[trans-lunar injection]] (TLI); after that, their consoles were vacated. Booster had the power to send an abort command to the spacecraft. All booster technicians were employed at the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and reported to JSC for the launches.\n\n===Control officer===\n\nThe control officer was responsible for the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] guidance, navigation, and control systems \u2013 essentially the equivalent of the GNC for the lunar module.\n\n==={{anchor|EECOM}}Electrical, environmental, and consumables manager (EECOM)===\n\nThe EECOM monitored [[cryogenic]] levels for [[fuel cell]]s, and cabin cooling systems; electrical distribution systems; cabin pressure control systems; and vehicle lighting systems. EECOM originally stood for electrical, environmental and communication systems. The [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] EECOM was responsible for CSM communications through [[Apollo 10]]. Afterward the communication task was moved to a new console named INCO.\n\nPerhaps the most famous NASA EECOMs are [[Seymour Liebergot|Seymour \"Sy\" Liebergot]], the EECOM on duty at the time of the oxygen tank explosion on [[Apollo 13]], and [[John Aaron]], who designed the drastically-reduced power budget for its return.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.honeysucklecreek.net/msfn_missions/Apollo_13_mission/hl_apollo13.html|title=Apollo 13 essay \u2013 Hamish Lindsay|website=www.honeysucklecreek.net|accessdate=2 October 2017}}</ref> Aaron also saved the [[Apollo 12]] mission by realizing that using the backup power supply for telemetry of analog capsule sensors would allow diagnosis of all the seemingly-unrelated problems caused by a lightning strike.\n\n==={{anchor|FAO}}Flight activities officer (FAO)===\n\nThe FAO planned and supported crew activities, checklists, procedures and schedules.\n\n==={{anchor|FLIGHT}}Flight director===\n\nThe flight directors held overall control of all of the individual positions in the MOCR.

Apollo missions 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15.\n* [[Gerry Griffin]], ''Gold Flight''. Apollo missions 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. \n* [[Milt Windler]], ''Maroon Flight''. Apollo missions 8, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15.\n* Cliff Charlesworth, ''Green Flight''. Apollo missions 8, 11 and 12.\n* M. P. (Pete) Frank, ''Orange Flight''. Apollo missions 9, 12, 16 and 17.\n\n==={{anchor|FDO}}Flight dynamics officer (FDO or FIDO)===\n\nResponsible for the flight path of the space vehicle, both atmospheric and [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]]. During lunar missions the FDO was also responsible for the lunar [[trajectory]]. The FDO monitored vehicle performance during the powered flight phase and assessed abort modes, calculated orbital maneuvers and resulting trajectories, and monitored vehicle flight profile and energy levels during [[reentry]].\n\n==={{anchor|GUIDO}}Guidance officer (GUIDANCE or GUIDO)===\n\nThe guidance officer monitored on board [[Apollo PGNCS|navigational systems]] and on board [[Apollo Guidance Computer|guidance computer]] software. Responsible for determining the position of the spacecraft in space. One well-known guidance officer was [[Steve Bales]], who gave the ''go'' call when the [[Apollo 11]] guidance computer came close to overloading during the first lunar descent.\n\n==={{anchor|GNC}}Guidance, navigation, and controls systems engineer (GNC)===\n\nThe GNC monitored all vehicle guidance, navigation, and control systems. Also responsible for propulsion systems such as the [[service propulsion system]] and reaction control system (RCS).\n\n===Integrated communications officer (INCO)===\n\nThe INCO was responsible for all data, voice and video communications systems, including monitoring the configuration of in-flight communications and [[instrumentation]] systems. Duties also included monitoring the [[telemetry]] link between the vehicle and the ground, and overseeing the [[uplink]] command and control processes. The position was formed from the combination of LEM and CSM communicator positions.\n\n===Network===\n\nSupervised the network of ground stations that relayed telemetry and communications from the spacecraft.\n\n===Organization and procedures officer (O&P)===\n\nSupervised the application of mission rules and established techniques to the conduct of the flight.\n\n===Retrofire officer (RETRO)===\n\nDrew up abort plans and was responsible for determination of [[retrorocket|retrofire]] times. During lunar missions the RETRO planned and monitored Trans Earth Injection (TEI) maneuvers, where the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo Service Module]] fired its engine to return to earth from the moon.\n\n===Telemetry, electrical, EVA mobility unit officer (TELMU)===\n\nMonitored the [[lunar module]] electrical and environmental systems, plus lunar astronaut spacesuits. Essentially the equivalent of the EECOM for the lunar module.\n\n== Shuttle and Space Station flight controllers ==\nNASA currently has a group of flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston for the [[International Space Station]] (ISS). The [[Space Shuttle]] flight control team (as well as those for the earlier Gemini, Apollo, and Skylab programs) were also based there. Console manning for short-duration and extended operations differed in operational philosophy.\n\nThe Space Shuttle (and prior program) flight controllers worked relatively brief periods: The several minutes of ascent, the few days the vehicle was in orbit, and reentry. The duration of operations for Space Shuttle flight controllers was short and time-critical. A failure on the Shuttle could leave flight controllers little time for talking, putting pressure on them to respond quickly to potential failures. The Space Shuttle flight controllers generally had limited capability to send commands to the shuttle for system reconfigurations.\n\nIn contrast, the ISS flight controllers work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. This allows the ISS flight controllers time to discuss off-[[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] telemetry. The ISS flight controllers have the opportunity to interface with many groups and engineering experts. The mentality of an ISS flight controller is to preempt a failure. Telemetry is closely monitored for any signatures that may begin to indicate future catastrophic failures. Generally, ISS flight controllers take a [[prophylactic]] approach to space vehicle operations. There are command capabilities that ISS flight controllers use to preclude a potential failure.\n\n==Shuttle flight control positions (1981-2011)==\nMany Apollo program mission control positions were carried forward to the Space Shuttle program. However, other positions were eliminated or redefined, and new positions were added.\n\nPositions remaining generally the same:\n* Booster\n* FAO\n* FDO\n* Guidance (became guidance and procedures officer, or GPO)\n* GNC\n* INCO (became ''instrumentation'' and communications officer)\n\nPositions eliminated or modified:\n* RETRO\n* EECOM (duties split up)\n* TELMU\n* CONTROL\n\nAfter retirement of the Space Shuttle in 2011, the operational concept of flight control of a launched crewed vehicle was used as the basis for the Boeing CST-100 Commercial Crew vehicle starting in 2019.\n\n===Assembly and checkout officer (ACO)/payloads===\n\nResponsible for all Space Shuttle-based activities related to construction and operation of the Space Station, including logistics and transfer items stored in a multi-purpose logistics module (MPLM) or [[Spacehab]]. Also responsible for all Shuttle payloads, from Spacehab to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] to deployable satellites. On Shuttle missions that did not dock with the ISS, this position was known as payloads.\n\n===Booster systems engineer (BOOSTER)===\n\nMonitored and evaluated performance of propulsion-related aspects of the launch vehicle during prelaunch and ascent, including the main engines and solid rocket boosters.<ref>{{cite web\n|url =http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1993_1995/95-056.html\n|title =Flight Control of STS-69 \n|last1 =Navias \n|first1 =Rob\n|publisher =Johnson Space Center\n|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20100318075948/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1993_1995/95-056.html\n|archivedate =18 March 2010\n|url-status =live\n|accessdate =17 August 2013\n|quote =Booster Systems Engineer (BOOSTER) Monitors main engine and solid rocket booster performance during ascent phase\n}}</ref>\n\n===Data processing system engineer (DPS)===\n\nResponsible for data processing systems in a space flight.

MMACS also followed use of on board crew hardware and in-flight equipment maintenance. This represented another portion of the job formerly done by EECOM, with additional responsibilities added by the specific requirements of Space Shuttle operations. The MMACS officer served as the point of contact for PDRS, Booster, and EVA during periods in a mission when these positions did not require constant staffing.\n\n'''MPSR positions'''\n* ''MECH'' \u2013 provided expert support monitoring of mechanical, hydraulic, and landing gear systems\n* ''MECH 2'' \u2013 provided extra support during the dynamic ascent and entry phases of flight\n* ''IFM'' \u2013 In-flight maintenance support\n* ''Crew systems/escape'' \u2013 responsible for operations of on board crew hardware and the crew's launch and entry suits\n* ''Photo/TV'' \u2013 responsible for the \"loose\" camera operation and maintenance, such as still cameras and camcorders, and the integration of video into and out of the orbiter's TV monitors\n\n===Payload deployment and retrieval system (PDRS)===\n\nResponsible for [[Space Shuttle program|Space Shuttle]] [[Remote Manipulator System|remote manipulator system]] (RMS) or \"robot arm\".\n\n===Propulsion engineer (PROP)===\n\nManaged the [[Reaction control system|reaction control]] thrusters and [[Orbital Maneuvering System|orbital maneuvering]] engines during all phases of flight, monitored fuel usage and propellant tank status, and calculated optimal sequences for thruster firings.\n\n====MPSR Positions====\n*OMS & RCS Engine Officer (OREO): Monitored health of shuttle on-orbit engines\n*Consumables: Monitored fuel usage and mass properties through the mission\n\n===Rendezvous (RNDZ)===\n\nResponsible for activities such as trajectory operations related to the rendezvous and docking/capture with another spacecraft, including [[Mir]], the ISS, and satellites such as the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\n===Trajectory officer (TRAJ)===\n\nAssisted the FDO during time-critical operations, responsible for maintaining the various processors that helped determine the shuttle's current and potential trajectories.

If an emergency had occurred, such as loss of one or more main engine during a Space Shuttle launch, requiring the shuttle to land at one of the [[Space Shuttle abort modes|contingency landing site]]s in Africa, Europe or the Middle East, TALCOM would have assumed the role of CAPCOM providing communications with astronauts aboard the crippled orbiter. Like CAPCOM, the TALCOM role was filled by an astronaut. Three astronauts were deployed to the alternate landing sites in [[Zaragoza Air Base]] and [[Moron Air Base]] in Spain, and [[Istres Air Base]] in France. These astronauts flew aboard weather reconnaissance aircraft to provide support at the selected landing site.<ref name=\"FS-2006-01-004-KSC\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/167472main_TALsites-06.pdf|title=Space Shuttle Transoceanic Abort Landing (TAL) Sites|date=December 2006|publisher=[[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]]|accessdate=2009-07-01}}</ref>\n\n== ISS flight control positions to 2010 ==\nThe International Space Station flight control positions used by NASA in Houston are different from those used by previous NASA programs. These differences exist primarily to stem the potential confusion that might otherwise follow from conflicting use of the same name in two different rooms during the same operations, such as when the space shuttle was conducting mated operations with the space station. There are also differences in the control positions because of differences in the operation of the two. The following is a list of those flight controllers located in Mission Control Center \u2013 Houston. There are several other control centers which house dozens of other flight controllers that support the vastly complex vehicle.\n\nPositions formerly used but eliminated or modified:\n\n* Assembly and checkout officer (ACO) \u2013 Retired position at end of shuttle. Was responsible for the integration of assembly and activation tasks for all ISS systems and elements. Coordinated with station and shuttle flight controllers on the execution of these operations.

This concept is known as Gemini. After Assembly complete, the Gemini concept was eliminated in the realignment of the core ISS flight control positions.\n* TITAN (Telemetry, Information Transfer, and Attitude Navigation) is responsible for Communication & Tracking (CATO), Command & Data Handling (ODIN), and Motion Control Systems (ADCO).\n* ATLAS (Atmosphere, Thermal, Lighting and Articulation Specialist) is responsible for Thermal Control (THOR), Environmental Control & Life Support (ECLSS), and Electrical Power Systems (PHALCON).

ISO is the integrator for all cargo that is delivered to and from the ISS for ATV, HTV, Dragon, and Cygnus vehicles.\n\n===Integration systems engineer (ISE)===\n\nA specialist position, the ISE is the systems liaison between ISS and visiting vehicles that are berthed to the US side of ISS. The ISE flight control is responsible for the safety of the ISS such that the visiting vehicle can safely approach, berth, and integrate with the ISS. This includes HTV, Dragon, Cygnus, and even special missions like the deployment of Bigelow Expandable Activity Module (BEAM). ISE works closely with VVO.\n\n===on board data interfaces and networks (ODIN)===\n\nThe ODIN is responsible for the Command and Data Handling (C&DH) system, the Portable Computer System (PCS) computers, the Caution & Warning (C&W) system, overall responsibility for commanding, and interfaces with International Partner avionics systems. The C&DH system consists of the Multiplexer/DeMultiplexers (MDMs) which are the ISS computers. Core software in each MDM (not User Application Software), the [[MIL-STD-1553]] data busses, Automated Payload Switches (APSs), fiber optic network, Payload Ethernet Hub Gateway (PEHG), and the [[Ethernet]] network. This does not include the Ops LAN, Station Support Computers (SSC), or file server.\n\n'''MPSR positions'''\n* Resource avionics engineer (RAVEN)\n\n===Operations planner (OPSPLAN)===\n\nLeads the coordination, development and maintenance of the station's short-term plan, including crew and ground activities.

The OSO is also responsible for mechanical systems\u2014such as those used to attach new modules or truss sections to the vehicle during assembly.\n\n===Plug-in port utilization officer (PLUTO)===\n\nThe name PLUTO is inherited from the flight controller's original role, which was to maintain and coordinate changes to the U.S. segment of the electrical plug-in plan (PiP). The PiP is the tracking of portable electronic equipment, making sure equipment connected is compatible and does not violate constraints, and will not overdraw the power source. Along with this, PLUTO is responsible for maintaining the OPSLAN (Operations Local Area Network) and the JSL (Joint Station LAN). PLUTO has remote desktop administration and monitoring capability to the network from the ground. The PLUTO is also responsible for certain Station Developmental Test Objectives, or SDTOs during the mission. This includes programming the Wireless Instrumentation System (WIS) and also remote desktop commanding for [[Robonaut|ROBONAUT]] activities.\n\n'''MPSR position'''\n* Hydra\n\n===Power, heating, articulation, lighting control officer (PHALCON)===\n\nManages the power generation, storage, and power distribution capabilities.\n\n===Remote interface officer (RIO)===\n\nFormerly known as the Russian interface officer.

The tree bore fruit in abundant quantity and of extraordinary sweetness. Its uniqueness excited attention and provoked an investigation. The resulting inspection of the tree uncovered Gabirol's remains, and led to the identification and execution of the murderer.\n\n==Historical identity==\nThough Gabirol's legacy was esteemed throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, it was historically minimized by two errors of scholarship that mis-attributed his works.\n\n===False ascription as King Solomon===\nGabirol seems to have often been called \"the M\u00e1lagan\", after his place of birth, and would occasionally so refer to himself when encrypting his signature in his poems (e.g. in \"\u05e9\u05d8\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd\", he embeds his signature as an [[acrostic]] in the form \"\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05df \u05d1\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05dc \u05de\u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d6\u05e7\" \u2013 meaning: \"I am young Solomon, son of Rabi Yehuda, from Malaqa, Hazak\"). While in [[Modern Hebrew]] the city is also called M\u00e1laga ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05d0\u05dc\u05d2\u05d4}}), that is in deference to its current [[Spanish language|Spanish]] pronunciation. In Gabirol's day, when it was ruled by Arabic speakers, it was called ''M\u0101laqa'' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0629}}), as it is to this day by Arabic speakers. The 12th-century Arab philosopher [[Jabir ibn Aflah]] misinterpreted manuscript signatures of the form \"\u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 ... \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 ... \u05d0\u05dc\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05e7\" to mean \"Solomon ... the Jew .. the king\", and so ascribed to [[Solomon]] some seventeen philosophical essays of Gabirol. The 15th-century Jewish philosopher [[Yohanan Alemanno]] imported that error back into the Hebrew canon, and added another four works to the list of false ascriptions.<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxx}}\n\n===Identification as Avicebron===\nIn 1846, [[Solomon Munk]] discovered among the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] manuscripts in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale|French National Library]] in [[Paris]] a work by [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]]. Comparing it with a [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] work by Avicebron entitled ''[[Solomon ibn Gabirol#Fons Vit\u00e6|Fons Vit\u00e6]]'', Munk proved them to both excerpt an [[Arabic]] original of which the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' was evidently the translation. Munk concluded that Avicebron or Avencebrol, who had for centuries been believed to be a Christian<ref name=pen/> or Arabic Muslim philosopher,<ref name=eb9/> was instead identical with the Jewish Solomon ibn Gabirol.<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxxi-xxxii}}<ref name=pen/><ref name=Orient/> The centuries-long confusion was in part due to a content feature atypical in Jewish writings: ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' exhibits an independence of Jewish religious dogma and does not cite Biblical verses or Rabbinic sources.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe progression in the Latinization of Gabirol's name seems to have been ibn Gabirol, Ibngebirol, Avengebirol.

It was preserved for the ages by a translation into Latin in the year 1150 by [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]], who was the first official director of the [[Toledo School of Translators]], a [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] [[philosopher]], and the [[archdeacon]] of [[Segovia, Spain]].<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxx}} In the 13th century, Shem Tov ibn Falaquera wrote a summary of ''Fons'' ''Vit\u00e6'' in Hebrew,<ref name=stanford/> and only in 1926 was the full Latin text was translated into Hebrew.<ref name=chabad/>\n\n''Fons Vit\u00e6'' consists of five sections:<ref name=je1906/>\n# matter and form in general and their relation in physical substances ({{lang-la|substanti\u00e6 corpore\u00e6 sive composit\u00e6}});\n# the substance which underlies the corporeality of the world ({{lang-la|de substantia qu\u00e6 sustinet corporeitatem mundi}});\n# proofs of the existence of intermediaries between God and the physical world ({{lang-la|substanti\u00e6 simplices}}, lit. \"intelligibiles\");\n# proofs that these \"intelligibiles\" are likewise constituted of matter and form;\n# universal matter and universal form.\n\n''Fons Vit\u00e6'' posits that the basis of existence and the source of life in every created thing is a combination of \"matter\" ({{lang-la|materia universalis}}) and \"form\". The doctrine of matter and form informed the work's subtitle: \"''De Materia et Forma.''\"<ref>The manuscript in the Mazarine Library is entitled \"''De Materia Universali''\"</ref> Its chief doctrines are:<ref name=je1906/>\n# everything that exists may be reduced to three categories:\n## God;\n## matter and form (i.e. Creation);\n## will (an intermediary).\n# All created beings are constituted of form and matter.\n# This holds true for both the physical world ({{lang-la|substantiis corporeis sive compositis}}) and the spiritual world ({{lang-la|substantiis spiritualibus sive simplicibus}}), which latter are the connecting link between the first substance (i.e. the Godhead, {{lang-la|essentia prima}}) and the physical world ({{lang-la|substantia, qu\u00e6 sustinet novem pr\u00e6dicamenta}}, lit. \"substance divided into nine categories\").\n# Matter and form are always and everywhere in the relation of \"''sustinens''\" and \"''sustentatum''\", \"''propriatum''\" and \"''proprietas''\": substratum and property or attribute.\n\n===Influence within Judaism===\n\nThough Gabirol as a philosopher was ignored by the Jewish community, Gabirol as a poet was not, and through his poetry, he introduced his philosophical ideas.<ref name=eb9/> His best-known poem, [[:s:Royal Crown|''Keter Malkut'' (\"Royal Crown\")]], is a philosophical treatise in poetical form, the \"double\" of the ''Fons Vit\u00e6''. For example, the eighty-third line of the poem points to one of the teachings of the ''Fons Vit\u00e6''; namely, that all the attributes predicated of God exist apart in thought alone and not in reality.<ref name=je1906/>\n\n[[Moses ibn Ezra]] is the first to mention Gabirol as a philosopher, praising his intellectual achievements, and quoting several passages from the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' in his own work, ''Aruggat ha-Bosem''.<ref name=je1906/> [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], who cites Gabirol's philosophico-allegorical Bible interpretation, borrows from the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' both in his prose and in his poetry without giving due credit.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe 12th-century philosopher [[Joseph ibn Tzaddik]] borrows extensively from the \"Fons Vit\u00e6\" in his work ''Microcosmos''.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nAnother 12th-century philosopher, [[Abraham ibn Daud]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], was the first to take exception to Gabirol's teachings. In ''Sefer ha-Kabbalah'' he praises Gabirol as a poet. But to counteract the influence of ibn Gabirol the philosopher, he wrote an Arabic book, translated into Hebrew under the title ''Emunah Ramah'', in which he reproaches Gabirol for having philosophized without any regard to the requirements of the Jewish religious position and bitterly accuses him of mistaking a number of poor reasons for one good one.<ref name=je1906/> He criticizes Gabirol for being repetitive, wrong-headed and unconvincing.<ref name=stanford/>\n\nOccasional traces of ibn Gabriol's thought are found in some of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature of the 13th century. Later references to ibn Gabirol, such as those of [[Elijah ben Joseph Chabillo|Elijah Chabillo]], [[Isaac Abravanel|Isaac Abarbanel]], [[Abravanel|Judah Abarbanel]], [[Moses Almosnino]], and [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], are based on an acquaintance with the scholastic philosophy, especially the works of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]].<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe 13th-century a Jewish philosopher [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] drew upon Gabirol's works in his encyclopedic philosophical text ''Sefer Ha\u1e25ibbur'' ({{lang-he|\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8}}, {{IPA-he|\u02c8se.fer ha.xi.\u02c8bur|pron}}, lit. \"The Book of Compilation\").\n\n===Influence on Scholasticism===\n\nFor over six centuries, the Christian world regarded ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' as the work of a Christian philosopher<ref name=pen/> or Arabic Muslim philosopher,<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxxi-xxxii}}<ref name=eb9/><ref name=pen/><ref name=Orient/> and it became a cornerstone and bone of contention in many theologically charged debates between Franciscans and Dominicans.<ref name=stanford/><ref name=je1906/> The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] led by [[St. Albertus Magnus]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] opposed the teachings of ''Fons Vit\u00e6''; the Platonist [[Franciscan]]s led by [[Duns Scotus]] supported its teachings, and led to its acceptance in Christian philosophy, influencing later philosophers such as the 16th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] [[Giordano Bruno]].<ref name=je1906/> Other early supporters of Gabirol's philosophy include the following:<ref name=je1906/>\n\n* [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]], who translated the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' into Latin and incorporated its ideas into his own teaching.\n* [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]], who refers to the work of Gabirol under the title ''Fons Sapienti\u00e6''. He speaks of Gabirol as a Christian and praises him as \"''unicus omnium philosophantium nobilissimus''.\"\n* [[Alexander of Hales]] and his disciple [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]], who accept the teaching of Gabirol that spiritual substances consist of matter and form.\n* William of Lamarre\n\nThe main points at issue between Gabirol and Aquinas were as follows:<ref name=je1906/>\n# the universality of matter, Aquinas holding that spiritual substances are immaterial;\n# the plurality of forms in a physical entity, which Aquinas denied;\n# the power of activity of physical beings, which Gabirol affirmed. Aquinas held that Gabirol made the mistake of transferring to real existence the theoretical combination of genus and species, and that he thus came to the erroneous conclusion that in reality all things are constituted of matter and form as genus and species respectively.\n\n==Ethics==\n\n===''The Improvement of the Moral Qualities''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n| '''Sight'''\n| '''Hearing'''\n\n|-\n| <poem>Pride\nMeekness\nPudency\nImpudence</poem>\n| <poem>Love\nHate\nMercy\nHard-heartedness (cruelty)</poem>\n\n|-\n| '''Smell'''\n| '''Taste'''\n\n|-\n| <poem>Wrath\nGood-will (suavity)\nJealousy\nWide-awakeness</poem>\n| <poem>Joy (cheerfulness)\nGrief (apprehensiveness)\nTranquillity\nPenitence (remorse)</poem>\n\n|-\n| colspan=2 style=\"padding-left:35%;\" | '''Touch'''\n|-\n| colspan=2 style=\"padding-left:35%;\" | <poem>Liberality\nMiserliness\nValor\nCowardice</poem>\n|}\n\n''The Improvement of the Moral Qualities'', originally written in Arabic under the title Islah al-Khlaq ({{lang-ar|\u0625\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642}}), and later translated by Ibn Tibbon as ({{lang-he|\"\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\"}}, {{IPA-he|ti.'kun mi.\u02c8dot ha.\u02c8ne.fe\u0283|pron}}) is an ethical treatise that has been called by Munk \"a popular manual of morals.\"{{cite quote|date=October 2015}} It was composed by Gabirol at Zaragoza in 1045, at the request of some friends who wished to possess a book treating of the qualities of man and the methods of effecting their improvement.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe innovations in the work are that it presents the principles of [[ethics]] independently of religious dogma and that it proposes that the five physical senses are emblems and instruments of virtue and vice, but not their agents; thus, a person's inclination to vice is subject to a person's will to change.<ref name=je1906/> Gabirol presents a tabular diagram of the relationship of twenty qualities to the five senses, reconstructed at right,<ref name=je1906/> and urges his readers to train the qualities of their souls unto good through self-understanding and habituation.

It seems Gabirol never married,<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxvi}} and that he spent the remainder of his life wandering.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nGabirol had become an accomplished poet and philosopher at an early age:\n* By age 17, he had composed five of his known poems, one an [[Azharot|azhara]] (\"I am the master, and Song is my slave\"<ref name=chabad/>) enumerating all [[613 commandments]] of [[Judaism]].<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xix}}\n* At age 17, he composed a 200-verse elegy for his friend Yekutiel<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xiv}} and four other notable elegies to mourn the death of [[Hai Gaon]].<ref name=chabad/>\n* By age 19, he had composed a 400-verse alphabetical and acrostic poem teaching the rules of Hebrew grammar.<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxv}}\n* By age 23<ref name=chabad/> or 25,<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxv}}<ref name=pen/> he had composed, in Arabic, \"Improvement of the Moral Qualities\" ({{lang-ar|\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0625\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642}}, translated into Hebrew by [[Judah ben Saul ibn Tibbon]] as {{lang-he|\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9}}<ref name=chabad/>\n* At around age 25,<ref name=chabad/> or not,<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxv}} he may have composed his collection of proverbs ''Mivchar Pninim'' (lit. \"Choice of Pearls\"), although scholars are divided on his authorship.<ref name=stanford/>\n* At around age 28,<ref name=chabad/> or not,<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxv}} he composed his philosophical work ''[[Solomon ibn Gabirol#Fons Vit\u00e6|Fons Vit\u00e6]]''.<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxv}}\n\nAs mentioned above, the conflicting accounts of Gabirol's death have him dying either before age 30 or by age 48.<ref name=stanford/> The opinion of earliest death, that he died before age 30, is believed to be based upon a misreading of medieval sources.<ref name=je1906/> The remaining two opinions are that he died either in 1069 or 1070,<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxvii}} or around 1058 in [[Valencia]].<ref name=je1906/><ref name=sirat/> As to the circumstances of his death, one legend claims that he was trampled to death by an Arab horseman.<ref name=chabad/> A second legend<ref name=yahya/> relates that he was murdered by a Muslim poet who was jealous of Gabirol's poetic gifts, and who secretly buried him beneath the roots of a fig tree. The tree bore fruit in abundant quantity and of extraordinary sweetness. Its uniqueness excited attention and provoked an investigation. The resulting inspection of the tree uncovered Gabirol's remains, and led to the identification and execution of the murderer.\n\n==Historical identity==\nThough Gabirol's legacy was esteemed throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods, it was historically minimized by two errors of scholarship that mis-attributed his works.\n\n===False ascription as King Solomon===\nGabirol seems to have often been called \"the M\u00e1lagan\", after his place of birth, and would occasionally so refer to himself when encrypting his signature in his poems (e.g. in \"\u05e9\u05d8\u05e8 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9 \u05d1\u05e2\u05d3\u05d9\u05dd\", he embeds his signature as an [[acrostic]] in the form \"\u05d0\u05e0\u05d9 \u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 \u05d4\u05e7\u05d8\u05df \u05d1\u05e8\u05d1\u05d9 \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 \u05d2\u05d1\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05dc \u05de\u05d0\u05dc\u05e7\u05d9 \u05d7\u05d6\u05e7\" \u2013 meaning: \"I am young Solomon, son of Rabi Yehuda, from Malaqa, Hazak\"). While in [[Modern Hebrew]] the city is also called M\u00e1laga ({{lang-he|\u05de\u05d0\u05dc\u05d2\u05d4}}), that is in deference to its current [[Spanish language|Spanish]] pronunciation. In Gabirol's day, when it was ruled by Arabic speakers, it was called ''M\u0101laqa'' ({{lang-ar|\u0645\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0629}}), as it is to this day by Arabic speakers. The 12th-century Arab philosopher [[Jabir ibn Aflah]] misinterpreted manuscript signatures of the form \"\u05e9\u05dc\u05de\u05d4 ... \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d3\u05d4 ... \u05d0\u05dc\u05de\u05dc\u05d0\u05e7\" to mean \"Solomon ... the Jew .. the king\", and so ascribed to [[Solomon]] some seventeen philosophical essays of Gabirol. The 15th-century Jewish philosopher [[Yohanan Alemanno]] imported that error back into the Hebrew canon, and added another four works to the list of false ascriptions.<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxx}}\n\n===Identification as Avicebron===\nIn 1846, [[Solomon Munk]] discovered among the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] manuscripts in the [[Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale|French National Library]] in [[Paris]] a work by [[Shem-Tov ibn Falaquera]]. Comparing it with a [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] work by Avicebron entitled ''[[Solomon ibn Gabirol#Fons Vit\u00e6|Fons Vit\u00e6]]'', Munk proved them to both excerpt an [[Arabic]] original of which the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' was evidently the translation. Munk concluded that Avicebron or Avencebrol, who had for centuries been believed to be a Christian<ref name=pen/> or Arabic Muslim philosopher,<ref name=eb9/> was instead identical with the Jewish Solomon ibn Gabirol.<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxxi-xxxii}}<ref name=pen/><ref name=Orient/> The centuries-long confusion was in part due to a content feature atypical in Jewish writings: ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' exhibits an independence of Jewish religious dogma and does not cite Biblical verses or Rabbinic sources.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe progression in the Latinization of Gabirol's name seems to have been ibn Gabirol, Ibngebirol, Avengebirol. Avengebrol, Avencebrol, Avicebrol, and finally Avicebron.<ref name=je1906/> Some sources still refer to him as Avicembron, Avicenbrol, or Avencebrol.<ref name=stanford/>\n\n==Philosophy==\nGabirol, in his poem \"\u05db\u05e9\u05e8\u05e9 \u05e2\u05e5\" (line 24), claims to have written twenty philosophical works.

The doctrine of matter and form informed the work's subtitle: \"''De Materia et Forma.''\"<ref>The manuscript in the Mazarine Library is entitled \"''De Materia Universali''\"</ref> Its chief doctrines are:<ref name=je1906/>\n# everything that exists may be reduced to three categories:\n## God;\n## matter and form (i.e. Creation);\n## will (an intermediary).\n# All created beings are constituted of form and matter.\n# This holds true for both the physical world ({{lang-la|substantiis corporeis sive compositis}}) and the spiritual world ({{lang-la|substantiis spiritualibus sive simplicibus}}), which latter are the connecting link between the first substance (i.e. the Godhead, {{lang-la|essentia prima}}) and the physical world ({{lang-la|substantia, qu\u00e6 sustinet novem pr\u00e6dicamenta}}, lit. \"substance divided into nine categories\").\n# Matter and form are always and everywhere in the relation of \"''sustinens''\" and \"''sustentatum''\", \"''propriatum''\" and \"''proprietas''\": substratum and property or attribute.\n\n===Influence within Judaism===\n\nThough Gabirol as a philosopher was ignored by the Jewish community, Gabirol as a poet was not, and through his poetry, he introduced his philosophical ideas.<ref name=eb9/> His best-known poem, [[:s:Royal Crown|''Keter Malkut'' (\"Royal Crown\")]], is a philosophical treatise in poetical form, the \"double\" of the ''Fons Vit\u00e6''. For example, the eighty-third line of the poem points to one of the teachings of the ''Fons Vit\u00e6''; namely, that all the attributes predicated of God exist apart in thought alone and not in reality.<ref name=je1906/>\n\n[[Moses ibn Ezra]] is the first to mention Gabirol as a philosopher, praising his intellectual achievements, and quoting several passages from the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' in his own work, ''Aruggat ha-Bosem''.<ref name=je1906/> [[Abraham ibn Ezra]], who cites Gabirol's philosophico-allegorical Bible interpretation, borrows from the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' both in his prose and in his poetry without giving due credit.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe 12th-century philosopher [[Joseph ibn Tzaddik]] borrows extensively from the \"Fons Vit\u00e6\" in his work ''Microcosmos''.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nAnother 12th-century philosopher, [[Abraham ibn Daud]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], was the first to take exception to Gabirol's teachings. In ''Sefer ha-Kabbalah'' he praises Gabirol as a poet. But to counteract the influence of ibn Gabirol the philosopher, he wrote an Arabic book, translated into Hebrew under the title ''Emunah Ramah'', in which he reproaches Gabirol for having philosophized without any regard to the requirements of the Jewish religious position and bitterly accuses him of mistaking a number of poor reasons for one good one.<ref name=je1906/> He criticizes Gabirol for being repetitive, wrong-headed and unconvincing.<ref name=stanford/>\n\nOccasional traces of ibn Gabriol's thought are found in some of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] literature of the 13th century. Later references to ibn Gabirol, such as those of [[Elijah ben Joseph Chabillo|Elijah Chabillo]], [[Isaac Abravanel|Isaac Abarbanel]], [[Abravanel|Judah Abarbanel]], [[Moses Almosnino]], and [[Joseph Solomon Delmedigo]], are based on an acquaintance with the scholastic philosophy, especially the works of [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]].<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe 13th-century a Jewish philosopher [[Berechiah ha-Nakdan]] drew upon Gabirol's works in his encyclopedic philosophical text ''Sefer Ha\u1e25ibbur'' ({{lang-he|\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05d4\u05d7\u05d9\u05d1\u05d5\u05e8}}, {{IPA-he|\u02c8se.fer ha.xi.\u02c8bur|pron}}, lit. \"The Book of Compilation\").\n\n===Influence on Scholasticism===\n\nFor over six centuries, the Christian world regarded ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' as the work of a Christian philosopher<ref name=pen/> or Arabic Muslim philosopher,<ref name=davidson/>{{rp|xxxi-xxxii}}<ref name=eb9/><ref name=pen/><ref name=Orient/> and it became a cornerstone and bone of contention in many theologically charged debates between Franciscans and Dominicans.<ref name=stanford/><ref name=je1906/> The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] led by [[St. Albertus Magnus]] and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] opposed the teachings of ''Fons Vit\u00e6''; the Platonist [[Franciscan]]s led by [[Duns Scotus]] supported its teachings, and led to its acceptance in Christian philosophy, influencing later philosophers such as the 16th-century [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[friar]] [[Giordano Bruno]].<ref name=je1906/> Other early supporters of Gabirol's philosophy include the following:<ref name=je1906/>\n\n* [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]], who translated the ''Fons Vit\u00e6'' into Latin and incorporated its ideas into his own teaching.\n* [[William of Auvergne, Bishop of Paris|William of Auvergne]], who refers to the work of Gabirol under the title ''Fons Sapienti\u00e6''. He speaks of Gabirol as a Christian and praises him as \"''unicus omnium philosophantium nobilissimus''.\"\n* [[Alexander of Hales]] and his disciple [[Bonaventure|Bonaventura]], who accept the teaching of Gabirol that spiritual substances consist of matter and form.\n* William of Lamarre\n\nThe main points at issue between Gabirol and Aquinas were as follows:<ref name=je1906/>\n# the universality of matter, Aquinas holding that spiritual substances are immaterial;\n# the plurality of forms in a physical entity, which Aquinas denied;\n# the power of activity of physical beings, which Gabirol affirmed. Aquinas held that Gabirol made the mistake of transferring to real existence the theoretical combination of genus and species, and that he thus came to the erroneous conclusion that in reality all things are constituted of matter and form as genus and species respectively.\n\n==Ethics==\n\n===''The Improvement of the Moral Qualities''===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|-\n| '''Sight'''\n| '''Hearing'''\n\n|-\n| <poem>Pride\nMeekness\nPudency\nImpudence</poem>\n| <poem>Love\nHate\nMercy\nHard-heartedness (cruelty)</poem>\n\n|-\n| '''Smell'''\n| '''Taste'''\n\n|-\n| <poem>Wrath\nGood-will (suavity)\nJealousy\nWide-awakeness</poem>\n| <poem>Joy (cheerfulness)\nGrief (apprehensiveness)\nTranquillity\nPenitence (remorse)</poem>\n\n|-\n| colspan=2 style=\"padding-left:35%;\" | '''Touch'''\n|-\n| colspan=2 style=\"padding-left:35%;\" | <poem>Liberality\nMiserliness\nValor\nCowardice</poem>\n|}\n\n''The Improvement of the Moral Qualities'', originally written in Arabic under the title Islah al-Khlaq ({{lang-ar|\u0625\u0635\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0644\u0627\u0642}}), and later translated by Ibn Tibbon as ({{lang-he|\"\u05ea\u05e7\u05d5\u05df \u05de\u05d3\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05e0\u05e4\u05e9\"}}, {{IPA-he|ti.'kun mi.\u02c8dot ha.\u02c8ne.fe\u0283|pron}}) is an ethical treatise that has been called by Munk \"a popular manual of morals.\"{{cite quote|date=October 2015}} It was composed by Gabirol at Zaragoza in 1045, at the request of some friends who wished to possess a book treating of the qualities of man and the methods of effecting their improvement.<ref name=je1906/>\n\nThe innovations in the work are that it presents the principles of [[ethics]] independently of religious dogma and that it proposes that the five physical senses are emblems and instruments of virtue and vice, but not their agents; thus, a person's inclination to vice is subject to a person's will to change.<ref name=je1906/> Gabirol presents a tabular diagram of the relationship of twenty qualities to the five senses, reconstructed at right,<ref name=je1906/> and urges his readers to train the qualities of their souls unto good through self-understanding and habituation.

Some sources cite 1932. Author Colin Escott cites 1931, stating that \"most biographies quote 1933 or 1934, although government documents cite the earlier year\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/allrootsleadtoro00esco|title=All roots lead to rock: legends of early rock 'n' roll: a Bear Family reader|date=1999|publisher=Schirmer Books|others=Escott, Colin., Bear Family Records (Firm)|isbn=0028648668|location=New York|oclc=40163451}}</ref>  His grave marker cites his birth year as 1932.\n\nHe was raised in a [[Baptist]] family, the son of Rev. George McPhatter and his wife Beulah (some accounts refer to her as Eva). Starting at the age of five, he sang in his father's church [[gospel music|gospel]] choir along with his three brothers and three sisters. When he was ten, Clyde was the soprano-voiced soloist for the choir.<ref>Arnold Shaw, Honkers And Shouters. The Golden Years Of Rhythm And Blues. New York: Crowell-Collier Press, 1978, pg. 381.</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Rev. McPhatter moved his family to [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], where Clyde attended Chelsior High School. He worked part-time as a grocery store clerk and was promoted to shift manager upon graduating high school.<ref name=\"Honkers And Shouters 1978, pg. 381\"/> The family then relocated to [[New York City]], where Clyde formed a gospel group, the Mount Lebanon Singers.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4880/biography}}; accessed March 27, 2018.</ref>\n\n===With Billy Ward & the Dominoes (1950&ndash;53)===\nIn 1950, after winning the coveted Amateur Night at Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]] contest, McPhatter returned to his job as a store manager but was later recruited by [[Billy Ward and his Dominoes]] and was present for the recording of \"[[Sixty Minute Man]]\" for [[Federal Records]], produced by [[Ralph Bass]].<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\n[[Billy Ward and his Dominoes]] was one of the top R&B vocal groups in the country, garnering more popularity than [[the Clovers]], [[the Ravens]] and [[the Five Keys]], largely due to McPhatter's fervent, high-pitched tenor. In his book ''The Drifters'', Bill Millar named [[Ben E. King]], [[Smokey Robinson]] of the Miracles, [[Sammy Turner]], and [[Marv Johnson]] among the many vocalists who patterned themselves after McPhatter. \"Most important,\" he concluded, \"McPhatter took hold of the Ink Spots' simple major chord harmonies, drenched them in call-and-response patterns and sang as if he were back in church. In doing so, he created a revolutionary musical style from which\u2014thankfully\u2014popular music will never recover.\"<ref>Shaw, ''Honkers And Shouters'', 1978, pg. 384.</ref>\n\nAfter recording several more songs with the Dominoes, including \"[[Have Mercy Baby]]\", \"Do Something for Me,\" and \"[[The Bells (Billy Ward and His Dominoes song)|The Bells]]\", McPhatter left the Dominoes on May 7, 1953. He was sometimes passed off as \"Clyde Ward, Billy's little brother.\" Others assumed it was Billy Ward doing the lead singing. As a member of the Dominoes, McPhatter did not earn much money; Ward paid him $100 a week, minus deductions for food, taxes, motel bills, etc. In an interview in 1971 McPhatter told journalist Marcia Vance that \"whenever I'd get back on the block where everybody'd heard my records\u2014half the time I couldn't afford a Coca-Cola.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1953\">Grendysa, Peter. \"The Drifters: Let the Boogie Woogie Roll, 1953\u20131958\". Atlantic Records 81927-1.<!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\nDue to such occurrences, and, as he was frequently at odds with Ward, McPhatter decided he would quit the Dominoes, intent on making a name for himself. He announced his intention to quit the group, and Ward agreed to his leaving provided that McPhatter stayed long enough to coach a replacement. Auditions for a replacement were later held at Detroit's Fox Theater, and a young [[Jackie Wilson]] eventually took over as lead tenor for the Dominoes. The position influenced Wilson's singing style and stage presence. \"I fell in love with the man's voice. I toured with the group and watched Clyde and listened...\"\u2014and apparently learned.<ref name=\"Honkers And Shouters 1978, pg. 381\"/>\n\nPrivately, McPhatter and Ward often argued, but publicly McPhatter expressed his appreciation of Ward for giving him his start in entertainment. \"I think Billy Ward is a very wonderful musician and entertainer. I appreciate all he did for me in giving me my start in show business.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1953\"/>\n\n===The Drifters (1953-54)===\n[[Ahmet Ertegun]], founder of [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Jerry Wexler]], eagerly sought McPhatter after noticing he was not present for an appearance the Dominoes once made at [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], which was \"an odd booking for the Dominoes\", in Ertegun's words.<ref>Shaw, ''Honkers And Shouters'', 1978, pg. 382.</ref>\n\nAfter locating him, McPhatter was then signed to Atlantic on the condition that he form his own group. McPhatter promptly assembled a group and called them [[the Drifters]]. They recorded a few tracks in June 1953, including a song called \"Lucille,\" written by McPhatter himself. This group of Drifters did not have the sound Atlantic executives were looking for however, and Clyde was prompted to assemble another group of singers. The initial members of the Drifters McPhatter assembled were mostly from the Mount Lebanon Singers.\n\nThe revised lineup recorded and released such hits as \"[[Money Honey (Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters song)|Money Honey]],\" \"[[Such a Night]],\" \"[[Honey Love (The Drifters song)|Honey Love]],\" \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\" and \"Whatcha Gonna Do,\" with the record label displaying the group name \"Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters\" on the first two singles, later changed to \"The Drifters featuring Clyde McPhatter\".\n\nIn late 1954, McPhatter was inducted into the U.S. Army and assigned to Special Services in the continental United States, which allowed him to continue recording. After his tour of duty, he left the Drifters and launched a solo career.  The Drifters continued as a successful group, but with many changes in personnel, and the group assembled by McPhatter was long gone by the time of their greatest successes after he left the group.\n\nUpon his departure from The Drifters, McPhatter unwisely sold his share of the group to the band's manager [[George Treadwell]], a decision that he later came to regret, after realizing that he caused his fellow musicians to experience unprofitability and the group essentially became a revolving door line-up with recycled members on a ridiculous $100 weekly salary and paid virtually no royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-drifters-mn0000118544/biography|title=The Drifters - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=August 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Solo career===\nJust after his [[military discharge]], McPhatter recorded his first solo hit, \"Love Has Joined Us Together\", with [[Ruth Brown]]. He released several R&B recordings in the next few years, including \"Rock and Cry\", \"Seven Days\" (later a bigger hit for [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]), \"[[Treasure of Love (Clyde McPhatter song)|Treasure of Love]]\", \"Let Me Know\", \"Just to Hold My Hand\", and his biggest solo hit, \"[[A Lover's Question]],\" written by [[Brook Benton]] and Jimmy T. Williams, which peaked at number 6 in 1958.\n\nMcPhatter's 1956 recording \"Treasure of Love\" was his first number 1 hit on the R&B charts as a solo artist and spent one week in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It reached number 16 on the U.S. pop charts, sold over two million copies in the United States alone, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins|location=London, UK|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/83 83]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/83}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Atlantic Records, McPhatter then signed with [[MGM Records]] and released several more songs, including \"I Told Myself a Lie\" and \"Think Me a Kiss\" (1960) and his first single for [[Mercury Records]], \"Ta Ta.\"{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} His tenure on these labels proved to be less fruitful than his time with Atlantic. He moved to other record labels and recorded more singles, including \"I Never Knew\" and his final Top Ten hit, \"[[Lover Please]]\", written by country artist [[Billy Swan]], which made it to number 7 in 1962. After \"Lover Please\", McPhatter's career took a downward turn, as musical styles and tastes were constantly changing during the 1960s. He turned to [[alcohol abuse]], sporadically releasing recordings that failed to chart.<ref name=\"oldies.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Clyde-McPhatter.html|title=Clyde McPhatter|website=OLDIES.com|accessdate=26 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, McPhatter moved to England, where he still had something of a following, utilizing the UK band ICE as backup.<ref name=\"oldies.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nMcPhatter returned to the U.S. in 1970, making a few appearances in rock-and-roll revival tours, but lived mostly as a recluse. Hopes for a major comeback with a Decca album were crushed on June 13, 1972, when he died in his sleep at the age of 39, of complications of [[myocardial infarction|heart]], liver, and [[kidney disease]], brought on by alcohol abuse - behavior fueled by a failed career and resentment he harbored towards the fans he felt deserted him.<ref name=\"autogenerated1953\"/> In his interview with journalist Marcia Vance, McPhatter said, \"I have no fans.\"<ref>Grendysa, Peter.

c. 1932 \u2013 June 13, 1972) was an American [[rhythm and blues]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[rock and roll]] singer. He was one of the most widely imitated R&B singers of the 1950s and early 1960s<ref name=\"nytimes\">Palmer, Robert (1981).

''[[The New York Times]]'', May 26, 1981.</ref> and was a key figure in the shaping of doo-wop and R&B. \n\nMcPhatter's high-pitched tenor voice was steeped in the gospel music he sang in much of his early life. He was the lead tenor of the Mount Lebanon Singers, a gospel group he formed as a teenager.<ref name=\"Honkers And Shouters 1978, pg. 381\">Shaw, Arnold (1978).

After his tenure with the Dominoes, McPhatter formed his own group, [[the Drifters]], and later worked as a solo performer. Only 39 at the time of his death, he had struggled for years with alcoholism and depression and was, according to Jay Warner\u2019s ''On This Day in Music History'', \"broke and despondent over a mismanaged career that made him a legend but hardly a success.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YEDbvGm9aw0/TUbkXarvdzI/AAAAAAAAADg/hDzYP9s2AH4/s1600/Clyde%2BMcPhatter.jpg&imgrefurl=http://davesmusicdatabase.blogspot.com/2011/06/clyde-mcphatter-r-legend.html&h=252&w=252&sz=10&tbnid=Ls0fJaYP7I16aM:&tbnh=90&tbnw=90&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dclyde%2Bmcphatter%2Bdeath%26tbm%3Disch%26tbo%3Du&zoom=1&q=clyde+mcphatter+death&usg=__dUikYFLDPrDzD2bZzUCun8h9Lwo=&hl=en&sa=X&ei=w-FQUKqNBemM2gWPp4CgDQ&ved=0CDEQ9QEwBjgK|title=Google Image Result|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_YEDbvGm9aw0/TUbkXarvdzI/AAAAAAAAADg/hDzYP9s2AH4/s1600/Clyde+McPhatter.jpg|title=Image|publisher=Google.com|accessdate=2012-12-16}}</ref>\n\nMcPhatter left a legacy of over 22 years of recording history. He was the first artist to be inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, first as a solo artist and later as a member of the Drifters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/inductees?name=clyde+mcphatter&field_inductee_induction_year=&field_induction_category=All.html|title=Inductee Explorer - Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=rockhall.com|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}</ref> \n\nSubsequent [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees#Multiple inductees|double and triple inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] are said to be members of the \"Clyde McPhatter Club\".<ref>[http://rockhallmonitors.blogspot.com/2011/05/one-of-more-interesting-phenomena-of.html \"10 Most Likely Next Members of the Clyde McPhatter Club\"].

Future Rock Legends, January 17, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Life and career==\n\n===Early life===\nMcPhatter was born in the community of [[Hayti, Durham, North Carolina|Hayti]], in [[Durham, North Carolina]] on November 15, although the year is disputed. Some sources cite 1932. Author Colin Escott cites 1931, stating that \"most biographies quote 1933 or 1934, although government documents cite the earlier year\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/allrootsleadtoro00esco|title=All roots lead to rock: legends of early rock 'n' roll: a Bear Family reader|date=1999|publisher=Schirmer Books|others=Escott, Colin., Bear Family Records (Firm)|isbn=0028648668|location=New York|oclc=40163451}}</ref>  His grave marker cites his birth year as 1932.\n\nHe was raised in a [[Baptist]] family, the son of Rev. George McPhatter and his wife Beulah (some accounts refer to her as Eva). Starting at the age of five, he sang in his father's church [[gospel music|gospel]] choir along with his three brothers and three sisters. When he was ten, Clyde was the soprano-voiced soloist for the choir.<ref>Arnold Shaw, Honkers And Shouters. The Golden Years Of Rhythm And Blues. New York: Crowell-Collier Press, 1978, pg. 381.</ref>\n\nIn 1945, Rev. McPhatter moved his family to [[Teaneck, New Jersey]], where Clyde attended Chelsior High School. He worked part-time as a grocery store clerk and was promoted to shift manager upon graduating high school.<ref name=\"Honkers And Shouters 1978, pg. 381\"/> The family then relocated to [[New York City]], where Clyde formed a gospel group, the Mount Lebanon Singers.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4880/biography}}; accessed March 27, 2018.</ref>\n\n===With Billy Ward & the Dominoes (1950&ndash;53)===\nIn 1950, after winning the coveted Amateur Night at Harlem's [[Apollo Theater]] contest, McPhatter returned to his job as a store manager but was later recruited by [[Billy Ward and his Dominoes]] and was present for the recording of \"[[Sixty Minute Man]]\" for [[Federal Records]], produced by [[Ralph Bass]].<ref name=\"nytimes\"/>\n\n[[Billy Ward and his Dominoes]] was one of the top R&B vocal groups in the country, garnering more popularity than [[the Clovers]], [[the Ravens]] and [[the Five Keys]], largely due to McPhatter's fervent, high-pitched tenor. In his book ''The Drifters'', Bill Millar named [[Ben E. King]], [[Smokey Robinson]] of the Miracles, [[Sammy Turner]], and [[Marv Johnson]] among the many vocalists who patterned themselves after McPhatter. \"Most important,\" he concluded, \"McPhatter took hold of the Ink Spots' simple major chord harmonies, drenched them in call-and-response patterns and sang as if he were back in church. In doing so, he created a revolutionary musical style from which\u2014thankfully\u2014popular music will never recover.\"<ref>Shaw, ''Honkers And Shouters'', 1978, pg. 384.</ref> \n\nAfter recording several more songs with the Dominoes, including \"[[Have Mercy Baby]]\", \"Do Something for Me,\" and \"[[The Bells (Billy Ward and His Dominoes song)|The Bells]]\", McPhatter left the Dominoes on May 7, 1953. He was sometimes passed off as \"Clyde Ward, Billy's little brother.\" Others assumed it was Billy Ward doing the lead singing. As a member of the Dominoes, McPhatter did not earn much money; Ward paid him $100 a week, minus deductions for food, taxes, motel bills, etc. In an interview in 1971 McPhatter told journalist Marcia Vance that \"whenever I'd get back on the block where everybody'd heard my records\u2014half the time I couldn't afford a Coca-Cola.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1953\">Grendysa, Peter. \"The Drifters: Let the Boogie Woogie Roll, 1953\u20131958\". Atlantic Records 81927-1.<!-- ISSN/ISBN, page(s) needed --></ref>\n\nDue to such occurrences, and, as he was frequently at odds with Ward, McPhatter decided he would quit the Dominoes, intent on making a name for himself. He announced his intention to quit the group, and Ward agreed to his leaving provided that McPhatter stayed long enough to coach a replacement. Auditions for a replacement were later held at Detroit's Fox Theater, and a young [[Jackie Wilson]] eventually took over as lead tenor for the Dominoes. The position influenced Wilson's singing style and stage presence. \"I fell in love with the man's voice. I toured with the group and watched Clyde and listened...\"\u2014and apparently learned.<ref name=\"Honkers And Shouters 1978, pg. 381\"/> \n\nPrivately, McPhatter and Ward often argued, but publicly McPhatter expressed his appreciation of Ward for giving him his start in entertainment. \"I think Billy Ward is a very wonderful musician and entertainer. I appreciate all he did for me in giving me my start in show business.\"<ref name=\"autogenerated1953\"/>\n\n===The Drifters (1953-54)===\n[[Ahmet Erteg\u00fcn]], founder of [[Atlantic Records]] and [[Jerry Wexler]], eagerly sought McPhatter after noticing he was not present for an appearance the Dominoes once made at [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]], which was \"an odd booking for the Dominoes\", in Erteg\u00fcn's words.<ref>Shaw, ''Honkers And Shouters'', 1978, pg. 382.</ref> \n\nAfter locating him, McPhatter was then signed to Atlantic on the condition that he form his own group. McPhatter promptly assembled a group and called them [[the Drifters]]. They recorded a few tracks in June 1953, including a song called \"Lucille,\" written by McPhatter himself. This group of Drifters did not have the sound Atlantic executives were looking for however, and Clyde was prompted to assemble another group of singers. The initial members of the Drifters McPhatter assembled were mostly from the Mount Lebanon Singers.\n\nThe revised lineup recorded and released such hits as \"[[Money Honey (Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters song)|Money Honey]],\" \"[[Such a Night]],\" \"[[Honey Love (The Drifters song)|Honey Love]],\" \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\" and \"Whatcha Gonna Do,\" with the record label displaying the group name \"Clyde McPhatter & the Drifters\" on the first two singles, later changed to \"The Drifters featuring Clyde McPhatter\".  \n\nIn late 1954, McPhatter was inducted into the U.S. Army and assigned to Special Services in the continental United States, which allowed him to continue recording. After his tour of duty, he left the Drifters and launched a solo career.  The Drifters continued as a successful group, but with many changes in personnel, and the group assembled by McPhatter was long gone by the time of their greatest successes after he left the group. \n\nUpon his departure from The Drifters, McPhatter unwisely sold his share of the group to the band's manager [[George Treadwell]], a decision that he later came to regret, after realizing that he caused his fellow musicians to experience unprofitability and the group essentially became a revolving door line-up with recycled members on a ridiculous $100 weekly salary and paid virtually no royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-drifters-mn0000118544/biography|title=The Drifters - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=August 5, 2017}}</ref>.\n\n===Solo career===\nJust after his [[military discharge]], McPhatter recorded his first solo hit, \"Love Has Joined Us Together\", with [[Ruth Brown]]. He released several R&B recordings in the next few years, including \"Rock and Cry\", \"Seven Days\" (later a bigger hit for [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]]), \"[[Treasure of Love (Clyde McPhatter song)|Treasure of Love]]\", \"Let Me Know\", \"Just to Hold My Hand\", and his biggest solo hit, \"[[A Lover's Question]],\" written by [[Brook Benton]] and Jimmy T. Williams, which peaked at number 6 in 1958. \n\nMcPhatter's 1956 recording \"Treasure of Love\" was his first number 1 hit on the R&B charts as a solo artist and spent one week in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It reached number 16 on the U.S. pop charts, sold over two million copies in the United States alone, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins|location=London, UK|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/83 83]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/83}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving Atlantic Records, McPhatter then signed with [[MGM Records]] and released several more songs, including \"I Told Myself a Lie\" and \"Think Me a Kiss\" (1960) and his first single for [[Mercury Records]], \"Ta Ta.\"{{cn|date=February 2018}} His tenure on these labels proved to be less fruitful than his time with Atlantic. He moved to other record labels and recorded more singles, including \"I Never Knew\" and his final Top Ten hit, \"[[Lover Please]]\", written by country artist [[Billy Swan]], which made it to number 7 in 1962. After \"Lover Please\", McPhatter's career took a downward turn, as musical styles and tastes were constantly changing during the 1960s. He turned to [[alcohol abuse]], sporadically releasing recordings that failed to chart.<ref name=\"oldies.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Clyde-McPhatter.html|title=Clyde McPhatter|website=OLDIES.com|accessdate=26 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968, McPhatter moved to England, where he still had something of a following, utilizing the UK band ICE as backup.<ref name=\"oldies.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nMcPhatter returned to the U.S. in 1970, making a few appearances in rock-and-roll revival tours, but lived mostly as a recluse. Hopes for a major comeback with a Decca album were crushed on June 13, 1972, when he died in his sleep at the age of 39, of complications of [[myocardial infarction|heart]], liver, and [[kidney disease]], brought on by alcohol abuse - behavior fueled by a failed career and resentment he harbored towards the fans he felt deserted him.<ref name=\"autogenerated1953\"/> In his interview with journalist Marcia Vance, McPhatter said, \"I have no fans.\"<ref>Grendysa, Peter.

He continued by saying: \"It's a very significant, detailed and intense undertaking that will stretch over four or five days.\" In December 2011 the DPC published a first report on Facebook. This report was not legally binding but suggested changes that Facebook should undertake until July 2012. The DPC is planning to do a review about Facebook's progress in July 2012.\n\n====Changes====\nIn spring 2012, Facebook had to undertake many changes (e.g., having an extended download tool that should allow users to exercise the European right to access to all stored information or an update of the worldwide [[privacy policy]]). These changes were seen as not sufficient to comply with European law by europe-v-facebook.org. The download tool does not allow, for example, access to all data. The group has launched our-policy.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.our-policy.org/|title=Our-Policy.org - Annuity Payments Policies and Regulations|website=Our-policy.org|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> to suggest improvements to the new policy, which they saw as a backdrop for privacy on Facebook. Since the group managed to get more than 7.000 comments on Facebook's pages, Facebook had to do a worldwide vote on the proposed changes. Such a vote would have only been binding if 30% of all users would have taken part. Facebook did not promote the vote, resulting in only 0.038% participation with about 87% voting against Facebook's new policy.

This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998 [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]], which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook at an age younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study's authors also note, \"Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join.\" The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, not 13.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/parents-children-facebook-privacy-age/ |title = Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n===Student-related issues===\n====Student privacy concerns====\nStudents who post illegal or otherwise inappropriate material have faced disciplinary action from their universities, colleges, and schools including expulsion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/10/06/fisher_college_expels_student_over_website_entries|work=The Boston Globe|title=Fisher College expels student over website entries|first=Sarah|last=Schweitzer|date=October 6, 2005}}</ref> Others posting libelous content relating to faculty have also faced disciplinary action.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 25, 2010|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/seventh-grade_north_syracuse_s.html|title=Seventh-grade North Syracuse student suspended, 25 others disciplined for Facebook page about teacher |work=[[The Post-Standard]]|date=January 24, 2010|author=O'Toole, Catie }}</ref> The ''Journal of Education for Business'' states that \"a recent study of 200 Facebook profiles found that 42% had comments regarding alcohol, 53% had photos involving alcohol use, 20% had comments regarding sexual activities, 25% had seminude or sexually provocative photos, and 50% included the use of profanity.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | last1 = Peluchette | first1 = Joy | last2 = Karl | first2 = Katherine | year = 2010 | title = Examining Students' Intended Image on Facebook: \"what were they Thinking?!\". | url = | journal = Journal of Education for Business | volume = 85 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20137 | doi=10.1080/08832320903217606}}</ref> It is inferred that negative or incriminating Facebook posts can affect alumni's and potential employers' perception of them.

Phishing takes the form of a message or Wall post that appears to come from someone on the user's Friend List but in actuality the message was sent by phishers using the friend's login information. The phishers are hoping the user takes the bait resulting in the phishers gaining access to the user's Facebook account. Soon afterwards, the user's other friends will start getting phishing messages from what appears to be the Facebook user. The point of the post is to get the users to visit a website with viruses and malware.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Unpublished photo disclosure bug ===\nIn September 2018, a software bug meant that photos that had been uploaded to Facebook accounts, but that had not been \"published\" (and which therefore should have remained private between the user and Facebook), were exposed to app developers.<ref name=\"guardian-2018-12-14\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/14/facebook-admits-bug-app-developers-hidden-photos|title=Facebook admits bug allowed apps to see hidden photos|first=Alex|last=Hern|date=December 14, 2018|accessdate=December 15, 2018|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref> Approximately 6.8 million users and 1500 third-party apps were affected.<ref name=\"guardian-2018-12-14\"/>\n\n===Sharing private messages and contacts' details without consent===\nIn December 2018, it emerged that Facebook had, during the period 2010\u20132018, granted access to users' private messages, address book contents, and private posts, without the users' consent, to more than 150 third parties including Microsoft, Amazon, Yahoo, Netflix, and Spotify.

The results showed that the frequency of Facebook use was moderately negatively related to general political knowledge.

Students of high schools face a possibility of bullying and other adverse behaviors over Facebook every day. Many studies have attempted to discover whether Facebook has a positive or negative effect on children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 social lives, and many of them have come to the conclusion that there are distinct social problems that arise with Facebook usage. British neuroscientist [[Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield|Susan Greenfield]] stuck up for the issues that children encounter on social media sites. She said that they can rewire the brain, which caused some hysteria over whether or not social networking sites are safe. She did not back up her claims with research, but did cause quite a few studies to be done on the subject. When that self is then broken down by others by badmouthing, criticism, harassment, criminalization or vilification, intimidation, demonization, demoralization, belittlement, or attacking someone over the site it can cause much of the envy, anger, or depression.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Are social networking sites breeding antisocial young people? |first=Alanna |last=Bromley |journal=Journal of Digital Research and Publishing |year=2011 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/8137/1/DRPJournal_5pm_S2_2011.pdf#page=7}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WoP0y3SylQ|title=Students Take On Cyberbullying|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=My Best Day: Presentation of Self and Social Manipulation in Facebook and IM |first=Naomi S. |last=Baron |year=2007 |url=http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/5782/Baron%20-%20My%20Best%20Day.pdf?sequence=1 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523064049/http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/handle/1961/5782/Baron%20-%20My%20Best%20Day.pdf?sequence=1 |archivedate=May 23, 2013  }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=A new addiction for teacher candidates: social networks |journal=The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology |volume=11 |issue=3 |year=2012 |url=http://tojet.net/articles/v11i3/1132.pdf}}</ref>\n\n[[Sherry Turkle]], in her book ''[[Sherry Turkle#Alone Together|Alone Together: Why We Expect More from Technology and Less from Each Other]]'', argues that social media bring people closer and further apart at the same time.

In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: \"At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes.

John Grohol, writing for [[Psych Central]], argued that despite its title and claims of \"[[emotional contagion]],\" this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called \"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count\" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet \"I am not happy\" would be scored as positive: \"Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers.\" Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the [[effect size]] of the findings are little more than a \"statistical blip.\"\n\n<blockquote>Kramer et al. (2014) found a 0.07%\u2014that's not 7 percent, that's 1/15th of one percent!!\u2014decrease in negative words in people's status updates when the number of negative posts on their Facebook news feed decreased.

The video was then shared on YouTube over ten thousand times. The International Criminal Court used it as evidence to indict al-Werfalli for the war crime of murder.<ref>https://www.icc-cpi.int/CaseInformationSheets/al-werfalliEng.pdf</ref> The BBC found the original video was still on Facebook 2 years after his indictment and also discovered videos showing the bodies of civilians being desecrated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} These were taken in Ganfouda, a district of Benghazi which was [[Battle of Benghazi (2014\u20132017)|under siege]] by the LNA between 2016-2017. More than 300 people, including dozens of children died during the siege. A video uncovered by BBC Arabic showed soldiers mocking a pile of corpses of dead civilians and trampling on bodies. Among them was a 77 year old woman, Alia Hamza. Her son, Ali Hamza had five family members killed in Ganfouda.\n\nAli Hamza told BBC Arabic, \u201cI sent links to lawyers to send to the ICC in the Hague against Khalifa Haftar and his military commanders regarding the massacres of civilians,\u201d said Hamza. In the video, the LNA soldiers label the civilians as terrorists. Human rights lawyer and war crimes specialist Rodney Dixon QC reviewed the evidence BBC Arabic found. \u201cIf groups are using those platforms to propagate their campaigns then those platforms should seriously look at their role because they could then be assisting in that process of further crimes being committed,\u201d he said.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} After presenting our findings to Facebook they removed all the videos that show a suspected war crime taking place. However, they opted not to suspend any of the accounts which we found linked to the images.

The NGO [[Shurat Hadin]]-Israel Law Center conducted an experiment over the incitement issue, which sought to expose what it viewed as double standards regarding anti-Israel sentiment vis-a-vis the simultaneous launch of two Facebook pages: \"Stop Palestinians\" and \"Stop Israel\". Following the launch of the two nearly identical pages, the NGO posted hateful content simultaneously on both pages. Next, Shurat Hadin's reported both faux-incitement pages to Facebook to see which, if either, would be removed. According to them, despite featuring nearly identical content, only one was removed from the online platform. They said the page inciting against Palestinians was closed by Facebook (on the same day that it was reported) for \"containing credible threat of violence\" which \"violated our [Facebook's] community standards\", but not the page inciting against Israelis. Shurat Hadin said that Facebook claimed that this page was \"not in violation of Facebook's rules\".

It also develops new tools to aid in its efforts, including the use of [[artificial intelligence]] to match terrorist images and videos, detecting when content is shared across related accounts, and developing technologies to stop repeat offenders. The company stated that it has 150 people dedicated to terrorism countermeasures, and works with governments and industries in an effort to curb terrorist propaganda.

In Facebook's [[Dublin]], Ireland headquarters, six individuals were determined to be \"high priority\" victims of the error, after the company concluded that their profiles were likely viewed by potential terrorists in groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]]. The bug itself, discovered in November 2016 and fixed two weeks later, was active for one month, and had also been retroactively exposing censored personal accounts from August 2016. One affected worker had fled Ireland, gone into hiding, and only returned to Ireland after five months due to a lack of money. Suffering from psychological distress, he filed a legal claim against Facebook and [[CPL Resources]], an [[outsourcing]] company, seeking compensation. A Facebook spokesperson stated that \"Our investigation found that only a small fraction of the names were likely viewed, and we never had evidence of any threat to the people impacted or their families as a result of this matter\", and Craig D\u2019Souza, Facebook's head of global investigations, said: \"Keep in mind that when the person sees your name on the list, it was in their activity log, which contains a lot of information [...] there is a good chance that they associate you with another admin of the group or a hacker\". Facebook offered to install a home-alarm monitoring system, provide transport to and from work, and counseling through its employee assistance program. As a result of the data leak, Facebook is reportedly testing the use of alternative, administrative accounts for workers reviewing content, rather than requiring workers to sign in with their personal profiles.<ref>{{cite web |first=Olivia |last=Solon |title=Revealed: Facebook exposed identities of moderators to suspected terrorists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/16/facebook-moderators-identity-exposed-terrorist-groups |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Joon Ian |last=Wong |title=The workers who police terrorist content on Facebook were exposed to terrorists by Facebook |url=https://qz.com/1008070/the-workers-who-police-terrorist-content-on-facebook-were-exposed-to-terrorists-by-facebook/ |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=June 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2018 social network Facebook announced that it has deleted 82 accounts created in [[Iran]] that included posts advocating harsh issues such as race, [[immigration]], and U.S. President Donald Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.radiofarda.com/a/facebook-deletes-iran-linked-accounts-followed-by-1-million-us-britain-political-divisive-sow-discord/29566728.html|title=Facebook Deletes Iran-Linked Accounts Followed By 1 Million In U.S., Britain|website=RFE/RL|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fake news===\n{{Main|Fake news website}}\nFacebook has been criticized for not doing enough to limit the spread of fake news stories on their site, especially after the [[2016 United States presidential election]], which some{{Like whom?|date=October 2019}} have claimed [[Donald Trump]] would not have won if Facebook had not helped spread what they claim to have been fake stories that were biased in his favor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/17/495827410/from-hate-speech-to-fake-news-the-content-crisis-facing-mark-zuckerberg |title=From Hate Speech To Fake News: The Content Crisis Facing Mark Zuckerberg |last=Shahani |first=Aarti |website=NPR |date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Mark Zuckerberg has begun to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news on Facebook as a result criticisms of Facebook's influence on the presidential election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-election/|title=Zuckerberg: Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news|last=Burke|first=Samuel|date=November 19, 2016|website=CNN Money|access-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref> At a conference called ''Techonomy'' Mark Zuckerberg stated in regards to Donald Trump, \"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news\".

According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that for an initial fee of $1,000, entitles Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as additional 1% interest per each day after January 1, 2004, until website completion.

Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt issued a statement indicating that the counsel for Ceglia had unsuccessfully attempted to seek an out-of-court settlement.

At the time, Zuckerberg worked for Ceglia as a code developer on a project named \"StreetFax\".

By omitting this line, Facebook license extends to adopt users' content perpetually and irrevocably years after the content has been deleted.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nMany users of Facebook voiced opinions against the changes to the Facebook Terms of Use, leading to an Internet-wide debate over the ownership of content. [[Electronic Privacy Information Center|The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)]] prepared a formal complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Many individuals were frustrated with the removal of the controversial clause. Facebook users, numbering more than 38,000, joined a user group against the changes, and a number of blogs and news sites have written about this issue.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nAfter the change was brought to light in Walters's blog entry, in his blog on February 16, 2009, Zuckerberg addressed the issues concerning the recently made changes to Facebook's terms of use.

However, on February 17, 2009, Zuckerberg wrote in his blog, that although Facebook reverted to its original terms of use, it is in the process of developing new terms in order to address the paradox. Zuckerberg stated that these new terms will allow Facebook users to \"share and control their information, and it will be written clearly in language everyone can understand.\" Zuckerberg invited users to join a group entitled \"Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities\" to give their input and help shape the new terms.\n\nOn February 26, 2009, Zuckerberg posted a blog, updating users on the progress of the new Terms of Use. He wrote, \"We decided we needed to do things differently and so we're going to develop new policies that will govern our system from the ground up in an open and transparent way.\" Zuckerberg introduces the two new additions to Facebook: the Facebook Principles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=54964476066 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Facebook Principles |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043045/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=54964476066 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> and the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=67758697570 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Statement of Rights and Responsibilities |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043055/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=67758697570 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> Both additions allow users to vote on changes to the terms of use before they are officially released.

Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin's wall, a friend of Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a $500+ fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that \"this was not a bug\" and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating \"Sorry for breaking your privacy&nbsp;... but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit\" and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. However, in a move that was met with much public criticism and disapproval, Facebook refused to pay out the 500+ fee to Shreateh; instead, Facebook responded that by posting to Zuckerberg's account, Shreateh had violated one of their [[terms of service]] policies and therefore \"could not be paid.\" Included with this, the Facebook team strongly censured Shreateh over his manner of resolving the matter. In closing, they asked that Shreateh continue to help them find bugs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bort |first=Julie |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/researcher-facebook-ignored-bug-found-143418388.html |title=Researcher: Facebook Ignored the Bug I Found Until I Used It to Hack Zuckerberg - Yahoo!

Maiffret said: \"He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five-year-old laptop that looks like it is half broken. It's something that might help him out in a big way.\" Facebook representatives have since responded, \"We will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users.\" Facebook representatives also claimed they'd paid out over $1&nbsp;million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past.<ref>{{cite web|agency=Reuters |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hacker-exposed-facebook-bug-reward-210333258.html |title=Hacker who exposed Facebook bug to get reward from unexpected source - Yahoo!

Within three days, the video had gone viral with more than a million views (it has reached 2,521,614 views as of June 10, 2014). In the video, Muller illustrates how after paying US$50 to Facebook advertising, the \"likes\" to his fan page have tripled in a few days and soon reached 70,000 \"likes\", compared to his original 2,115 likes before the advertising. Despite the significant increase in likes, Muller noticed his page has actually decreased in engagement \u2013 there were fewer people commenting, sharing, and liking his posts and updates despite the significant increase in \"likes\".

In the wake of a January 2019 report by ''[[TechCrunch]]'' on Project Atlas, which alleged that Facebook bypassed the App Store by using an Apple enterprise program for apps used internally by a company's employees, Facebook refuted the article but later announced its discontinuation of the program on iOS.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Casey|last1=Newton|accessdate=January 30, 2019|title=Facebook will shut down its controversial market research app for iOS|url=https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2019/1/30/18203349/facebook-research-app-apple-shutdown|date=January 30, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref><ref name=\"TechCrunch Jan 2019\">{{cite web|accessdate=January 30, 2019|title=Facebook pays teens to install VPN that spies on them|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/facebook-project-atlas/|first=John|last=Constine|website=TechCrunch|date=January 29, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn January 30, 2019, Apple temporarily revoked Facebook's Enterprise Developer Program [[Public key certificate|certificates]] for one day, which caused all of the company's internal iOS apps to become inoperable.<ref name=\"Recode Jan 2019\">{{cite web|first1=Kurt|last1=Wagner|accessdate=January 30, 2019|title=Apple says it's banning Facebook's research app that collects users' personal information|url=https://www.recode.net/2019/1/30/18203231/apple-banning-facebook-research-app|date=January 30, 2019|website=Recode}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first1=Tom|last1=Warren|accessdate=January 30, 2019|title=Apple blocks Facebook from running its internal iOS apps|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18203551/apple-facebook-blocked-internal-ios-apps|date=January 30, 2019|website=The Verge}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Mike|last1=Isaac|accessdate=2019-02-02|title=Apple Shows Facebook Who Has the Power in an App Dispute|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/31/technology/apple-blocks-facebook.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=31 January 2019|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Apple stated that \"Facebook has been using their membership to distribute a data-collecting app to consumers, which is a clear breach of their agreement with Apple\", and that the certificates were revoked \"to protect our users and their data\".<ref name=\"Recode Jan 2019\" /> US Senators [[Mark Warner]], [[Richard Blumenthal]], and [[Ed Markey]] separately criticized Facebook Research's targeting of teenagers, and promised to sponsor legislation to regulate market research programs.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 31, 2019|title=Senator Warner calls on Zuckerberg to support market research consent rules|url=http://social.techcrunch.com/2019/01/30/facebook-research-app/|date=January 30, 2019|first=Josh|last=Constine|website=TechCrunch}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first1=Issie|last1=Lapowsky|accessdate=January 31, 2019|title=By Defying Apple's Rules, Facebook Shows It Never Learns|url=https://www.wired.com/story/facebook-research-app-lessons/|date=January 30, 2019|issn=1059-1028|website=Wired.com}}</ref>\n\n===Inability to voluntarily terminate accounts===\nFacebook had allowed users to deactivate their accounts but not actually remove account content from its servers. A Facebook representative explained to a student from the [[University of British Columbia]] that users had to clear their own accounts by manually deleting all of the content including wall posts, friends, and groups. ''The New York Times'' noted the issue and raised a concern that emails and other private user data remain indefinitely on Facebook's servers.<ref name=\"aspan\" /> Facebook subsequently began allowing users to permanently delete their accounts in 2010. Facebook's Privacy Policy now states, \"When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Facebook.\"<ref name=\"facebook\" />\n\n===Memorials===\nA notable ancillary effect of social-networking websites is the ability for participants to mourn publicly for a deceased individual. On Facebook, friends often leave messages of sadness, grief, or hope on the individual's page, transforming it into a public book of condolences. This particular phenomenon has been documented at a number of schools.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=March 5, 2008|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/521293.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820170242/http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/521293.html|archivedate=August 20, 2007|title=Net generation grieves with Facebook postings|publisher=News Observer}}</ref><ref name=charlottesville>{{cite news|first=Sarah |last=Batista |url=http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/news/headlines/1999437.html |title=UVA Student Remembered |publisher=Charlottesville Newsplex |date=November 21, 2005 |accessdate=April 10, 2006 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119114556/http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/news/headlines/1999437.html |archivedate=January 19, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=dailyherald>{{cite news|first=Stephanie|last=Bernhard|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/media/paper472/news/2006/01/25/CampusNews/Community.Mourns.Death.Of.Pagan.06-1504200.shtml?norewrite200603280837&sourcedomain=www.browndailyherald.com|title=Community mourns death of Pagan '06|newspaper=Brown Daily Herald|date=January 25, 2006|accessdate=April 10, 2006}}</ref> Facebook originally held a policy that profiles of people known to be deceased would be removed after 30 days due to privacy concerns.<ref>{{cite news|accessdate=March 5, 2008|url=http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2007/02/22/Features/Facebook.Profiles.Become.Makeshift.Memorials-2736508.shtml?mkey=2429152|title=Facebook profiles become makeshift memorials|newspaper=The Brown Daily Herald|date=February 22, 2007|author=Kelleher, Kristina|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321104329/http://media.www.browndailyherald.com/media/storage/paper472/news/2007/02/22/Features/Facebook.Profiles.Become.Makeshift.Memorials-2736508.shtml?mkey=2429152|archivedate=March 21, 2008}}</ref> Due to user response, Facebook changed its policy to place deceased members' profiles in a \"memorialization state\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2007-05-08-facebook-vatech_N.htm?csp=34|title=USA Today article|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 8, 2007|first=Monica|last=Hortobagyi|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}</ref> Facebook's Privacy Policy regarding memorialization says, \"If we are notified that a user is deceased, we may memorialize the user's account.

He continued by saying: \"It's a very significant, detailed and intense undertaking that will stretch over four or five days.\" In December 2011 the DPC published a first report on Facebook. This report was not legally binding but suggested changes that Facebook should undertake until July 2012. The DPC is planning to do a review about Facebook's progress in July 2012.\n\n====Changes====\nIn spring 2012, Facebook had to undertake many changes (e.g., having an extended download tool that should allow users to exercise the European right to access to all stored information or an update of the worldwide [[privacy policy]]). These changes were seen as not sufficient to comply with European law by europe-v-facebook.org. The download tool does not allow, for example, access to all data. The group has launched our-policy.org<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.our-policy.org/|title=Our-Policy.org - Annuity Payments Policies and Regulations|website=Our-policy.org|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}</ref> to suggest improvements to the new policy, which they saw as a backdrop for privacy on Facebook. Since the group managed to get more than 7.000 comments on Facebook's pages, Facebook had to do a worldwide vote on the proposed changes. Such a vote would have only been binding if 30% of all users would have taken part. Facebook did not promote the vote, resulting in only 0.038% participation with about 87% voting against Facebook's new policy.

This policy is in compliance with a United States law, the 1998 [[Children's Online Privacy Protection Act]], which requires minors aged 13 or younger to gain explicit parental consent to access commercial websites. In jurisdictions where a similar law sets a lower minimum age, Facebook enforces the lower age. Of the 1,007 households surveyed for the study, 76% of parents reported that their child joined Facebook at an age younger than 13, the minimum age in the site's terms of service. The study also reported that Facebook removes roughly 20,000 users each day for violating its minimum age policy. The study's authors also note, \"Indeed, Facebook takes various measures both to restrict access to children and delete their accounts if they join.\" The findings of the study raise questions primarily about the shortcomings of United States federal law, but also implicitly continue to raise questions about whether or not Facebook does enough to publicize its terms of service with respect to minors. Only 53% of parents said they were aware that Facebook has a minimum signup age; 35% of these parents believe that the minimum age is merely a recommendation or thought the signup age was 16 or 18, not 13.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/education/parents-children-facebook-privacy-age/ |title = Why Parents Help Their Children Lie to Facebook About Age: Unintended Consequences of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}</ref>\n\n===Student-related issues===\n====Student privacy concerns====\nStudents who post illegal or otherwise inappropriate material have faced disciplinary action from their universities, colleges, and schools including expulsion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/10/06/fisher_college_expels_student_over_website_entries|work=The Boston Globe|title=Fisher College expels student over website entries|first=Sarah|last=Schweitzer|date=October 6, 2005}}</ref> Others posting libelous content relating to faculty have also faced disciplinary action.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 25, 2010|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/seventh-grade_north_syracuse_s.html|title=Seventh-grade North Syracuse student suspended, 25 others disciplined for Facebook page about teacher |work=[[The Post-Standard]]|date=January 24, 2010|author=O'Toole, Catie }}</ref> The ''Journal of Education for Business'' states that \"a recent study of 200 Facebook profiles found that 42% had comments regarding alcohol, 53% had photos involving alcohol use, 20% had comments regarding sexual activities, 25% had seminude or sexually provocative photos, and 50% included the use of profanity.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite journal | last1 = Peluchette | first1 = Joy | last2 = Karl | first2 = Katherine | year = 2010 | title = Examining Students' Intended Image on Facebook: \"what were they Thinking?!\". | url = | journal = Journal of Education for Business | volume = 85 | issue = 1| pages = 30\u20137 | doi=10.1080/08832320903217606}}</ref> It is inferred that negative or incriminating Facebook posts can affect alumni's and potential employers' perception of them.

Phishing takes the form of a message or Wall post that appears to come from someone on the user's Friend List but in actuality the message was sent by phishers using the friend's login information. The phishers are hoping the user takes the bait resulting in the phishers gaining access to the user's Facebook account.

It is caused by the extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect.

The results showed that the frequency of Facebook use was moderately negatively related to general political knowledge.

Many studies have attempted to discover whether Facebook has a positive or negative effect on children\u2019s and teenagers\u2019 social lives, and many of them have come to the conclusion that there are distinct social problems that arise with Facebook usage. British neuroscientist [[Susan Greenfield, Baroness Greenfield|Susan Greenfield]] stuck up for the issues that children encounter on social media sites. She said that they can rewire the brain, which caused some hysteria over whether or not social networking sites are safe. She did not back up her claims with research, but did cause quite a few studies to be done on the subject.

In its complaint, EPIC alleged that Facebook had deceived users by secretly conducting a psychological experiment on their emotions: \"At the time of the experiment, Facebook did not state in the Data Use Policy that user data would be used for research purposes.

John Grohol, writing for [[Psych Central]], argued that despite its title and claims of \"[[emotional contagion]],\" this study did not look at emotions at all. Instead, its authors used an application (called \"Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count\" or LIWC 2007) that simply counted positive and negative words in order to infer users' sentiments. He wrote that a shortcoming of the LIWC tool is that it does not understand negations. Hence, the tweet \"I am not happy\" would be scored as positive: \"Since the LIWC 2007 ignores these subtle realities of informal human communication, so do the researchers.\" Grohol concluded that given these subtleties, the [[effect size]] of the findings are little more than a \"statistical blip.\"\n\n<blockquote>Kramer et al.

The International Criminal Court used it as evidence to indict al-Werfalli for the war crime of murder.<ref>https://www.icc-cpi.int/CaseInformationSheets/al-werfalliEng.pdf</ref> The BBC found the original video was still on Facebook 2 years after his indictment and also discovered videos showing the bodies of civilians being desecrated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} These were taken in Ganfouda, a district of Benghazi which was [[Battle of Benghazi (2014\u20132017)|under siege]] by the LNA between 2016-2017. More than 300 people, including dozens of children died during the siege. A video uncovered by BBC Arabic showed soldiers mocking a pile of corpses of dead civilians and trampling on bodies. Among them was a 77 year old woman, Alia Hamza. Her son, Ali Hamza had five family members killed in Ganfouda.\n\nAli Hamza told BBC Arabic, \u201cI sent links to lawyers to send to the ICC in the Hague against Khalifa Haftar and his military commanders regarding the massacres of civilians,\u201d said Hamza. In the video, the LNA soldiers label the civilians as terrorists. Human rights lawyer and war crimes specialist Rodney Dixon QC reviewed the evidence BBC Arabic found. \u201cIf groups are using those platforms to propagate their campaigns then those platforms should seriously look at their role because they could then be assisting in that process of further crimes being committed,\u201d he said.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} After presenting our findings to Facebook they removed all the videos that show a suspected war crime taking place. However, they opted not to suspend any of the accounts which we found linked to the images. Erin Saltman, Facebook's policy manager for Counterterrorism in Europe, Middle East and Africa, told BBC Arabic, \u201cSometimes there are very conflicting narratives of whether or not the victim is a terrorist, or whether it's a civilian over who's committing that act, we cannot be the pure arbiters of truth.\u201d<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/> But Facebook and Youtube\u2019s own community guidelines

When it comes to alleged incitement, Facebook has been accused of being unfair, removing only posts and pages that attack [[Palestinians]], while turning a blind eye to similar posts that are violently [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]]. The NGO [[Shurat Hadin]]-Israel Law Center conducted an experiment over the incitement issue, which sought to expose what it viewed as double standards regarding anti-Israel sentiment vis-a-vis the simultaneous launch of two Facebook pages: \"Stop Palestinians\" and \"Stop Israel\". Following the launch of the two nearly identical pages, the NGO posted hateful content simultaneously on both pages. Next, Shurat Hadin's reported both faux-incitement pages to Facebook to see which, if either, would be removed. According to them, despite featuring nearly identical content, only one was removed from the online platform.

In Facebook's [[Dublin]], Ireland headquarters, six individuals were determined to be \"high priority\" victims of the error, after the company concluded that their profiles were likely viewed by potential terrorists in groups such as [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]], [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]]. The bug itself, discovered in November 2016 and fixed two weeks later, was active for one month, and had also been retroactively exposing censored personal accounts from August 2016. One affected worker had fled Ireland, gone into hiding, and only returned to Ireland after five months due to a lack of money. Suffering from psychological distress, he filed a legal claim against Facebook and [[CPL Resources]], an [[outsourcing]] company, seeking compensation. A Facebook spokesperson stated that \"Our investigation found that only a small fraction of the names were likely viewed, and we never had evidence of any threat to the people impacted or their families as a result of this matter\", and Craig D\u2019Souza, Facebook's head of global investigations, said: \"Keep in mind that when the person sees your name on the list, it was in their activity log, which contains a lot of information [...] there is a good chance that they associate you with another admin of the group or a hacker\". Facebook offered to install a home-alarm monitoring system, provide transport to and from work, and counseling through its employee assistance program. As a result of the data leak, Facebook is reportedly testing the use of alternative, administrative accounts for workers reviewing content, rather than requiring workers to sign in with their personal profiles.<ref>{{cite web |first=Olivia |last=Solon |title=Revealed: Facebook exposed identities of moderators to suspected terrorists |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jun/16/facebook-moderators-identity-exposed-terrorist-groups |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=June 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Joon Ian |last=Wong |title=The workers who police terrorist content on Facebook were exposed to terrorists by Facebook |url=https://qz.com/1008070/the-workers-who-police-terrorist-content-on-facebook-were-exposed-to-terrorists-by-facebook/ |website=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media]] |date=June 16, 2017 |accessdate=June 18, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn October 26, 2018 social network Facebook announced that it has deleted 82 accounts created in [[Iran]] that included posts advocating harsh issues such as race, [[immigration]], and U.S. President Donald Trump.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.radiofarda.com/a/facebook-deletes-iran-linked-accounts-followed-by-1-million-us-britain-political-divisive-sow-discord/29566728.html|title=Facebook Deletes Iran-Linked Accounts Followed By 1 Million In U.S., Britain|website=RFE/RL|accessdate=December 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Fake news===\n{{Main|Fake news website}}\nFacebook has been criticized for not doing enough to limit the spread of fake news stories on their site, especially after the [[2016 United States presidential election]], which some{{Like whom?|date=October 2019}} have claimed [[Donald Trump]] would not have won if Facebook had not helped spread what they claim to have been fake stories that were biased in his favor.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/11/17/495827410/from-hate-speech-to-fake-news-the-content-crisis-facing-mark-zuckerberg |title=From Hate Speech To Fake News: The Content Crisis Facing Mark Zuckerberg |last=Shahani |first=Aarti |website=NPR |date=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Mark Zuckerberg has begun to take steps to eliminate the prevalence of fake news on Facebook as a result criticisms of Facebook's influence on the presidential election.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/2016/11/19/technology/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-fake-news-election/|title=Zuckerberg: Facebook will develop tools to fight fake news|last=Burke|first=Samuel|date=November 19, 2016|website=CNN Money|access-date=November 22, 2016}}</ref> At a conference called ''Techonomy'' Mark Zuckerberg stated in regards to Donald Trump, \"There's a profound lack of empathy in asserting that the only reason why someone could have voted the way that they did is because they saw some fake news\".

According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that for an initial fee of $1,000, entitles Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as additional 1% interest per each day after January 1, 2004, until website completion.

Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt issued a statement indicating that the counsel for Ceglia had unsuccessfully attempted to seek an out-of-court settlement.

At the time, Zuckerberg worked for Ceglia as a code developer on a project named \"StreetFax\".

By omitting this line, Facebook license extends to adopt users' content perpetually and irrevocably years after the content has been deleted.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nMany users of Facebook voiced opinions against the changes to the Facebook Terms of Use, leading to an Internet-wide debate over the ownership of content. [[Electronic Privacy Information Center|The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC)]] prepared a formal complaint with the [[Federal Trade Commission]]. Many individuals were frustrated with the removal of the controversial clause. Facebook users, numbering more than 38,000, joined a user group against the changes, and a number of blogs and news sites have written about this issue.<ref name=\"PC World\" />\n\nAfter the change was brought to light in Walters's blog entry, in his blog on February 16, 2009, Zuckerberg addressed the issues concerning the recently made changes to Facebook's terms of use.

However, on February 17, 2009, Zuckerberg wrote in his blog, that although Facebook reverted to its original terms of use, it is in the process of developing new terms in order to address the paradox. Zuckerberg stated that these new terms will allow Facebook users to \"share and control their information, and it will be written clearly in language everyone can understand.\" Zuckerberg invited users to join a group entitled \"Facebook Bill of Rights and Responsibilities\" to give their input and help shape the new terms.\n\nOn February 26, 2009, Zuckerberg posted a blog, updating users on the progress of the new Terms of Use. He wrote, \"We decided we needed to do things differently and so we're going to develop new policies that will govern our system from the ground up in an open and transparent way.\" Zuckerberg introduces the two new additions to Facebook: the Facebook Principles<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=54964476066 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Facebook Principles |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043045/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=54964476066 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> and the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=67758697570 |publisher=Facebook |title=Facebook Town Hall: Proposed Statement of Rights and Responsibilities |accessdate=March 5, 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227043055/http://www.facebook.com//group.php?gid=67758697570 |archivedate=February 27, 2009 }}</ref> Both additions allow users to vote on changes to the terms of use before they are officially released.

Users are not supposed to have the ability to post material to the Facebook Walls of other users unless they are approved friends of those users that they have posted material to. To prove that he was telling the truth, Shreateh posted material to Sarah Goodin's wall, a friend of Facebook CEO [[Mark Zuckerberg]]. Following this, Shreateh contacted Facebook's security team with the proof that his bug was real, explaining in detail what was going on. Facebook has a bounty program in which it compensates people a $500+ fee for reporting bugs instead of using them to their advantage or selling them on the black market. However, it was reported that instead of fixing the bug and paying Shreateh the fee, Facebook originally told him that \"this was not a bug\" and dismissed him. Shreateh then tried a second time to inform Facebook, but they dismissed him yet again. On the third try, Shreateh used the bug to post a message to Mark Zuckerberg's Wall, stating \"Sorry for breaking your privacy&nbsp;... but a couple of days ago, I found a serious Facebook exploit\" and that Facebook's security team was not taking him seriously. Within minutes, a security engineer contacted Shreateh, questioned him on how he performed the move and ultimately acknowledged that it was a bug in the system. Facebook temporarily suspended Shreateh's account and fixed the bug after several days. However, in a move that was met with much public criticism and disapproval, Facebook refused to pay out the 500+ fee to Shreateh; instead, Facebook responded that by posting to Zuckerberg's account, Shreateh had violated one of their [[terms of service]] policies and therefore \"could not be paid.\" Included with this, the Facebook team strongly censured Shreateh over his manner of resolving the matter. In closing, they asked that Shreateh continue to help them find bugs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bort |first=Julie |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/researcher-facebook-ignored-bug-found-143418388.html |title=Researcher: Facebook Ignored the Bug I Found Until I Used It to Hack Zuckerberg - Yahoo!

Maiffret said: \"He is sitting there in Palestine doing this research on a five-year-old laptop that looks like it is half broken. It's something that might help him out in a big way.\" Facebook representatives have since responded, \"We will not change our practice of refusing to pay rewards to researchers who have tested vulnerabilities against real users.\" Facebook representatives also claimed they'd paid out over $1&nbsp;million to individuals who have discovered bugs in the past.<ref>{{cite web|agency=Reuters |url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hacker-exposed-facebook-bug-reward-210333258.html |title=Hacker who exposed Facebook bug to get reward from unexpected source - Yahoo!

Within three days, the video had gone viral with more than a million views (it has reached 2,521,614 views as of June 10, 2014). In the video, Muller illustrates how after paying US$50 to Facebook advertising, the \"likes\" to his fan page have tripled in a few days and soon reached 70,000 \"likes\", compared to his original 2,115 likes before the advertising. Despite the significant increase in likes, Muller noticed his page has actually decreased in engagement \u2013 there were fewer people commenting, sharing, and liking his posts and updates despite the significant increase in \"likes\".

In 2016, [[ProPublica]] found that advertisers could target or exclude users from advertising based on an  \"Ethnic Affinity\"\u2014a demographic trait which is determined based on a user's interests and behaviors on Facebook, and not explicitly provided by the user.

Advertisers who attempt to create ads for housing, employment, or credit (HEC) opportunities would be blocked from using ethnic affinities (renamed \"multicultural affinities\" and now classified as behaviors) to target the ad. If an advertiser uses any other audience segment to target ads for HEC, they would be informed of the policies, and be required to affirm their compliance with relevant laws and policies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2017/02/improving-enforcement-and-promoting-diversity-updates-to-ads-policies-and-tools/|title=Improving Enforcement and Promoting Diversity: Updates to Ads Policies and Tools|publisher=Facebook|language=en|access-date=2019-03-29}}</ref>\n\nHowever, in November 2017, ProPublica found that automated enforcement of these new policies was inconsistent.

Produced by [[Hal B. Wallis]], the film stars [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carolyn Jones]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. It is based on the 1952 novel ''[[A Stone for Danny Fisher]]'' by [[Harold Robbins]], about a nineteen-year-old who gets mixed up with crooks and involved with two women.\n\nPresley later indicated that of all the characters he portrayed throughout his acting career, the role of Danny Fisher in ''King Creole'' was his favorite. To make the film, Presley was granted a 60-day deferment from January to March 1958 for beginning his military service. Location shooting in [[New Orleans]] was delayed several times by crowds of fans attracted by the stars, particularly Presley.\n\nThe film was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on July 2, 1958, to both critical and commercial success. The critics were unanimous in their praise of Presley's performance. ''King Creole'' peaked at number five on the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' box office earnings charts.\n\nThe soundtrack song \"[[Hard Headed Woman]]\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' pop singles chart, number two on the [[R&B chart]], and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]], while the soundtrack album peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' album chart.\n\n==Plot==\nNineteen-year-old high school student Danny Fisher (Elvis) works before and after school to support his surviving family: his father ([[Dean Jagger]]) and sister Mimi (Jan Shepard). After Danny's mother died, his grieving father lost his job as a pharmacist, and moved his impoverished family to the [[French Quarter]] in New Orleans.\n\n[[File:King Creole 1958 (Elvis Presley and Carolyn Jones).JPG|thumb|left|Danny protects Ronnie from one of Maxie Field's customers]]\nAt work one morning, Danny rescues Ronnie (Jones) from her abusive date. After a taxi ride to Danny's high school, Ronnie kisses him. Danny responds to witnessing schoolmates' teasing by kissing Ronnie back and then punching one of them in the face when he makes a teasing remark. Danny is summoned, where Miss Pearson (Helene Hatch), his teacher, tells Principal Evans ([[Raymond Bailey]]) that Danny will not graduate because of his poor attitude. Mr. Evans is sympathetic, but powerless to help, so Danny decides to drop out of school to find work, against the wishes of his father, who tries to convince Danny to stay in school.\n\nWhen Danny leaves the school grounds, three young men lure him into an alley. Their leader, Shark ([[Vic Morrow]]), wants revenge for Danny hitting the teasing student at school, who turned out to be his brother. Danny defends himself so well that it impresses Shark, so Shark invites Danny to join his gang. Shark then has Danny to help the gang shoplift at a [[five-and-dime]] by singing \"[[Lover Doll]]\" to distract the customers and staff.\n\n[[File:King Creole 1958 (Elvis Presley and Dolores Hart).JPG|thumb|right|Nellie confesses to Danny that she is willing to see him again]]\nOnly Nellie ([[Dolores Hart]]), who works the snack bar, notices Danny's complicity in the theft, but she does not turn him in.\n\nLater that night, Danny meets Ronnie again at The Blue Shade nightclub, where Danny is now employed. At first, she pretends not to know him, as she is accompanied by her boyfriend and the club's owner, Maxie Fields, aka \"The Pig\" (Matthau). When Maxie does not believe her, she claims she heard Danny sing once. Maxie insists that Danny prove he can sing. His rendition of \"[[Trouble (Elvis Presley song)|Trouble]]\" impresses Charlie LeGrand ([[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]]), the honest owner of the King Creole nightclub, the only nightspot in the area not owned by Maxie.  Impressed, LeGrand offers Danny a job as a singer at his club.\n\nAfter leaving the club Danny meets up with the Shark gang for his share of the nightly take. He then makes his way to the five and dime at closing time to see Nellie. Danny invites Nellie to a fictitious party in a hotel room.  Finding nobody else there, Nellie starts crying in fear and leaves after admitting that she still wants to see Danny again, but not under those conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Fisher finds employment as a pharmacist in a local drug store, but his boss, Mr. Primont ([[Gavin Gordon (actor)|Gavin Gordon]])\u2014who reluctantly hired Mr. Fisher after his boss made him do so\u2014constantly demeans Mr. Fisher out of retaliation, much to Danny's embarrassment. That situation makes it easier for Danny to go against his father's wishes and accept Charlie's job offer. When Danny becomes a hit at the King Creole, Maxie tries to hire him. Danny declines his offer out of loyalty to Charlie.\n\nShark, now working for Maxie, suggests to Danny they beat up Primont to help his father. One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery, so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about his involvement in the mugging, and then does it anyway. Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.\n\nMaxie sends his henchmen after Danny. Shark and another gang member trap him in an alley. Danny knocks out one of his pursuers. Then Shark stabs Danny, but kills himself in the struggle. Ronnie finds a profusely bleeding Danny and takes him to her house on a bayou to recover. She asks him to forget her sordid past and pretend to love her. Danny replies that it would not be difficult and kisses her. Maxie drives up, accompanied by Dummy (Jack Grinnage), a member of Danny's former gang. Maxie fatally shoots Ronnie. Dummy, who had been befriended by Danny, grapples with Maxie.  The gun goes off, killing its owner.\n\nDanny returns to the King Creole. He sings the lines \"Let's think of the future, forget the past, you're not my first love, but you're my last\" to Nellie in the audience. Mr Fisher also shows up to listen to his son sing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Elvis Presley]] as Danny Fisher\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Ronnie, Maxie's mistress\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Maxie Fields, the local gangster\n* [[Dolores Hart]] as Nellie, a five-and-dime employee who falls for Danny\n* [[Dean Jagger]] as Mr. Fisher, Danny's father\n* [[Liliane Montevecchi]] as Forty Nina, a stripper at the King Creole nightclub\n* [[Vic Morrow]] as Shark, Maxie's lead thug\n* [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] as Charlie LeGrand, owner of the King Creole\n* [[Jan Shepard]] as Mimi Fisher,<ref name=\"Reid\">{{citation | last = Reid | first = John Howard | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc6imzGc41IC&lpg=PP1&dq=More%20Movie%20Musicals&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = More Movie Musicals | page = 95}}</ref> Danny's sister\n* [[Brian G.

Wallis had rented a house for Presley's privacy, and a second one after one of his assistants noticed that the back of the houses in the block led to the back of the houses on the adjacent street. To escape from the crowds, Presley would climb to the roof of one house and cross over onto the roof of the other.<ref>Doll, Susan (1994); pp.61, 62</ref><ref>Wallis, Hal B; Higham, Charles; p.150</ref>  After a fan discovered his path, he resided on the tenth floor of the [[Beverly Wilshire Hotel]], which was rented for the whole cast.<ref name=\"Day by Day-116\" />\n\nBefore filming began, Curtiz was convinced that Presley would be a \"conceited boy\", but after a few weeks of working together, he described Presley as a \"lovely boy\" who would go on to be a \"wonderful actor\".<ref name=gural450/> Presley, after seeing an early copy of the finished film, thanked Curtiz for giving him the opportunity to show his potential as an actor; he would later cite Danny Fisher as his favorite role of his acting career.

And there it stays, until a limp melodramatic home stretch, even with eight or so of those twitching, gyrating musical interludes. ... These also perfectly typify the Bourbon Street honky-tonks that Mr. Curtiz and his fine photographer, Russ Harlan, have beguilingly drenched with atmosphere. Matching, or balancing, the tunes are at least seven characterizations that supply the real backbone and tell the story of the picture. ... for Mr. Presley, in his third screen attempt, it's a pleasure to find him up to a little more than Bourbon Street shoutin' and wigglin'.

They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing how to get out of it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at.<ref>''The Spectator''; p.307</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbout Presley's performance, ''[[Down Beat]]'' wrote: \"Let it be noted that Elvis Presley's latest, King Creole, is his best picture thus far--comparatively speaking, of course. Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis might begin to get an inkling of what acting's all about.\"<ref>''Down Beat'', p.44</ref> ''[[Macfadden Publications|TV-Radio Mirror]]'' magazine praised Presley's acting over his past roles: \"Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far.

Produced by [[Hal B. Wallis]], the film stars [[Elvis Presley]], [[Carolyn Jones]] and [[Walter Matthau]]. It is based on the 1952 novel ''[[A Stone for Danny Fisher]]'' by [[Harold Robbins]], about a nineteen-year-old who gets mixed up with crooks and involved with two women.\n\nPresley later indicated that of all the characters he portrayed throughout his acting career, the role of Danny Fisher in ''King Creole'' was his favorite. To make the film, Presley was granted a 60-day deferment from January to March 1958 for beginning his military service. Location shooting in [[New Orleans]] was delayed several times by crowds of fans attracted by the stars, particularly Presley.\n\nThe film was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] on July 2, 1958, to both critical and commercial success. The critics were unanimous in their praise of Presley's performance. ''King Creole'' peaked at number five on the ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' box office earnings charts.\n\nThe soundtrack song \"[[Hard Headed Woman]]\" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' pop singles chart, number two on the [[R&B chart]], and was certified gold by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]], while the soundtrack album peaked at number two on the ''Billboard'' album chart.\n\n==Plot==\nNineteen-year-old high school student Danny Fisher (Elvis) works before and after school to support his surviving family: his father ([[Dean Jagger]]) and sister Mimi (Jan Shepard). After Danny's mother died, his grieving father lost his job as a pharmacist, and moved his impoverished family to the [[French Quarter]] in New Orleans.\n\n[[File:King Creole 1958 (Elvis Presley and Carolyn Jones).JPG|thumb|left|Danny protects Ronnie from one of Maxie Field's customers]]\nAt work one morning, Danny rescues Ronnie (Jones) from her abusive date. After a taxi ride to Danny's high school, Ronnie kisses him. Danny responds to witnessing schoolmates' teasing by kissing Ronnie back and then punching one of them in the face when he makes a teasing remark. Danny is summoned, where Miss Pearson (Helene Hatch), his teacher, tells Principal Evans ([[Raymond Bailey]]) that Danny will not graduate because of his poor attitude. Mr. Evans is sympathetic, but powerless to help, so Danny decides to drop out of school to find work, against the wishes of his father, who tries to convince Danny to stay in school.\n\nWhen Danny leaves the school grounds, three young men lure him into an alley. Their leader, Shark ([[Vic Morrow]]), wants revenge for Danny hitting the teasing student at school, who turned out to be his brother. Danny defends himself so well that it impresses Shark, so Shark invites Danny to join his gang. Shark then has Danny to help the gang shoplift at a [[five-and-dime]] by singing \"[[Lover Doll]]\" to distract the customers and staff.\n\n[[File:King Creole 1958 (Elvis Presley and Dolores Hart).JPG|thumb|right|Nellie confesses to Danny that she is willing to see him again]]\nOnly Nellie ([[Dolores Hart]]), who works the snack bar, notices Danny's complicity in the theft, but she does not turn him in.\n\nLater that night, Danny meets Ronnie again at The Blue Shade nightclub, where Danny is now employed. At first, she pretends not to know him, as she is accompanied by her boyfriend and the club's owner, Maxie Fields, aka \"The Pig\" (Matthau). When Maxie does not believe her, she claims she heard Danny sing once. Maxie insists that Danny prove he can sing. His rendition of \"[[Trouble (Elvis Presley song)|Trouble]]\" impresses Charlie LeGrand ([[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]]), the honest owner of the King Creole nightclub, the only nightspot in the area not owned by Maxie.  Impressed, LeGrand offers Danny a job as a singer at his club.\n\nAfter leaving the club Danny meets up with the Shark gang for his share of the nightly take. He then makes his way to the five and dime at closing time to see Nellie. Danny invites Nellie to a fictitious party in a hotel room.  Finding nobody else there, Nellie starts crying in fear and leaves after admitting that she still wants to see Danny again, but not under those conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Fisher finds employment as a pharmacist in a local drug store, but his boss, Mr. Primont ([[Gavin Gordon (actor)|Gavin Gordon]])\u2014who reluctantly hired Mr. Fisher after his boss made him do so\u2014constantly demeans Mr. Fisher out of retaliation, much to Danny's embarrassment. That situation makes it easier for Danny to go against his father's wishes and accept Charlie's job offer. When Danny becomes a hit at the King Creole, Maxie tries to hire him. Danny declines his offer out of loyalty to Charlie.\n\nShark, now working for Maxie, suggests to Danny they beat up Primont to help his father. One night when Mr. Fisher leaves the store dressed in Primont's hat and coat (lent due to a rainstorm), Shark recognizes him, but decides to mug him anyway, as that would be even better for Maxie's purposes. Danny's father is so badly injured that he needs expensive surgery, so Maxie pays for a specialist to perform it. Maxie later blackmails Danny into signing with him by threatening to tell his father about his involvement in the mugging, and then does it anyway. Outraged, Danny pummels Maxie for the betrayal and helps Ronnie escape him.\n\nMaxie sends his henchmen after Danny. Shark and another gang member trap him in an alley. Danny knocks out one of his pursuers. Then Shark stabs Danny, but kills himself in the struggle. Ronnie finds a profusely bleeding Danny and takes him to her house on a bayou to recover. She asks him to forget her sordid past and pretend to love her. Danny replies that it would not be difficult and kisses her. Maxie drives up, accompanied by Dummy (Jack Grinnage), a member of Danny's former gang. Maxie fatally shoots Ronnie. Dummy, who had been befriended by Danny, grapples with Maxie.  The gun goes off, killing its owner.\n\nDanny returns to the King Creole. He sings the lines \"Let's think of the future, forget the past, you're not my first love, but you're my last\" to Nellie in the audience. Mr Fisher also shows up to listen to his son sing.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Elvis Presley]] as Danny Fisher\n* [[Carolyn Jones]] as Ronnie, Maxie's mistress\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Maxie Fields, the local gangster\n* [[Dolores Hart]] as Nellie, a five-and-dime employee who falls for Danny\n* [[Dean Jagger]] as Mr. Fisher, Danny's father\n* [[Liliane Montevecchi]] as Forty Nina, a stripper at the King Creole nightclub\n* [[Vic Morrow]] as Shark, Maxie's lead thug\n* [[Paul Stewart (actor)|Paul Stewart]] as Charlie LeGrand, owner of the King Creole\n* [[Jan Shepard]] as Mimi Fisher,<ref name=\"Reid\">{{citation | last = Reid | first = John Howard | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vc6imzGc41IC&lpg=PP1&dq=More%20Movie%20Musicals&pg=PA95#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = More Movie Musicals | page = 95}}</ref> Danny's sister\n* [[Brian G.

Acting is his assignment in this shrewdly upholstered showcase, and he does it, so help us over a picket fence.<ref>{{cite news| title= Actor With Guitar|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9D05E0D91E31E73BBC4C53DFB1668383649EDE|author=Howard Thompson | date=July 4, 1958|work=The New York Times| accessdate= June 20, 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[The Spectator]]'', however, criticized the relationship of Presley's character with his love interests: \n\n<blockquote>The girls in his (Michael Curtiz's) latest film, King Creole, are both played by good, serious actresses: Carolyn Jones .. and Dolores Hart, ... both are shown to be hungrily, desperately, unpridefully in love with him (Presley's character). They have no existence, except in him; do nothing but wait for him; hope for nothing but a little rough affection ... Instead of being kissed, they beg for kisses, which Mr. Presley sulkily and reluctantly hands out now and then, with the air of a small, fastidious boy being press to eat marshmallow and, though he feels a bit sick not quite knowing how to get out of it ... (it) really seems to suggest this is a god come down among us for a spell; and when tender and infinitely patient in spite of the long past of infidelity, nonchalance, and what looks to an observer like plain indifference from him, her lips poised for the kiss that doesn't come ... As the most extreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and, though you may be put off at first by his pale, puffy, bruised looking babyish face, by the weary cherubic decadence you might imagine in Nero, and the excessive greasiness of his excessively long, spiky locks, his films, however bad (and King Creole is pretty low on his list), are well worth taking a look at.<ref>''The Spectator''; p.307</ref></blockquote>\n\nAbout Presley's performance, ''[[Down Beat]]'' wrote: \"Let it be noted that Elvis Presley's latest, King Creole, is his best picture thus far--comparatively speaking, of course. Maybe about 10 more films (and as many drama coaches) from now Elvis might begin to get an inkling of what acting's all about.\"<ref>''Down Beat'', p.44</ref> ''[[Macfadden Publications|TV-Radio Mirror]]'' magazine praised Presley's acting over his past roles: \"Elvis Presley does his strongest acting job so far. Two years ago, Presley on the screen was a laughing stock.  But nobody is laughing now\".<ref>{{citation | last = Kirchberg | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RdhpXMEZbcQC&lpg=PA59&dq=king%20creole&pg=PA59#v=onepage&q&f=false | title = Elvis Presley, Richard Nixon, and the American dream | page = 59}}</ref> Meanwhile, The ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' criticized the violence depicted in the film and rated the movie a III, denoting poor, stating, \"This entangled series of cliches, each with more unlikely motivation than the last, provides the most unattractive Presley vehicle so far. His numbers only offer intermittent relief from the calculated violence and viciousness, and he can do little to balance the disagreeable movie\".<ref>{{citation | last = Caine | first = Andrew James | title = Interpreting Rock Movies | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=S1FVg61QpxEC&lpg=PP1&dq=Interpreting%20rock%20movies%3A%20the%20pop%20film%20and%20its%20critics%20in%20Britain&pg=PA65#v=onepage&q&f=false | page = 65}}</ref>\n\n''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' lamented the lack of punishment to the main character for his actions, but praised the director for his influence on Presley: \n\n<blockquote>No doubt adults won't be moved much by \"King Creole\" one way or the other, but unfortunately teenage audiences may be taken in, especially since Danny is supposed to be a sympathetic character and at the end goes unpunished by the police for his crimes ... It must be said in favor of Director Michael Curtiz that he does succeed in getting Presley to act every now and then, but the cards are stacked in such an obvious manner against Danny that even Montgomery Clift couldn't have handled the role with conviction.<ref>''Commonweal''; p.424</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[Catholic World]]'' commented: \n\n<blockquote>Playing a part\u2014 an underprivileged youth who, on and off, displays some dignity and honest aspirations \u2014 that requires some histrionic effort, Presley shows signs that he is getting the hang of acting. The picture itself, however, after a promising enough beginning turns into a lurid melodramatic hash composed in about equal part of juvenile delinquency, gangsterism and sex. These may be legitimate dramatic subjects but the script gives them an illegitimate viewpoint and leaves muddled moral issues dangling.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Catholic World|page=384|title=Movie Reviews|publisher=Paulist Fathers|year=1958|volume=187}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n''[[TimesDaily|The Florence Times]]'' wrote of Presley: \n\n<blockquote>the fellow isn't a bad actor. Of course, he's nothing at all sensational and the Academy Award isn't in danger, but there are Hollywood habitues who've gotten by for years with less ability. In fact, given the normal amount of the more painstaking type of direction, it is entirely possible that Mr. Wiggle-hips could develop into a really competent actor. As long, however, as he can continue to attract audiences in present proportions there's little need in worrying with drama schools.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dxYsAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ecgEAAAAIBAJ&dq=king-creole&pg=767%2C4748525|title='King Creole' has Elvis, little Else ...
