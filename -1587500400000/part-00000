The best known mouse species is the common [[house mouse]] (''Mus musculus''). It is also a popular [[pet]]. In some places, certain kinds of [[Apodemus|field mice]] are locally common. They are known to invade homes for food and shelter.\n\nSpecies of mice are mostly classified in Rodentia, and are present throughout the order.  Typical mice are classified in the genus [[Mus (genus)|Mus]].\n\nMice are typically distinguished from [[rat|rats]] by their size. Generally, when someone discovers a smaller [[muroid]] rodent, its [[common name]] includes the term ''mouse'', while if it is larger, the name includes the term ''rat''. Common terms ''rat'' and ''mouse'' are not [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomically]] specific. Scientifically, the term ''mouse'' is not confined to members of ''Mus'' for example, but also applies to species from other genera such as the [[deer mouse|deer mouse, ''Peromyscus'']].\n\n[[Fancy mouse|Domestic mice]] sold as pets often differ substantially in size from the common house mouse. This is attributable both to breeding and to different conditions in the wild. The best-known strain, the white [[Laboratory mouse|lab mouse]], has more uniform traits that are appropriate to its use in research.\n\n[[Cat]]s, wild [[dog]]s, [[fox]]es, [[bird of prey|birds of prey]], [[snake]]s and even certain kinds of [[arthropod]]s have been known to prey heavily upon mice. Nevertheless, because of its remarkable adaptability to almost any [[ecological niche|environment]], the mouse is one of the most successful [[mammalian]] genera living on Earth today.\n\nMice, in certain contexts, can be considered [[vermin]] which are a major source of [[crops|crop]] damage,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Leirs H |title=The Year of the Rat ends: time to fight hunger!|journal=Pest Manag Sci |volume=65 |issue=4 |year=2009 |doi=10.1002/ps.1718 |pmid=19206089 |pages=351\u20132}}</ref> causing structural damage and spreading [[disease]]s through their [[Parasitism|parasites]] and [[feces]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Meerburg BG, Singleton GR, Kijlstra A |title=Rodent-borne diseases and their risks for public health|journal=Crit Rev Microbiol|volume=35 |issue=3|year=2009|doi=10.1080/10408410902989837|pmid=19548807 |pages=221\u201370}}</ref> In North America, breathing dust that has come in contact with mouse excrement has been linked to [[hantavirus]], which may lead to [[hantavirus pulmonary syndrome]] (HPS).\n\nPrimarily [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]]<ref name=\"noc1\">{{cite journal|jstor=1374418|title=Nocturnal Explorations of the Forest Deer-Mouse|first=W.

It housed some high-ranking British and Commonwealth officers, including Major-General Sir [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]], who was employed by the Italian government in the [[Italian Armistice|Armistice]] negotiations with the Allies in 1943.\n\n== Original castle ==\nThe 13th-century castle located on a hill north of Florence close to Fiesole is medieval in origin. It was once the ancient stronghold of the Visdomini family, important Florentine nobility since the 11th century.<ref>Scott, p.7.</ref> They enjoyed special privileges from the Florentine bishops. A son of the family [[John Gualbert]], a Benedictine monk, was canonized in 1193 by [[Pope Celestine III]]. The property then passed to the Usimbardi family, (which introduced glass production to Florence) followed by the Ceffini of [[Figline Valdarno|Figline]].\n\nThey soon sold it to the Buonaccorsi banking family. In the general crash of Florentine banks in 1345 (bad debts by King [[Edward III of England]] for his [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)]] campaigns) it was purchased by Niccolo, son of Ugo degli [[Albizi]], a wealthy mercantile family.<ref>Scott, p.18.</ref> A branch of this family, for reasons of political expediency renamed Alessandri, occupied the castle for some three hundred years.\n\nAfter the fall of the Republic, the Alessandri family still kept up their palace in the city, but the castle was allowed to drift into decay, till by the year 1637 only the Lord Francesco lived there with a 10-year-old son, Giovani Antonio, and a maiden aunt of 70. The ruins and land were sold in 1827 to Lorenzo di Bartolommeo Galli da Rovezzano <ref>Scott, p.28.</ref> They became a source of interest to writers and artists during the romantic era, as evidenced by an Emilio Burci sketch dated 1836.\n\n[[File:Cartolina di vincigliata, 1901.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of Vincigliata Castle in 1901]]\n\n==  John Temple-Leader ==\n[[John Temple-Leader]] , as a young [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politician, suddenly abandoned a  parliamentary career for the continent. In the early 1840s after several years in [[Cannes]], he moved to [[Florence]], taking a house in the Piazza Pitti. He became a friend of Georgio Barbera, a Florentine publisher and supporter of the unification of Italy. Later he purchased Fiesole's Villa di Maiano and joined Tuscany's sizeable English expatriate community. Whilst exploring the hills of Fiesole, the Englishman came upon the overgrown ruin of Castello di Vincigliata. He fell in love with it and decided to restore it to its former glory.\n\nOver 15 years, the castle was reconstructed in the neo-Gothic style from the ground up. With the help of a young architect, Giuseppe Fancelli,<ref>Scott, p.31.</ref> it became a romantic vision of a feudal fortress. He also bought the surrounding land, more than seven hundred acres in the space of fifty years, began the delicate task of reclaiming it and restoring the houses and villas. He created the Bosco di Vincigliata, planting cypresses in the rocky areas where nothing else would grow, with pines and all the various shrubs and bushes one finds in a typical central Italian woodland; in short, an English romantic garden on a huge scale. People flocked from afar to visit his castle and admire the grounds, and he was extremely pleased when The [[Illustrated London News]] printed an engraving of [[Queen Victoria]] doing a watercolour of the Giardino delle Colonne, a pretty pool fed by the Mensola creek, during her visit in 1893.\n\n[[Henry James]] wrote of the castle: \"This elaborate piece of imitation has no superficial use; but, even if it were less complete, less successful, less brilliant, I should feel a reflective kindness for it. So handsome a piece of work is its own justification; it belongs to the heroics of culture.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Henry |last=James |authorlink=Henry James |url=https://archive.org/stream/transatlanticske00jameuoft#page/n290 |title=Transatlantic sketches |location=Boston |publisher=James R. Osgood |year=1875 |pages=287\u2013288}}</ref>\n\nThe gate of the castello is flanked by two stone lions and leads into an Italian garden with a fountain and a sunken cloister. Originally there were many Gaetano Bianchi (1819\u20131892) frescoes of scenes from the lives of the various families that owned Vincigliata, but only one has survived, Ugolino de'Visdomini invoking the Virgin before marching against the Sienese. In 1889 he published the definitive record on Sir [[John Hawkwood]], an English mercenary (or ''[[condottiero]]'') active in 14th-century Italy. Sir John married late in life and died in Florence in 1903, without heirs. He left all his properties, including the Castello di Vincigliata to his great nephew Richard Luttrell Pilkington Bethell, 3rd [[Baron Westbury]], who sold it off piecemeal, and his art collection was scattered.\n\n== POW camp ==\nThe castle was requisitioned by the Italian government during [[World War II]] and was designated P.G. 12 Vincigliata, as a prisoner-of-war camp for distinguished military prisoners. It was a much smaller camp than the others, with no more than around twenty-five prisoners at any one time. The officers were separated from the non-commissioned officers and the only link between them was via the officers' [[Batman (military)|batmen]] or servants who attended them. During the ebb and flow of the [[North African Campaign]] 1941/2, a number of high-ranking British officers were captured.\n\nOn arrival in Italy, most British POWs passed through the Italian transit camp at [[Capua]] and then moved to more permanent camps. In early 1942, the Italian army began to reorganise their POW camp system and commenced to number and classify them. The large camp at [[Sulmona#Campo 78|Sulmona]], holding as many as 3,000 prisoners, in the [[Abruzzo]] outside Rome, became known as ''Campo concentramento di prigionieri di guerra 78'', abbreviated to P.G. 78, which held a large number of British and Commonwealth officers and other ranks.\n\nA small number of these senior officers and NCOs secured in the Villa Orsini were sent further north to P.G. 12 Vincigliata. They included Air-Marshal Owen Boyd, Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor, Lieutenant-General Philip Neame, and Major-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, who wrote, \"We learned that Vincigliati (sic) had belonged to an Englishman, a man called Temple-Leader. We considered he had restored the castello in the most thoughtless fashion, giving all his attention to what went on above ground, and regardless of the many underground passages that he had sealed up. He made things very difficult for us.\"<ref name=\"Wiart192\">Carton de Wiart, p.192.</ref> The castle also included New Zealander Brigadiers Reginald Miles and James Hargest who reflected in his book, \"One thing the late Temple-Leader had certainly done: he had erected a structure ideal for the purpose it was now put to\u2014a prison.\"<ref name=\"Hargest74\">Hargest, p.74.</ref>\n\n===Known prisoners, September 1941 \u2013 September 1943===\n\n====British and Commonwealth officers====\n\n;Brigadier Bertram Frank Armstrong DSO (1893\u20131972)\n\nArmstrong, a South African, was the commanding officer of the 5th South African Infantry Brigade, which formed part of the South African 1st Infantry Division, formed August 1940. It served in East Africa and the Western Desert. He was captured at Sidi Rezeg in North Africa on 23 or 24 November 1941. He had the nickname \"Oubaas\" [and] \"...was a jolly soul, who seemed quite undisturbed by prison life in Vincigliata.\"<ref name=\"Leeming111\">Leeming, p.111.</ref> He received the DSO in 1942, and escaped during the Italian Armistice in September 1943\u2014initially with other officers, including Dan Ranfurly, walking over the Apennines and down into Romagna, guided by a Benedictine monk Don Leone. \"It was a terrible climb for Brigadier Armstrong who had a game leg. There was not enough food in the village, so we dispersed in small parties over a district of ten miles.\"<ref name=\"Ranfurly237\"/> He became a major-general, and chief of the general staff, [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|South African Union Defence Force]], before retiring in 1953.\n\n;Air Marshal [[Owen Tudor Boyd]] CB, OBE, MC, AFC (1889\u20131944)\n\nBoyd was on his way to Egypt, in November 1940 as the new deputy commander of the British Air Forces in the Middle East. En route for [[Malta]], the [[Wellington bomber]] in which he and his staff were passengers was forced down over enemy-controlled [[Sicily]] by a group of Italian fighters. After destroying his confidential papers by setting his own aircraft on fire, Boyd became a prisoner of war. He and his ADC Flight-Lieutenant Leeming, were sent to the Villa Orsini close to Sulmona PG 78, POW camp, joined later by Neame, O'Connor, Combe, Gambier-Parry, Todhunter and Younghusband, before being sent to Vincigliata some six months later.\n\nHe was involved with a number of escape plans. He was an expert carpenter,<ref name=\"Wiart194\">Carton de Wiart, p.194.</ref> contributing to the tunnel work, and in March 1943 escaping with five other officers. After making it to Milan boarded a train for [[Como]] only to be arrested at the Swiss frontier. He escaped again during the Italian Armistice in September 1943, after time in the Italian countryside he successfully reached the Allied lines with Neame and O'Connor. He returned to England but in August 1944 he died of a heart attack.\n\n;Major-General Sir [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]] VC, KBE, CB, CMG, DSO (1880\u20131963)\n\nDe Wiart came from a well-connected continental family and was appointed by Churchill as head of a military mission en route to Yugoslavia. He was captured when his [[Wellington bomber|Wellington aircraft]] from [[Malta]] crash-landed in the sea off the coast of North Africa in April 1941. He had won a VC in [[World War I]], on the Somme, being wounded eight times and losing a hand and eye. He was the alleged model for the flamboyant Brigadier Ritchie-Hook in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''Sword of Honour'' trilogy. He was sent to the villa Orsini (referred to as Medici in his book) close to Sulmona P.G. 78. Later, with other officers, he was sent to Vincigliata, where he made many escape attempts including through a successful tunnel with five others in March 1943.\n\nHe managed to evade capture for eight days disguised as an Italian peasant, no mean feat considering that he did not speak Italian, and was 61 years old, with an eye patch, and one empty sleeve. He was captured and returned to Vincigliata for the obligatory 30-day solitary confinement.<ref name=\"Neame309\">Neame, p.309.</ref> In August 1943 he was selected by the Italian authorities to accompany an Italian negotiator, General Zanussi, to Rome then Lisbon to meet Allied contacts to facilitate the surrender. When they reached [[Lisbon]], Carton de Wiart was released and made his way to England, by plane the same month. Within a month of his arrival, Churchill informed him that he was to be sent to China as his personal representative to Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. He left by air for India in October 1943. In November 1944 he was promoted to lieutenant-general. At the war's end he retired to Ireland, and married for the second time.\n\n;Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Frederick Boyce Combe]], CB, DSO & Bar (1895-1967)\n\nCombe was a British Army officer before and during World War II. He was commanding officer of the [[11th Hussars]] for the initial stages of the Western Desert Campaign. He was twice awarded the DSO for his service in the Western Desert Campaign before being captured in [[Cyrenaica]] in April 1941, with O'Connor and Neame. In Vincigliata he became one of the gardeners,<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/> as well as keeping sixteen hens, \"and tended them like a mother.\"<ref>Neame, p.76.</ref> He was an enthusiastic escaper, taking turns in tunnelling, and one of the six officers to escape in April 1943. Unfortunately he was caught the next morning at [[Milan]] railway station, whilst studying a timetable.<ref name=\"Neame308\">Neame, p.308.</ref> He escaped again with all remaining officers and men during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. He reached Camaldoli with Neame, O'Connor and other British officers. In [[Romagna]], he joined the Italian partisans led by Libero as [[Riccardo Fedel]] was known.<ref>Lamb, pp.202\u2013207.</ref> He arrived at Allied lines in May 1944, rejoining the Eighth Army.\n\nIn October 1944 he was given command of 2nd Armoured Brigade, until after the German surrender, with the rank of colonel. In 1945, he had brief periods as an acting major-general commanding successively 78th Infantry Division and 46th Infantry Division in Austria. In October 1946 his rank of major-general was made permanent and he was appointed Deputy GOC British Troops Austria. He retired from the army in October 1947, and married the same year. In 1945 he had become Colonel of the Regiment of the 11th Hussars, taking part in the procession behind the coffin at the funeral of [[King George VI]] in 1952. He relinquished the post in 1957.\n\n;Colonel George Hew Fanshawe, CBE (1899\u20131974)\n\nBorn into a military Oxfordshire family, Fanshawe became a career soldier, serving in India where he met and married Mary Holme Wiggin in 1926, at Sialkot, India, they had a son Hew Dalrymple Fanshawe born in 1927. During World War II he was the commanding officer of The [[Queen's Bays]] (2nd Dragoon Guards) part of the Royal Armoured Corps, and was captured in North Africa, and arrived at Vincigliata in 1942. As Neame recorded in his book, \"Colonel G. Fanshawe also joined us at Florence, but Younghusband and Fanshawe were sent away to make room for more senior officers.\"<ref name=\"Neame288\">Neame, p.288.</ref><ref>Carton de Wiart, p.193.</ref> He was transferred to Veano Camp P.G. 29, in [[Piacenza]], Northern Italy.\n\nAfter the war he was gazetted in 1946, lieutenant-colonel (acting brigadier), (13054), The Bays, (seniority, July 1942). He was gazetted a brigadier in December 1948. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the New Years Honours list 1953, and was commander, Royal Armoured Corps, between March 1951 and October 1952, when he retired to Oxfordshire.\n\n;Major-General [[Michael Gambier-Parry|Michael Denman Gambier-Parry]], MC, (1891\u20131976)\n\nThe Gambier-Parrys of [[Highnam Court]], [[Gloucestershire]]; were an artistic and military family \u2013 his uncle [[Ernest Gambier-Parry]]<ref>''The Times'', Obituary, 17 April 1936.</ref> was a major in the army sent to Egypt to avenge the death of General Gordon, and wrote a book (''Suakin'', 1885) about his experiences. Michael joined the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] in 1911. As a captain in World War I, he served in France (awarded the Military Cross) and at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. Promoted temporary lieutenant-colonel, he transferred to the Royal Tank Corps 1924.\n\nIn World War II he was aide-de-camp to the King, then headed the British Military Mission to [[Athens]] in 1940. In 1941, as general officer commanding the 2nd Armoured Division, North Africa, he was captured with Brigadier Vaughan at [[Mechili]] in April 1941. He arrived at Villa Orsini near Sulmona with Neame, O'Connor, Combe and Younghusband, and was sent to Vincigliata the same year. As Carton de Wiart wrote of him \"...&nbsp;he was also a most gifted man, made delightful sketches, was a first class 'forger' \u2013 which could no doubt earn him a steady income in the underworld.\"<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/><ref>Hargest, pp.113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nKnown as 'GP', he was a knowledgeable musician, \"and led the choir in our church services on Sunday.\"<ref name=\"Neame304\"/> \"'GP' was one of the few really unselfish men I have ever known.\"<ref>Leeming, p.96.</ref> In September 1943, he escaped with the other officers and after various adventures arrived in Rome. He initially obtained sanctuary in a secret room within Signora Di Rienzo\u2019s fourth-floor apartment in the Via Ruggero Bonghi. Later he was hidden in a hospital on Via Santo Stefano Rotundo run by the Little Sisters of Mary; all arranged by an Irish priest known as the \u2018Vatican Pimpernel\u2019 <ref> pp.109-112, The Vatican Pimpernel, Brian Fleming, Skyhorse Publishing Inc, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-61608-702-9}} </ref>,\u2018under the noses\u2019 of the Germans until the allies arrived in June 1944. He retired soon after, becoming Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire, and died in 1976.\n\n;The Rt Rev [[George Gerard|George Vincent Gerard]], CBE, MC (1898\u20131984)\n\nDuring World War II Bishop Gerard was the military chaplain to the New Zealand forces and was captured in North Africa. He was for a short time imprisoned in Vincigliata <ref name=\"Neame304\"/> until he was repatriated to Egypt in June 1943. He was educated at Christ's College, Canterbury and Brasenose College, Oxford. After serving with the [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] (Royal East Kent Regiment) in World War I, he was ordained in 1923 and embarked on his ecclesiastical career in New Zealand, becoming the 7th Anglican bishop of [[Diocese of Waiapu|Waiapu]], from 1938 to 1944.\n\n;Brigadier [[James Hargest]] CBE, DSO & 2 bars, MC, ED, MP, (1891\u20131944)\n\nHargest came from a New Zealand farming family. In World War I he served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, commissioned as a second lieutenant. He fought and was wounded in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], and later fought in France, being awarded the Military Cross, the DSO, and the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur. In 1931, he was elected to Parliament as the MP for Invercargill. During World War II, he was able to use his political connections to get an appointment as a brigadier in 1940, and took part in the Battle of Crete, where his incompetence and indecisiveness allowed the German parachutists against the odds to gain a foothold at the Maleme airfield that lost the Battle of Crete for the allies. Nevertheless, he was decorated.  later his brigade took part in the defence of [[Tobruk]], where he was captured in November 1941. It is inexplicable that the Italians didn\u2019t release him to do more damage on his side. He and his servant, Howes, were sent by sea and rail to Italy arriving just before Christmas at the Villa Orsini near Sulmona.<ref name=\"Hargest55\">Hargest, p.55.</ref> He was joined by fellow New Zealander Brigadier Miles. Hargest and other officers were transferred to Vincigliata by train in March 1942.\n\nSeveral escape attempts were made but his successful escape was through the tunnel in March 1943. He and Miles paired up for the escape and managed to travel to Milan by train and onward to Como and finally across the Swiss border.<ref name=\"Neame308\"/> On arriving Hargest wrote \"We raced up the hill into thick forest. Reg cried, 'Jim, we're in Switzerland!' I dived into my case and hauled out the three-ounce bottle of rum. We drank to our freedom.\"<ref>Hargest, p.131.</ref> After travelling alone through France and Spain to Gibraltar he reached England by air in November 1943. As New Zealand's observer he travelled back to France on D-Day 1944. On 12 August he was killed by a shell-burst and is buried in Normandy.\n\n;Flight Lieutenant [[John Fishwick Leeming]] (1895\u20131965)\n\nLeeming was a Lancastrian with a keen interest in aviation. He had built a glider with friends in 1922 and formed the [[Lancashire Aero Club]], becoming its chairman. In 1926 he was the first to land an aeroplane on a mountain (3,117&nbsp;ft up [[Helvellyn]] in the English Lake District). He sold his first published article at 13 and during the 1930s became internationally known for his books. He joined the RAF and was with Air Marshal Boyd as his aide-de-camp when their Wellington bomber was forced down over enemy-controlled Sicily in November 1940. After destroying confidential papers by setting the aircraft on fire, including some \u00a3250,000 in currency (although some was secretly hidden for possible escape),<ref name=\"Neame292\">Neame, p.292.</ref> he and Boyd became prisoners of war. They were sent to the Villa Orsini, close to the Sulmona POW camp near Rome. Six months later they were moved to Vincigliata P.G. 12 near Florence.\n\nAs Lieutenant-General Neame wrote, \"Leeming gave up running the mess in December 1941, after we had been in Florence for three months to devote himself to the plot.\"<ref name=\"Neame288\"/> \"His character interested me. I place him as an extremely shrewd man, very persistent and determined, but pleasant to deal with, with a most kindly nature and a flair for getting on with nearly anyone. But he delighted to appear to others as simple and easily overcome by circumstances, a pose which he developed so successfully that he managed to get himself repatriated as a very bad nervous-breakdown case. I must say he worked hard for months on this astounding plot. He succeeded so well that the international medical board, with Swiss and Italian doctors, unhesitatingly accepted his case for early repatriation,\" (in April 1943 via a military hospital in Lucca).<ref>Neame, pp.283\u2013284.</ref> \"However, he reached England and returned to duty. We used to spend many hours on the battlements of Castello di Vincigliata discussing [my] book, how to be an author and many other matters.\"<ref>Neame, p.284.</ref> Leeming was influential in the escape plans, suggesting using the castle well system,<ref>Neame, p.294.</ref> camouflaging,<ref>Neame, p.295.</ref> and coding secret communications to MI9.<ref>Neame, p.310.</ref> After the war he returned to business in Manchester. He continued to write books and his experience as a POW in Italy was the inspiration for his novels.\n\n;Brigadier [[Reginald Miles]], CBE, DSO & Bar, MC (1892\u20131943)\n\nReggie Miles, a New Zealander, served as an artillery captain at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and was badly wounded in July 1915. In France, during the battle of the Somme, he was awarded the Military Cross in December 1916. In May 1917 he was promoted to major. The following year he received a DSO (recommended for the Victoria Cross) and was mentioned in dispatches in November 1918. In World War II he served in the Greek campaign, was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Greek Military Cross (first class).\n\nRejoining his division in North Africa, in December 1941 his 6th Field Regiment was overrun by German Panzers near Belhamed, and he was wounded in the back by shrapnel and taken prisoner. He and Hargest arrived in Vincigliata in 1942. He settled into camp routine, becoming a gardener,<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/> and was actively involved in escape attempts. Together with Hargest he escaped<ref name=\"Neame303\">Neame, p.303.</ref> to Switzerland \u2013the only two of six officers who escaped from the castle through a tunnel which he helped to build, in April 1943. Neame received a coded letter announcing their success a fortnight later.<ref name=\"Neame308\"/> Miles was made a CBE and received a bar to his DSO for his \"splendid achievement in escaping.\" However, having travelled as far as the Spanish frontier on 20 October 1943, in a state of depression and exhaustion, he inexplicably shot himself and was buried in the Figueras Municipal Cemetery. He was posthumously appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1944.\n\n;Lieutenant General Sir [[Philip Neame]] VC, KBE, CB, DSO, KStJ (1888\u20131978)\n\nNeame was born in Faversham Kent and educated at [[Cheltenham College]]. He joined the Royal Engineers in 1908 and during World War I had won the [[Victoria Cross]] in December 1914. Ten years later he won a gold medal for shooting at the 1924 Paris Olympics (the only VC to win an Olympic medal). These games were memorably celebrated in the film ''Chariots of Fire''. He saw service in India, becoming a brigadier-general with Eastern Command in 1934 and then returned to England as commandant of the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]], Woolwich in 1938. Neame, along with Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor, were captured by a German patrol in the Western Desert Campaign in Cyrenaica, April 1941.\n\nHe was sent to Italy, first at Villa Orsini near Sulmona, where he met other captured officers, as Carton de Wiart wrote: \"General Neame well known as a big game hunter, discovered a latent talent for embroidery, and also started on a book.\"<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.187.</ref> He later moved to Castello di Vincigliata P.G. 12, \"Chief backgammon expert was Neame, but it made it perfectly furious to play with him, as he always seemed to have the luck of the devil.\"<ref name=\"Wiart195\">Carton de Wiart, p.195.</ref> The officers started a tunnel and as Carton de Wiart explained, \"Neame with his sapper's knowledge gave us the layout for our labours, and with such a degree of accuracy that at the end we were hardly a centimetre out.\"<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.208.</ref> He and O'Connor took all the remaining officers and men out of Vincigliata during the Italian Armistice in 1943. They were taken to Florence railway station and put on a train to Arezzo.<ref name=\"Ranfurly236\">Ranfurly, p.236.</ref>\n\nAfter months in the mountains and with the help of partisans and MI9 agents he, Boyd and O'Connor finally arrived in Allied lines safely by Christmas 1943. Back in England during 1944, the Countess of Ranfurly records in her diary, \"We paid a short visit to General Neame and his wife in their pretty house in Kent and he and Dan (Ranfurly, Neame's ADC since 1940) talked of their escapes.\"<ref>Ranfurly, p.247.</ref> Neame served as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey from 1945 to 1953. Philip Neame was the nephew of a founding father of the Kent-based Shepherd Neame brewing dynasty, the oldest in Kent.\n\n;General Sir [[Richard Nugent O'Connor]] KT, GCB, DSO & Bar, MC, ADC (1889\u20131981)\n\nO'Connor was born in India, sent to England attending [[Wellington School, Somerset]], and later the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. During World War I as brigade major of 91 Brigade, 7th Division, he was awarded the Military Cross in February 1915 and in March the DSO. In World War II now promoted to major-general, he was the brilliant commander of 7th Armoured Division and 4th Indian Brigade that earlier in the North African campaign had routed the Italian 10th Army, taking the surrender of 130,000 men and 400 tanks.\n\nUnfortunately, he was captured with Lieutenant-General Neame by a German reconnaissance night patrol in the desert between Derna and Mechili in April 1941.<ref>Neame, pp.279\u2013282.</ref> He was flown to Catania and then by rail to Sulmona where he and his fellow captives were billeted in the Villa Orsini for six months before being sent to Vincigliata. He attempted many escapes and succeeded in April 1943 by tunnelling out of the castle with five other officers. 'General Dick' as the New Zealanders affectionately called him,<ref>Hargest, p.91.</ref> teamed up with Carton de Wiart and walked across the Apennines. In seven days they were far beyond Bologna, some 150 miles from Florence.<ref name=\"Neame309\"/> They were arrested by a carabinieri patrol out looking for them. The result was a return to the castle and thirty days' solitary confinement.\n\nA few months later, after the Italian Armistice in September 1943, he escaped again, with all remaining officers and men. He reached [[Camaldoli]] with Neame, and with the help of partisans and MI9 officers reached Allied lines in [[Termoli]] by fishing boat by Christmas 1943.<ref name=\"Foot240\"/> In 1944 he commanded VIII Corps in Normandy and later, during [[Operation Market Garden]]. In 1945 he was General Officer in Command of the Eastern Command in India. He retired in 1948. He was Lord Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty from 1955 to 1964.\n\n;Thomas [[Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly]] KCMG (1914\u20131988)\n\nSecond Lieutenant Lord (Dan) Ranfurly, educated at [[Eton College]], joined the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers), 1st Cavalry Division, and was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Neame when they were both captured in Cyrenaica in April 1941. He was taken by ship from North Africa to Naples, then by rail to Sulmona camp P.G. 78 in the Abruzzo near Rome. Neame was taken to Villa Orsini nearby. They met again when they were both transferred to Vincigliata P.G. 12 in October 1941. He adapted to prison life and handled the officers housekeeping and Red Cross parcels.<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/> As Carton de Wiart wrote, \"He was our most expert gambler, did me the good turn of teaching me to play backgammon.\"<ref name=\"Wiart195\"/> He helped with the tunnel escape plans, cleverly building and disguising the escape trap to the outside world.<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.214.</ref>\n\nHe escaped with other officers during the Italian Armistice in September 1943.

His exploits in the Second World War, along with those of his wife, [[Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly|Hermione]], and valet, Whitaker, are chronicled in the memoirs of his wife, Hermione, ''[[To War with Whitaker|To War With Whitaker: The Wartime Diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly, 1939\u20131945]]''.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Ranfurly worked briefly in insurance at Lloyd's of London, not long after being appointed Governor of the [[Bahamas]] by [[Winston Churchill]]. Returning home in 1957, he took up farming at his Buckinghamshire estate.\n\n;Capt [[Guy Ruggles-Brise]] (1914\u20132000)\n\nGuy Edward Ruggles-Brise, educated at [[Eton College]], joined the 104th Essex Yeomanry, and in 1940 was picked for commando training in Scotland. He departed with No 7 Commando for North Africa, where he was captured after a daring raid in 1941 and transferred to Naples by ship. He was later held at P.G. 35 at [[Padula]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conscript-heroes.com/MI9-04.html |title=MI9 |work=Conscript Heroes}}</ref> near Salerno from May 1942 until June 1943. Briefly sent to P.G. 19 in [[Bologna]] before being transferred to Vincigliata in the latter days before the Italian armistice, he was among the party released by General Chiappe in September 1943. He and the others were driven to [[Firenze Campo di Marte railway station]] from where a special train took them to Arezzo.\n\nAfter months with the partisans in the Apennines he finally reached Allied lines in May 1944 with a group of officers including an old schoolfriend, 'Dan' Ranfurly.<ref>Ranfurly, p.241.</ref> After the war he became a stockbroker and bought an estate in Scotland where he enjoyed deer stalking.\n\n;Lieutenant Victor Smith, RNR\n\nLieutenant Smith, RN, of [[813 Naval Air Squadron|813 Squadron]] FAA, {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}}, was shot down in a raid on Maritza airfield, Rhodes, on 4 September 1940.

He married Janet Alicia Christopher in 1924 and during the 1930s was in Egypt. In World War II he commanded the 1st Armoured Brigade, initially based in the United Kingdom and then in January 1941 it was shipped to Egypt. When Greece was invaded the 1st Armoured Brigade was sent with General Maitland Wilson's unsuccessful attempt at stopping the German invasion.\n\nIn April 1941 it was evacuated to Egypt. He commanded the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own) part of 7th Armoured Division in the defence of Tobruk, where he was captured by a German reconnaissance night patrol (led by Rommel) in the desert in November 1941.<ref name=\"Hargest55\"/> He was sent to Italy and arrived at the Villa Orsini, near Sulmona, joining Brigadier Hargest and others.

O'Connor's attempt over the wall had failed, with the inevitable punishment of a month's solitary confinement. Then in mid-September 1942 a tunnel was started and designed by Neame, a Royal Engineer. Various officers took it in turns to work on it in shifts of four hours per day. This was hard blistering work, but they managed to successfully evade detection, over the next six months. It was completed by 20 March 1943.<ref>Neave, p.303.</ref> The plan was for six selected officers to escape in pairs; O'Connor with Carton de Wairt, Combe with Boyd and the two New Zealanders Hargest and Miles together. Waiting for the right conditions they eventually escaped on the evening of 29 March. Neame in his book pays tribute to the support they received from fellow POW's: \"...while the remaining six officers and thirteen NCOs and men went through hours of tedious watching to ensure success. Every one, officers and men, were in it, and wildly keen for success!\"<ref name=\"Neame303\"/> In the meantime Leeming had been sent to Lucca military hospital in early April 1943 by the International Medical board, (he faked a very bad nervous breakdown) and from there by train to Lisbon where he was repatriated on the British hospital ship {{Ship|HMHS|Newfoundland}} arriving at Avonmouth April 23, 1943.\n\nThe tunnel escape proceeded brilliantly with six officers escaping (in order: Combe, Miles, Boyd, Hargest, O'Connor, Carton de Wiart) remaining undetected until the following day, enough time for the escapees to be far away. They all had their adventures some of which have been described in their books. O'Connor and Carton de Wiart (who was now aged sixty-three) were captured in the region of the Po Valley, Bologna after eight days, while Combe was caught at Milan railway station. Boyd managed to board a train and reach Como before he too was apprehended. However the New Zealanders, Reg Miles and James Hargest secured their escape by journeying by rail and then walking over the border into Switzerland. Neame received a coded letter from Miles two weeks later confirming their safe arrival.<ref name=\"Neame308\"/>\nAs a punishment, after the discovery of the tunnel two of the officers' batmen (Pickford and Prewett) were transferred to another camp. Eventually the four captured officers were returned to the camp for thirty days solitary. As Carton de Wiart comments in his book, \"I learnt also that twenty-four hours elapsed before our exit hole had been discovered, and then only by Gussie's dog (Mickey, a cross St Bernard & white sheep-dog). Gussie (as Lieutenant Agosto Ricciardi their previous Italian guard and Gaoler was known) had left it behind when he had been sent away, but the dog proved too intimate a friend to us, and had unwittingly given away our secret.\"<ref name=\"Wiart222\"/>\nA new camp commander was appointed and the garrison was increased by fifty-percent \u2013 there were now some hundred infantry and Carabinieri to guard eleven officers and fourteen other ranks. The final and successful escape was not made until after the Italian surrender in September 1943. However, in the preceding months, the inmates of the castle had through MI9 contacts continued to receive parcels with much concealed escape material including over 20,000 lire in Italian money, various maps, compasses and some clothing material.<ref>Neame, p.312.</ref>\n\nCampo 12 received a Red Cross visit in December 1942; and reported, \"This camp for British Generals continues to be satisfactory. A few minor complaints were brought forward and settled on the spot. No British chaplain has yet visited the camp.\"<ref>''POW'' magazine, April 1943.</ref> A visit three months later describes the camp as \"...as being like a country house. The officers spend much of their time working in the garden.\"<ref>''POW'' magazine, June 1943.</ref>\n\nThen in mid-August Carton de Wiart was selected by the Italians and taken from Vincigliata to Rome as part of their proposed armistice negotiations with the allies. (He was a friend of the Italian Crown Princess \u2013 and they hoped this connection would help). He met with the Italian Deputy Chief of Staff General Zanussi,<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.226.</ref> and after a few days they travelled on to neutral Lisbon. By the end of the month he was flown to England a free man.\n\n;The Italian Armistice 1943\n\nThen on 8 September 1943, the captain in charge of Castello di Vincigliata announced that the Italian government had arranged an armistice.<ref>Ranfurly, p.235.</ref> At nine in the morning two days later all the remaining prisoners of war were sent to Florence railway station as the Germans were approaching. General Chiappe, a sympathetic Italian officer arranged a special train for them to Arezzo some sixty miles south. Using the smuggled Lire currency they bought various civilian clothes from local Italians at the railway station. Suitably attired Neame, O'Connor, with nine other officers, together with fourteen other ranks under CQMS Morgan set off to evade capture.<ref>Neave, p.314.</ref> After arriving in Arezzo they discovered much confusion and a general air of despondency with many Italian officials. So the officers decided it was safer to move away the same evening with all the escaping soldiers. They travelled some forty miles northward to the Hospice of Camadoli in the Apennine Mountains. They stayed four days. Some officers climbed another thousand feet higher to the Monastery in Eremo where the Prior-General of the Camaldolese Order resided. He was pro-British \u2013 hated the fascists and detailed one of the brothers Don Leoni to act as special liaison between the British escaped prisoners.<ref>Neave, p.316.</ref> Links with MI9 were re-established and money provided to help with food and shelter in an already impoverished Italian countryside. There was not enough food in the local village, so the escaping group was dispersed in small parties over a district of ten miles.\nItaly was still politically divided and word reached the Prior-General that an Italian fascist had betrayed the presence of the escaping prisoners and for their safety moved them from the Monastery to hide and live amongst the Italians in the mountain villages of Segeteina and Strabatenza some ten miles away. In September and October the soldiers helped the peasants with their manual work such as digging, fetching water and husking maize. O'Connor or Neame would make regular visits to check on the soldiers' welfare and give them any news.<ref>Neave, p.318.</ref> During this time Neame and O'Connor (who had learnt Italian whilst a prisoner) had collected another twenty or so British soldiers that had also escaped after the armistice and were wandering the mountains. As a precaution the officers built brushwood hides in the surrounding woods, to sleep overnight as there were frequent alarms about spies and impending searches. Then on the morning of 29 October, 120 Germans arrived by Italian motor-lorries and surrounded the village to search it.<ref>Neave, p.325.</ref> They had been betrayed. The approaching Germans were seen by the officers from higher up the mountains and with help from one of the guides in the village escaped. The NCO's and other soldiers were not so lucky. After two months freedom they were again prisoners of war \u2013 this time by the Germans. After a series of escapades, by Christmas 1943 Neame, O'Connor and Boyd arrived at Termoli by fishing boat. A further five brigadiers and eleven other escapers arrived the same way by mid-May 1944.<ref name=\"Foot240\">Foot, p.240.</ref>\n\n====MI9 escape & evasion====\nAmongst the many clandestine British secret services during World War II was a department known as [[MI9]]. (It was set up under Norman Crockatt, an ex-infantry major who earned the DSO and MC in World War I). It worked to train the armed forces in escape and evasion. Evasion lines were set up in occupied countries. MI9 exchanged coded letters with prisoner of war camps, and secretively sent in money, maps, clothes and many other useful tools. What the Italians never knew was that O'Connor had one of \"Winterbottom's codes\"<ref>Foot, p.148.</ref> and was therefore secretively in touch with London, through coded letters sent to fictitious addresses in England.<ref>Neame, pp.310\u2013311.</ref>\n\n====Aftermath====\n* John Leeming was the first officer to reach England from the prison camp, in April 1943. However, he had been medically repatriated by feigning paranoia.\n* Carton de Wiart reached England in August 1943, having been involved in the Italian Armistice. He later reflected in his book ''Happy Odyssey'' (p.&nbsp;184), after capture in North Africa, \"I met Captain Camino, who had lived in England many years and afterwards proved himself most helpful to many British prisoners of war. Later Captain Camino took me on to the Cavalry barracks, where I was treated as an honoured guest, and I wish that I could meet some of those officers again and thank them for their courtesy and kindness to me.\"\n* James Hargest was the first and only soldier to escape Vincigliata and successfully reach England in November 1943. In doing so, he became the highest-ranking British officer to escape in either war.<ref>Hargest, publisher's note.</ref> He wrote an account of his escape on his return in, ''Farewell Campo 12'', with a dedication: \"To my son Geoffrey who died of wounds in Italy, in March 1944.\" Hargest was killed in Normandy in 1944, and his book published posthumously in 1945.\n* Philip Neame wrote the whole of his book, ''Playing with Strife'', except for the last chapter, whilst a prisoner-of-war in Italy. He carried the manuscript when he was released from the castle during the Italian armistice in September 1943. It was concealed in a tomb by the Prior General in the monastery of Eremo, retrieved by a British MI9 agent (Signor Ruggero Cagnazzo) in November 1944, and finally published in 1947.\n\n==Current castle ==\n[[File:Castello di Vincigliata.jpg|thumb|The castle pictured by John Dann in 2010]]\n{{As of|2012}}, the family owners were offering the castle as a venue for special occasions such as weddings, gala dinners and wine tastings. It has its own vineyard, the Testamatta Estate ([[Azienda Agricola Testamatta]]), run by Bibi Graetz, a wine-maker and artist who designs his own labels. He produces indigenous varieties of Sangiovese, Canaiolo and Colorino.

In the mid-nineteenth century the building, which had fallen into a ruinous state, was acquired by the Englishman John Temple-Leader and entirely reconstructed in the feudal style.\n\nBetween 1941 and 1943 it served as a small [[prisoner-of-war camp]] known as '''Castello di Vincigliata Campo P.G. 12'''. It housed some high-ranking British and Commonwealth officers, including Major-General Sir [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]], who was employed by the Italian government in the [[Italian Armistice|Armistice]] negotiations with the Allies in 1943.\n\n== Original castle ==\nThe 13th-century castle located on a hill north of Florence close to Fiesole is medieval in origin. It was once the ancient stronghold of the Visdomini family, important Florentine nobility since the 11th century.<ref>Scott, p.7.</ref> They enjoyed special privileges from the Florentine bishops. A son of the family [[John Gualbert]], a Benedictine monk, was canonized in 1193 by [[Pope Celestine III]]. The property then passed to the Usimbardi family, (which introduced glass production to Florence) followed by the Ceffini of [[Figline Valdarno|Figline]].\n\nThey soon sold it to the Buonaccorsi banking family. In the general crash of Florentine banks in 1345 (bad debts by King [[Edward III of England]] for his [[Battle of Cr\u00e9cy]] and [[Battle of Poitiers (1356)]] campaigns) it was purchased by Niccolo, son of Ugo degli [[Albizi]], a wealthy mercantile family.<ref>Scott, p.18.</ref> A branch of this family, for reasons of political expediency renamed Alessandri, occupied the castle for some three hundred years.\n\nAfter the fall of the Republic, the Alessandri family still kept up their palace in the city, but the castle was allowed to drift into decay, till by the year 1637 only the Lord Francesco lived there with a 10-year-old son, Giovani Antonio, and a maiden aunt of 70. The ruins and land were sold in 1827 to Lorenzo di Bartolommeo Galli da Rovezzano <ref>Scott, p.28.</ref> They became a source of interest to writers and artists during the romantic era, as evidenced by an Emilio Burci sketch dated 1836.\n\n[[File:Cartolina di vincigliata, 1901.jpg|thumb|The courtyard of Vincigliata Castle in 1901]]\n\n==  John Temple-Leader ==\n[[John Temple-Leader]] , as a young [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] politician, suddenly abandoned a  parliamentary career for the continent. In the early 1840s after several years in [[Cannes]], he moved to [[Florence]], taking a house in the Piazza Pitti. He became a friend of Georgio Barbera, a Florentine publisher and supporter of the unification of Italy. Later he purchased Fiesole's Villa di Maiano and joined Tuscany's sizeable English expatriate community. Whilst exploring the hills of Fiesole, the Englishman came upon the overgrown ruin of Castello di Vincigliata. He fell in love with it and decided to restore it to its former glory.\n\nOver 15 years, the castlewas reconstructed in the neo-Gothic style from the ground up. With the help of a young architect, Giuseppe Fancelli,<ref>Scott, p.31.</ref> it became a romantic vision of a feudal fortress. He also bought the surrounding land, more than seven hundred acres in the space of fifty years, began the delicate task of reclaiming it and restoring the houses and villas. He created the Bosco di Vincigliata, planting cypresses in the rocky areas where nothing else would grow, with pines and all the various shrubs and bushes one finds in a typical central Italian woodland; in short, an English romantic garden on a huge scale. People flocked from afar to visit his castle and admire the grounds, and he was extremely pleased when The [[Illustrated London News]] printed an engraving of [[Queen Victoria]] doing a watercolour of the Giardino delle Colonne, a pretty pool fed by the Mensola creek, during her visit in 1893.\n\n[[Henry James]] wrote of the castle: \"This elaborate piece of imitation has no superficial use; but, even if it were less complete, less successful, less brilliant, I should feel a reflective kindness for it. So handsome a piece of work is its own justification; it belongs to the heroics of culture.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Henry |last=James |authorlink=Henry James |url=https://archive.org/stream/transatlanticske00jameuoft#page/n290 |title=Transatlantic sketches |location=Boston |publisher=James R. Osgood |year=1875 |pages=287\u2013288}}</ref>\n\nThe gate of the castello is flanked by two stone lions and leads into an Italian garden with a fountain and a sunken cloister. Originally there were many Gaetano Bianchi (1819\u20131892) frescoes of scenes from the lives of the various families that owned Vincigliata, but only one has survived, Ugolino de'Visdomini invoking the Virgin before marching against the Sienese. In 1889 he published the definitive record on Sir [[John Hawkwood]], an English mercenary (or ''[[condottiero]]'') active in 14th-century Italy. Sir John married late in life and died in Florence in 1903, without heirs. He left all his properties, including the Castello di Vincigliata to his great nephew Richard Luttrell Pilkington Bethell, 3rd [[Baron Westbury]], who sold it off piecemeal, and his art collection was scattered.\n\n== POW camp ==\nThe castle was requisitioned by the Italian government during [[World War II]] and was designated P.G. 12 Vincigliata, as a prisoner-of-war camp for distinguished military prisoners. It was a much smaller camp than the others, with no more than around twenty-five prisoners at any one time. The officers were separated from the non-commissioned officers and the only link between them was via the officers' [[Batman (military)|batmen]] or servants who attended them. During the ebb and flow of the [[North African Campaign]] 1941/2, a number of high-ranking British officers were captured.\n\nOn arrival in Italy, most British POWs passed through the Italian transit camp at [[Capua]] and then moved to more permanent camps. In early 1942, the Italian army began to reorganise their POW camp system and commenced to number and classify them. The large camp at [[Sulmona#Campo 78|Sulmona]], holding as many as 3,000 prisoners, in the [[Abruzzo]] outside Rome, became known as ''Campo concentramento di prigionieri di guerra 78'', abbreviated to P.G. 78, which held a large number of British and Commonwealth officers and other ranks.\n\nA small number of these senior officers and NCOs secured in the Villa Orsini were sent further north to P.G. 12 Vincigliata. They included Air-Marshal Owen Boyd, Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor, Lieutenant-General Philip Neame, and Major-General Sir Adrian Carton de Wiart, who wrote, \"We learned that Vincigliati (sic) had belonged to an Englishman, a man called Temple-Leader. We considered he had restored the castello in the most thoughtless fashion, giving all his attention to what went on above ground, and regardless of the many underground passages that he had sealed up. He made things very difficult for us.\"<ref name=\"Wiart192\">Carton de Wiart, p.192.</ref> The castle also included New Zealander Brigadiers Reginald Miles and James Hargest who reflected in his book, \"One thing the late Temple-Leader had certainly done: he had erected a structure ideal for the purpose it was now put to\u2014a prison.\"<ref name=\"Hargest74\">Hargest, p.74.</ref>\n\n===Known prisoners, September 1941 \u2013 September 1943===\n\n====British and Commonwealth officers====\n\n;Brigadier Bertram Frank Armstrong DSO (1893\u20131972)\n\nArmstrong, a South African, was the commanding officer of the 5th South African Infantry Brigade, which formed part of the South African 1st Infantry Division, formed August 1940. It served in East Africa and the Western Desert. He was captured at Sidi Rezeg in North Africa on 23 or 24 November 1941. He had the nickname \"Oubaas\" [and] \"...was a jolly soul, who seemed quite undisturbed by prison life in Vincigliata.\"<ref name=\"Leeming111\">Leeming, p.111.</ref> He received the DSO in 1942, and escaped during the Italian Armistice in September 1943\u2014initially with other officers, including Dan Ranfurly, walking over the Apennines and down into Romagna, guided by a Benedictine monk Don Leone. \"It was a terrible climb for Brigadier Armstrong who had a game leg. There was not enough food in the village, so we dispersed in small parties over a district of ten miles.\"<ref name=\"Ranfurly237\"/> He became a major-general, and chief of the general staff, [[Union Defence Force (South Africa)|South African Union Defence Force]], before retiring in 1953.\n\n;Air Marshal [[Owen Tudor Boyd]] CB, OBE, MC, AFC (1889\u20131944)\n\nBoyd was on his way to Egypt, in November 1940 as the new deputy commander of the British Air Forces in the Middle East. En route for [[Malta]], the [[Wellington bomber]] in which he and his staff were passengers was forced down over enemy-controlled [[Sicily]] by a group of Italian fighters. After destroying his confidential papers by setting his own aircraft on fire, Boyd became a prisoner of war. He and his ADC Flight-Lieutenant Leeming, were sent to the Villa Orsini close to Sulmona PG 78, POW camp, joined later by Neame, O'Connor, Combe, Gambier-Parry, Todhunter and Younghusband, before being sent to Vincigliata some six months later.\n\nHe was involved with a number of escape plans. He was an expert carpenter,<ref name=\"Wiart194\">Carton de Wiart, p.194.</ref> contributing to the tunnel work, and in March 1943 escaping with five other officers. After making it to Milan boarded a train for [[Como]] only to be arrested at the Swiss frontier. He escaped again during the Italian Armistice in September 1943, after time in the Italian countryside he successfully reached the Allied lines with Neame and O'Connor. He returned to England but in August 1944 he died of a heart attack.\n\n;Major-General Sir [[Adrian Carton de Wiart]] VC, KBE, CB, CMG, DSO (1880\u20131963)\n\nDe Wiart came from a well-connected continental family and was appointed by Churchill as head of a military mission en route to Yugoslavia. He was captured when his [[Wellington bomber|Wellington aircraft]] from [[Malta]] crash-landed in the sea off the coast of North Africa in April 1941. He had won a VC in [[World War I]], on the Somme, being wounded eight times and losing a hand and eye. He was the alleged model for the flamboyant Brigadier Ritchie-Hook in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''Sword of Honour'' trilogy. He was sent to the villa Orsini (referred to as Medici in his book) close to Sulmona P.G. 78. Later, with other officers, he was sent to Vincigliata, where he made many escape attempts including through a successful tunnel with five others in March 1943.\n\nHe managed to evade capture for eight days disguised as an Italian peasant, no mean feat considering that he did not speak Italian, and was 61 years old, with an eye patch, and one empty sleeve. He was captured and returned to Vincigliata for the obligatory 30-day solitary confinement.<ref name=\"Neame309\">Neame, p.309.</ref> In August 1943 he was selected by the Italian authorities to accompany an Italian negotiator, General Zanussi, to Rome then Lisbon to meet Allied contacts to facilitate the surrender. When they reached [[Lisbon]], Carton de Wiart was released and made his way to England, by plane the same month. Within a month of his arrival, Churchill informed him that he was to be sent to China as his personal representative to Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. He left by air for India in October 1943. In November 1944 he was promoted to lieutenant-general. At the war's end he retired to Ireland, and married for the second time.\n\n;Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Frederick Boyce Combe]], CB, DSO & Bar (1895-1967)\n\nCombe was a British Army officer before and during World War II. He was commanding officer of the [[11th Hussars]] for the initial stages of the Western Desert Campaign. He was twice awarded the DSO for his service in the Western Desert Campaign before being captured in [[Cyrenaica]] in April 1941, with O'Connor and Neame. In Vincigliata he became one of the gardeners,<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/> as well as keeping sixteen hens, \"and tended them like a mother.\"<ref>Neame, p.76.</ref> He was an enthusiastic escaper, taking turns in tunnelling, and one of the six officers to escape in April 1943. Unfortunately he was caught the next morning at [[Milan]] railway station, whilst studying a timetable.<ref name=\"Neame308\">Neame, p.308.</ref> He escaped again with all remaining officers and men during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. He reached Camaldoli with Neame, O'Connor and other British officers. In [[Romagna]], he joined the Italian partisans led by Libero as [[Riccardo Fedel]] was known.<ref>Lamb, pp.202\u2013207.</ref> He arrived at Allied lines in May 1944, rejoining the Eighth Army.\n\nIn October 1944 he was given command of 2nd Armoured Brigade, until after the German surrender, with the rank of colonel. In 1945, he had brief periods as an acting major-general commanding successively 78th Infantry Division and 46th Infantry Division in Austria. In October 1946 his rank of major-general was made permanent and he was appointed Deputy GOC British Troops Austria. He retired from the army in October 1947, and married the same year. In 1945 he had become Colonel of the Regiment of the 11th Hussars, taking part in the procession behind the coffin at the funeral of [[King George VI]] in 1952. He relinquished the post in 1957.\n\n;Colonel George Hew Fanshawe, CBE (1899\u20131974)\n\nBorn into a military Oxfordshire family, Fanshawe became a career soldier, serving in India where he met and married Mary Holme Wiggin in 1926, at Sialkot, India, they had a son Hew Dalrymple Fanshawe born in 1927. During World War II he was the commanding officer of The [[Queen's Bays]] (2nd Dragoon Guards) part of the Royal Armoured Corps, and was captured in North Africa, and arrived at Vincigliata in 1942. As Neame recorded in his book, \"Colonel G. Fanshawe also joined us at Florence, but Younghusband and Fanshawe were sent away to make room for more senior officers.\"<ref name=\"Neame288\">Neame, p.288.</ref><ref>Carton de Wiart, p.193.</ref> He was transferred to Veano Camp P.G. 29, in [[Piacenza]], Northern Italy.\n\nAfter the war he was gazetted in 1946, lieutenant-colonel (acting brigadier), (13054), The Bays, (seniority, July 1942). He was gazetted a brigadier in December 1948. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the New Years Honours list 1953, and was commander, Royal Armoured Corps, between March 1951 and October 1952, when he retired to Oxfordshire.\n\n;Major-General [[Michael Gambier-Parry|Michael Denman Gambier-Parry]], MC, (1891\u20131976)\n\nThe Gambier-Parrys of [[Highnam Court]], [[Gloucestershire]]; were an artistic and military family \u2013 his uncle [[Ernest Gambier-Parry]]<ref>''The Times'', Obituary, 17 April 1936.</ref> was a major in the army sent to Egypt to avenge the death of General Gordon, and wrote a book (''Suakin'', 1885) about his experiences. Michael joined the [[Royal Welch Fusiliers]] in 1911. As a captain in World War I, he served in France (awarded the Military Cross) and at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. Promoted temporary lieutenant-colonel, he transferred to the Royal Tank Corps 1924.\n\nIn World War II he was aide-de-camp to the King, then headed the British Military Mission to [[Athens]] in 1940. In 1941, as general officer commanding the 2nd Armoured Division, North Africa, he was captured with Brigadier Vaughan at [[Mechili]] in April 1941. He arrived at Villa Orsini near Sulmona with Neame, O'Connor, Combe and Younghusband, and was sent to Vincigliata the same year. As Carton de Wiart wrote of him \"...&nbsp;he was also a most gifted man, made delightful sketches, was a first class 'forger' \u2013 which could no doubt earn him a steady income in the underworld.\"<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/><ref>Hargest, pp.113\u2013114.</ref>\n\nKnown as 'GP', he was a knowledgeable musician, \"and led the choir in our church services on Sunday.\"<ref name=\"Neame304\"/> \"'GP' was one of the few really unselfish men I have ever known.\"<ref>Leeming, p.96.</ref> In September 1943, he escaped with the other officers and after various adventures arrived in Rome. He initially obtained sanctuary in a secret room within Signora Di Rienzo\u2019s fourth-floor apartment in the Via Ruggero Bonghi. Later he was hidden in a hospital on Via Santo Stefano Rotundo run by the Little Sisters of Mary; all arranged by an Irish priest known as the \u2018Vatican Pimpernel\u2019 <ref> pp.109-112, The Vatican Pimpernel, Brian Fleming, Skyhorse Publishing Inc, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-61608-702-9}} </ref>,\u2018under the noses\u2019 of the Germans until the allies arrived in June 1944. He retired soon after, becoming Deputy Lieutenant of Wiltshire, and died in 1976.\n\n;The Rt Rev [[George Gerard|George Vincent Gerard]], CBE, MC (1898\u20131984)\n\nDuring World War II Bishop Gerard was the military chaplain to the New Zealand forces and was captured in North Africa. He was for a short time imprisoned in Vincigliata <ref name=\"Neame304\"/> until he was repatriated to Egypt in June 1943. He was educated at Christ's College, Canterbury and Brasenose College, Oxford. After serving with the [[Buffs (Royal East Kent Regiment)|Buffs]] (Royal East Kent Regiment) in World War I, he was ordained in 1923 and embarked on his ecclesiastical career in New Zealand, becoming the 7th Anglican bishop of [[Diocese of Waiapu|Waiapu]], from 1938 to 1944.\n\n;Brigadier [[James Hargest]] CBE, DSO & 2 bars, MC, ED, MP, (1891\u20131944)\n\nHargest came from a New Zealand farming family. In World War I he served in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, commissioned as a second lieutenant. He fought and was wounded in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]], and later fought in France, being awarded the Military Cross, the DSO, and the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur. In 1931, he was elected to Parliament as the MP for Invercargill. During World War II, he was able to use his political connections to get an appointment as a brigadier in 1940, and took part in the Battle of Crete, where his incompetence and indecisiveness allowed the German parachutists against the odds to gain a foothold at the Maleme airfield that lost the Battle of Crete for the allies. Nevertheless, he was decorated.  later his brigade took part in the defence of [[Tobruk]], where he was captured in November 1941. It is inexplicable that the Italians didn\u2019t release him to do more damage on his side. He and his servant, Howes, were sent by sea and rail to Italy arriving just before Christmas at the Villa Orsini near Sulmona.<ref name=\"Hargest55\">Hargest, p.55.</ref> He was joined by fellow New Zealander Brigadier Miles. Hargest and other officers were transferred to Vincigliata by train in March 1942.\n\nSeveral escape attempts were made but his successful escape was through the tunnel in March 1943. He and Miles paired up for the escape and managed to travel to Milan by train and onward to Como and finally across the Swiss border.<ref name=\"Neame308\"/> On arriving Hargest wrote \"We raced up the hill into thick forest. Reg cried, 'Jim, we're in Switzerland!' I dived into my case and hauled out the three-ounce bottle of rum. We drank to our freedom.\"<ref>Hargest, p.131.</ref> After travelling alone through France and Spain to Gibraltar he reached England by air in November 1943. As New Zealand's observer he travelled back to France on D-Day 1944. On 12 August he was killed by a shell-burst and is buried in Normandy.\n\n;Flight Lieutenant [[John Fishwick Leeming]] (1895\u20131965)\n\nLeeming was a Lancastrian with a keen interest in aviation. He had built a glider with friends in 1922 and formed the [[Lancashire Aero Club]], becoming its chairman. In 1926 he was the first to land an aeroplane on a mountain (3,117&nbsp;ft up [[Helvellyn]] in the English Lake District). He sold his first published article at 13 and during the 1930s became internationally known for his books. He joined the RAF and was with Air Marshal Boyd as his aide-de-camp when their Wellington bomber was forced down over enemy-controlled Sicily in November 1940. After destroying confidential papers by setting the aircraft on fire, including some \u00a3250,000 in currency (although some was secretly hidden for possible escape),<ref name=\"Neame292\">Neame, p.292.</ref> he and Boyd became prisoners of war. They were sent to the Villa Orsini, close to the Sulmona POW camp near Rome. Six months later they were moved to Vincigliata P.G. 12 near Florence.\n\nAs Lieutenant-General Neame wrote, \"Leeming gave up running the mess in December 1941, after we had been in Florence for three months to devote himself to the plot.\"<ref name=\"Neame288\"/> \"His character interested me. I place him as an extremely shrewd man, very persistent and determined, but pleasant to deal with, with a most kindly nature and a flair for getting on with nearly anyone. But he delighted to appear to others as simple and easily overcome by circumstances, a pose which he developed so successfully that he managed to get himself repatriated as a very bad nervous-breakdown case. I must say he worked hard for months on this astounding plot. He succeeded so well that the international medical board, with Swiss and Italian doctors, unhesitatingly accepted his case for early repatriation,\" (in April 1943 via a military hospital in Lucca).<ref>Neame, pp.283\u2013284.</ref> \"However, he reached England and returned to duty. We used to spend many hours on the battlements of Castello di Vincigliata discussing [my] book, how to be an author and many other matters.\"<ref>Neame, p.284.</ref> Leeming was influential in the escape plans, suggesting using the castle well system,<ref>Neame, p.294.</ref> camouflaging,<ref>Neame, p.295.</ref> and coding secret communications to MI9.<ref>Neame, p.310.</ref> After the war he returned to business in Manchester. He continued to write books and his experience as a POW in Italy was the inspiration for his novels.\n\n;Brigadier [[Reginald Miles]], CBE, DSO & Bar, MC (1892\u20131943)\n\nReggie Miles, a New Zealander, served as an artillery captain at [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] and was badly wounded in July 1915. In France, during the battle of the Somme, he was awarded the Military Cross in December 1916. In May 1917 he was promoted to major. The following year he received a DSO (recommended for the Victoria Cross) and was mentioned in dispatches in November 1918. In World War II he served in the Greek campaign, was mentioned in dispatches and awarded the Greek Military Cross (first class).\n\nRejoining his division in North Africa, in December 1941 his 6th Field Regiment was overrun by German Panzers near Belhamed, and he was wounded in the back by shrapnel and taken prisoner. He and Hargest arrived in Vincigliata in 1942. He settled into camp routine, becoming a gardener,<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/> and was actively involved in escape attempts. Together with Hargest he escaped<ref name=\"Neame303\">Neame, p.303.</ref> to Switzerland \u2013the only two of six officers who escaped from the castle through a tunnel which he helped to build, in April 1943. Neame received a coded letter announcing their success a fortnight later.<ref name=\"Neame308\"/> Miles was made a CBE and received a bar to his DSO for his \"splendid achievement in escaping.\" However, having travelled as far as the Spanish frontier on 20 October 1943, in a state of depression and exhaustion, he inexplicably shot himself and was buried in the Figueras Municipal Cemetery. He was posthumously appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1944.\n\n;Lieutenant General Sir [[Philip Neame]] VC, KBE, CB, DSO, KStJ (1888\u20131978)\n\nNeame was born in Faversham Kent and educated at [[Cheltenham College]]. He joined the Royal Engineers in 1908 and during World War I had won the [[Victoria Cross]] in December 1914. Ten years later he won a gold medal for shooting at the 1924 Paris Olympics (the only VC to win an Olympic medal). These games were memorably celebrated in the film ''Chariots of Fire''. He saw service in India, becoming a brigadier-general with Eastern Command in 1934 and then returned to England as commandant of the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich|Royal Military Academy]], Woolwich in 1938. Neame, along with Lieutenant-General Richard O'Connor, were captured by a German patrol in the Western Desert Campaign in Cyrenaica, April 1941.\n\nHe was sent to Italy, first at Villa Orsini near Sulmona, where he met other captured officers, as Carton de Wiart wrote: \"General Neame well known as a big game hunter, discovered a latent talent for embroidery, and also started on a book.\"<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.187.</ref> He later moved to Castello di Vincigliata P.G. 12, \"Chief backgammon expert was Neame, but it made it perfectly furious to play with him, as he always seemed to have the luck of the devil.\"<ref name=\"Wiart195\">Carton de Wiart, p.195.</ref> The officers started a tunnel and as Carton de Wiart explained, \"Neame with his sapper's knowledge gave us the layout for our labours, and with such a degree of accuracy that at the end we were hardly a centimetre out.\"<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.208.</ref> He and O'Connor took all the remaining officers and men out of Vincigliata during the Italian Armistice in 1943. They were taken to Florence railway station and put on a train to Arezzo.<ref name=\"Ranfurly236\">Ranfurly, p.236.</ref>\n\nAfter months in the mountains and with the help of partisans and MI9 agents he, Boyd and O'Connor finally arrived in Allied lines safely by Christmas 1943. Back in England during 1944, the Countess of Ranfurly records in her diary, \"We paid a short visit to General Neame and his wife in their pretty house in Kent and he and Dan (Ranfurly, Neame's ADC since 1940) talked of their escapes.\"<ref>Ranfurly, p.247.</ref> Neame served as Lieutenant Governor of Guernsey from 1945 to 1953. Philip Neame was the nephew of a founding father of the Kent-based Shepherd Neame brewing dynasty, the oldest in Kent.\n\n;General Sir [[Richard Nugent O'Connor]] KT, GCB, DSO & Bar, MC, ADC (1889\u20131981)\n\nO'Connor was born in India, sent to England attending [[Wellington School, Somerset]], and later the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. During World War I as brigade major of 91 Brigade, 7th Division, he was awarded the Military Cross in February 1915 and in March the DSO. In World War II now promoted to major-general, he was the brilliant commander of 7th Armoured Division and 4th Indian Brigade that earlier in the North African campaign had routed the Italian 10th Army, taking the surrender of 130,000 men and 400 tanks.\n\nUnfortunately, he was captured with Lieutenant-General Neame by a German reconnaissance night patrol in the desert between Derna and Mechili in April 1941.<ref>Neame, pp.279\u2013282.</ref> He was flown to Catania and then by rail to Sulmona where he and his fellow captives were billeted in the Villa Orsini for six months before being sent to Vincigliata. He attempted many escapes and succeeded in April 1943 by tunnelling out of the castle with five other officers. 'General Dick' as the New Zealanders affectionately called him,<ref>Hargest, p.91.</ref> teamed up with Carton de Wiart and walked across the Apennines. In seven days they were far beyond Bologna, some 150 miles from Florence.<ref name=\"Neame309\"/> They were arrested by a carabinieri patrol out looking for them. The result was a return to the castle and thirty days' solitary confinement.\n\nA few months later, after the Italian Armistice in September 1943, he escaped again, with all remaining officers and men. He reached [[Camaldoli]] with Neame, and with the help of partisans and MI9 officers reached Allied lines in [[Termoli]] by fishing boat by Christmas 1943.<ref name=\"Foot240\"/> In 1944 he commanded VIII Corps in Normandy and later, during [[Operation Market Garden]]. In 1945 he was General Officer in Command of the Eastern Command in India. He retired in 1948. He was Lord Lieutenant of Ross and Cromarty from 1955 to 1964.\n\n;Thomas [[Daniel Knox, 6th Earl of Ranfurly]] KCMG (1914\u20131988)\n\nSecond Lieutenant Lord (Dan) Ranfurly, educated at [[Eton College]], joined the Nottinghamshire Yeomanry (Sherwood Rangers), 1st Cavalry Division, and was aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Neame when they were both captured in Cyrenaica in April 1941. He was taken by ship from North Africa to Naples, then by rail to Sulmona camp P.G. 78 in the Abruzzo near Rome. Neame was taken to Villa Orsini nearby. They met again when they were both transferred to Vincigliata P.G. 12 in October 1941. He adapted to prison life and handled the officers housekeeping and Red Cross parcels.<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/> As Carton de Wiart wrote, \"He was our most expert gambler, did me the good turn of teaching me to play backgammon.\"<ref name=\"Wiart195\"/> He helped with the tunnel escape plans, cleverly building and disguising the escape trap to the outside world.<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.214.</ref>\n\nHe escaped with other officers during the Italian Armistice in September 1943. On Florence railway station he exchanged his uniform for a civilian tweed jacket and a ticket collector's cap for a hundred cigarettes.<ref name=\"Ranfurly236\"/> With the help of Italian partisans and MI9 officers he reached Allied lines in Termoli by fishing boat in May 1944. His exploits in the Second World War, along with those of his wife, [[Hermione, Countess of Ranfurly|Hermione]], and valet, Whitaker, are chronicled in the memoirs of his wife, Hermione, ''[[To War with Whitaker|To War With Whitaker: The Wartime Diaries of the Countess of Ranfurly, 1939\u20131945]]''.\n\nFollowing the end of World War II, Ranfurly worked briefly in insurance at Lloyd's of London, not long after being appointed Governor of the [[Bahamas]] by [[Winston Churchill]]. Returning home in 1957, he took up farming at his Buckinghamshire estate.\n\n;Capt [[Guy Ruggles-Brise]] (1914\u20132000)\n\nGuy Edward Ruggles-Brise, educated at [[Eton College]], joined the 104th Essex Yeomanry, and in 1940 was picked for commando training in Scotland. He departed with No 7 Commando for North Africa, where he was captured after a daring raid in 1941 and transferred to Naples by ship. He was later held at P.G. 35 at [[Padula]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conscript-heroes.com/MI9-04.html |title=MI9 |work=Conscript Heroes}}</ref> near Salerno from May 1942 until June 1943. Briefly sent to P.G. 19 in [[Bologna]] before being transferred to Vincigliata in the latter days before the Italian armistice, he was among the party released by General Chiappe in September 1943. He and the others were driven to [[Firenze Campo di Marte railway station]] from where a special train took them to Arezzo.\n\nAfter months with the partisans in the Apennines he finally reached Allied lines in May 1944 with a group of officers including an old schoolfriend, 'Dan' Ranfurly.<ref>Ranfurly, p.241.</ref> After the war he became a stockbroker and bought an estate in Scotland where he enjoyed deer stalking.\n\n;Lieutenant Victor Smith, RNR\n\nLieutenant Smith, RN, of [[813 Naval Air Squadron|813 Squadron]] FAA, {{HMS|Eagle|1918|6}}, was shot down in a raid on Maritza airfield, Rhodes, on 4 September 1940. He made a forced landing on Scarpanto Island and was taken prisoner. As John Leeming, a fellow prisoner records in his book, \"One officer Lieutenant Victor Smith, of the Fleet Air Arm, was allowed to visit us regularly. He was an accountant in civil life and helped to audit the camp books. He was held in a nearby camp Fontana D'Amore,\" close to Villa Orsino in the Abrusso.<ref>Leeming, p.70.</ref> Carton de Wiart mentions Lieutenant Smith <ref>Carton de Wiart, p.191.</ref> together with Ranfurly as two officers joining his party at Sulmona railway station, before being sent to Campo P.G. 12 Vincigliata in October 1942.<ref name=\"Leeming111\"/>\n\n;Brigadier Douglas Arnold Stirling (1897\u20131958)\n\nStirling lived in Goring on Thames and served as lieutenant with the [[13th Hussars]] in World War I, serving in France (''Croix de Guerre'', 1917) and in Mesopotamia against the Turks. He married Janet Alicia Christopher in 1924 and during the 1930s was in Egypt. In World War II he commanded the 1st Armoured Brigade, initially based in the United Kingdom and then in January 1941 it was shipped to Egypt. When Greece was invaded the 1st Armoured Brigade was sent with General Maitland Wilson's unsuccessful attempt at stopping the German invasion.\n\nIn April 1941 it was evacuated to Egypt. He commanded the 11th Hussars (Prince Albert's Own) part of 7th Armoured Division in the defence of Tobruk, where he was captured by a German reconnaissance night patrol (led by Rommel) in the desert in November 1941.<ref name=\"Hargest55\"/> He was sent to Italy and arrived at the Villa Orsini, near Sulmona, joining Brigadier Hargest and others. Hargest wrote later, \"Stirling and I became great friends and I found him an excellent companion.\"<ref>Hargest, p.56.</ref> \"He was in charge of the mess catering and negotiated through an Italian officer for a goose and ingredients for a pudding for our first Christmas in captivity.\"<ref>Hargest, p.57.</ref> He was transferred by rail to Florence and Castello di Vincigliata in March 1942. He settled into camp routine, known as 'Pip',<ref name=\"Leeming111\"/> and worked on the tunnel in shifts for many months.<ref name=\"Neame297\">Neame, p.297.</ref>\n\nAt Vincigliata \"Stirling had the most desirable effect on rabbits..he ensured the success of our birthday feasts.\"<ref name=\"Wiart194\"/> \"Stirling was sent to Rome to be court-marshalled by a Fascist court, because he had written on a postcard that Italians were bastards. Stirling's powers of rhetoric were colossal; he practically persuaded the court that not only was it a term of endearment in English, but a compliment as well. He returned to Vincigliata and heard no more about it.\"<ref name=\"Wiart203\">Carton de Wiart, p.203.</ref> He was sent to the military hospital in Lucca with Leeming in April 1942 for his duodenal ulcer.<ref>Leeming, p.174.</ref> He was returned to the camp and escaped with other officers during the Italian Armistice in September 1943 <ref>Neame, p.325.</ref> and reached Allied lines in Termoli by fishing boat by May 1944. The same year he wrote to O'Connor seeking an appointment in an armoured brigade without success.\n\n;Brigadier [[Edward Joseph Todhunter]] TD, DL, (1900\u20131976)\n\nTed Todhunter was born on his family estate Kingsmoor House and Stewards farm in Great Parndon, Essex. He attended [[Rugby School]] becoming a cadet in the O.T.C division. In 1922 he was gazetted as 2nd lieutenant in the Territorial Royal Field Artillery, 104th (Essex Yeomanry) Brigade. He married Agnes Swire in 1927.\n\nPromoted to lieutenant-colonel, and during World War II, serving as a brigadier with the RHA, he was captured at Mechili in Cyrenaica, North Africa, with General Gambier-Parry in April 1941. He was initially brought to the same barracks as Carton de Wiart in Tripoli,<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.184.</ref> then by ship to Naples and to the Villa Orsini near Sulmona.

He became Vice-Colonel (Hon Brigadier) [[3rd The King's Own Hussars]], retired, he and his family lived in [[Crickhowell]], south Wales. He came from a long line of army officers, stretching back to the mid-18th century.

O'Connor's attempt over the wall had failed, with the inevitable punishment of a month's solitary confinement. Then in mid-September 1942 a tunnel was started and designed by Neame, a Royal Engineer. Various officers took it in turns to work on it in shifts of four hours per day. This was hard blistering work, but they managed to successfully evade detection, over the next six months. It was completed by 20 March 1943.<ref>Neave, p.303.</ref> The plan was for six selected officers to escape in pairs; O'Connor with Carton de Wairt, Combe with Boyd and the two New Zealanders Hargest and Miles together. Waiting for the right conditions they eventually escaped on the evening of 29 March. Neame in his book pays tribute to the support they received from fellow POW's: \"...while the remaining six officers and thirteen NCOs and men went through hours of tedious watching to ensure success. Every one, officers and men, were in it, and wildly keen for success!\"<ref name=\"Neame303\"/> In the meantime Leeming had been sent to Lucca military hospital in early April 1943 by the International Medical board, (he faked a very bad nervous breakdown) and from there by train to Lisbon where he was repatriated on the British hospital ship {{Ship|HMHS|Newfoundland}} arriving at Avonmouth April 23, 1943.\n\nThe tunnel escape proceeded brilliantly with six officers escaping (in order: Combe, Miles, Boyd, Hargest, O'Connor, Carton de Wiart) remaining undetected until the following day, enough time for the escapees to be far away. They all had their adventures some of which have been described in their books. O'Connor and Carton de Wiart (who was now aged sixty-three) were captured in the region of the Po Valley, Bologna after eight days, while Combe was caught at Milan railway station. Boyd managed to board a train and reach Como before he too was apprehended. However the New Zealanders, Reg Miles and James Hargest secured their escape by journeying by rail and then walking over the border into Switzerland. Neame received a coded letter from Miles two weeks later confirming their safe arrival.<ref name=\"Neame308\"/>\nAs a punishment, after the discovery of the tunnel two of the officers' batmen (Pickford and Prewett) were transferred to another camp. Eventually the four captured officers were returned to the camp for thirty days solitary. As Carton de Wiart comments in his book, \"I learnt also that twenty-four hours elapsed before our exit hole had been discovered, and then only by Gussie's dog (Mickey, a cross St Bernard & white sheep-dog). Gussie (as Lieutenant Agosto Ricciardi their previous Italian guard and Gaoler was known) had left it behind when he had been sent away, but the dog proved too intimate a friend to us, and had unwittingly given away our secret.\"<ref name=\"Wiart222\"/>\nA new camp commander was appointed and the garrison was increased by fifty-percent \u2013 there were now some hundred infantry and Carabinieri to guard eleven officers and fourteen other ranks. The final and successful escape was not made until after the Italian surrender in September 1943. However, in the preceding months, the inmates of the castle had through MI9 contacts continued to receive parcels with much concealed escape material including over 20,000 lire in Italian money, various maps, compasses and some clothing material.<ref>Neame, p.312.</ref>\n\nCampo 12 received a Red Cross visit in December 1942; and reported, \"This camp for British Generals continues to be satisfactory. A few minor complaints were brought forward and settled on the spot. No British chaplain has yet visited the camp.\"<ref>''POW'' magazine, April 1943.</ref> A visit three months later describes the camp as \"...as being like a country house. The officers spend much of their time working in the garden.\"<ref>''POW'' magazine, June 1943.</ref>\n\nThen in mid-August Carton de Wiart was selected by the Italians and taken from Vincigliata to Rome as part of their proposed armistice negotiations with the allies. (He was a friend of the Italian Crown Princess \u2013 and they hoped this connection would help). He met with the Italian Deputy Chief of Staff General Zanussi,<ref>Carton de Wiart, p.226.</ref> and after a few days they travelled on to neutral Lisbon. By the end of the month he was flown to England a free man.\n\n;The Italian Armistice 1943\n\nThen on 8 September 1943, the captain in charge of Castello di Vincigliata announced that the Italian government had arranged an armistice.<ref>Ranfurly, p.235.</ref> At nine in the morning two days later all the remaining prisoners of war were sent to Florence railway station as the Germans were approaching. General Chiappe, a sympathetic Italian officer arranged a special train for them to Arezzo some sixty miles south. Using the smuggled Lire currency they bought various civilian clothes from local Italians at the railway station. Suitably attired Neame, O'Connor, with nine other officers, together with fourteen other ranks under CQMS Morgan set off to evade capture.<ref>Neave, p.314.</ref> After arriving in Arezzo they discovered much confusion and a general air of despondency with many Italian officials. So the officers decided it was safer to move away the same evening with all the escaping soldiers. They travelled some forty miles northward to the Hospice of Camadoli in the Apennine Mountains. They stayed four days. Some officers climbed another thousand feet higher to the Monastery in Eremo where the Prior-General of the Camaldolese Order resided. He was pro-British \u2013 hated the fascists and detailed one of the brothers Don Leoni to act as special liaison between the British escaped prisoners.<ref>Neave, p.316.</ref> Links with MI9 were re-established and money provided to help with food and shelter in an already impoverished Italian countryside. There was not enough food in the local village, so the escaping group was dispersed in small parties over a district of ten miles.\nItaly was still politically divided and word reached the Prior-General that an Italian fascist had betrayed the presence of the escaping prisoners and for their safety moved them from the Monastery to hide and live amongst the Italians in the mountain villages of Segeteina and Strabatenza some ten miles away. In September and October the soldiers helped the peasants with their manual work such as digging, fetching water and husking maize. O'Connor or Neame would make regular visits to check on the soldiers' welfare and give them any news.<ref>Neave, p.318.</ref> During this time Neame and O'Connor (who had learnt Italian whilst a prisoner) had collected another twenty or so British soldiers that had also escaped after the armistice and were wandering the mountains. As a precaution the officers built brushwood hides in the surrounding woods, to sleep overnight as there were frequent alarms about spies and impending searches. Then on the morning of 29 October, 120 Germans arrived by Italian motor-lorries and surrounded the village to search it.<ref>Neave, p.325.</ref> They had been betrayed. The approaching Germans were seen by the officers from higher up the mountains and with help from one of the guides in the village escaped. The NCO's and other soldiers were not so lucky. After two months freedom they were again prisoners of war \u2013 this time by the Germans. After a series of escapades, by Christmas 1943 Neame, O'Connor and Boyd arrived at Termoli by fishing boat. A further five brigadiers and eleven other escapers arrived the same way by mid-May 1944.<ref name=\"Foot240\">Foot, p.240.</ref>\n\n====MI9 escape & evasion====\nAmongst the many clandestine British secret services during World War II was a department known as [[MI9]]. (It was set up under Norman Crockatt, an ex-infantry major who earned the DSO and MC in World War I). It worked to train the armed forces in escape and evasion. Evasion lines were set up in occupied countries. MI9 exchanged coded letters with prisoner of war camps, and secretively sent in money, maps, clothes and many other useful tools. What the Italians never knew was that O'Connor had one of \"Winterbottom's codes\"<ref>Foot, p.148.</ref> and was therefore secretively in touch with London, through coded letters sent to fictitious addresses in England.<ref>Neame, pp.310\u2013311.</ref>\n\n====Aftermath====\n* John Leeming was the first officer to reach England from the prison camp, in April 1943. However, he had been medically repatriated by feigning paranoia.\n* Carton de Wiart reached England in August 1943, having been involved in the Italian Armistice. He later reflected in his book ''Happy Odyssey'' (p.&nbsp;184), after capture in North Africa, \"I met Captain Camino, who had lived in England many years and afterwards proved himself most helpful to many British prisoners of war.

In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself. A lack of authenticity is considered in existentialism to be ''[[bad faith (existentialism)|bad faith]]''.<ref>[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/authenticity/ Authenticity (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The call of authenticity resonates with the famous instruction by the [[Pythia|Oracle of Delphi]], \u201c[[Know thyself]].\u201d But authenticity extends this message: \"Don\u2019t merely know thyself \u2013 be thyself.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself!

For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet \"[[poseur]]\".<ref name=\"indiecult2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

For this reason among others, authenticity is often \"at the limits\" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.<ref>{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-415-11946-7 }}</ref> Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures\u2014the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.\n\nSartre is concerned also with the \"[[vertiginous]]\" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. \"Panegyric Upon Abraham\" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-13-158591-1 }}</ref>\n\nAuthenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees \u201cboth the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people\u2019s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. \u201c<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Kristoffer Holt, \u201cAuthentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,\u201d Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)</ref> His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as \u201clevelling.\u201d Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by \u201cfacing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, \u201cOne must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith. This is how Kierkegaard described authenticity in his 1850 book Practice in Christianity: {{Quotation|\"Therefore, it is a risk to preach, for as I go up into that holy place-whether the church is packed or as good as empty, whether I myself am aware of it or not, I have one listener more than can be seen, an invisible listener, God in heaven, whom I certainly cannot see but who truly can see me. .... Truly it is a risk to preach! Most people no doubt have the idea that to step out on the stage as an actor, to venture into the danger of having all eyes focused on one, is something that requires courage. Yet in one sense this danger, like everything on the stage, is an illusion, because the actor, of course, is personally outside it all; his task is precisely to deceive, to dissemble, to represent someone else, and to reproduce accurately someone else's words. The proclaimer of Christian truth, on the other hand, steps forward into a place where, even if the eyes of all are not focused on him, the eye of an omnicient one is. His task is: to be himself, and in a setting, God's house, which, all eyes and ears, requires only one thing of him-that he should be himself, be true. That he should be true, that is, that he himself should be what he proclaims, or at least strive to be that, or at least be honest enough to confess about himself that he is not that. ... How risky it is to be the I who preaches, the one speaking, an I who by preaching and as he preaches commits himself unconditionally, displays his life so that, if possible, one could look directly into his soul-to be this I, that is risky! Soren Kierkegaard, Practice in Christianity 1850, Hong p. 234-235}}\n\nNietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues \u201con account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\">Nietzsche, F.W., & Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.</ref> Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls \u201cherding animal morality,\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\"/> if he is to find authenticity. To \u201cstand alone\u201d and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be \u201cstrong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert \u2018eternal valuations.\u2019\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\"/> One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche\u2019s existential philosophies is \u201cthe responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one\u2019s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.\n\nAccording to Abulof, authenticity's calling \u2013 being true to oneself \u2013 deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the \"self\": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes \u201cdetermine your destiny!\u201d urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, \u201cHow am I not myself?\u201d and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to \u201cbad faith.\u201d Otherwise, my choices \u2013 whatever they might be \u2013 constitute me.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530\u2013532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}</ref>\n\n====Existential journalism====\n[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are \u201cgladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1995\">Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.</ref> Journalists are restricted by \u201cinstitutional red tape\u201d and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the \u201cred tape\u201d because their work will be published.\n\nActively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that \u201cindividual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, \u201cgrows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1995\"/>\n\n====Criticisms====\nPhilosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.<ref>Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.</ref>\n\n===Erich Fromm===\nA very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]<ref>Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar & Rinehart 1941 (also published as \"Fear of Freedom\" Routledge UK 1942)</ref> in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition \u2013 the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the \"absolute freedom\" of Sartre \u2013 as \"the illusion of individuality\",<ref>Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7</ref> as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.\n\n===Other perspectives===\nThose who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as \"the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise.\"<ref>Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself \"Dare to be yourself\"]. ''Psychology Today''.</ref>\n\nWhile authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to \"the good life,\" it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.\n\n==History==\nSecular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\". In aesthetics, \"[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]\" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of \"authenticity\" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.<ref>Wood, A.

Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's \u201ccold\u201d reason.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}</ref> In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a \"canon\" of existentialist writers which include [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.\n\nThe call of, and for, authenticity - \"be thyself!\" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&year_start=1800&year_end=2018&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: \"in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Cultural activities==\nStaged authenticity refers to information or performances presented by tourism professionals and locals. It is the way that locals perceive what tourists want to see and experience. \n\nDue to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.<ref>AJ Giannini (2010). \"Semiotic and semantic implications of \"authenticity\"\". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611\u2013612.</ref> For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more \"authentic\" relationship with the natural world.\n\nSome writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a \"textbook\" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of \"[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]\" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.\n[[File:Das musste ja so kommen..!.jpg|thumb|150px|The punk subculture classifies members as \"poseurs\" if they are deemed to not understand or respect the subculture's values.]]\nIndividuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of \"[[selling out]],\" used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.\n\n===In music===\n{{See also|Rockism|Punk ideologies}}\n\nThe concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet \"[[poseur]]\".<ref name=\"indiecult2006\"/> \"Poseur\" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. \"The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways\", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.<ref>Weinstein, Deena.

In existentialism, authenticity is the degree to which an individual's actions are congruent with their beliefs and desires, despite external pressures; the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces, pressures, and influences which are very different from, and other than, itself.

For instance, the philosophers [[Jean Paul Sartre]] and [[Theodor Adorno]] had opposing views regarding jazz, with Sartre considering it authentic and Adorno inauthentic. The concept of authenticity is often aired in  musical subcultures, such as [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], where a purported lack of authenticity is commonly labeled with the epithet \"[[poseur]]\".<ref name=\"indiecult2006\">{{cite web|url=http://www.indiecult.com/2006-04/television-personalities-my-dark-places |title=Homeward Bound.

For this reason among others, authenticity is often \"at the limits\" of language; it is described as the negative space around inauthenticity, with reference to examples of inauthentic living.<ref>{{cite book | last = Golomb | first = Jacob | title = In Search of Authenticity | publisher = Routledge | year = 1995 | location = London and New York | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-415-11946-7 }}</ref> Sartre's novels are perhaps the easiest access to this mode of describing authenticity: they often contain characters and [[antihero]]es who base their actions on external pressures\u2014the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one's own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. His work also includes characters who do not understand their own reasons for acting, or who ignore crucial facts about their own lives in order to avoid uncomfortable truths; this connects his work with the philosophical tradition.\n\nSartre is concerned also with the \"[[vertiginous]]\" experience of absolute freedom. In Sartre's view, this experience, necessary for the state of authenticity, can be so unpleasant that it leads people to inauthentic ways of living. Typically, authenticity is seen as a very general concept, not attached to any particular political or aesthetic ideology. This is a necessary aspect of authenticity: because it concerns a person's ''relation'' with the world, it cannot be arrived at by simply repeating a set of actions or taking up a set of positions. In this manner, authenticity is connected with creativity: the impetus to action must arise from the person in question, and not be externally imposed. Heidegger takes this notion to the extreme, by speaking in very abstract terms about modes of living (his terminology was adopted and simplified by Sartre in his philosophical works). Kierkegaard's work (e.g. \"Panegyric Upon Abraham\" from ''[[Fear and Trembling]]'') often focuses on biblical stories which are not directly imitable. Sartre, as has been noted above, focused on inauthentic existence as a way to avoid the paradoxical problem of appearing to provide prescriptions for a mode of living that rejects external dictation.<ref>{{cite book | last = Baird | first = Forrest E. | authorlink = |author2= Walter Kaufmann | title = From Plato to Derrida | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | year = 2008 | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-13-158591-1 }}</ref>\n\nAuthenticity, according to Kierkegaard, is reliant on an individual finding authentic faith and becoming true to oneself. Kierkegaard develops the idea that news media and the bourgeois church-Christianity present challenges for an individual in society trying to live authentically. Kierkegaard thus sees \u201cboth the media and the church as intervening agencies, blocking people\u2019s way to true experiences, authenticity, and God. \u201c<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Kristoffer Holt, \u201cAuthentic Journalism? A Critical Discussion about Existential Authenticity in Journalism Ethics,\u201d Journal of Mass Media Ethics 27 (2012)</ref> His conviction lies with the idea that mass-culture creates a loss of individual significance, which he refers to as \u201clevelling.\u201d Kierkegaard views the media as supporting a society that does not form its own opinions but utilizes the opinions constructed by the news. Similarly, he interprets religion as a tradition that is passively accepted by individuals, without the inclusion of authentic thought. Kierkegaard believes that authentic faith can be achieved by \u201cfacing reality, making a choice and then passionately sticking with it.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> The goal of Kierkegaard's existentialist philosophy is to show that, in order to achieve authenticity, one must face reality and form his own opinions of existence. So as not to be discouraged by levelling, Kierkegaard suggests, \u201cOne must make an active choice to surrender to something that goes beyond comprehension, a leap of faith into the religious.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> Even if one does not want to put forth the effort of developing his own views, he must do so in the quest for authentic faith. This is how Kierkegaard described authenticity in his 1850 book Practice in Christianity: {{Quotation|\"Therefore, it is a risk to preach, for as I go up into that holy place-whether the church is packed or as good as empty, whether I myself am aware of it or not, I have one listener more than can be seen, an invisible listener, God in heaven, whom I certainly cannot see but who truly can see me. .... Truly it is a risk to preach! Most people no doubt have the idea that to step out on the stage as an actor, to venture into the danger of having all eyes focused on one, is something that requires courage. Yet in one sense this danger, like everything on the stage, is an illusion, because the actor, of course, is personally outside it all; his task is precisely to deceive, to dissemble, to represent someone else, and to reproduce accurately someone else's words. The proclaimer of Christian truth, on the other hand, steps forward into a place where, even if the eyes of all are not focused on him, the eye of an omnicient one is. His task is: to be himself, and in a setting, God's house, which, all eyes and ears, requires only one thing of him-that he should be himself, be true. That he should be true, that is, that he himself should be what he proclaims, or at least strive to be that, or at least be honest enough to confess about himself that he is not that. ... How risky it is to be the I who preaches, the one speaking, an I who by preaching and as he preaches commits himself unconditionally, displays his life so that, if possible, one could look directly into his soul-to be this I, that is risky! Soren Kierkegaard, Practice in Christianity 1850, Hong p. 234-235}}\n\nNietzsche's view of authenticity is an atheist interpretation of Kierkegaard. He rejects the role of religion in finding authenticity because he believes in finding truth without the use of virtues. Nietzsche believes of the authentic man as the following: Someone who elevates himself over others in order to transcend the limits of conventional morality in an attempt to decide for oneself about [[good and evil]], without regard for the virtues \u201con account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\">Nietzsche, F.W., & Zimmern, H. (1997). Beyond good and evil: Prelude to a philosophy of the future. Mineola, NY: Dover.</ref> Nietzsche rejects the idea of religious virtues due to the lack of questioning by the individual. One must avoid what he calls \u201cherding animal morality,\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\"/> if he is to find authenticity. To \u201cstand alone\u201d and avoid religiously constructed principles, it is essential to be \u201cstrong and original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvaluate and invert \u2018eternal valuations.\u2019\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1997\"/> One must be a free thinker and theorize views outside of their predilections. The commonality of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche\u2019s existential philosophies is \u201cthe responsibilities they place on the individual to take active part in the shaping of one\u2019s beliefs and then to be willing to act on that belief.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> For Nietzsche, the secular mentality is a form of weakness and, for authenticity to be achieved, one must truly transcend conventional morality.\n\nAccording to Abulof, authenticity's calling \u2013 being true to oneself \u2013 deceivingly conceals the deep chasms between two divergent interpretations of the \"self\": essentialist and existentialist. Essentialist authenticity demands we find and follow our preordained destiny, our inborn core. Conversely, existentialist authenticity prescribes \u201cdetermine your destiny!\u201d urging people to become aware of their freedom to choose their own path, which may, but need not, join that of others. While essentialists search for signs of self-betrayals, existentialists defiantly ask, \u201cHow am I not myself?\u201d and answer: only when I forget my freedom, and surrender to \u201cbad faith.\u201d Otherwise, my choices \u2013 whatever they might be \u2013 constitute me.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Abulof|first=Uriel|date=2017-12-01|title=Be Yourself! How Am I Not myself?|journal=Society|language=en|volume=54|issue=6|pages=530\u2013532|doi=10.1007/s12115-017-0183-0|issn=0147-2011}}</ref>\n\n====Existential journalism====\n[[List of existentialists|Existential philosophers]] like [[Kierkegaard]], [[Nietzsche]], and [[Heidegger]] investigate the existential-ontological significance of societally constructed norms to decipher authenticity. For an existential journalist, this aversion to, and turning away from, an unquestioning acceptance of norms contributes to the production of an authentic work. [[J. C. Merrill|Merrill]] believes that authentic journalism can exist if the journalist is true to one's self and rejects conformism. There are traditions that exist in media and news outlets that prevent journalists from achieving authenticity. Like Kierkegaard's view of media and church, Merrill believes that journalists are \u201cgladly sacrificing individual authenticity to adapt nicely to the highly regimented, [[depersonalized]] corporate structure.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1995\">Merril, J.C. (1995). Existential Journalism (rev. ed.) Ames, IA: Iowa State University Press.</ref> Journalists are restricted by \u201cinstitutional red tape\u201d and, thus, cannot achieve authenticity. It is beneficial for journalists to adhere to the \u201cred tape\u201d because their work will be published.\n\nActively shaping one's own belief and then acting upon that belief is a laborious task. A journalist that hesitates in writing a story because it is not within the norm is unable to achieve authenticity because of the notion that following the norm is more valuable than being authentic. The contention is, however, that \u201cindividual freedom and courage to act is more valuable than collective adherence to journalistic codes of conduct.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/> As journalists make conscious decisions to write authentically, they are able to contribute more value in their work. The consequence of authentic writing is positive and ensures that the journalist, according to Merrill, \u201cgrows, matures, creates himself, and projects himself into the future.\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1995\"/>\n\n====Criticisms====\nPhilosopher [[Jacob Golomb]] argues that the existentialist notion of authenticity is incompatible with a morality that values all persons.<ref>Golomb, Jacob (1995). ''In Search of Authenticity: From Kierkegaard to Camus''. London: Routledge.</ref>\n\n===Erich Fromm===\nA very different definition of authenticity was proposed by [[Erich Fromm]]<ref>Fromm. E., Escape from Freedom, Farrar & Rinehart 1941 (also published as \"Fear of Freedom\" Routledge UK 1942)</ref> in the mid-1900s. He considered behavior of any kind, even that wholly in accord with societal mores, to be authentic if it results from personal understanding and approval of its drives and origins, rather than merely from conformity with the received wisdom of the society.  Thus a Frommean authentic may behave consistently in a manner that accords with cultural norms, for the reason that those norms appear on consideration to be appropriate, rather than simply in the interest of conforming with current norms. Fromm thus considers authenticity to be a positive outcome of enlightened and informed motivation rather than a negative outcome of rejection of the expectations of others. He described the latter condition \u2013 the drive primarily to escape external restraints typified by the \"absolute freedom\" of Sartre \u2013 as \"the illusion of individuality\",<ref>Fromm E., Fear of Freedom, ch. 7</ref> as opposed to the genuine individuality that results from authentic living.\n\n===Other perspectives===\nThose who advocate [[Reform movement|social reform]] value the study of authenticity since it can provide a radical manifesto and an overview of the shortcomings of social structures. Michael Kernis and Brian Goldman defined authenticity as \"the unimpeded operation of one's true or core self in one's daily enterprise.\"<ref>Wright, Karen (May 01, 2008). [http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200804/dare-be-yourself \"Dare to be yourself\"]. ''Psychology Today''.</ref>\n\nWhile authenticity may be a goal intrinsic to \"the good life,\" it is often a difficult state to actually achieve, due in part to social pressures to live inauthentically and in part to a person's own character. It is also described as a revelatory state, where one perceives oneself, other people, and sometimes even things, in a radically new way. Some writers argue that authenticity also requires self-knowledge, and that it alters a person's relationships with other people. Authenticity also carries with it its own set of moral obligations, which often exist regardless of race, gender and class. The notion of authenticity also fits into [[utopia]]n ideology, which requires authenticity among its citizens to exist, or which claims that such a condition would remove physical and economic barriers to pursuing authenticity.\n\n==History==\nSecular and religious notions of authenticity have coexisted for centuries under different guises; perhaps the earliest account of authenticity that remains popular is [[Socrates]]' admonition that \"the unexamined life is not worth living\". In aesthetics, \"[[Authenticity in art|authenticity]]\" describes the perception of art as faithful to the artist's self, rather than conforming to external values such as historical tradition, or commercial worth.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} A common definition of \"authenticity\" in [[psychology]] refers to the attempt to live one's life according to the needs of one's inner being, rather than the demands of society or one's early conditioning.<ref>Wood, A.

Romanticists since the late 18th century prescribed intuition, emotion and a return to nature as a necessary corrective, even an antidote, to Enlightenment's \u201ccold\u201d reason.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Creative Imagination.|last=James.|first=Engell|date=1980|publisher=HUP|isbn=9780674333253|location=Cambridge|oclc=935280039}}</ref> In the twentieth century, Anglo-American discussions of authenticity often center around the writings of a few key figures associated with [[existentialism|existentialist philosophy]], where the term originated; because most of these writers wrote in languages other than English, the process of translating and anthologizing has had a strong impact on the debate. [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] might be credited with creating a \"canon\" of existentialist writers which include [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. For these writers, the [[consciousness|conscious]] [[Philosophy of self|self]] is seen as coming to terms with being in a material world and with encountering external forces and influences which are very different from itself; authenticity is one way in which the self acts and changes in response to these pressures.\n\nThe call of, and for, authenticity - \"be thyself!\" - has pervaded modern thought and culture. A [https://books.google.com/ngrams/interactive_chart?content=be+yourself&year_start=1800&year_end=2018&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cbe%20yourself%3B%2Cc0 Google ngram (1800-2008)] indicates the dramatic rise, since the 1960s, in relative frequency of this modern command: \"in books, Hollywood films, commercials, and daily conversations, we advise, even order: be yourself!\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Cultural activities==\nStaged authenticity refers to information or performances presented by tourism professionals and locals. It is the way that locals perceive what tourists want to see and experience. \n\nDue to different groups' and individual's different experiences, views of authenticity regarding cultural activities vary widely and often differ between groups and individuals.<ref>AJ Giannini (2010). \"Semiotic and semantic implications of \"authenticity\"\". ''Psychological Reports'' '''106''' (2): 611\u2013612.</ref> For Sartre, [[jazz]] music was a representation of freedom; this may have been in part because jazz was associated with [[African American]] culture, and was thus in opposition to Western culture generally, which Sartre considered hopelessly inauthentic. [[Theodor Adorno]], however, another writer and philosopher concerned with the notion of authenticity, despised jazz music because he saw it as a false representation that could give the appearance of authenticity but that was as much bound up in concerns with appearance and audience as many other forms of art. Heidegger in his later life associated authenticity with non-technological modes of existence, seeing technology as distorting a more \"authentic\" relationship with the natural world.\n\nSome writers on authenticity in the twentieth century considered the predominant [[Norm (social)|cultural norms]] to be inauthentic; not only because they were seen as forced on people, but also because, in themselves, they required people to behave inauthentically towards their own desires, obscuring true reasons for acting. [[Advertising]], in as much as it attempted to give people a reason for doing something that they did not already possess, was a \"textbook\" example of how Western culture distorted the individual for external reasons. Race relations are seen as another limit on authenticity, as they demand that the self engage with others on the basis of external attributes. An early example of the connection between inauthenticity and capitalism was made by [[Karl Marx]], whose notion of \"[[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]\" can be linked to the later discourse on the nature of inauthenticity.\n[[File:Das musste ja so kommen..!.jpg|thumb|150px|The punk subculture classifies members as \"poseurs\" if they are deemed to not understand or respect the subculture's values.]]\nIndividuals concerned with living authentically have often led unusual lives that opposed cultural norms; the rise of the [[counter-culture]] in the 1960s in Europe and America was seen by many as a new opportunity to live an authentic existence. Many, however, have pointed out that [[anti-authoritarianism]] and eccentricity does not necessarily constitute an authentic state of being. The connection of the violation of cultural norms to authenticity, however, is strong and real{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, and continues today: among artists who explicitly violate the conventions of their profession, for example. The connection of inauthenticity to [[capitalism]] is contained in the notion of \"[[selling out]],\" used to describe an artist whose work has become inauthentic after achieving commercial success and thus becoming to an extent integrated into an inauthentic system.\n\n===In music===\n{{See also|Rockism|Punk ideologies}}\n\nThe concept of authenticity is often raised in the [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] musical subcultures, in which people or bands are criticized for their purported lack of authenticity by being labeled with the epithet \"[[poseur]]\".<ref name=\"indiecult2006\"/> \"Poseur\" is used to refer to a person (or band) who copies the dress, speech, and/or mannerisms of a group or subculture, generally for attaining acceptability within the group, yet who is deemed not to share or understand the values or philosophy of the subculture. \"The code of authenticity, which is central to the [[heavy metal subculture]], is demonstrated in many ways\", such as through clothing, the use of an emotional singing voice and having serious themes in the songs.<ref>Weinstein, Deena.

Breuil was accompanied by Denis Peyrony (curator of the [[Les eyzies|Prehistory Museum]] at [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil|Les Eyzies]]), Jean Bouyssonie and Dr Cheynier.\n\nThe cave complex was opened to the public on 14 July 1948, and initial archaeological investigations began a year later, focusing on the Shaft. By 1955, [[carbon dioxide]], heat, humidity, and other contaminants produced by 1,200 visitors per day had visibly damaged the paintings. As air condition deteriorated, fungi and [[lichen]] increasingly infested the walls. Consequently, the cave was closed to the public in 1963, the paintings were restored to their original state, and a monitoring system on a daily basis was introduced.\n\n===Replicas===\nConservation problems in the original cave have made the creation of replicas more important.\n\n====Lascaux II====\n''Lascaux II'', an exact copy of the ''Great Hall of the Bulls'' and the ''Painted Gallery'' was displayed at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris, before being displayed from 1983 in the cave's vicinity (about 200&nbsp;m away from the original cave), a compromise and attempt to present an impression of the paintings' scale and composition for the public without harming the originals.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"cave_art\" /> A full range of Lascaux's parietal art is presented a few kilometres from the site at the ''Centre of Prehistoric Art'', Le Parc du Thot, where there are also live animals representing [[Prehistoric animals|ice-age fauna]].<ref>[http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/dordogne/au-thot-24-retour-loups-prehistoriques-1259593.html le retour des loups \u201cpr\u00e9historiques\u201d]</ref>\n\nThe paintings for this site were duplicated with the same type of materials as [[iron oxide]], [[charcoal]] and [[ochre]] which were believed to be used 19 thousand years ago.<ref name=\"dailytelegraph.com.au\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/lascaux-cave-170323|title=The Beautiful and Famous Lascaux Cave|last=Quotations|first=K.

Before joining the [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne River]] near Limeuil, the V\u00e9z\u00e8re flows in a south-westerly direction. At its centre point, the river's course is marked by a series of meanders flanked by high limestone cliffs that determine the landscape. Upstream from this steep-sloped relief, near [[Montignac, Dordogne|Montignac]] and in the vicinity of Lascaux, the contours of the land soften considerably; the valley floor widens, and the banks of the river lose their steepness.\n\nThe Lascaux valley is located some distance from the major concentrations of decorated caves and inhabited sites, most of which were discovered further downstream. In the environs of the village of Eyzies-de-Tayac Sireuil, there are no fewer than 37 decorated caves and shelters, as well as an even greater number of habitation sites from the Upper Paleolithic, located in the open, beneath a sheltering overhang, or at the entrance to one of the area's [[karst]] cavities. This is the highest concentration in Europe.\n\n== Parietal representation ==\nThe Hall of the Bulls, presents the most spectacular composition of Lascaux. Its calcite walls are not suitable for engraving, so it is only decorated with paintings, often of impressive dimensions: some are up to five metres long.\n\nTwo rows of [[aurochs]] face each other, two on one side and three on the other. The two aurochs on the north side are accompanied by about ten [[horse]]s and a large enigmatic animal, with two straight lines on its forehead that earned it the nickname \"unicorn\". On the south side, three large aurochs are next to three smaller ones, painted red, as well as six small deer and the only bear in the cave, superimposed on the belly of an aurochs and difficult to read.\n\nThe Axial Diverticulum is also decorated with cattle and horses accompanied by deer and ibex. A drawing of a fleeing horse was brushed with manganese pencil 2.50 metres above the ground. Some animals are painted on the ceiling and seem to roll from one wall to the other. These representations, which required the use of scaffolding, are intertwined with many signs (sticks, dots and rectangular signs).\n\nThe Passage has a highly degraded decoration, notably through air circulation.\n\nThe Nave has four groups of figures: the Empreinte panel, the Black Cow panel, the Deer swimming panel and the Crossed Buffalo panel. These works are accompanied by many enigmatic geometric signs, including coloured checkers that H. Breuil called \"coats of arms\".\n\nThe Feline Diverticulum owes its name to a group of felines, one of which seems to urinate to mark its territory. Very difficult to access, one can see there engravings of wild animals of a rather naive style. There are also other animals associated with signs, including a representation of a horse seen from the front, exceptional in Paleolithic art where animals are generally represented in profiles or from a \"twisted perspective\".\n\nThe apse contains more than a thousand engravings, some of which are superimposed on paintings, corresponding to animals and signs. There is the only reindeer represented in Lascaux.\n\nThe Well presents the most enigmatic scene of Lascaux: an ithyphallic (erect sex) man with a bird's head seems to fall, perhaps knocked down by a buffalo gutted by a saga; at his side is represented an elongated object surmounted by a bird, perhaps a propeller; on the left a rhinoceros moves away. A horse is also present on the opposite wall. Two groups of signs are to be noted in this composition:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 between man and rhinos, three pairs of digitized punctuation marks found at the bottom of the Cat Diverticulum, in the most remote part of the cave;\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 under man and bison, a complex barbed wire sign that can be found almost identically on other walls of the cave, but also on paddle points and on the sandstone lamp found nearby.\n\n==Images==\n[[File:Lascaux, Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Megaloceros]]'' with line of dots]]\nThe cave contains nearly 6,000 figures, which can be grouped into three main categories: animals, human figures, and abstract signs.

Many images are too faint to discern, and others have deteriorated entirely.\n\nOver 900 can be identified as animals, and 605 of these have been precisely identified. Out of these images, there are 364 paintings of [[Equus (genus)|equines]] as well as 90 paintings of [[Deer|stags]]. Also represented are cattle and bison, each representing 4 to 5% of the images.

The four black bulls, or [[aurochs]], are the dominant figures among the 36 animals represented here. One of the bulls is {{convert|5.2|m}} long, the largest animal discovered so far in cave art. Additionally, the bulls appear to be in motion.<ref name=curtis/>\n\nA painting referred to as \"The Crossed Bison\", found in the chamber called the Nave, is often submitted as an example of the skill of the Paleolithic cave painters. The crossed hind legs create the illusion that one bison is closer to the viewer than the other. This visual depth in the scene demonstrates a primitive form of perspective which was particularly advanced for the time.\n\n===Interpretation===\nThe interpretation of [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Palaeolithic Art]] is problematic, as it can be influenced by our own prejudices and beliefs. Some anthropologists and art historians theorize the paintings could be an account of past hunting success, or could represent a mystical ritual in order to improve future hunting endeavors. The latter theory is supported by the overlapping images of one group of animals in the same cave location as another group of animals, suggesting that one area of the cave was more successful for predicting a plentiful hunting excursion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.karstworlds.com/2010/12/lascaux-cave-history.html|title=Lascaux cave: History|website=www.karstworlds.com|language=en|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nApplying the iconographic method of analysis to the Lascaux paintings (studying position, direction and size of the figures; organization of the composition; painting technique; distribution of the color planes; research of the image center), Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Guiot-Houdart attempted to comprehend the symbolic function of the animals, to identify the theme of each image and finally to reconstitute the canvas of the myth illustrated on the rock walls.<ref>{{cite book|first=Th\u00e9r\u00e8se|last=Guiot-Houdart|title=Lascaux et les mythes|location=P\u00e9rigueux|year=2004|publisher=Pilote 24|language=French|isbn=2-912347-39-4}}</ref>{{elucidate|reason=her conclusions?|date=December 2012}}\n[[Image:Lascaux2.jpg|thumb|left|Cave painting of a [[Dun gene|dun]] horse ([[Equus (genus)|equine]]) at Lascaux]]\nJulien d'Huy and Jean-Lo\u00efc Le Quellec showed that certain angular or barbed signs of Lascaux may be analysed as \"weapon\" or \"wounds\".

At Lascaux, bison, aurochs and ibex are not represented side by side. Conversely, one can note a bison-horses-lions system and an aurochs-horses-deer-bears system, these animals being frequently associated.<ref>Denis Tauxe (2007).\"L\u2019organisation symbolique du dispositif pari\u00e9tal de la grotte de Lascaux\", ''Pr\u00e9histoire du Sud-Ouest'', 15: 177-266</ref> Such a distribution may show the relationship between the species pictured and their environmental conditions. Aurochs and bison fight one against the other, and horses and deer are very social with other animals. Bison and lions live in open plains areas; aurochs, deer and bears are associated with forests and marshes; ibex habitat is rocky areas, and horses are highly adaptive for all these areas. The Lascaux paintings' disposition may be explained by a belief in the real life of the pictured species, wherein the artists tried to respect their real environmental conditions.<ref>Julien d'Huy (2011). \"[https://independent.academia.edu/JuliendHuy/Papers/1304532/La_distribution_des_animaux_a_Lascaux_refleterait_leur_distribution_naturelle._-_Bulletin_de_la_Societe_Historique_et_Archeologique_du_Perigord_CXXXVIII_4_2011_493-502 La distribution des animaux \u00e0 Lascaux refl\u00e8terait leur distribution naturelle]\", ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Historique et Arch\u00e9ologique du P\u00e9rigord'' CXXXVIII, 493-502</ref>\n\nLess known is the image area called the ''Abside'' (Apse), a roundish, semi-spherical chamber similar to an [[apse]] in a Romanesque basilica.

This model is based on a masculine/feminine duality \u2013 which can be particularly observed in the bison/horse and aurochs/horse pairs \u2013 identifiable in both the signs and the animal representations. He also defined an ongoing evolution through four consecutive styles, from the Aurignacian to the Late Magdalenian. Andr\u00e9 Leroi-Gourhan did not publish a detailed analysis of the cave's figures. In his work Pr\u00e9histoire de l\u2019art occidental, published in 1965, he nonetheless put forward an analysis of certain signs and applied his explanatory model to the understanding of other decorated caves.\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:Lascaux operations room.jpg|thumb|upright|The conservation room at Lascaux]]\nThe opening of Lascaux Cave after World War II changed the cave environment. The exhalations of 1,200 visitors per day, presence of light, and changes in air circulation have created a number of problems. Lichens and crystals began to appear on the walls in the late 1950s, leading to closure of the caves in 1963. This led to restriction of access to the real caves to a few visitors every week, and the creation of a replica cave for visitors to Lascaux. In 2001, the authorities in charge of Lascaux changed the air conditioning system which resulted in regulation of the temperature and humidity. When the system had been established, an infestation of ''[[Fusarium solani]]'', a white [[Mold (fungus)|mold]], began spreading rapidly across the cave ceiling and walls.<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Invasion of the French Paleolithic painted cave of Lascaux by members of the Fusarium solani species complex\n | journal = Mycologia | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | year = 2007 | pages = 526\u2013533\n | doi = 10.3852/mycologia.99.4.526\n |author1=Jo\u00eblle Dupont |author2=Claire Jacquet |author3=Bruno Denneti\u00e8re |author4=Sandrine Lacoste | pmid = 18065003\n}}</ref> The mold is considered to have been present in the cave soil and exposed by the work of tradesmen, leading to the spread of the fungus which was treated with [[quicklime]]. In 2007, a new fungus, which has created grey and black blemishes, began spreading in the real cave.\n\nOrganized through the initiative of the French Ministry of Culture, an international symposium titled \"Lascaux and Preservation Issues in Subterranean Environments\" was held in Paris on 26 and 27 February 2009, under the chairmanship of Jean Clottes. It brought together nearly three hundred participants from seventeen countries with the goal of confronting research and interventions conducted in Lascaux Cave since 2001 with the experiences gained in other countries in the domain of preservation in subterranean environments.<ref>At the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]] in Japan, and [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] in Spain, for example.</ref> The proceedings of this symposium were published in 2011. Seventy-four specialists in fields as varied as biology, biochemistry, botany, hydrology, climatology, geology, fluid mechanics, archaeology, anthropology, restoration and conservation, from numerous countries (France, United States, Portugal, Spain, Japan, and others) contributed to this publication.<ref>Coye, N. dir.

They returned along with the [[Henri Breuil|Abb\u00e9 Henri Breuil]] on 21 September 1940; Breuil would make many sketches of the cave, some of which are used as study material today due to the extreme degradation of many of the paintings. Breuil was accompanied by Denis Peyrony (curator of the [[Les eyzies|Prehistory Museum]] at [[Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil|Les Eyzies]]), Jean Bouyssonie and Dr Cheynier.\n\nThe cave complex was opened to the public on 14 July 1948, and initial archaeological investigations began a year later, focusing on the Shaft. By 1955, [[carbon dioxide]], heat, humidity, and other contaminants produced by 1,200 visitors per day had visibly damaged the paintings. As air condition deteriorated, fungi and [[lichen]] increasingly infested the walls. Consequently, the cave was closed to the public in 1963, the paintings were restored to their original state, and a monitoring system on a daily basis was introduced.\n\n===Replicas===\nConservation problems in the original cave have made the creation of replicas more important.\n\n====Lascaux II====\n''Lascaux II'', an exact copy of the ''Great Hall of the Bulls'' and the ''Painted Gallery'' was displayed at the [[Grand Palais]] in Paris, before being displayed from 1983 in the cave's vicinity (about 200&nbsp;m away from the original cave), a compromise and attempt to present an impression of the paintings' scale and composition for the public without harming the originals.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\"cave_art\" /> A full range of Lascaux's parietal art is presented a few kilometres from the site at the ''Centre of Prehistoric Art'', Le Parc du Thot, where there are also live animals representing [[Prehistoric animals|ice-age fauna]].<ref>[http://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/dordogne/au-thot-24-retour-loups-prehistoriques-1259593.html le retour des loups \u201cpr\u00e9historiques\u201d]</ref>\n\nThe paintings for this site were duplicated with the same type of materials as [[iron oxide]], [[charcoal]] and [[ochre]] which were believed to be used 19 thousand years ago.<ref name=\"dailytelegraph.com.au\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/lascaux-cave-170323|title=The Beautiful and Famous Lascaux Cave|last=Quotations|first=K.

Before joining the [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne River]] near Limeuil, the V\u00e9z\u00e8re flows in a south-westerly direction. At its centre point, the river's course is marked by a series of meanders flanked by high limestone cliffs that determine the landscape. Upstream from this steep-sloped relief, near [[Montignac, Dordogne|Montignac]] and in the vicinity of Lascaux, the contours of the land soften considerably; the valley floor widens, and the banks of the river lose their steepness.\n\nThe Lascaux valley is located some distance from the major concentrations of decorated caves and inhabited sites, most of which were discovered further downstream. In the environs of the village of Eyzies-de-Tayac Sireuil, there are no fewer than 37 decorated caves and shelters, as well as an even greater number of habitation sites from the Upper Paleolithic, located in the open, beneath a sheltering overhang, or at the entrance to one of the area's [[karst]] cavities. This is the highest concentration in Europe.\n\n== Parietal representation ==\nThe Hall of the Bulls, presents the most spectacular composition of Lascaux. Its calcite walls are not suitable for engraving, so it is only decorated with paintings, often of impressive dimensions: some are up to five metres long.\n\nTwo rows of [[aurochs]] face each other, two on one side and three on the other. The two aurochs on the north side are accompanied by about ten [[horse]]s and a large enigmatic animal, with two straight lines on its forehead that earned it the nickname \"unicorn\". On the south side, three large aurochs are next to three smaller ones, painted red, as well as six small deer and the only bear in the cave, superimposed on the belly of an aurochs and difficult to read.\n\nThe Axial Diverticulum is also decorated with cattle and horses accompanied by deer and ibex. A drawing of a fleeing horse was brushed with manganese pencil 2.50 metres above the ground. Some animals are painted on the ceiling and seem to roll from one wall to the other. These representations, which required the use of scaffolding, are intertwined with many signs (sticks, dots and rectangular signs).\n\nThe Passage has a highly degraded decoration, notably through air circulation.\n\nThe Nave has four groups of figures: the Empreinte panel, the Black Cow panel, the Deer swimming panel and the Crossed Buffalo panel. These works are accompanied by many enigmatic geometric signs, including coloured checkers that H. Breuil called \"coats of arms\".\n\nThe Feline Diverticulum owes its name to a group of felines, one of which seems to urinate to mark its territory. Very difficult to access, one can see there engravings of wild animals of a rather naive style. There are also other animals associated with signs, including a representation of a horse seen from the front, exceptional in Paleolithic art where animals are generally represented in profiles or from a \"twisted perspective\".\n\nThe apse contains more than a thousand engravings, some of which are superimposed on paintings, corresponding to animals and signs. There is the only reindeer represented in Lascaux.\n\nThe Well presents the most enigmatic scene of Lascaux: an ithyphallic (erect sex) man with a bird's head seems to fall, perhaps knocked down by a buffalo gutted by a saga; at his side is represented an elongated object surmounted by a bird, perhaps a propeller; on the left a rhinoceros moves away. A horse is also present on the opposite wall. Two groups of signs are to be noted in this composition:\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 between man and rhinos, three pairs of digitized punctuation marks found at the bottom of the Cat Diverticulum, in the most remote part of the cave;\n\n- \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 under man and bison, a complex barbed wire sign that can be found almost identically on other walls of the cave, but also on paddle points and on the sandstone lamp found nearby.\n\n==Images==\n[[File:Lascaux, Megaloceros.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Megaloceros]]'' with line of dots]]\nThe cave contains nearly 6,000 figures, which can be grouped into three main categories: animals, human figures, and abstract signs.

Many images are too faint to discern, and others have deteriorated entirely.\n\nOver 900 can be identified as animals, and 605 of these have been precisely identified. Out of these images, there are 364 paintings of [[Equus (genus)|equines]] as well as 90 paintings of [[Deer|stags]]. Also represented are cattle and bison, each representing 4 to 5% of the images. A smattering of other images include seven felines, a bird, a bear, a rhinoceros, and a human. There are no images of reindeer, even though that was the principal source of food for the artists.<ref name=curtis>{{cite book|last=Curtis|first=Gregory|title=The Cave Painters: Probing the Mysteries of the World's First Artists|year=2006|publisher=Alfred A.

The four black bulls, or [[aurochs]], are the dominant figures among the 36 animals represented here. One of the bulls is {{convert|5.2|m}} long, the largest animal discovered so far in cave art. Additionally, the bulls appear to be in motion.<ref name=curtis/>\n\nA painting referred to as \"The Crossed Bison\", found in the chamber called the Nave, is often submitted as an example of the skill of the Paleolithic cave painters. The crossed hind legs create the illusion that one bison is closer to the viewer than the other. This visual depth in the scene demonstrates a primitive form of perspective which was particularly advanced for the time.\n\n===Interpretation===\nThe interpretation of [[Art of the Upper Paleolithic|Palaeolithic Art]] is problematic, as it can be influenced by our own prejudices and beliefs. Some anthropologists and art historians theorize the paintings could be an account of past hunting success, or could represent a mystical ritual in order to improve future hunting endeavors. The latter theory is supported by the overlapping images of one group of animals in the same cave location as another group of animals, suggesting that one area of the cave was more successful for predicting a plentiful hunting excursion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.karstworlds.com/2010/12/lascaux-cave-history.html|title=Lascaux cave: History|website=www.karstworlds.com|language=en|access-date=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nApplying the iconographic method of analysis to the Lascaux paintings (studying position, direction and size of the figures; organization of the composition; painting technique; distribution of the color planes; research of the image center), Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Guiot-Houdart attempted to comprehend the symbolic function of the animals, to identify the theme of each image and finally to reconstitute the canvas of the myth illustrated on the rock walls.<ref>{{cite book|first=Th\u00e9r\u00e8se|last=Guiot-Houdart|title=Lascaux et les mythes|location=P\u00e9rigueux|year=2004|publisher=Pilote 24|language=French|isbn=2-912347-39-4}}</ref>{{elucidate|reason=her conclusions?|date=December 2012}}\n[[Image:Lascaux2.jpg|thumb|left|Cave painting of a [[Dun gene|dun]] horse ([[Equus (genus)|equine]]) at Lascaux]]\nJulien d'Huy and Jean-Lo\u00efc Le Quellec showed that certain angular or barbed signs of Lascaux may be analysed as \"weapon\" or \"wounds\".

At Lascaux, bison, aurochs and ibex are not represented side by side. Conversely, one can note a bison-horses-lions system and an aurochs-horses-deer-bears system, these animals being frequently associated.<ref>Denis Tauxe (2007).\"L\u2019organisation symbolique du dispositif pari\u00e9tal de la grotte de Lascaux\", ''Pr\u00e9histoire du Sud-Ouest'', 15: 177-266</ref> Such a distribution may show the relationship between the species pictured and their environmental conditions. Aurochs and bison fight one against the other, and horses and deer are very social with other animals. Bison and lions live in open plains areas; aurochs, deer and bears are associated with forests and marshes; ibex habitat is rocky areas, and horses are highly adaptive for all these areas. The Lascaux paintings' disposition may be explained by a belief in the real life of the pictured species, wherein the artists tried to respect their real environmental conditions.<ref>Julien d'Huy (2011). \"[https://independent.academia.edu/JuliendHuy/Papers/1304532/La_distribution_des_animaux_a_Lascaux_refleterait_leur_distribution_naturelle._-_Bulletin_de_la_Societe_Historique_et_Archeologique_du_Perigord_CXXXVIII_4_2011_493-502 La distribution des animaux \u00e0 Lascaux refl\u00e8terait leur distribution naturelle]\", ''Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Historique et Arch\u00e9ologique du P\u00e9rigord'' CXXXVIII, 493-502</ref>\n\nLess known is the image area called the ''Abside'' (Apse), a roundish, semi-spherical chamber similar to an [[apse]] in a Romanesque basilica.

This model is based on a masculine/feminine duality \u2013 which can be particularly observed in the bison/horse and aurochs/horse pairs \u2013 identifiable in both the signs and the animal representations. He also defined an ongoing evolution through four consecutive styles, from the Aurignacian to the Late Magdalenian. Andr\u00e9 Leroi-Gourhan did not publish a detailed analysis of the cave's figures. In his work Pr\u00e9histoire de l\u2019art occidental, published in 1965, he nonetheless put forward an analysis of certain signs and applied his explanatory model to the understanding of other decorated caves.\n\n==Threats==\n[[File:Lascaux operations room.jpg|thumb|upright|The conservation room at Lascaux]]\nThe opening of Lascaux Cave after World War II changed the cave environment. The exhalations of 1,200 visitors per day, presence of light, and changes in air circulation have created a number of problems. Lichens and crystals began to appear on the walls in the late 1950s, leading to closure of the caves in 1963. This led to restriction of access to the real caves to a few visitors every week, and the creation of a replica cave for visitors to Lascaux. In 2001, the authorities in charge of Lascaux changed the air conditioning system which resulted in regulation of the temperature and humidity. When the system had been established, an infestation of ''[[Fusarium solani]]'', a white [[mold]], began spreading rapidly across the cave ceiling and walls.<ref>{{cite journal\n | title = Invasion of the French Paleolithic painted cave of Lascaux by members of the Fusarium solani species complex\n | journal = Mycologia | volume = 99 | issue = 4 | year = 2007 | pages = 526\u2013533\n | doi = 10.3852/mycologia.99.4.526\n |author1=Jo\u00eblle Dupont |author2=Claire Jacquet |author3=Bruno Denneti\u00e8re |author4=Sandrine Lacoste | pmid = 18065003\n}}</ref> The mold is considered to have been present in the cave soil and exposed by the work of tradesmen, leading to the spread of the fungus which was treated with [[quicklime]]. In 2007, a new fungus, which has created grey and black blemishes, began spreading in the real cave.\n\nOrganized through the initiative of the French Ministry of Culture, an international symposium titled \"Lascaux and Preservation Issues in Subterranean Environments\" was held in Paris on 26 and 27 February 2009, under the chairmanship of Jean Clottes. It brought together nearly three hundred participants from seventeen countries with the goal of confronting research and interventions conducted in Lascaux Cave since 2001 with the experiences gained in other countries in the domain of preservation in subterranean environments.<ref>At the [[Takamatsuzuka Tomb]] in Japan, and [[Cave of Altamira|Altamira]] in Spain, for example.</ref> The proceedings of this symposium were published in 2011. Seventy-four specialists in fields as varied as biology, biochemistry, botany, hydrology, climatology, geology, fluid mechanics, archaeology, anthropology, restoration and conservation, from numerous countries (France, United States, Portugal, Spain, Japan, and others) contributed to this publication.<ref>Coye, N. dir.

It determines the country's [[Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest|representative]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and has been broadcasting almost every year since its inauguration in 1962.\n\nVarious singing presentations have been used throughout its history, beginning with radio-only performances in the first few years, live interpretation, playback, remakes and even duets featuring other singers. The winners have traditionally been selected by a jury. However, other voting methods have also been applied, such as televoting or regional juries. At times, the head juror has carried twice the voting power of other jurors.  \n\n[[Va\u00e7e Zela]] holds the record for most victories in the competition with eleven wins followed by Tonin T\u00ebrshana with four wins and [[Aurela Ga\u00e7e]] and Manjola Nallbani with three wins respectively. The most recent winner is [[Arilena Ara]] who won the [[Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs 58|58th edition]] of the contest.

They were accused of endangering the country with \"immoral aspects\" in their songs and performances. Following this development, the ruling Communist Party imposed numerous sanctions on the contest's creativity, with a strict censorship on anything deemed inappropriate by the government. This ranged from limiting the type of clothes artists could wear, to restricting their range of movement while performing. The main organisers of the show were accused of conspiring against the country and corrupting its youth.<ref name=forumishqiptar>{{cite web|title=T\u00eb gjith\u00eb t\u00eb nd\u00ebshkuarit e Festivalit t\u00eb 11-t\u00eb.(All the prosecuted after the 11th festival)|work=Transcribed article by Skifter K\u00eblli\u00e7i|url=http://www.forumishqiptar.com/showthread.php?t=41071|accessdate=1 July 2011|language=Albanian}}</ref><ref name=shqiperiacom>{{cite web|title=Ja \"kokat e prera\" n\u00eb art e kultur\u00eb, pas Festivalit t\u00eb 11-t\u00eb|work=Transcribed article by Skifter K\u00eblli\u00e7i|url=http://www.shqiperia.com/lajme/lajm/nr/3263/Ja-kokat-e-prera-ne-art-e-kulture-pas-Festivalit-te-11-te|accessdate=1 July 2011|language=Albanian}}</ref> \n\nAfter the 1972 edition the contest dwelled in a period of extreme pressure and censorship. The songs were highly monitored and the topics were generally related to the country's development or the government and its main figures. This oppression continued until 1984 when the dictator died. The following year, the change in lyrics was very abrupt and censorship began to relax. [[Nertila Koka]] and [[Anita Bitri]] quickly became the favorite new singers of songs about love, while [[Parashqevi Simaku]], [[Irma Libohova]] and [[Morena Reka]] also motivated the youth with progressively more liberal political entries year after year. Rock groups such as [[Tingulli i Zjarrt\u00eb]] had a considerable impact with the message of their songs and the introduction of rock music to the Albanian music scene, a genre which has endured successfully to this day and can easily be spotted even in modern FIK entries, a large part of which feature electric guitars. This was a planned liberalization that had the silent consent of the Communist Party leadership all along, primarily as a result of their realization that the days of Communism in Eastern Europe were coming to an end. The general public however was less aware of the imminence of such changes to the political order, making the performances have a puzzling effect that provoked both outrage and hope. Although Albania was the last country in Eastern Europe to part with communist rule in 1992, FIK entries were ringing the bells of change already by 1988.\n \nWith the fall of communism during the early 90s, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs had a temporary boost in both quality and diversity. The winning songs reflected the transitional period that the country was undergoing. The 1991 winner, [[Ardit Gjebrea]] - \"Jon\" (''Jon''), and the 1992 winner, [[Osman Mula]]'s entry sung by [[Aleksand\u00ebr Gjoka]], [[Manjola Nallbani]] & [[Viktor Tahiraj]] titled \"Pesha e fatit\" (''The weight of fate'') had an immigration and freedom theme, which coincided with the state of affairs in [[Albania]] at the time. During this period, the contest was also introduced to the word [[God]] for the first time. Prior to that, religion was illegal and the word [[God]] was not allowed to be pronounced in public. The participation of [[Albanians|Albanian]] singers from outside the country's borders was also an addition to the history of the festival during this decade. Before that, the country was in a period of isolation. The clothing and performances of the singers became more extravagant as time went by, with singers like [[Bleona Qereti]], [[Ledina \u00c7elo]] and [[Adelina Ismajli]] being among the most notable trendsetters of the new era.\n\nIn 1996, the stage of Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs welcomed newcomer [[Elsa Lila]] in a performance that deeply touched the hearts of the public with the clarity of her voice. She won the contest with \"Pyes lotin\" (''I ask the tear'') in 1996 and pulled off another victory the following year with \"Larg urrejtjes\" (''Away from the hatred'') in 1997. These songs mirrored the country's difficult reality following the collapse of the pyramid schemes, an [[Albanian Rebellion of 1997|event]] which wreaked havoc all throughout [[Albania]]. Despite the difficult times, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs never stopped its broadcast and went ahead as scheduled during the final weeks of December, as it has done for every year since its inception.\n\nIn 1998, [[Alb\u00ebrie Had\u00ebrgjonaj]] became the first [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar-Albanian]] singer to win the contest with the ballad \"Mir\u00ebsia dhe e v\u00ebrteta\" (''Goodness and truth''). The song had a humanitarian anti-war message and is often referred to locally as a song for [[Kosovo]], relating to the 1998\u20131999 [[Insurgency in Kosovo (1995\u201398)|war]].\n\nUp until 1999, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs was the biggest music event in Albania. Its popularity began to waver after the introduction of other competitions such as Top Fest and [[K\u00ebnga Magjike]], which were more liberal with their entry and singer selections, and eventually began to produce higher ratings. However, with Albania's introduction to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2004, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs quickly began producing a greater degree of national and international interest. In addition, other competitors were lost to [[Top Fest]], a festival which started a few years later as a reality series on [[Top Channel]] leading to a Spring finale. The festival received a boost of audience when another talented newcomer touched the stage of FIK in 2003, idol winner [[Anjeza Shahini]]. She had recently won the \"[[Ethet e s\u00eb Premtes Mbr\u00ebma]]\" (''Albanian Idol'') talent show a few months prior to competing in FIK and the public was highly impressed with her voice and her charming stage presence.\n\n=== 2004\u2013present ===\n\n[[Anjeza Shahini]] won the 42nd edition of Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs, placing hopeful professional singer [[Mariza Ikonomi]] in second place. Mariza boycotted the stage when the results were announced in a sign of disappointment. Much was at stake in this edition, as the winner would be the first ever representative of [[Albania]] in [[Eurovision]].<ref name=\"Eurovision TV\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision.tv]] |title=All about Albania |url=https://eurovision.tv/story/all-about-albania |website=eurovision.tv |language=English |quote=Anjeza Shahini carried her nations debut hopes, and ended up delivering a very respectable 7th place in the Final.}}</ref> Anjeza went on to sing at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]], landing herself in a respectable 7th place with the song \"[[The Image Of You]]\". Ever since, a more international interest around the festival has emerged, with Eurovision fans from Europe and beyond increasingly following the contest through live internet streams and satellite feeds. Year after year, FIK tags have trended in the top places of many European countries on Twitter during the live final show. Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs is usually the first national selection process jumpstarting the Eurovision Song Contest season, where countries reveal their competing entries for the show in May. Due to it commonly being held around Christmas week, Eurovision fans refer to this time period as \"FIKmas\".<ref>{{cite web |author1=Luis Fuster |publisher=[[Wiwibloggs]] |title=It\u2019s FiKmas time!

Its best result to date has been by Kosovar-Albanian singer [[Rona Nishliu]] with the highly appraised performance of her vocally intensive song \"[[Suus]]\", ranking 2nd in the semi-finals and 5th in the finals of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n \n=== Trivia ===\n{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n* In the early editions of Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs, each song would be interpreted two or three times by different singers. However, only one of the versions sung would be declared the winner.\n* In 1980, it has been rumoured that the government intervened in the selection of the winner, giving the victory to \"Shoqet tona ilegale\" (''Our illegal friends'') by Va\u00e7e Zela instead of \"Njer\u00ebzit e agimeve\" (''People of the mornings'') by [[Alida Hisku]]. While the first is a song honoring undercover friendships among partisans during the time of the national liberation of Albania from Nazi forces, the latter makes strong references to intellectual awakening and enlightenment ideas, as evidenced by its lyrics: \"The generations have long dreamed of an awakening like this, with the sun in their hearts, with the light in their eyes, among mornings of fire, new generations grow, they plant like the wheat, new days to come\"; concepts deemed strongly in contrast with the philosophy of Enver Hoxha's dictatorship.\n* In 1987, it was said that [[Kozma Dushi]] with the song \"Lot me ty o djal\u00eb\" (''Hey boy we cry with you'') was set to be declared the winner, however minutes before the jury made their decision, the wife of the country's ruler, [[Nexhmije Hoxha]], declared that she did not want that song to win, so another song was chosen to win.\n* In 1994, [[Mariza Ikonomi]] became the youngest singer to compete in the festival at the age of 12, in a duet with [[Fran\u00e7esk Radi]] and their song \"Telefonat\u00eb zemrash\" (''Phone call of hearts'').\n* In 1995, the song \"E Doni Dashurin\u00eb\" (''Do you want love'') by [[Luan Zhegu]] & [[Ledina \u00c7elo]] was reported to be the most applauded song in Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs history to date, a total applause time of 7 minutes and 11 seconds.\n* In 1997, [[Alma Bektashi]] had a wardrobe malfunction on stage when her dress fell off, revealing her breast. The cameras managed to avoid the incident, however the audience received a full view of the incident.\n* In 1998 the first Kosovar-Albanian singer, [[Alb\u00ebrie Had\u00ebrgjonaj]] with the song \"Mir\u00ebsia dhe e v\u00ebrteta\" (''Goodness and truth''), was declared the winner.\n* In 1999, the song \"Apokalipsi\" (''The Apocalypse'') by [[Irma Libohova|Irma]] & [[Eranda Libohova]] was initially declared the winner instead of [[Aurela Ga\u00e7e]]'s  \"S'jam tribu\" (''I'm not a tribute'') due to a miscalculation in jury votes.\n* In 2016, hologram technology was used to bring back a performance by [[Va\u00e7e Zela]] as a tribute, almost three years after the iconic singer's death.\n\n=== Scandals ===\n\n* In 1963, [[Besnik Taraveshi]] was the first singer to be prosecuted by the Communist Dictatorship, ahead of many to come throughout the history of the festival. This was due to his interpretation and mispronunciation of a word in the song \"Djaloshi dhe shiu\" (''The boy and the rain'').\n* In 1964, head of the jury [[Llazar Siliqi]] decided that no first place will be awarded, due to the low quality of the songs. Instead, \"Dritaren k\u00ebrkoj\" by [[Va\u00e7e Zela]] was awarded second place, and two other songs awarded third place.\n* In 1972, [[Enver Hozha]] deemed the organisers of [[Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs 11]] \"Enemies of The People\", a name given to all the subjects who he considered a danger to the country. Unluckily, many of them were prosecuted after being accused of endangering the country's mentality by introducing an immoral aspect to the show, and plotting against the government by influencing the Albanian youth at the time. RTSH general director at the time [[Todi Lubonja]], together with the festival's director [[Mihal Luarasi]] and singer [[Sherif Merdani]] were sentenced and would remain imprisoned for sixteen years until 1989, while many of the others involved were banned from working in television and/or were deported to remote Albanian cities.<ref name=forumishqiptar /><ref name=shqiperiacom /> The claims were out of context and these punishments were used as an example and a statement for future organisers. There is a whole book dedicated to this event: [[Festivali i Nj\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb]] (''The 11th Festival''), written by [[Skifter K\u00eblli\u00e7i]].\n* In 1999, [[Irma Libohova|Irma]] & [[Eranda Libohova]] left the [[Palace of Congresses]] early, thinking that their song \"[[Apokalipsi]]\" (''The Apocalypse'') would not win. The song was initially declared as the winner, although a miscalculation in the jury votes announced the following day by head juror Va\u00e7e Zela, revealed that [[Aurela Ga\u00e7e]]'s \"[[S'jam tribu]]\" (''I'm not a tribute'') had won instead.\n* In 2003, singer [[Mariza Ikonomi]], who was eager to represent [[Albania]] for the first time in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], left the venue in sign of protest when it was announced that her entry \"[[Mbi ur\u00eb]]\" (''Over a bridge'') had ranked 2nd. She lost to [[Anjeza Shahini]]'s \"[[Imazhi Yt]]\" (''[[The Image of You]]'').\n* In 2004, the producers of the song \"[[Tomorrow I Go|Nes\u00ebr shkoj]]\" filed a lawsuit against [[Ledina \u00c7elo]] because she had signed contracts with a phone company without previously consulting them. She was also accused of not attending the conferences set up the producers and that she had not rehearsed the song enough. The suit was dropped within the week that it was filed.\n* In 2006, [[Greta Ko\u00e7i]] was so disappointed from her 5th placing with the song \"Eja zem\u00ebr\" that she burst out in tears, while her mother faced off the festival's 7 member jury with allegations of corruption and incompetence.\n* In 2007, [[Blero]] dropped out of the competition, claiming that he was asked for a large amount of money in exchange of a victory by an anonymous caller. He also claimed that the first three positions were already decided by the organizers prior to the event. The jury and the festival administration replied in a press statement that it was Blero who had asked for the first prize by sending an SMS which stated that he would withdraw if his victory was not guaranteed.\n* Also in 2007, [[Manjola Nallbani]] accused the festival authorities that they had sabotaged her song. Her voice was not heard at all in the hall, instead the public only heard the orchestra and the playback. This was confirmed by the general director of the festival [[Zamira Koleci]]. Nallbani declared that she would no longer participate in this event and called certain organizers [[:wikt:Mafioso|mafioso]]s.\n* The 2007 edition also provoked a huge public reaction and massive press attention after the song \"[[Jeta k\u00ebrkon dashuri]]\" (''Life needs love'') by [[Flaka Krelani]] and [[Doruntina Disha]] placed second, prompting corruption accusations about the jury, namely [[Gjergj Xhuvani]] and [[Alban Sk\u00ebnderaj]]. These two judges did not give any points to this song, while four judges awarded it maximum points and [[Rudina Magjistari]] awarded it the second highest points. General Director [[Zamira Koleci]] in a press interview called the two judges \"gangsters and racists\" after their boycott of the song from the Kosovo Albanian singers. [[Edmond Zhulali]], composer of the song and artistic director of FIK, submitted a request to the RTSH council for the jury's votes to be disqualified. The council however turned down this request after 2 hours of debate.\n* In 2013, an alleged change in the contractual agreement between the festival and Kosovo model [[Diellza Kolgeci]], the previously assigned female host for FIK 52, led to Diellza withdrawing from her hosting duties just days before the live show. She stated that the original terms of her contract included the costs of lodging and other amenities for her personal assistant, however the modified version did not include such expenses, citing a suspicious lack of funds in the festival's budget following a change of directors. The festival responded to the controversy by airing a satirical ad featuring male host Enkel Demi appearing upset at the news of Diellza's withdrawal, and three replacement female hosts, model [[Marinela Meta]], Miss Albania 2011 Xhesika Berberi, and actress [[Klea Huta]]. The girls cheer him up by saying that they would be more than willing to co-host the show with him and that they can't wait for the rehearsals to begin. In response, Diellza utilized some prominent newspapers in Albania to state that it would be impossible to replace her, as well as to clarify that she would not be willing to compromise her values over one show. She said that if enough notice had been given to her about the changes in the contract, she could easily book 10,000 hotel rooms for her assistant through her large base of connections. She expressed respect for the festival's history however, despite her disagreements with the current staff. Meanwhile, Enkel appeared to have a humorous take on Diellza's high standards, saying that his diet had been affected by her presence, referring to her demands for lean meats covered in lemon juice.\n* In 2014, the festival's organizers ran into some high-profile problems when it came to successfully booking their guest singer for their interval act. After [[Conchita Wurst]]'s refusal earlier in December due to a busy schedule, [[Alexander Rybak]], who initially accepted FIK's offer to perform, also pulled out at the last minute after his composed entry in the [[Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|Belarusian national final]] failed to secure a victory. He stated that the combination of this disappointment, along with some misunderstandings with FIK's authorities, forced him to make this unusual cancellation. Reaction by fans was mixed, as some decried unprofessionalism, while others appeared more empathetic. FIK organizers ultimately relied on jury members [[Genc Dashi]] and [[Rona Nishliu]] to fill in for Rybak, as Dashi improvised on the guitar, while Nishliu paid tribute to Va\u00e7e Zela, who had died earlier in February. It was also rumored that the opening act of the grand final, consisting of a well-liked violin reprise of past FIK entries, was the organizers' ironic response to Rybak's last-minute cancellation.\n* In 2015, [[Edea Demaliaj]]'s song \"Era\" (''The wind''), composed by [[Adrian Hila]] and written by [[Pandi La\u00e7o]], was disqualified by the festival's directors, despite being included in the initial list of competing entries. Hila expressed his discontent when interviewed on the TV show [[Oktapod]], contesting the board's decision to disqualify his song simply because its lyrics were written by the host of [[Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs 54|FIK 54]] Pandi La\u00e7o. Meanwhile, singer Edea Demaliaj dropped out of the competition after finding herself without a song. Her replacement was [[Orgesa Zaimi]], whose entry had not qualified during the internal pre-selection stage.\n* Also in 2015, [[Eneda Tarifa]]'s victory reignited allegations of bias and corruption by the jury and the festival's organizers, as media and critics attributed Tarifa's win to her close friendship and joint business venture with FIK's current artistic director [[Elton Deda]], rather than on her merit versus the competition. The jury's integrity had previously been questioned when 22 entries, rather than the planned 18, were qualified for the grand final, raising suspicions that certain singers had passed on to the final based on name recognition rather than song quality. Adding more to the scrutiny was the fact that, instead of revealing the full set of votes from every juror, the festival regressed to its old practice of mentioning only the top ranked songs in the final, circumventing any individual responsibility for potentially compromised jurors in the process. The controversial victory of Eneda Tarifa brought to the forefront an old spat that the singer had once had with Albanian LGBT rights defender [[Kristi Pinderi]], when he had publicly challenged Tarifa's moral standards after she had lashed out against [[Conchita Wurst]]'s triumph in [[Eurovision 2014]]. At the time, Tarifa had initially complained that music itself had been eclipsed by Conchita's win, but in a subsequent statement she elaborated that the Eurovision Song Contest was not spreading the correct set of values to its European audience, and that certain LGBT groups were lobbying for attention and exposure in this contest. Her fragmented reaction, along with her concerns on how to explain \u201cConchita\u201d to her family, were dismissed by Pinderi as embellished homophobia on her part. In a heated media exchange, he challenged Tarifa's intellect along with her diploma in Social Works, while recalling an old interview as a journalist for his previous employer where he was left with the impression that \u201cshe was either not very smart, or she did not know how to properly articulate smart things\u201d.\n* In 2016, there was controversy over the festival's decision not to follow through with the announced 60% jury and 40% public voting ratio during the final. Instead, the public vote counted only for 1/13th of the final result. Under a 60/40 split, [[Lindita (singer)|Lindita]] would have tied with [[Ylli Limani]] at 120 points, requiring tie-breaking procedures to determine the winner. It is worth noting that Lindita received votes from 11 jurors compared to Limani's 7, and received top scores from 5 jurors compared to Limani's 1. In addition, Lindita won the jury vote by scoring twice as much as Limani (80 points v. 40 points), while Limani won the public vote by scoring twice as much as Lindita (10 points v. 5 points). A 60/40 ratio would have required that the public vote be worth 8 times the vote of 1 member from the 12-member jury.\n* Also in 2016, [[Ledina \u00c7elo]]'s see-through dress on the first semi final made waves throughout the Albanian media as criticism ensued due to the family-oriented nature of the festival's audience. Her hosting abilities were also heavily criticized. Journalist [[Dasara Karaiskaj]], known for her pointed humor, lamented the situation by commenting that \u00c7elo must have read the script \u201cthrough her ass\u201d.\n* In 2017, singer [[Kastro Zizo]] claimed that his song was politically censored by RTSH due to its lyrics. RTSH stated that the decision was made by the preselection jury, which could qualify only 22 out of the 70 entries that were submitted, leaving no space for politics to play a role. After posting the lyrics in full, Kastro maintained that the lyrics were penalized for portraying the increase in migration that has come as a result of the policies of the current government, blaming RTSH bureaucrats for the occurrence. Former prime minister [[Sali Berisha]] also expressed his views, comparing the jury's decision to Hoxha's censorship over the festival during the 1970s. A few days later, singer [[Klajdi Musabelliu]] made a similar complaint, stating that he was shocked to learn that his migration-themed entry did not pass preselection. Since Musabelliu also works for an opposition party, his disqualification from the FIK semi finals quickly became politicized as well.\n\n== Winners ==\n{{Main|Winners of Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs}}\n\nAs of 2019, [[Va\u00e7e Zela]] holds the record for the highest number of wins having won the contest eleven times followed by Tonin T\u00ebrshana with four wins, [[Aurela Ga\u00e7e]] and Manjola Nallbani with three wins respectively.

It determines the country's [[Albania in the Eurovision Song Contest|representative]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and has been broadcasting almost every year since its inauguration in 1962.\n\nVarious singing presentations have been used throughout its history, beginning with radio-only performances in the first few years, live interpretation, playback, remakes and even duets featuring other singers.

At times, the head juror has carried twice the voting power of other jurors.  \n\n[[Va\u00e7e Zela]] holds the record for most victories in the competition with eleven wins followed by Tonin T\u00ebrshana with four wins and [[Aurela Ga\u00e7e]] and Manjola Nallbani with three wins respectively. The most recent winner is [[Arilena Ara]] who won the [[Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs 58|58th edition]] of the contest.

They were accused of endangering the country with \"immoral aspects\" in their songs and performances. Following this development, the ruling Communist Party imposed numerous sanctions on the contest's creativity, with a strict censorship on anything deemed inappropriate by the government. This ranged from limiting the type of clothes artists could wear, to restricting their range of movement while performing. The main organisers of the show were accused of conspiring against the country and corrupting its youth.<ref name=forumishqiptar>{{cite web|title=T\u00eb gjith\u00eb t\u00eb nd\u00ebshkuarit e Festivalit t\u00eb 11-t\u00eb.(All the prosecuted after the 11th festival)|work=Transcribed article by Skifter K\u00eblli\u00e7i|url=http://www.forumishqiptar.com/showthread.php?t=41071|accessdate=1 July 2011|language=Albanian}}</ref><ref name=shqiperiacom>{{cite web|title=Ja \"kokat e prera\" n\u00eb art e kultur\u00eb, pas Festivalit t\u00eb 11-t\u00eb|work=Transcribed article by Skifter K\u00eblli\u00e7i|url=http://www.shqiperia.com/lajme/lajm/nr/3263/Ja-kokat-e-prera-ne-art-e-kulture-pas-Festivalit-te-11-te|accessdate=1 July 2011|language=Albanian}}</ref> \n\nAfter the 1972 edition the contest dwelled in a period of extreme pressure and censorship. The songs were highly monitored and the topics were generally related to the country's development or the government and its main figures. This oppression continued until 1984 when the dictator died. The following year, the change in lyrics was very abrupt and censorship began to relax. [[Nertila Koka]] and [[Anita Bitri]] quickly became the favorite new singers of songs about love, while [[Parashqevi Simaku]], [[Irma Libohova]] and [[Morena Reka]] also motivated the youth with progressively more liberal political entries year after year. Rock groups such as [[Tingulli i Zjarrt\u00eb]] had a considerable impact with the message of their songs and the introduction of rock music to the Albanian music scene, a genre which has endured successfully to this day and can easily be spotted even in modern FIK entries, a large part of which feature electric guitars. This was a planned liberalization that had the silent consent of the Communist Party leadership all along, primarily as a result of their realization that the days of Communism in Eastern Europe were coming to an end. The general public however was less aware of the imminence of such changes to the political order, making the performances have a puzzling effect that provoked both outrage and hope. Although Albania was the last country in Eastern Europe to part with communist rule in 1992, FIK entries were ringing the bells of change already by 1988.\n \nWith the fall of communism during the early 90s, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs had a temporary boost in both quality and diversity. The winning songs reflected the transitional period that the country was undergoing. The 1991 winner, [[Ardit Gjebrea]] - \"Jon\" (''Jon''), and the 1992 winner, [[Osman Mula]]'s entry sung by [[Aleksand\u00ebr Gjoka]], [[Manjola Nallbani]] & [[Viktor Tahiraj]] titled \"Pesha e fatit\" (''The weight of fate'') had an immigration and freedom theme, which coincided with the state of affairs in [[Albania]] at the time. During this period, the contest was also introduced to the word [[God]] for the first time. Prior to that, religion was illegal and the word [[God]] was not allowed to be pronounced in public. The participation of [[Albanians|Albanian]] singers from outside the country's borders was also an addition to the history of the festival during this decade. Before that, the country was in a period of isolation. The clothing and performances of the singers became more extravagant as time went by, with singers like [[Bleona Qereti]], [[Ledina \u00c7elo]] and [[Adelina Ismajli]] being among the most notable trendsetters of the new era.\n\nIn 1996, the stage of Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs welcomed newcomer [[Elsa Lila]] in a performance that deeply touched the hearts of the public with the clarity of her voice. She won the contest with \"Pyes lotin\" (''I ask the tear'') in 1996 and pulled off another victory the following year with \"Larg urrejtjes\" (''Away from the hatred'') in 1997. These songs mirrored the country's difficult reality following the collapse of the pyramid schemes, an [[Albanian Rebellion of 1997|event]] which wreaked havoc all throughout [[Albania]]. Despite the difficult times, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs never stopped its broadcast and went ahead as scheduled during the final weeks of December, as it has done for every year since its inception.\n\nIn 1998, [[Alb\u00ebrie Had\u00ebrgjonaj]] became the first [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar-Albanian]] singer to win the contest with the ballad \"Mir\u00ebsia dhe e v\u00ebrteta\" (''Goodness and truth''). The song had a humanitarian anti-war message and is often referred to locally as a song for [[Kosovo]], relating to the 1998\u20131999 [[Insurgency in Kosovo (1995\u201398)|war]].\n\nUp until 1999, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs was the biggest music event in Albania. Its popularity began to waver after the introduction of other competitions such as Top Fest and [[K\u00ebnga Magjike]], which were more liberal with their entry and singer selections, and eventually began to produce higher ratings. However, with Albania's introduction to the Eurovision Song Contest in 2004, Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs quickly began producing a greater degree of national and international interest. In addition, other competitors were lost to [[Top Fest]], a festival which started a few years later as a reality series on [[Top Channel]] leading to a Spring finale. The festival received a boost of audience when another talented newcomer touched the stage of FIK in 2003, idol winner [[Anjeza Shahini]]. She had recently won the \"[[Ethet e s\u00eb Premtes Mbr\u00ebma]]\" (''Albanian Idol'') talent show a few months prior to competing in FIK and the public was highly impressed with her voice and her charming stage presence.\n\n=== 2004\u2013present ===\n\n[[Anjeza Shahini]] won the 42nd edition of Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs, placing hopeful professional singer [[Mariza Ikonomi]] in second place. Mariza boycotted the stage when the results were announced in a sign of disappointment. Much was at stake in this edition, as the winner would be the first ever representative of [[Albania]] in [[Eurovision]].<ref name=\"Eurovision TV\">{{cite web |publisher=[[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision.tv]] |title=All about Albania |url=https://eurovision.tv/story/all-about-albania |website=eurovision.tv |language=English |quote=Anjeza Shahini carried her nations debut hopes, and ended up delivering a very respectable 7th place in the Final.}}</ref> Anjeza went on to sing at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004]], landing herself in a respectable 7th place with the song \"[[The Image Of You]]\". Ever since, a more international interest around the festival has emerged, with Eurovision fans from Europe and beyond increasingly following the contest through live internet streams and satellite feeds. Year after year, FIK tags have trended in the top places of many European countries on Twitter during the live final show. Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs is usually the first national selection process jumpstarting the Eurovision Song Contest season, where countries reveal their competing entries for the show in May. Due to it commonly being held around Christmas week, Eurovision fans refer to this time period as \"FIKmas\".<ref>{{cite web |author1=Luis Fuster |publisher=[[Wiwibloggs]] |title=It\u2019s FiKmas time!

Its best result to date has been by Kosovar-Albanian singer [[Rona Nishliu]] with the highly appraised performance of her vocally intensive song \"[[Suus]]\", ranking 2nd in the semi-finals and 5th in the finals of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n \n=== Trivia ===\n{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n* In the early editions of Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs, each song would be interpreted two or three times by different singers. However, only one of the versions sung would be declared the winner.\n* In 1980, it has been rumoured that the government intervened in the selection of the winner, giving the victory to \"Shoqet tona ilegale\" (''Our illegal friends'') by Va\u00e7e Zela instead of \"Njer\u00ebzit e agimeve\" (''People of the mornings'') by [[Alida Hisku]]. While the first is a song honoring undercover friendships among partisans during the time of the national liberation of Albania from Nazi forces, the latter makes strong references to intellectual awakening and enlightenment ideas, as evidenced by its lyrics: \"The generations have long dreamed of an awakening like this, with the sun in their hearts, with the light in their eyes, among mornings of fire, new generations grow, they plant like the wheat, new days to come\"; concepts deemed strongly in contrast with the philosophy of Enver Hoxha's dictatorship.\n* In 1987, it was said that [[Kozma Dushi]] with the song \"Lot me ty o djal\u00eb\" (''Hey boy we cry with you'') was set to be declared the winner, however minutes before the jury made their decision, the wife of the country's ruler, [[Nexhmije Hoxha]], declared that she did not want that song to win, so another song was chosen to win.\n* In 1994, [[Mariza Ikonomi]] became the youngest singer to compete in the festival at the age of 12, in a duet with [[Fran\u00e7esk Radi]] and their song \"Telefonat\u00eb zemrash\" (''Phone call of hearts'').\n* In 1995, the song \"E Doni Dashurin\u00eb\" (''Do you want love'') by [[Luan Zhegu]] & [[Ledina \u00c7elo]] was reported to be the most applauded song in Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs history to date, a total applause time of 7 minutes and 11 seconds.\n* In 1997, [[Alma Bektashi]] had a wardrobe malfunction on stage when her dress fell off, revealing her breast. The cameras managed to avoid the incident, however the audience received a full view of the incident.\n* In 1998 the first Kosovar-Albanian singer, [[Alb\u00ebrie Had\u00ebrgjonaj]] with the song \"Mir\u00ebsia dhe e v\u00ebrteta\" (''Goodness and truth''), was declared the winner.\n* In 1999, the song \"Apokalipsi\" (''The Apocalypse'') by [[Irma Libohova|Irma]] & [[Eranda Libohova]] was initially declared the winner instead of [[Aurela Ga\u00e7e]]'s  \"S'jam tribu\" (''I'm not a tribute'') due to a miscalculation in jury votes.\n* In 2016, hologram technology was used to bring back a performance by [[Va\u00e7e Zela]] as a tribute, almost three years after the iconic singer's death.\n\n=== Scandals ===\n\n* In 1963, [[Besnik Taraveshi]] was the first singer to be prosecuted by the Communist Dictatorship, ahead of many to come throughout the history of the festival. This was due to his interpretation and mispronunciation of a word in the song \"Djaloshi dhe shiu\" (''The boy and the rain'').\n* In 1964, head of the jury [[Llazar Siliqi]] decided that no first place will be awarded, due to the low quality of the songs. Instead, \"Dritaren k\u00ebrkoj\" by [[Va\u00e7e Zela]] was awarded second place, and two other songs awarded third place.\n* In 1972, [[Enver Hozha]] deemed the organisers of [[Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs 11]] \"Enemies of The People\", a name given to all the subjects who he considered a danger to the country. Unluckily, many of them were prosecuted after being accused of endangering the country's mentality by introducing an immoral aspect to the show, and plotting against the government by influencing the Albanian youth at the time. RTSH general director at the time [[Todi Lubonja]], together with the festival's director [[Mihal Luarasi]] and singer [[Sherif Merdani]] were sentenced and would remain imprisoned for sixteen years until 1989, while many of the others involved were banned from working in television and/or were deported to remote Albanian cities.<ref name=forumishqiptar /><ref name=shqiperiacom /> The claims were out of context and these punishments were used as an example and a statement for future organisers. There is a whole book dedicated to this event: [[Festivali i Nj\u00ebmb\u00ebdhjet\u00eb]] (''The 11th Festival''), written by [[Skifter K\u00eblli\u00e7i]].\n* In 1999, [[Irma Libohova|Irma]] & [[Eranda Libohova]] left the [[Palace of Congresses]] early, thinking that their song \"[[Apokalipsi]]\" (''The Apocalypse'') would not win. The song was initially declared as the winner, although a miscalculation in the jury votes announced the following day by head juror Va\u00e7e Zela, revealed that [[Aurela Ga\u00e7e]]'s \"[[S'jam tribu]]\" (''I'm not a tribute'') had won instead.\n* In 2003, singer [[Mariza Ikonomi]], who was eager to represent [[Albania]] for the first time in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], left the venue in sign of protest when it was announced that her entry \"[[Mbi ur\u00eb]]\" (''Over a bridge'') had ranked 2nd. She lost to [[Anjeza Shahini]]'s \"[[Imazhi Yt]]\" (''[[The Image of You]]'').\n* In 2004, the producers of the song \"[[Tomorrow I Go|Nes\u00ebr shkoj]]\" filed a lawsuit against [[Ledina \u00c7elo]] because she had signed contracts with a phone company without previously consulting them. She was also accused of not attending the conferences set up the producers and that she had not rehearsed the song enough. The suit was dropped within the week that it was filed.\n* In 2006, [[Greta Ko\u00e7i]] was so disappointed from her 5th placing with the song \"Eja zem\u00ebr\" that she burst out in tears, while her mother faced off the festival's 7 member jury with allegations of corruption and incompetence.\n* In 2007, [[Blero]] dropped out of the competition, claiming that he was asked for a large amount of money in exchange of a victory by an anonymous caller. He also claimed that the first three positions were already decided by the organizers prior to the event. The jury and the festival administration replied in a press statement that it was Blero who had asked for the first prize by sending an SMS which stated that he would withdraw if his victory was not guaranteed.\n* Also in 2007, [[Manjola Nallbani]] accused the festival authorities that they had sabotaged her song. Her voice was not heard at all in the hall, instead the public only heard the orchestra and the playback. This was confirmed by the general director of the festival [[Zamira Koleci]]. Nallbani declared that she would no longer participate in this event and called certain organizers [[:wikt:Mafioso|mafioso]]s.\n* The 2007 edition also provoked a huge public reaction and massive press attention after the song \"[[Jeta k\u00ebrkon dashuri]]\" (''Life needs love'') by [[Flaka Krelani]] and [[Doruntina Disha]] placed second, prompting corruption accusations about the jury, namely [[Gjergj Xhuvani]] and [[Alban Sk\u00ebnderaj]]. These two judges did not give any points to this song, while four judges awarded it maximum points and [[Rudina Magjistari]] awarded it the second highest points. General Director [[Zamira Koleci]] in a press interview called the two judges \"gangsters and racists\" after their boycott of the song from the Kosovo Albanian singers. [[Edmond Zhulali]], composer of the song and artistic director of FIK, submitted a request to the RTSH council for the jury's votes to be disqualified. The council however turned down this request after 2 hours of debate.\n* In 2013, an alleged change in the contractual agreement between the festival and Kosovo model [[Diellza Kolgeci]], the previously assigned female host for FIK 52, led to Diellza withdrawing from her hosting duties just days before the live show. She stated that the original terms of her contract included the costs of lodging and other amenities for her personal assistant, however the modified version did not include such expenses, citing a suspicious lack of funds in the festival's budget following a change of directors. The festival responded to the controversy by airing a satirical ad featuring male host Enkel Demi appearing upset at the news of Diellza's withdrawal, and three replacement female hosts, model [[Marinela Meta]], Miss Albania 2011 [[Xhesika Berberi]], and actress [[Klea Huta]]. The girls cheer him up by saying that they would be more than willing to co-host the show with him and that they can't wait for the rehearsals to begin. In response, Diellza utilized some prominent newspapers in Albania to state that it would be impossible to replace her, as well as to clarify that she would not be willing to compromise her values over one show. She said that if enough notice had been given to her about the changes in the contract, she could easily book 10,000 hotel rooms for her assistant through her large base of connections. She expressed respect for the festival's history however, despite her disagreements with the current staff. Meanwhile, Enkel appeared to have a humorous take on Diellza's high standards, saying that his diet had been affected by her presence, referring to her demands for lean meats covered in lemon juice.\n* In 2014, the festival's organizers ran into some high-profile problems when it came to successfully booking their guest singer for their interval act. After [[Conchita Wurst]]'s refusal earlier in December due to a busy schedule, [[Alexander Rybak]], who initially accepted FIK's offer to perform, also pulled out at the last minute after his composed entry in the [[Belarus in the Eurovision Song Contest 2015|Belarusian national final]] failed to secure a victory. He stated that the combination of this disappointment, along with some misunderstandings with FIK's authorities, forced him to make this unusual cancellation. Reaction by fans was mixed, as some decried unprofessionalism, while others appeared more empathetic. FIK organizers ultimately relied on jury members [[Genc Dashi]] and [[Rona Nishliu]] to fill in for Rybak, as Dashi improvised on the guitar, while Nishliu paid tribute to Va\u00e7e Zela, who had died earlier in February. It was also rumored that the opening act of the grand final, consisting of a well-liked violin reprise of past FIK entries, was the organizers' ironic response to Rybak's last-minute cancellation.\n* In 2015, [[Edea Demaliaj]]'s song \"Era\" (''The wind''), composed by [[Adrian Hila]] and written by [[Pandi La\u00e7o]], was disqualified by the festival's directors, despite being included in the initial list of competing entries. Hila expressed his discontent when interviewed on the TV show [[Oktapod]], contesting the board's decision to disqualify his song simply because its lyrics were written by the host of [[Festivali i K\u00ebng\u00ebs 54|FIK 54]] Pandi La\u00e7o. Meanwhile, singer Edea Demaliaj dropped out of the competition after finding herself without a song. Her replacement was [[Orgesa Zaimi]], whose entry had not qualified during the internal pre-selection stage.\n* Also in 2015, [[Eneda Tarifa]]'s victory reignited allegations of bias and corruption by the jury and the festival's organizers, as media and critics attributed Tarifa's win to her close friendship and joint business venture with FIK's current artistic director [[Elton Deda]], rather than on her merit versus the competition. The jury's integrity had previously been questioned when 22 entries, rather than the planned 18, were qualified for the grand final, raising suspicions that certain singers had passed on to the final based on name recognition rather than song quality. Adding more to the scrutiny was the fact that, instead of revealing the full set of votes from every juror, the festival regressed to its old practice of mentioning only the top ranked songs in the final, circumventing any individual responsibility for potentially compromised jurors in the process. The controversial victory of Eneda Tarifa brought to the forefront an old spat that the singer had once had with Albanian LGBT rights defender [[Kristi Pinderi]], when he had publicly challenged Tarifa's moral standards after she had lashed out against [[Conchita Wurst]]'s triumph in [[Eurovision 2014]]. At the time, Tarifa had initially complained that music itself had been eclipsed by Conchita's win, but in a subsequent statement she elaborated that the Eurovision Song Contest was not spreading the correct set of values to its European audience, and that certain LGBT groups were lobbying for attention and exposure in this contest. Her fragmented reaction, along with her concerns on how to explain \u201cConchita\u201d to her family, were dismissed by Pinderi as embellished homophobia on her part. In a heated media exchange, he challenged Tarifa's intellect along with her diploma in Social Works, while recalling an old interview as a journalist for his previous employer where he was left with the impression that \u201cshe was either not very smart, or she did not know how to properly articulate smart things\u201d.\n* In 2016, there was controversy over the festival's decision not to follow through with the announced 60% jury and 40% public voting ratio during the final. Instead, the public vote counted only for 1/13th of the final result. Under a 60/40 split, [[Lindita (singer)|Lindita]] would have tied with [[Ylli Limani]] at 120 points, requiring tie-breaking procedures to determine the winner. It is worth noting that Lindita received votes from 11 jurors compared to Limani's 7, and received top scores from 5 jurors compared to Limani's 1. In addition, Lindita won the jury vote by scoring twice as much as Limani (80 points v. 40 points), while Limani won the public vote by scoring twice as much as Lindita (10 points v. 5 points). A 60/40 ratio would have required that the public vote be worth 8 times the vote of 1 member from the 12-member jury.\n* Also in 2016, [[Ledina \u00c7elo]]'s see-through dress on the first semi final made waves throughout the Albanian media as criticism ensued due to the family-oriented nature of the festival's audience. Her hosting abilities were also heavily criticized. Journalist [[Dasara Karaiskaj]], known for her pointed humor, lamented the situation by commenting that \u00c7elo must have read the script \u201cthrough her ass\u201d.\n* In 2017, singer [[Kastro Zizo]] claimed that his song was politically censored by RTSH due to its lyrics. RTSH stated that the decision was made by the preselection jury, which could qualify only 22 out of the 70 entries that were submitted, leaving no space for politics to play a role. After posting the lyrics in full, Kastro maintained that the lyrics were penalized for portraying the increase in migration that has come as a result of the policies of the current government, blaming RTSH bureaucrats for the occurrence. Former prime minister [[Sali Berisha]] also expressed his views, comparing the jury's decision to Hoxha's censorship over the festival during the 1970s. A few days later, singer [[Klajdi Musabelliu]] made a similar complaint, stating that he was shocked to learn that his migration-themed entry did not pass preselection.

The pageant was founded as Miss Albania in 2002, until rebranding as Miss Universe Albania in 2006. Since 2006, winners of the competition have competed internationally in [[Miss Universe]], while some runners-up have competed in [[Miss World]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lola2.jpeg|thumb|230px|[[Floriana Garo]] represented Albania in the Miss World 2012 beauty pageant.]]\nAlbania debuted at Miss Universe in 2002 with the Miss Albania organization as the official franchise holder. The organization held national pageant yearly up into 2006. Beginning in 2007, the franchise license was given to the then official photographer of Miss Universe, Fadil Berisha who happened to be from Albania. At this point Fadil created the \"Miss Universe Albania\" organization and would held occasional yearly national pageant or in some cases, designate a participant to represent Albania at Miss Universe. Fadil would continue to be the national director until 2013.\n\nIn 2014 Eduart Deda acquired the Miss Universe franchise license in Albania and consequently also the [[Miss World]] franchise license. The company would held yearly national pageants where two winners were crowned to compete at Miss Universe and Miss World. The company would held the license of Miss World until 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the Miss World license was given to Vera Grabocka who was previously the national director of Miss World in Albania between 2006-2013,  while Eduart Deda only held the Miss Universe license.\n\n==Implementation and complaints==\nThe beauty contests are carried out by two different organizers: Vera Grabocka has been competing in the Miss Albania competition since 1991, and Petri Bozo and his Deliart Club have held the Miss Shqiperia elections important. Politically, Petri Bozo is associated with the Socialist Party, Vera Grabocka with the Democratic Party. The finalists take part in the election for Miss Europe, since 2002 also for Miss World and Miss Universe.\n\n[[Albanians]] from [[Kosovo]] can also be eliminated at the Miss Albania competition: Venera Mustafa became Miss Kosovo and Miss Albania in 1999. In the same year she participated for Albania and the Miss Europe election. Agnesa Vuthaj was a member of the Miss Kosovo in 2003, a member of the Miss Albania in 2004 and a candidate as a member of the Miss World in 2004 and the Miss Universe in 2005.\n\nMiss Universe Albania was launched in 2002 to become a participant in the Miss Universe international competition.\n\nEnkeleid Omi and his agency Alba-Media have been leading the competition for Miss Earth Albania, its winners and Miss Earth since 2005. Here too, all Albanians from Kosovo stand as candidates: The 2007 winner, Shpresa Vitia, stuck from there.\n\n==Titleholders==\n[[File:Angela-martini-profile.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Angela Martini]], Miss Universe Albania 2010]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!width=\"60\"|Year||width=\"250\"|Miss Universe Albania||width=\"100\"|Municipality\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2006|2006]]\n| Eralda Hitaj<ref name=albania2006>{{cite web |title=Eralda Hitaj |url=http://www.missuniverse.com/delegates/2006/files/AL.html |publisher=missuniverse.com |date=July 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701175802/http://www.missuniverse.com/delegates/2006/files/AL.html |archivedate=July 1, 2006}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]]\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2007|2007]]\n| [[Sadina Alla]]<ref name=albania2007>{{cite news |title=Miss Universe Presentation Show Gowns |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/missuniverse/popup.asp?gtitle=Miss%20Universe%20Presentation%20Show%20Gowns&SubID=2553&page=0&css=/photos/fashion.css |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=March 3, 2011 }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]]\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2008|2008]]\n| Matilda Mecini<ref name=albania2008>{{cite web |title=Beauties will attend Miss Universe 2008 |url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sl=vi&tl=en&u=http://www.xaluan.com/modules.php%3Fname%3DNews%26file%3Darticle%26sid%3D43162&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&usg=ALkJrhjkflaoLkq7H3nVoW-S-Gm2P2FlLw |publisher=xaluan.com |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]]\n|- \n| [[Miss Universe 2009|2009]]\n| [[Hasna Xhuki\u00e7i]]<ref name=albania2009>{{cite news |title=Miss Universe bikini photos |url=http://www.torontosun.com/life/2009/08/04/10372971.html |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=August 5, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n| [[Fier County|Fier]] \n|- \n| [[Miss Universe 2010|2010]]\n| [[Angela Martini]]<ref name=albania2010>{{cite news |title=Is Angela as beautiful as Linda? |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&tl=en&u=http://www.20min.ch/people/schweiz/story/24458584 |newspaper=[[20 Minuten]] |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n| [[Shkod\u00ebr County|Shkod\u00ebr]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2011|2011]]\n| Xhesika Berberi<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalbeauties.com/blog/2011/06/miss-universe-albania-2011/|title=Global Beauties - Miss Universe Albania 2011|work=Global Beauties|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227073313/http://www.globalbeauties.com/blog/2011/06/miss-universe-albania-2011/|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2012|2012]]\n| Adrola Dushi\n| [[Lezh\u00eb County|Lezh\u00eb]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2013|2013]]\n| [[Fioralba Dizdari]]\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2014|2014]]\n| [[Zhaneta Byberi]]\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2015|2015]]\n| [[Megi Luka]]\n| [[Fush\u00eb-Kruj\u00eb]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2016|2016]]\n| [[Lindita Idrizi]]\n| [[Elbasan]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2017|2017]]\n| Blerta Leka\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2018|2018]]\n| [[Trejsi Sejdini]]\n| [[Elbasan]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2019|2019]]\n| [[Cindy Marina]]\n| [[Shkod\u00ebr]]\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2020|2020]]\n| TBA\n| TBA\n|-\n|}\n\n===Wins by municipality===\n{| class=\"wikitable \" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!width=\"150\"|Municipality||width=\"50\"|Titles||width=\"250\"|Years\n|-\n| [[Tirana]]\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center\" | 7\n| 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017\n|-\n| [[Shkod\u00ebr]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center\" | 2\n| 2010, 2019\n|-\n| [[Elbasan]]\n| 2016, 2018\n|-\n| [[Fush\u00eb-Kruj\u00eb]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align: center\" | 1\n| 2015\n|-\n| [[Lezh\u00eb]]\n| 2012\n|-\n| [[Fier]]\n| 2009\n|-\n| [[Istog]]\n| 2005\n|-\n| [[Prishtina]]\n| 1999\n|-\n|}\n\n==Big Four pageants representatives==\n===Miss Universe===\n<poem>\n{{Color box|gold|border=black}} \u2013 Winner\n{{Color box|#FFFF66|border=black}} \u2013 Finalist\n{{Color box|#FFFF99|border=black}} \u2013 Semifinalist\n</poem>\nSince 2006, the winner of Miss Universe Albania has been sent to [[Miss Universe]].

The pageant was founded as Miss Albania in 2002, until rebranding as Miss Universe Albania in 2006. Since 2006, winners of the competition have competed internationally in [[Miss Universe]], while some runners-up have competed in [[Miss World]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Lola2.jpeg|thumb|230px|[[Floriana Garo]] represented Albania in the Miss World 2012 beauty pageant.]]\nAlbania debuted at Miss Universe in 2002 with the Miss Albania organization as the official franchise holder. The organization held national pageant yearly up into 2006. Beginning in 2007, the franchise license was given to the then official photographer of Miss Universe, Fadil Berisha who happened to be from Albania. At this point Fadil created the \"Miss Universe Albania\" organization and would held occasional yearly national pageant or in some cases, designate a participant to represent Albania at Miss Universe. Fadil would continue to be the national director until 2013.\n\nIn 2014 Eduart Deda acquired the Miss Universe franchise license in Albania and consequently also the [[Miss World]] franchise license. The company would held yearly national pageants where two winners were crowned to compete at Miss Universe and Miss World. The company would held the license of Miss World until 2017.\n\nIn 2018, the Miss World license was given to Vera Grabocka who was previously the national director of Miss World in Albania between 2006-2013,  while Eduart Deda only held the Miss Universe license.\n\n==Implementation and complaints==\nThe beauty contests are carried out by two different organizers: Vera Grabocka has been competing in the Miss Albania competition since 1991, and Petri Bozo and his Deliart Club have held the Miss Shqiperia elections important. Politically, Petri Bozo is associated with the Socialist Party, Vera Grabocka with the Democratic Party. The finalists take part in the election for Miss Europe, since 2002 also for Miss World and Miss Universe.\n\n[[Albanians]] from [[Kosovo]] can also be eliminated at the Miss Albania competition: Venera Mustafa became Miss Kosovo and Miss Albania in 1999. In the same year she participated for Albania and the Miss Europe election. Agnesa Vuthaj was a member of the Miss Kosovo in 2003, a member of the Miss Albania in 2004 and a candidate as a member of the Miss World in 2004 and the Miss Universe in 2005.\n\nMiss Universe Albania was launched in 2002 to become a participant in the Miss Universe international competition.\n\nEnkeleid Omi and his agency Alba-Media have been leading the competition for Miss Earth Albania, its winners and Miss Earth since 2005. Here too, all Albanians from Kosovo stand as candidates: The 2007 winner, Shpresa Vitia, stuck from there.\n\n==Titleholders==\n[[File:Angela-martini-profile.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Angela Martini]], Miss Universe Albania 2010]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!width=\"60\"|Year||width=\"250\"|Miss Universe Albania||width=\"100\"|Municipality\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2006|2006]]\n| Eralda Hitaj<ref name=albania2006>{{cite web |title=Eralda Hitaj |url=http://www.missuniverse.com/delegates/2006/files/AL.html |publisher=missuniverse.com |date=July 1, 2006 |accessdate=March 3, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701175802/http://www.missuniverse.com/delegates/2006/files/AL.html |archivedate=July 1, 2006}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]]\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2007|2007]]\n| [[Sadina Alla]]<ref name=albania2007>{{cite news |title=Miss Universe Presentation Show Gowns |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/missuniverse/popup.asp?gtitle=Miss%20Universe%20Presentation%20Show%20Gowns&SubID=2553&page=0&css=/photos/fashion.css |work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=May 23, 2007|accessdate=March 3, 2011 }} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]]\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2008|2008]]\n| Matilda Mecini<ref name=albania2008>{{cite web |title=Beauties will attend Miss Universe 2008 |url=http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&sl=vi&tl=en&u=http://www.xaluan.com/modules.php%3Fname%3DNews%26file%3Darticle%26sid%3D43162&prev=_t&rurl=translate.google.com&usg=ALkJrhjkflaoLkq7H3nVoW-S-Gm2P2FlLw |publisher=xaluan.com |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]]\n|- \n| [[Miss Universe 2009|2009]]\n| [[Hasna Xhuki\u00e7i]]<ref name=albania2009>{{cite news |title=Miss Universe bikini photos |url=http://www.torontosun.com/life/2009/08/04/10372971.html |newspaper=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=August 5, 2009 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n| [[Fier County|Fier]] \n|- \n| [[Miss Universe 2010|2010]]\n| [[Angela Martini]]<ref name=albania2010>{{cite news |title=Is Angela as beautiful as Linda? |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=de&tl=en&u=http://www.20min.ch/people/schweiz/story/24458584 |newspaper=[[20 Minuten]] |date=July 19, 2010 |accessdate=March 3, 2011}}</ref>\n| [[Shkod\u00ebr County|Shkod\u00ebr]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2011|2011]]\n| [[Xhesika Berberi]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalbeauties.com/blog/2011/06/miss-universe-albania-2011/|title=Global Beauties - Miss Universe Albania 2011|work=Global Beauties|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227073313/http://www.globalbeauties.com/blog/2011/06/miss-universe-albania-2011/|archivedate=December 27, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2012|2012]]\n| Adrola Dushi\n| [[Lezh\u00eb County|Lezh\u00eb]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2013|2013]]\n| [[Fioralba Dizdari]]\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2014|2014]]\n| [[Zhaneta Byberi]]\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2015|2015]]\n| [[Megi Luka]]\n| [[Fush\u00eb-Kruj\u00eb]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2016|2016]]\n| [[Lindita Idrizi]]\n| [[Elbasan]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2017|2017]]\n| Blerta Leka\n| [[Tirana]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2018|2018]]\n| [[Trejsi Sejdini]]\n| [[Elbasan]] \n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2019|2019]]\n| [[Cindy Marina]]\n| [[Shkod\u00ebr]]\n|-\n| [[Miss Universe 2020|2020]]\n| TBA\n| TBA\n|-\n|}\n\n===Wins by municipality===\n{| class=\"wikitable \" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!width=\"150\"|Municipality||width=\"50\"|Titles||width=\"250\"|Years\n|-\n| [[Tirana]]\n| rowspan=\"1\" style=\"text-align: center\" | 7\n| 2006, 2007, 2008, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2017\n|-\n| [[Shkod\u00ebr]]\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align: center\" | 2\n| 2010, 2019\n|-\n| [[Elbasan]]\n| 2016, 2018\n|-\n| [[Fush\u00eb-Kruj\u00eb]]\n| rowspan=\"5\" style=\"text-align: center\" | 1\n| 2015\n|-\n| [[Lezh\u00eb]]\n| 2012\n|-\n| [[Fier]]\n| 2009\n|-\n| [[Istog]]\n| 2005\n|-\n| [[Prishtina]]\n| 1999\n|-\n|}\n\n==Big Four pageants representatives==\n===Miss Universe===\n<poem>\n{{Color box|gold|border=black}} \u2013 Winner\n{{Color box|#FFFF66|border=black}} \u2013 Finalist\n{{Color box|#FFFF99|border=black}} \u2013 Semifinalist\n</poem>\nSince 2006, the winner of Miss Universe Albania has been sent to [[Miss Universe]].

{"title_page": "Food preservation", "text_new": "{{pp|small=yes}}\n{{short description|Inhibition of microbial growth in food}}\n'''Food preservation''' prevents the growth of [[microorganism]]s (such as [[yeast]]s), or other microorganisms (although some methods work by introducing benign [[bacteria]] or fungi to the food), as well as slowing the [[redox|oxidation]] of [[fat]]s that cause [[Rancidification|rancidity]]. Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the [[enzymatic browning]] reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation.\n\nMany processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method. Preserving fruit by turning it into jam, for example, involves boiling (to reduce the fruit's moisture content and to kill bacteria, etc.), sugaring (to prevent their re-growth) and sealing within an airtight jar (to prevent recontamination). Some traditional methods of preserving food have been shown to have a lower [[Waste hierarchy|energy input]] and [[carbon footprint]], when compared to modern methods.<ref>[http://www.chelseagreen.com/authors/_gardeners_farmers_of_terre_vivante/ \"Preserving Food without Freezing or Canning, Chelsea Green Publishing, 1999\"]</ref>\n\nSome methods of food preservation are known to create [[carcinogen]]s. In 2015, the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] of the [[World Health Organization]] classified processed meat, i.e. meat that has undergone salting, curing, fermenting, and smoking, as \"[[carcinogenic]] to humans\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/news/world-health-organization-says-processed-meat-causes-cancer|title=World Health Organization Says Processed Meat Causes Cancer|author= Stacy Simon |work=Cancer.org |date= 26 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-34615621 |title = Processed meats do cause cancer \u2013 WHO|author= James Gallagher|work= BBC |date=26 October 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.iarc.fr/en/media-centre/pr/2015/pdfs/pr240_E.pdf| title=IARC Monographs evaluate consumption of red meat and processed meat |work= International Agency for Research on Cancer |date= 26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nMaintaining or creating nutritional value, [[wikt:texture|texture]] and [[flavor]] is an important aspect of food preservation.\n\n== Traditional techniques ==\nNew techniques of food preservation became available to the home chef from the dawn of [[agriculture]] until the [[Industrial Revolution]].\n\n=== Curing ===\n[[File:Prague powder No 1.jpg|thumb|Bag of Prague powder#1, also known as \"[[curing salt]]\" or \"pink salt\". It is typically a combination of salt and sodium nitrite, with the pink color added to distinguish it from ordinary salt.]]\n{{Main|Curing (food preservation)}}\nThe earliest form of curing was dehydration or [[Food drying|drying]], used as early as 12,000&nbsp;BC. [[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] and [[salting (food)|salting]] techniques improve on the drying process and add antimicrobial agents that aid in preservation. Smoke deposits a number of pyrolysis products onto the food, including the [[phenol]]s [[syringol]], [[guaiacol]] and [[catechol]].<ref name=\"Msagati, T. 2012\">Msagati, T. (2012). \"The Chemistry of Food Additives and Preservatives\"</ref> Salt accelerates the drying process using [[osmosis]] and also inhibits the growth of several common strains of bacteria. More recently [[nitrite]]s have been used to cure meat, contributing a characteristic pink colour.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nummer|first1=Brian|last2=Andress|first2=Elizabeth|title=Curing and Smoking Meats for Home Food Preservation|url=http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/lit_rev/cure_smoke_cure.html|publisher=National Center for Home Food Preservation|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Cooling ===\n{{Main|Refrigeration}}\n[[Refrigeration|Cooling]] preserves food by slowing down the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and the action of enzymes that causes the food to rot. The introduction of commercial and domestic refrigerators drastically improved the diets of many in the [[Western world]] by allowing food such as fresh fruit, salads and dairy products to be stored safely for longer periods, particularly during warm weather.\n\nBefore the era of mechanical refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred in the forms of [[root cellar]]s and [[icebox]]es. Rural people often did their own [[ice cutting]], whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the [[ice trade]]. Today, root cellaring remains popular among people who value various goals, including [[local food]], [[heirloom plant|heirloom crops]], traditional home [[list of cooking techniques|cooking techniques]], [[family farm]]ing, [[frugality]], [[self-sufficiency]], [[organic farming]], and others.\n\n=== Freezing ===\n\n{{Main|Frozen food}}\n[[Freezing]] is also one of the most commonly used processes, both commercially and domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods, including prepared foods that would not have required freezing in their unprepared state. For example, potato waffles are stored in the freezer, but potatoes themselves require only a cool dark place to ensure many months' storage. Cold stores provide large-volume, long-term storage for strategic food stocks held in case of national emergency in many countries.\n\n=== Boiling ===\n{{Main|Boiling}}\nBoiling liquid food items can kill any existing microbes. Milk and water are often boiled to kill any harmful microbes that may be present in them.\n\n=== Heating ===\nHeating to temperatures which are sufficient to kill microorganisms inside the food is a method used with [[perpetual stew]]s. Milk is also boiled before storing to kill many microorganisms.\n\n=== Sugaring ===\n{{see also |Sugaring}}\nThe earliest cultures have used [[sugar]] as a [[preservative]], and it was commonplace to store [[fruit]] in [[honey]]. Similar to pickled foods, [[sugar cane]] was brought to Europe through the trade routes. In northern climates without sufficient sun to dry foods, [[preserves]] are made by heating the fruit with sugar.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\">Nummer, B. (2002). \"Historical Origins of Food Preservation\" http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html. (Accessed on 5 May 2014)</ref> \"Sugar tends to draw water from the microbes (plasmolysis). This process leaves the microbial cells dehydrated, thus killing them.  In this way, the food will remain safe from microbial spoilage.\"<ref name=\"Msagati, T. 2012\" /> Sugar is used to preserve fruits, either in an [[antimicrobial]] syrup with fruit such as [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, and [[plum]]s, or in crystallized form where the preserved material is cooked in sugar to the point of crystallization and the resultant product is then stored dry. This method is used for the skins of [[citrus]] fruit (candied peel), [[angelica]], and [[ginger]]. Also, sugaring can be used in the production of [[jam]] and [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]].\n\n=== Pickling ===\n{{Main|Pickling}}\nPickling is a method of preserving food in an edible, antimicrobial liquid. Pickling can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical pickling and fermentation pickling.\n\nIn chemical pickling, the food is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include [[brine]] (high in salt), [[vinegar]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], and [[vegetable oil]]. Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent. Common chemically pickled foods include [[Pickled cucumber|cucumbers]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[corned beef]], [[herring]], and [[Pickled egg|eggs]], as well as mixed vegetables such as [[piccalilli]].\n\nIn fermentation pickling, bacteria in the liquid produce [[organic acid]]s as preservation agents, typically by a process that produces [[lactic acid]] through the presence of [[lactobacillales]]. Fermented pickles include [[sauerkraut]], [[nukazuke]], [[kimchi]], and [[surstr\u00f6mming]].\n\n=== Lye ===\n{{main|Sodium hydroxide#Food preparation}}\n[[Sodium hydroxide]] ([[lye]]) makes food too [[alkaline]] for bacterial growth. Lye will [[saponification|saponify]] fats in the food, which will change its flavor and texture. [[Lutefisk]] uses lye in its preparation, as do some olive recipes. Modern recipes for [[century egg]]s also call for lye.\n\n=== Canning ===\n\n[[File:PreservedFood1.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved food]]\n{{Main|Canning}}\n{{See also|Home canning}}\n[[Canning]] involves cooking food, sealing it in sterilized cans or jars, and [[boiling]] the containers to kill or weaken any remaining bacteria as a form of [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. It was invented by the French confectioner [[Nicolas Appert]].<ref>''Nicolas Appert inventeur et humaniste'' by Jean-Paul Barbier, Paris, 1994 and http://www.appert-aina.com</ref> By 1806, this process was used by the French Navy to preserve meat, fruit, vegetables, and even milk.  Although Appert had discovered a new way of preservation, it wasn't understood until 1864 when [[Louis Pasteur]] found the relationship between microorganisms, food spoilage, and illness.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\" />\n\nFoods have varying degrees of natural protection against spoilage and may require that the final step occur in a [[pressure cooker]]. High-acid fruits like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] require no preservatives to can and only a short boiling cycle, whereas marginal vegetables such as [[carrot]]s require longer boiling and addition of other acidic elements. Low-acid foods, such as vegetables and meats, require pressure canning. Food preserved by canning or bottling is at immediate risk of spoilage once the can or bottle has been opened.\n\nLack of quality control in the canning process may allow ingress of water or micro-organisms. Most such failures are rapidly detected as decomposition within the can causes gas production and the can will swell or burst. However, there have been examples of poor manufacture (underprocessing) and poor [[hygiene]] allowing contamination of canned food by the obligate [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobe]] ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', which produces an acute toxin within the food, leading to severe illness or death. This organism produces no gas or obvious taste and remains undetected by taste or smell. Its toxin is denatured by cooking, however. Cooked [[mushroom]]s, handled poorly and then canned, can support the growth of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', which produces a toxin that is not destroyed by canning or subsequent reheating.\n\n=== Jellying ===\n{{Main|Aspic}}Secondary article: Fruit Preserves{{See also|Potted shrimps|Confit}}\nFood may be preserved by cooking in a material that solidifies to form a gel. Such materials include [[gelatin]], [[agar]], [[maize]] flour, and [[arrowroot]] flour. Some foods naturally form a [[protein]] gel when cooked, such as [[Eel|eels and elvers]], and [[Sipuncula|sipunculid]] worms, which are a delicacy in [[Xiamen]], in the Fujian province of the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Jellied eel]]s are a delicacy in the East End of [[London]], where they are eaten with mashed potatoes. Potted meats in [[aspic]] (a gel made from gelatin and clarified meat broth) were a common way of serving meat off-cuts in the UK until the 1950s. Many [[jugging|jugged]] meats are also jellied. A traditional British way of preserving meat (particularly [[Potted shrimps|shrimp]]) is by setting it in a pot and sealing it with a layer of fat. Also common is potted chicken liver; jellying is one of the steps in producing traditional [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]]s. \n\nBesides jellying of meat and seafood, a widely known type of Jellying is fruit preserves which are preparations of fruits, vegetables and sugar, often stored in glass jam jars and Mason jars. Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot, and savory preserves, such as those made from tomatoes or squash. The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, \"preserves\" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies. \n\n=== Jugging ===\n{{Main|Jugging}}\nMeat can be preserved by jugging. Jugging is the process of [[stewing]] the meat (commonly [[game (food)|game]] or [[fish]]) in a covered [[earthenware]] jug or [[casserole]]. The animal to be jugged is usually cut into pieces, placed into a tightly-sealed jug with brine or [[gravy]], and stewed. [[Red wine]] and/or the animal's own blood is sometimes added to the cooking liquid. Jugging was a popular method of preserving meat up until the middle of the 20th century.\n\n=== Burial ===\nBurial of food can preserve it due to a variety of factors: lack of light, lack of oxygen, cool temperatures, pH level, or [[desiccant]]s in the soil. Burial may be combined with other methods such as salting or fermentation. Most foods can be preserved in soil that is very dry and salty (thus a desiccant) such as sand, or soil that is frozen.\n\nMany [[root vegetables]] are very resistant to spoilage and require no other preservation than storage in cool dark conditions, for example by burial in the ground, such as in a [[storage clamp]]. [[Century egg]]s are traditionally created by placing eggs in alkaline mud (or other alkaline substance), resulting in their \"inorganic\" fermentation through raised pH instead of spoiling. The fermentation preserves them and breaks down some of the complex, less flavorful proteins and fats into simpler, more flavorful ones. [[Cabbage]] was traditionally buried during [[Autumn]] in northern US farms for preservation. Some methods keep it crispy while other methods produce [[sauerkraut]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} A similar process is used in the traditional production of [[kimchi]]. Sometimes meat is buried under conditions that cause preservation. If buried on hot coals or ashes, the heat can kill pathogens, the dry ash can desiccate, and the earth can block oxygen and further contamination. If buried where the earth is very cold, the earth acts like a refrigerator.\n\nIn [[Orissa, India]], it is practical to store rice by burying it underground. This method helps to store for three to six months during the dry season.\n\nButter and similar substances have been preserved as [[bog butter]] in Irish [[peat bogs]] for centuries.\n\n=== Confit ===\nMeat can be preserved by salting it, cooking it at or near 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in some kind of [[fat]] (such as [[lard]] or [[tallow]]), and then storing it immersed in the fat.  These preparations were popular in Europe before refrigerators became ubiquitous.  They are still popular in [[France]], where they are called ''[[confit]]''.<ref name=aidells>Bruce Aidells (2012): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN4t61JFQe4C&pg=PA429 The Great Meat Cookbook]'', page 429. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 632 pages. {{ISBN|9780547241418}}</ref><ref name=jung>Susan Jung (2012): \"[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1073828/truc-confit-fat-fabulous-way-preserve-meat Truc: confit, a fat-fabulous way to preserve meat]\". ''Post Magazine'', online article, posted on 2012-11-03, accessed on 2019-02-21.</ref>  The preparation will keep longer if stored in a cold cellar or buried in cold ground.\n\n=== Fermentation ===\n{{See also|Fermentation (food)}}\nSome foods, such as many [[cheese]]s, [[wine]]s, and [[beer]]s, use specific micro-organisms that combat spoilage from other less-benign organisms. These micro-organisms keep pathogens in check by creating an environment toxic for themselves and other micro-organisms by producing acid or alcohol. Methods of fermentation include, but are not limited to, starter micro-organisms, salt, hops, controlled (usually cool) temperatures and controlled (usually low) levels of oxygen. These methods are used to create the specific controlled conditions that will support the desirable organisms that produce food fit for human consumption.\n\nFermentation is the microbial conversion of starch and sugars into alcohol. Not only can fermentation produce alcohol, but it can also be a valuable preservation technique. Fermentation can also make foods more nutritious and palatable. For example, drinking water in the Middle Ages was dangerous because it often contained pathogens that could spread disease. When the water is made into beer, the boiling during the brewing process kills any bacteria in the water that could make people sick. Additionally, the water now has the nutrients from the barley and other ingredients, and the microorganisms can also produce vitamins as they ferment.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\" />\n\n== Modern industrial techniques ==\nTechniques of food preservation were developed in research laboratories for commercial applications.\n\n=== Pasteurization ===\n{{Main|Pasteurization}}\nPasteurization is a process for preservation of liquid food. It was originally applied to combat the souring of young local wines. Today, the process is mainly applied to dairy products. In this method, milk is heated at about {{cvt|70|C|F}} for 15\u201330 seconds to kill the bacteria present in it and cooling it quickly to {{cvt|10|C|F}} to prevent the remaining bacteria from growing. The milk is then stored in sterilized bottles or pouches in cold places. This method was invented by [[Louis Pasteur]], a [[French people|French]] chemist, in 1862.\n\n=== Vacuum packing ===\n{{Main|Vacuum packing}}\nVacuum-packing stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag or bottle. The [[vacuum]] environment strips bacteria of oxygen needed for survival. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storing [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] to reduce loss of flavor from oxidization. A major drawback to vacuum packaging, at the consumer level, is that vacuum sealing can deform contents and rob certain foods, such as cheese, of its flavor.\n\n=== Freeze drying ===\n{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\n{{main|Freeze drying}}\n\n=== Artificial food additives ===\n{{Main|Preservatives}}\n{{Main|Sulfite food and beverage additives}}\nPreservative food additives can be ''antimicrobial''\u2014which inhibit the growth of [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[Fungus|fungi]], including [[Mold (fungus)|mold]]\u2014or ''[[antioxidant]]'', such as [[oxygen absorber]]s, which inhibit the [[oxidation]] of food constituents. Common antimicrobial preservatives include [[calcium propionate]], [[sodium nitrate]], [[sodium nitrite]], [[sulfite]]s ([[sulfur dioxide]], [[sodium bisulfite]], [[potassium hydrogen sulfite]], etc.), and [[EDTA]]. [[Antioxidant]]s include [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT). Other preservatives include [[formaldehyde]] (usually in solution), [[glutaraldehyde]] (insecticide), [[ethanol]], and [[methylchloroisothiazolinone]].\n\n=== Irradiation ===\n{{Main|Food irradiation}}\nIrradiation of food<ref>anon., Food Irradation \u2013 A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food, WHO, Geneva, 1991</ref> is the exposure of food to [[ionizing radiation]]. Multiple types of ionizing radiation can be used, including [[beta particle]]s (high-energy [[electron]]s) and [[gamma ray]]s (emitted from radioactive sources such as [[cobalt-60]] or [[cesium-137]]). Irradiation can kill bacteria, molds, and insect pests, reduce the ripening and spoiling of fruits, and at higher doses induce sterility. The technology may be compared to [[pasteurization]]; it is sometimes called \"cold pasteurization\", as the product is not heated. Irradiation may allow lower-quality or contaminated foods to be rendered marketable.\n\nNational and international expert bodies have declared food irradiation as \"wholesome\"; organizations of the [[United Nations]], such as the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], endorse food irradiation.<ref name=\"JECFI\">World Health Organization.

Activists have also opposed food irradiation for other reasons, for example, arguing that irradiation can be used to sterilize contaminated food without resolving the underlying cause of the contamination.<ref>Hauter, W. & Worth, M., ''Zapped! Irradiation and the Death of Food'', Food & Water Watch Press, Washington, DC, 2008</ref> International legislation on whether food may be irradiated or not varies worldwide from no regulation to a full ban.<ref>[http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif NUCLEUS \u2013 Food Irradiation Clearances<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526025627/http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif |date=26 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nApproximately 500,000 tons of food items are irradiated per year worldwide in over 40 countries.

PEF holds potential as a type of low-temperature alternative pasteurization process for sterilizing food products. In PEF processing, a substance is placed between two electrodes, then the pulsed electric field is applied. The electric field enlarges the pores of the cell membranes, which kills the cells and releases their contents. PEF for food processing is a developing technology still being researched. There have been limited industrial applications of PEF processing for the pasteurization of fruit juices. To date, several PEF treated juices are available on the market in Europe. Furthermore, for several years a juice pasteurization application in the US has used PEF. For cell disintegration purposes especially potato processors show great interest in PEF technology as an efficient alternative for their preheaters. Potato applications are already operational in the US and Canada. There are also commercial PEF potato applications in various countries in Europe, as well as in Australia, India, and China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elea-technology.com|title=Elea Pulsed Electric Field Technology |last=|first=|date=|website=www.elea-technology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Modified atmosphere ===\n{{Main|Modified atmosphere}}\n\nModifying atmosphere is a way to preserve food by operating on the atmosphere around it. Salad crops that are notoriously difficult to preserve are now being packaged in sealed bags with an atmosphere modified to reduce the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) concentration and increase the [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration. There is concern that, although salad vegetables retain their appearance and texture in such conditions, this method of preservation may not retain nutrients, especially [[vitamin]]s.\nThere are two methods for preserving grains with carbon dioxide. One method is placing a block of [[dry ice]] in the bottom and filling the can with the grain. Another method is purging the container from the bottom by gaseous carbon dioxide from a cylinder or bulk supply vessel.\n\n[[Carbon dioxide]] prevents insects and, depending on concentration, [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] and [[oxidation]] from damaging the grain. Grain stored in this way can remain edible for approximately five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://entomology.k-state.edu/doc/finished-chapters/s156-ch-16-contr-or-mod-atmospheres--mar2.pdf|title=Controlled or Modified Atmospheres|last=Navarro|first=Shlomo|last2=Timlick|first2=Blaine|date=March 2012|website=k-state.edu|access-date=17 March 2018|last3=Demianyk|first3=Colin|last4=White|first4=Noel}}</ref>\n\n[[Nitrogen]] gas (N<sub>2</sub>) at concentrations of 98% or higher is also used effectively to kill insects in the grain through [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref>Annis, P.C. and Dowsett, H.A. 1993. Low oxygen disinfestation of grain: exposure periods needed for high mortality. Proc. International Conference on Controlled Atmosphere and Fumigation. Winnipeg, June 1992, Caspit Press, Jerusalem, pp. 71\u201383.</ref> However, carbon dioxide has an advantage in this respect, as it kills organisms through [[hypercarbia]] and hypoxia (depending on concentration), but it requires concentrations of above 35%,<ref>Annis, P.C. and Morton, R. 1997.

This makes carbon dioxide preferable for fumigation in situations where a [[hermetic seal]] cannot be maintained.\n\nControlled Atmospheric Storage (CA): \"CA storage is a non-chemical process. Oxygen levels in the sealed rooms are reduced, usually by the infusion of nitrogen gas, from the approximate 21 percent in the air we breathe to 1 percent or 2 percent. Temperatures are kept at a constant {{cvt|0\u20132|C|F}}. Humidity is maintained at 95 percent and carbon dioxide levels are also controlled. Exact conditions in the rooms are set according to the apple variety. Researchers develop specific regimens for each variety to achieve the best quality. Computers help keep conditions constant.\"\n\"Eastern Washington, where most of Washington\u2019s apples are grown, has enough warehouse storage for 181 million boxes of fruit, according to a report done in 1997 by managers for the Washington State Department of Agriculture Plant Services Division. The storage capacity study shows that 67 percent of that space\u2014enough for 121,008,000 boxes of apples\u2014is CA storage.\"\n<ref>[http://www.bestapples.com/facts/facts_controlled.aspx Controlled Atmospheric Storage (CA) :: Washington State Apple Commission<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAir-tight storage of grains (sometimes called hermetic storage) relies on the respiration of grain, insects, and fungi that can modify the enclosed atmosphere sufficiently to control insect pests. This is a method of great antiquity,<ref>Various authors, Session 1: Natural Air-Tight Storage In: Shejbal, J., ed., Controlled Atmosphere Storage of Grains, Elsevier: Amsterdam, 1\u201333</ref> as well as having modern equivalents.

Food preservation may also include processes that inhibit visual deterioration, such as the [[enzymatic browning]] reaction in apples after they are cut during food preparation.\n\nMany processes designed to preserve food involve more than one food preservation method. Preserving fruit by turning it into jam, for example, involves boiling (to reduce the fruit's moisture content and to kill bacteria, etc.), sugaring (to prevent their re-growth) and sealing within an airtight jar (to prevent recontamination). Some traditional methods of preserving food have been shown to have a lower [[Waste hierarchy|energy input]] and [[carbon footprint]], when compared to modern methods.<ref>[http://www.chelseagreen.com/authors/_gardeners_farmers_of_terre_vivante/ \"Preserving Food without Freezing or Canning, Chelsea Green Publishing, 1999\"]</ref>\n\nSome methods of food preservation are known to create [[carcinogen]]s.

It is typically a combination of salt and sodium nitrite, with the pink color added to distinguish it from ordinary salt.]]\n{{Main|Curing (food preservation)}}\nThe earliest form of curing was dehydration or [[Food drying|drying]], used as early as 12,000&nbsp;BC. [[Smoking (cooking)|Smoking]] and [[salting (food)|salting]] techniques improve on the drying process and add antimicrobial agents that aid in preservation. Smoke deposits a number of pyrolysis products onto the food, including the [[phenol]]s [[syringol]], [[guaiacol]] and [[catechol]].<ref name=\"Msagati, T. 2012\">Msagati, T. (2012). \"The Chemistry of Food Additives and Preservatives\"</ref> Salt accelerates the drying process using [[osmosis]] and also inhibits the growth of several common strains of bacteria. More recently [[nitrite]]s have been used to cure meat, contributing a characteristic pink colour.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nummer|first1=Brian|last2=Andress|first2=Elizabeth|title=Curing and Smoking Meats for Home Food Preservation|url=http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/lit_rev/cure_smoke_cure.html|publisher=National Center for Home Food Preservation|date=June 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Cooling ===\n{{Main|Refrigeration}}\n[[Refrigeration|Cooling]] preserves food by slowing down the growth and reproduction of microorganisms and the action of enzymes that causes the food to rot. The introduction of commercial and domestic refrigerators drastically improved the diets of many in the [[Western world]] by allowing food such as fresh fruit, salads and dairy products to be stored safely for longer periods, particularly during warm weather.\n\nBefore the era of mechanical refrigeration, cooling for food storage occurred in the forms of [[root cellar]]s and [[icebox]]es. Rural people often did their own [[ice cutting]], whereas town and city dwellers often relied on the [[ice trade]]. Today, root cellaring remains popular among people who value various goals, including [[local food]], [[heirloom plant|heirloom crops]], traditional home [[list of cooking techniques|cooking techniques]], [[family farm]]ing, [[frugality]], [[self-sufficiency]], [[organic farming]], and others.\n\n=== Freezing ===\n\n{{Main|Frozen food}}\n[[Freezing]] is also one of the most commonly used processes, both commercially and domestically, for preserving a very wide range of foods, including prepared foods that would not have required freezing in their unprepared state. For example, potato waffles are stored in the freezer, but potatoes themselves require only a cool dark place to ensure many months' storage. Cold stores provide large-volume, long-term storage for strategic food stocks held in case of national emergency in many countries.\n\n=== Boiling ===\n{{Main|Boiling}}\nBoiling liquid food items can kill any existing microbes. Milk and water are often boiled to kill any harmful microbes that may be present in them.\n\n=== Heating ===\nHeating to temperatures which are sufficient to kill microorganisms inside the food is a method used with [[perpetual stew]]s. Milk is also boiled before storing to kill many microorganisms.\n\n=== Sugaring ===\n{{see also |Sugaring}}\nThe earliest cultures have used [[sugar]] as a [[preservative]], and it was commonplace to store [[fruit]] in [[honey]]. Similar to pickled foods, [[sugar cane]] was brought to Europe through the trade routes. In northern climates without sufficient sun to dry foods, [[preserves]] are made by heating the fruit with sugar.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\">Nummer, B. (2002). \"Historical Origins of Food Preservation\" http://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/factsheets/food_pres_hist.html. (Accessed on 5 May 2014)</ref> \"Sugar tends to draw water from the microbes (plasmolysis). This process leaves the microbial cells dehydrated, thus killing them.  In this way, the food will remain safe from microbial spoilage.\"<ref name=\"Msagati, T. 2012\" /> Sugar is used to preserve fruits, either in an [[antimicrobial]] syrup with fruit such as [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, [[peach]]es, [[apricot]]s, and [[plum]]s, or in crystallized form where the preserved material is cooked in sugar to the point of crystallization and the resultant product is then stored dry. This method is used for the skins of [[citrus]] fruit (candied peel), [[angelica]], and [[ginger]]. Also, sugaring can be used in the production of [[jam]] and [[Jelly (fruit preserves)|jelly]].\n\n=== Pickling ===\n{{Main|Pickling}}\nPickling is a method of preserving food in an edible, antimicrobial liquid. Pickling can be broadly classified into two categories: chemical pickling and fermentation pickling.\n\nIn chemical pickling, the food is placed in an edible liquid that inhibits or kills bacteria and other microorganisms. Typical pickling agents include [[brine]] (high in salt), [[vinegar]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], and [[vegetable oil]]. Many chemical pickling processes also involve heating or boiling so that the food being preserved becomes saturated with the pickling agent. Common chemically pickled foods include [[Pickled cucumber|cucumbers]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[corned beef]], [[herring]], and [[Pickled egg|eggs]], as well as mixed vegetables such as [[piccalilli]].\n\nIn fermentation pickling, bacteria in the liquid produce [[organic acid]]s as preservation agents, typically by a process that produces [[lactic acid]] through the presence of [[lactobacillales]]. Fermented pickles include [[sauerkraut]], [[nukazuke]], [[kimchi]], and [[surstr\u00f6mming]].\n\n=== Lye ===\n{{main|Sodium hydroxide#Food preparation}}\n[[Sodium hydroxide]] ([[lye]]) makes food too [[alkaline]] for bacterial growth. Lye will [[saponification|saponify]] fats in the food, which will change its flavor and texture. [[Lutefisk]] uses lye in its preparation, as do some olive recipes. Modern recipes for [[century egg]]s also call for lye.\n\n=== Canning ===\n\n[[File:PreservedFood1.jpg|thumb|right|Preserved food]]\n{{Main|Canning}}\n{{See also|Home canning}}\n[[Canning]] involves cooking food, sealing it in sterilized cans or jars, and [[boiling]] the containers to kill or weaken any remaining bacteria as a form of [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. It was invented by the French confectioner [[Nicolas Appert]].<ref>''Nicolas Appert inventeur et humaniste'' by Jean-Paul Barbier, Paris, 1994 and http://www.appert-aina.com</ref> By 1806, this process was used by the French Navy to preserve meat, fruit, vegetables, and even milk.  Although Appert had discovered a new way of preservation, it wasn't understood until 1864 when [[Louis Pasteur]] found the relationship between microorganisms, food spoilage, and illness.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\" />\n\nFoods have varying degrees of natural protection against spoilage and may require that the final step occur in a [[pressure cooker]]. High-acid fruits like [[Strawberry|strawberries]] require no preservatives to can and only a short boiling cycle, whereas marginal vegetables such as [[carrot]]s require longer boiling and addition of other acidic elements. Low-acid foods, such as vegetables and meats, require pressure canning. Food preserved by canning or bottling is at immediate risk of spoilage once the can or bottle has been opened.\n\nLack of quality control in the canning process may allow ingress of water or micro-organisms. Most such failures are rapidly detected as decomposition within the can causes gas production and the can will swell or burst. However, there have been examples of poor manufacture (underprocessing) and poor [[hygiene]] allowing contamination of canned food by the obligate [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobe]] ''[[Clostridium botulinum]]'', which produces an acute toxin within the food, leading to severe illness or death. This organism produces no gas or obvious taste and remains undetected by taste or smell. Its toxin is denatured by cooking, however. Cooked [[mushroom]]s, handled poorly and then canned, can support the growth of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', which produces a toxin that is not destroyed by canning or subsequent reheating.\n\n=== Jellying ===\n{{Main|Aspic}}Secondary article: Fruit Preserves{{See also|Potted shrimps|Confit}}\nFood may be preserved by cooking in a material that solidifies to form a gel. Such materials include [[gelatin]], [[agar]], [[maize]] flour, and [[arrowroot]] flour. Some foods naturally form a [[protein]] gel when cooked, such as [[Eel|eels and elvers]], and [[Sipuncula|sipunculid]] worms, which are a delicacy in [[Xiamen]], in the Fujian province of the [[People's Republic of China]]. [[Jellied eel]]s are a delicacy in the East End of [[London]], where they are eaten with mashed potatoes. Potted meats in [[aspic]] (a gel made from gelatin and clarified meat broth) were a common way of serving meat off-cuts in the UK until the 1950s. Many [[jugging|jugged]] meats are also jellied. A traditional British way of preserving meat (particularly [[Potted shrimps|shrimp]]) is by setting it in a pot and sealing it with a layer of fat. Also common is potted chicken liver; jellying is one of the steps in producing traditional [[p\u00e2t\u00e9]]s. \n\nBesides jellying of meat and seafood, a widely known type of Jellying is fruit preserves which are preparations of fruits, vegetables and sugar, often stored in glass jam jars and Mason jars. Many varieties of fruit preserves are made globally, including sweet fruit preserves, such as those made from strawberry or apricot, and savory preserves, such as those made from tomatoes or squash. The ingredients used and how they are prepared determine the type of preserves; jams, jellies, and marmalades are all examples of different styles of fruit preserves that vary based upon the fruit used. In English, the word, in plural form, \"preserves\" is used to describe all types of jams and jellies. \n\n=== Jugging ===\n{{Main|Jugging}}\nMeat can be preserved by jugging. Jugging is the process of [[stewing]] the meat (commonly [[game (food)|game]] or [[fish]]) in a covered [[earthenware]] jug or [[casserole]]. The animal to be jugged is usually cut into pieces, placed into a tightly-sealed jug with brine or [[gravy]], and stewed. [[Red wine]] and/or the animal's own blood is sometimes added to the cooking liquid. Jugging was a popular method of preserving meat up until the middle of the 20th century.\n\n=== Burial ===\nBurial of food can preserve it due to a variety of factors: lack of light, lack of oxygen, cool temperatures, pH level, or [[desiccant]]s in the soil. Burial may be combined with other methods such as salting or fermentation. Most foods can be preserved in soil that is very dry and salty (thus a desiccant) such as sand, or soil that is frozen.\n\nMany [[root vegetables]] are very resistant to spoilage and require no other preservation than storage in cool dark conditions, for example by burial in the ground, such as in a [[storage clamp]]. [[Century egg]]s are traditionally created by placing eggs in alkaline mud (or other alkaline substance), resulting in their \"inorganic\" fermentation through raised pH instead of spoiling. The fermentation preserves them and breaks down some of the complex, less flavorful proteins and fats into simpler, more flavorful ones. [[Cabbage]] was traditionally buried during [[Autumn]] in northern US farms for preservation. Some methods keep it crispy while other methods produce [[sauerkraut]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} A similar process is used in the traditional production of [[kimchi]]. Sometimes meat is buried under conditions that cause preservation. If buried on hot coals or ashes, the heat can kill pathogens, the dry ash can desiccate, and the earth can block oxygen and further contamination. If buried where the earth is very cold, the earth acts like a refrigerator.\n\nIn [[Orissa, India]], it is practical to store rice by burying it underground. This method helps to store for three to six months during the dry season.\n\nButter and similar substances have been preserved as [[bog butter]] in Irish [[peat bogs]] for centuries.\n\n=== Confit ===\nMeat can be preserved by salting it, cooking it at or near 100&nbsp;\u00b0C in some kind of [[fat]] (such as [[lard]] or [[tallow]]), and then storing it immersed in the fat.  These preparations were popular in Europe before refrigerators became ubiquitous.  They are still popular in [[France]], where they are called ''[[confit]]''.<ref name=aidells>Bruce Aidells (2012): ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YN4t61JFQe4C&pg=PA429 The Great Meat Cookbook]'', page 429. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt; 632 pages. {{ISBN|9780547241418}}</ref><ref name=jung>Susan Jung (2012): \"[https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1073828/truc-confit-fat-fabulous-way-preserve-meat Truc: confit, a fat-fabulous way to preserve meat]\". ''Post Magazine'', online article, posted on 2012-11-03, accessed on 2019-02-21.</ref>  The preparation will keep longer if stored in a cold cellar or buried in cold ground.\n\n=== Fermentation ===\n{{See also|Fermentation (food)}}\nSome foods, such as many [[cheese]]s, [[wine]]s, and [[beer]]s, use specific micro-organisms that combat spoilage from other less-benign organisms. These micro-organisms keep pathogens in check by creating an environment toxic for themselves and other micro-organisms by producing acid or alcohol. Methods of fermentation include, but are not limited to, starter micro-organisms, salt, hops, controlled (usually cool) temperatures and controlled (usually low) levels of oxygen. These methods are used to create the specific controlled conditions that will support the desirable organisms that produce food fit for human consumption.\n\nFermentation is the microbial conversion of starch and sugars into alcohol. Not only can fermentation produce alcohol, but it can also be a valuable preservation technique. Fermentation can also make foods more nutritious and palatable. For example, drinking water in the Middle Ages was dangerous because it often contained pathogens that could spread disease. When the water is made into beer, the boiling during the brewing process kills any bacteria in the water that could make people sick. Additionally, the water now has the nutrients from the barley and other ingredients, and the microorganisms can also produce vitamins as they ferment.<ref name=\"nchfp.uga.edu\" />\n\n== Modern industrial techniques ==\nTechniques of food preservation were developed in research laboratories for commercial applications.\n\n=== Pasteurization ===\n{{Main|Pasteurization}}\nPasteurization is a process for preservation of liquid food. It was originally applied to combat the souring of young local wines. Today, the process is mainly applied to dairy products. In this method, milk is heated at about {{cvt|70|C|F}} for 15\u201330 seconds to kill the bacteria present in it and cooling it quickly to {{cvt|10|C|F}} to prevent the remaining bacteria from growing. The milk is then stored in sterilized bottles or pouches in cold places. This method was invented by [[Louis Pasteur]], a [[French people|French]] chemist, in 1862.\n\n=== Vacuum packing ===\n{{Main|Vacuum packing}}\nVacuum-packing stores food in a vacuum environment, usually in an air-tight bag or bottle. The [[vacuum]] environment strips bacteria of oxygen needed for survival. Vacuum-packing is commonly used for storing [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] to reduce loss of flavor from oxidization. A major drawback to vacuum packaging, at the consumer level, is that vacuum sealing can deform contents and rob certain foods, such as cheese, of its flavor.\n\n=== Freeze drying ===\n{{Expand section|date=September 2018}}\n{{main|Freeze drying}}\n\n=== Artificial food additives ===\n{{Main|Preservatives}}\n{{Main|Sulfite food and beverage additives}}\nPreservative food additives can be ''antimicrobial''\u2014which inhibit the growth of [[bacterium|bacteria]] or [[Fungus|fungi]], including [[mold]]\u2014or ''[[antioxidant]]'', such as [[oxygen absorber]]s, which inhibit the [[oxidation]] of food constituents. Common antimicrobial preservatives include [[calcium propionate]], [[sodium nitrate]], [[sodium nitrite]], [[sulfite]]s ([[sulfur dioxide]], [[sodium bisulfite]], [[potassium hydrogen sulfite]], etc.), and [[EDTA]]. [[Antioxidant]]s include [[butylated hydroxyanisole]] (BHA) and [[butylated hydroxytoluene]] (BHT). Other preservatives include [[formaldehyde]] (usually in solution), [[glutaraldehyde]] (insecticide), [[ethanol]], and [[methylchloroisothiazolinone]].\n\n=== Irradiation ===\n{{Main|Food irradiation}}\nIrradiation of food<ref>anon., Food Irradation \u2013 A technique for preserving and improving the safety of food, WHO, Geneva, 1991</ref> is the exposure of food to [[ionizing radiation]]. Multiple types of ionizing radiation can be used, including [[beta particle]]s (high-energy [[electron]]s) and [[gamma ray]]s (emitted from radioactive sources such as [[cobalt-60]] or [[cesium-137]]). Irradiation can kill bacteria, molds, and insect pests, reduce the ripening and spoiling of fruits, and at higher doses induce sterility. The technology may be compared to [[pasteurization]]; it is sometimes called \"cold pasteurization\", as the product is not heated. Irradiation may allow lower-quality or contaminated foods to be rendered marketable.\n\nNational and international expert bodies have declared food irradiation as \"wholesome\"; organizations of the [[United Nations]], such as the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], endorse food irradiation.<ref name=\"JECFI\">World Health Organization.

Activists have also opposed food irradiation for other reasons, for example, arguing that irradiation can be used to sterilize contaminated food without resolving the underlying cause of the contamination.<ref>Hauter, W. & Worth, M., ''Zapped! Irradiation and the Death of Food'', Food & Water Watch Press, Washington, DC, 2008</ref> International legislation on whether food may be irradiated or not varies worldwide from no regulation to a full ban.<ref>[http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif NUCLEUS \u2013 Food Irradiation Clearances<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526025627/http://nucleus.iaea.org/NUCLEUS/nucleus/Content/Applications/FICdb/FoodIrradiationClearances.jsp?module=cif |date=26 May 2008 }}</ref>\n\nApproximately 500,000 tons of food items are irradiated per year worldwide in over 40 countries.

PEF holds potential as a type of low-temperature alternative pasteurization process for sterilizing food products. In PEF processing, a substance is placed between two electrodes, then the pulsed electric field is applied. The electric field enlarges the pores of the cell membranes, which kills the cells and releases their contents. PEF for food processing is a developing technology still being researched. There have been limited industrial applications of PEF processing for the pasteurization of fruit juices. To date, several PEF treated juices are available on the market in Europe. Furthermore, for several years a juice pasteurization application in the US has used PEF. For cell disintegration purposes especially potato processors show great interest in PEF technology as an efficient alternative for their preheaters. Potato applications are already operational in the US and Canada. There are also commercial PEF potato applications in various countries in Europe, as well as in Australia, India, and China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elea-technology.com|title=Elea Pulsed Electric Field Technology |last=|first=|date=|website=www.elea-technology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>\n\n=== Modified atmosphere ===\n{{Main|Modified atmosphere}}\n\nModifying atmosphere is a way to preserve food by operating on the atmosphere around it. Salad crops that are notoriously difficult to preserve are now being packaged in sealed bags with an atmosphere modified to reduce the oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) concentration and increase the [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration. There is concern that, although salad vegetables retain their appearance and texture in such conditions, this method of preservation may not retain nutrients, especially [[vitamin]]s.\nThere are two methods for preserving grains with carbon dioxide. One method is placing a block of [[dry ice]] in the bottom and filling the can with the grain. Another method is purging the container from the bottom by gaseous carbon dioxide from a cylinder or bulk supply vessel.\n\n[[Carbon dioxide]] prevents insects and, depending on concentration, [[mold]] and [[oxidation]] from damaging the grain. Grain stored in this way can remain edible for approximately five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://entomology.k-state.edu/doc/finished-chapters/s156-ch-16-contr-or-mod-atmospheres--mar2.pdf|title=Controlled or Modified Atmospheres|last=Navarro|first=Shlomo|last2=Timlick|first2=Blaine|date=March 2012|website=k-state.edu|access-date=17 March 2018|last3=Demianyk|first3=Colin|last4=White|first4=Noel}}</ref>\n\n[[Nitrogen]] gas (N<sub>2</sub>) at concentrations of 98% or higher is also used effectively to kill insects in the grain through [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]].<ref>Annis, P.C. and Dowsett, H.A. 1993. Low oxygen disinfestation of grain: exposure periods needed for high mortality. Proc. International Conference on Controlled Atmosphere and Fumigation. Winnipeg, June 1992, Caspit Press, Jerusalem, pp. 71\u201383.</ref> However, carbon dioxide has an advantage in this respect, as it kills organisms through [[hypercarbia]] and hypoxia (depending on concentration), but it requires concentrations of above 35%,<ref>Annis, P.C. and Morton, R. 1997.

This makes carbon dioxide preferable for fumigation in situations where a [[hermetic seal]] cannot be maintained.\n\nControlled Atmospheric Storage (CA): \"CA storage is a non-chemical process. Oxygen levels in the sealed rooms are reduced, usually by the infusion of nitrogen gas, from the approximate 21 percent in the air we breathe to 1 percent or 2 percent. Temperatures are kept at a constant {{cvt|0\u20132|C|F}}. Humidity is maintained at 95 percent and carbon dioxide levels are also controlled. Exact conditions in the rooms are set according to the apple variety. Researchers develop specific regimens for each variety to achieve the best quality. Computers help keep conditions constant.\"\n\"Eastern Washington, where most of Washington\u2019s apples are grown, has enough warehouse storage for 181 million boxes of fruit, according to a report done in 1997 by managers for the Washington State Department of Agriculture Plant Services Division. The storage capacity study shows that 67 percent of that space\u2014enough for 121,008,000 boxes of apples\u2014is CA storage.\"\n<ref>[http://www.bestapples.com/facts/facts_controlled.aspx Controlled Atmospheric Storage (CA) :: Washington State Apple Commission<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAir-tight storage of grains (sometimes called hermetic storage) relies on the respiration of grain, insects, and fungi that can modify the enclosed atmosphere sufficiently to control insect pests. This is a method of great antiquity,<ref>Various authors, Session 1: Natural Air-Tight Storage In: Shejbal, J., ed., Controlled Atmosphere Storage of Grains, Elsevier: Amsterdam, 1\u201333</ref> as well as having modern equivalents.

Retrieved on 2008-12-27</ref> typical vegetation in these areas ranges from moist [[seasonal tropical forest]]s to [[savannah]]s.\n\nWhen the wet season occurs during the warm season, or [[summer]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  The wet season is a time when [[air quality]] improves, freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly, leading to crop yields late in the season.  Floods cause rivers to overflow their banks, and some animals to retreat to higher ground.  [[Soil]] nutrients diminish and erosion increases.  The incidence of [[malaria]] increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures.  Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.  The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.\n\nHowever, regions within the tropics may well not have a tropical climate. Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], much of the area within the geographical tropics is classed not as \"tropical\" but as \"dry\" ([[desert climate|arid]] or [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]), including the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]], the [[Atacama Desert]] and [[Australian Outback]]. Also, there are [[alpine tundra]] and snow-capped peaks, including [[Mauna Kea]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the [[Andes]] as far south as the northernmost parts of [[Chile]] and [[Per\u00fa]].\n\n== Ecosystems ==\n\n[[File:Paju\u00e7ara.jpg|thumb|[[Coconut]] palms in the warm, tropical climate of northern [[Brazil]]]]\n\n[[File:Tropical forest.JPG|thumb|[[Tropical forest]] near [[Fonds-Saint-Denis]], [[Martinique]]]]\n\n[[Tropical plants]] and animals are those species native to the tropics. Tropical ecosystems may consist of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[seasonal tropical forests]], [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry (often deciduous) forests]], spiny forests, [[desert]] and other habitat types. There are often significant areas of [[biodiversity]], and species [[endemism]] present, particularly in rainforests and seasonal forests. Some examples of important biodiversity and high endemism ecosystems are [[El Yunque National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Costa Rica]]n and [[Nicaragua]]n rainforests, [[Amazon Rainforest]] territories of several [[South America]]n countries, [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], the [[Waterberg Biosphere]] of [[South Africa]], and eastern [[Madagascar]] rainforests. Often the soils of tropical forests are low in [[nutrient]] content, making them quite vulnerable to [[slash-and-burn]] [[deforestation]] techniques, which are sometimes an element of [[shifting cultivation]] agricultural systems.\n\nIn [[biogeography]], the tropics are divided into [[Paleotropical Kingdom|Paleotropics]] (Africa, Asia and Australia) and [[Neotropical realm|Neotropics]] (Caribbean, Central America, and South America). Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Pantropic. The Neotropical region should not be confused with the [[ecozone]] of the same name; in the Old World, there is no such ambiguity, as the Paleotropics correspond to the Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and partly the Australasian and Oceanic ecozones.\n\n==Tropicality==\n\n\"Tropicality\" refers to the geographic imagery that many people outside the tropics have of that region. The idea of tropicality gained renewed interest in modern geographical discourse when French geographer [[Pierre Gourou]] published ''Les Pays Tropicaux'' (''The Tropical World'', in English), in the late 1940s.<ref>Arnold, David. \"Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950\", p. 6. Journal of Tropical Geography</ref>\n\nTropicality encompasses at least two contradictory imageries. One is that the tropics represent a Garden of Eden, a heaven on Earth;<ref name=\"Arnold, David p. 7\">Arnold, David. \"Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950\", p. 7. Journal of Tropical Geography</ref> the alternative is that the tropics are primitive and essentially lawless. The latter view was often discussed in Western literature\u2014more so than the first.<ref name=\"Arnold, David p. 7\"/> Evidence suggests that over time the more primitive view of the tropics in popular literature has been supplanted by more nuanced interpretations that reflect historical changes in values associated with tropical culture and ecology, although some primitive associations are persistent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Menadue|first=Christopher B.|date=2017-05-30|title=Trysts Tropiques: The Torrid Jungles of Science Fiction|journal=ETropic: Electronic Journal of Studies in the Tropics|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|doi=10.25120/etropic.16.1.2017.3570|issn=1448-2940|url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/49178/1/Trysts_Tropiques.pdf}}</ref> \n\nWestern scholars also theorized about the reasons that tropical areas were deemed \"inferior\" to regions in the Northern Hemisphere. A popular explanation focused on the differences in climate\u2014tropical regions typically have much warmer weather than northern regions. This theme led some scholars, including Gourou, to argue that warmer climates correlate to primitive indigenous populations lacking control over nature, compared to northern populations having \"mastered nature\".<ref>Arnold, David. \"Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950\", p. 13.

Retrieved on 2008-12-27</ref> typical vegetation in these areas ranges from moist [[seasonal tropical forest]]s to [[savannah]]s.\n\nWhen the wet season occurs during the warm season, or [[summer]], [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours.  The wet season is a time when [[air quality]] improves, freshwater quality improves and vegetation grows significantly, leading to crop yields late in the season.  Floods cause rivers to overflow their banks, and some animals to retreat to higher ground.  [[Soil]] nutrients diminish and erosion increases.  The incidence of [[malaria]] increases in areas where the rainy season coincides with high temperatures.  Animals have adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime.  The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature.\n\nHowever, regions within the tropics may well not have a tropical climate. Under the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], much of the area within the geographical tropics is classed not as \"tropical\" but as \"dry\" ([[desert climate|arid]] or [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]), including the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]], the [[Atacama Desert]] and [[Australian Outback]]. Also, there are [[alpine tundra]] and snow-capped peaks, including [[Mauna Kea]], [[Mount Kilimanjaro]], and the [[Andes]] as far south as the northernmost parts of [[Chile]] and [[Per\u00fa]].\n\n== Ecosystems ==\n\n[[File:Paju\u00e7ara.jpg|thumb|[[Coconut]] palms in the warm, tropical climate of northern [[Brazil]]]]\n\n[[File:Tropical forest.JPG|thumb|[[Tropical forest]] near [[Fonds-Saint-Denis]], [[Martinique]]]]\n\n[[Tropical plants]] and animals are those species native to the tropics. Tropical ecosystems may consist of [[tropical rainforest]]s, [[seasonal tropical forests]], [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|dry (often deciduous) forests]], spiny forests, [[desert]] and other habitat types. There are often significant areas of [[biodiversity]], and species [[endemism]] present, particularly in rainforests and seasonal forests. Some examples of important biodiversity and high endemism ecosystems are [[El Yunque National Forest]] in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Costa Rica]]n and [[Nicaragua]]n rainforests, [[Amazon Rainforest]] territories of several [[South America]]n countries, [[Madagascar dry deciduous forests]], the [[Waterberg Biosphere]] of [[South Africa]], and eastern [[Madagascar]] rainforests. Often the soils of tropical forests are low in [[nutrient]] content, making them quite vulnerable to [[slash-and-burn]] [[deforestation]] techniques, which are sometimes an element of [[shifting cultivation]] agricultural systems.\n\nIn [[biogeography]], the tropics are divided into [[Paleotropical Kingdom|Paleotropics]] (Africa, Asia and Australia) and [[Neotropical realm|Neotropics]] (Caribbean, Central America, and South America). Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Pantropic. The Neotropical region should not be confused with the [[ecozone]] of the same name; in the Old World, there is no such ambiguity, as the Paleotropics correspond to the Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and partly the Australasian and Oceanic ecozones.\n\n==Tropicality==\n\n\"Tropicality\" refers to the geographic imagery that many people outside the tropics have of that region. The idea of tropicality gained renewed interest in modern geographical discourse when French geographer [[Pierre Gourou]] published ''Les Pays Tropicaux'' (''The Tropical World'', in English), in the late 1940s.<ref>Arnold, David. \"Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950\", p. 6. Journal of Tropical Geography</ref>\n\nTropicality encompasses at least two contradictory imageries. One is that the tropics represent a Garden of Eden, a heaven on Earth;<ref name=\"Arnold, David p. 7\">Arnold, David. \"Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950\", p. 7. Journal of Tropical Geography</ref> the alternative is that the tropics are primitive and essentially lawless. The latter view was often discussed in Western literature\u2014more so than the first.<ref name=\"Arnold, David p. 7\"/> Evidence suggests that over time the more primitive view of the tropics in popular literature has been supplanted by more nuanced interpretations that reflect historical changes in values associated with tropical culture and ecology, although some primitive associations are persistent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Menadue|first=Christopher B.|date=2017-05-30|title=Trysts Tropiques: The Torrid Jungles of Science Fiction|journal=ETropic: Electronic Journal of Studies in the Tropics|language=en|volume=16|issue=1|doi=10.25120/etropic.16.1.2017.3570|issn=1448-2940|url=https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/49178/1/Trysts_Tropiques.pdf}}</ref> \n\nWestern scholars also theorized about the reasons that tropical areas were deemed \"inferior\" to regions in the Northern Hemisphere. A popular explanation focused on the differences in climate\u2014tropical regions typically have much warmer weather than northern regions. This theme led some scholars, including Gourou, to argue that warmer climates correlate to primitive indigenous populations lacking control over nature, compared to northern populations having \"mastered nature\".<ref>Arnold, David. \"Illusory Riches: Representations of the Tropical World, 1840-1950\", p. 13.
