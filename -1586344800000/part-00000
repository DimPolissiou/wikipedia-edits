Directed by [[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] and written by [[Michael Mitnick]], the film stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Edison, [[Michael Shannon]] as Westinghouse, [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]], alongside [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Tuppence Middleton]], [[Matthew Macfadyen]] and [[Damien Molony]]. [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Steven Zaillian]] also serve as executive producers.\n\nAnnounced in May 2012, Gomez-Rejon was confirmed in September 2015. Cumberbatch, Shannon, and Hoult joined the cast by October 2016, and filming began in England that December. The film premiered at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2017.\n\nCo-produced by [[Harvey Weinstein]] and originally to be distributed by [[The Weinstein Company]], the film was shelved and sold in November 2017 following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]]. It was eventually bought by [[Lantern Entertainment]] (the successor of TWC), who then sold the domestic distribution rights to 101 Studios. After discovering a [[final cut privilege]] clause in Scorsese's contract, Gomez-Rejon convinced him to allow for reshoots and to trim ten minutes off the original version's runtime, resulting in the film that was eventually released into theaters. The film was released in the United States on October 25, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1880 and [[Thomas Edison]] has unveiled his electric lightbulb and has decided on [[Direct Current]] (DC) which is cheaper and cleaner than gaslight but it is limited in range and expensive. [[George Westinghouse]], a successful business man and inventor himself, wishes to learn more, and invites Edison to dinner. After being snubbed by Edison, Westinghouse sets out to prove [[Alternating Current]] (AC) is the better technology as it can work over greater distances and at significantly lower cost. Edison and Westinghouse compete to get cities across the United States to use their system. Brilliant inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] arrives in the United States and begins working with Edison, but is disappointed by Edison's unwillingness to reconsider his ideas and to fulfill what Tesla thought was a financial promise which Edison passes off as just a joke. Tesla then leaves Edison's team. Edison fiercely guards his patents and sues Westinghouse.\n\nEdison suggests that AC is dangerous and engages in a publicity war, while Westinghouse stands behind the technical merits of AC. As Edison struggles to find ways to make DC more affordable, Westinghouse attempts to get the high-voltage AC system to work with motors. Edison's wife dies, and Westinghouse is also struck with personal tragedy when his friend [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]] dies in an electrical accident. Both face significant financial risk. To generate funds Edison commercially sells his speaking machine \"[[The Phonograph]]\". To damage the reputation of AC, Edison shows that it easily [[electrocution|electrocutes]] animals, and secretly works to help the creators of execution by [[electric chair]], despite his previous objections to manufacturing weapons or other machines of death. The first person to die by electrocution is [[William Kemmler]], and newspapers label the event as \"Far Worse Than Hanging\". Westinghouse discovers Edison's involvement and reveals it to the press.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to strike out on his own, Tesla is approached by Westinghouse to work together, and build a practical [[AC motor]]. Edison is increasingly marginalized and [[J. P. Morgan]] merges Edison Electric into [[General Electric]]. The competing systems come to a head as they both put forward proposals to illuminate the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. [[Samuel Insull]] presents the bid on behalf of Edison, and Westinghouse presents his competing bid. The abundantly lit fair is revealed. Westinghouse was successful. At the fair Westinghouse and Edison meet briefly. Edison discusses what it was like to achieve a great invention, and suggests that his next invention ([[Thomas Edison#Motion pictures|Motion Pictures]]) could be so incredible that people might forget his name was ever associated with electricity.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Thomas Edison]]\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as [[George Westinghouse]]\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]]\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Marguerite Erskine Walker\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]]\n* [[Simon Manyonda]] as [[Lewis Latimer]]\n* [[Stanley Townsend]] as [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]]\n* [[Tuppence Middleton]] as [[Thomas Edison#Marriages and children|Mary Stilwell Edison]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/memorial/5814 |title=Mary Stilwell Edison (1855 - 1884)|publisher=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[J.

Directed by [[Alfonso Gomez-Rejon]] and written by [[Michael Mitnick]], the film stars [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as Edison, [[Michael Shannon]] as Westinghouse, [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]], and [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]], alongside [[Katherine Waterston]], [[Tuppence Middleton]], [[Matthew Macfadyen]] and [[Damien Molony]]. [[Martin Scorsese]] and [[Steven Zaillian]] also serve as executive producers.\n\nAnnounced in May 2012, Gomez-Rejon was confirmed in September 2015. Cumberbatch, Shannon, and Hoult joined the cast by October 2016, and filming began in England that December. The film premiered at the [[2017 Toronto International Film Festival|Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 9, 2017.\n\nCo-produced by [[Harvey Weinstein]] and originally to be distributed by [[The Weinstein Company]], the film was shelved and sold in November 2017 following the [[Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations]]. It was eventually bought by [[Lantern Entertainment]] (the successor of TWC), who then sold the domestic distribution rights to 101 Studios. After discovering a [[final cut privilege]] clause in Scorsese's contract, Gomez-Rejon convinced him to allow for reshoots and to trim ten minutes off the original version's runtime, resulting in the film that was eventually released into theaters. The film was released in the United States on October 25, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\nIt is 1880 and [[Thomas Edison]] has unveiled his electric lightbulb and has decided on [[Direct Current]] (DC) which is cheaper and cleaner than gaslight but it is limited in range and expensive. [[George Westinghouse]], a successful business man and inventor himself, wishes to learn more, and invites Edison to dinner. After being snubbed by Edison, Westinghouse sets out to prove [[Alternating Current]] (AC) is the better technology as it can work over greater distances and at significantly lower cost. Edison and Westinghouse compete to get cities across the United States to use their system. Brilliant inventor [[Nikola Tesla]] arrives in the United States and begins working with Edison, but is disappointed by Edison's unwillingness to reconsider his ideas and to fulfill what Tesla thought was a financial promise which Edison passes off as just a joke. Tesla then leaves Edison's team. Edison fiercely guards his patents and sues Westinghouse.\n\nEdison suggests that AC is dangerous and engages in a publicity war, while Westinghouse stands behind the technical merits of AC. As Edison struggles to find ways to make DC more affordable, Westinghouse attempts to get the high-voltage AC system to work with motors. Edison's wife dies, and Westinghouse is also struck with personal tragedy when his friend [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]] dies in an electrical accident. Both face significant financial risk. To generate funds Edison commercially sells his speaking machine \"[[The Phonograph]]\". To damage the reputation of AC, Edison shows that it easily [[electrocution|electrocutes]] animals, and secretly works to help the creators of execution by [[electric chair]], despite his previous objections to manufacturing weapons or other machines of death. The first person to die by electrocution is [[William Kemmler]], and newspapers label the event as \"Far Worse Than Hanging\". Westinghouse discovers Edison's involvement and reveals it to the press.\n\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt to strike out on his own, Tesla is approached by Westinghouse to work together, and build a practical [[AC motor]]. Edison is increasingly marginalized and [[J. P. Morgan]] merges Edison Electric into [[General Electric]]. The competing systems come to a head as they both put forward proposals to illuminate the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago. [[Samuel Insull]] presents the bid on behalf of Edison, and Westinghouse presents his competing bid. The abundantly lit fair is revealed. Westinghouse was successful. At the fair Westinghouse and Edison meet briefly. Edison discusses what it was like to achieve a great invention, and suggests that his next invention ([[Thomas Edison#Motion pictures|Motion Pictures]]) could be so incredible that people might forget his name was ever associated with electricity.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Benedict Cumberbatch]] as [[Thomas Edison]]\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as [[George Westinghouse]]\n* [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Nikola Tesla]]\n* [[Katherine Waterston]] as Marguerite Erskine Walker\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as [[Samuel Insull]]\n* [[Simon Manyonda]] as [[Lewis Latimer]]\n* [[Stanley Townsend]] as [[Franklin Leonard Pope|Franklin Pope]]\n* [[Tuppence Middleton]] as [[Thomas Edison#Marriages and children|Mary Stilwell Edison]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://findagrave.com/memorial/5814 |title=Mary Stilwell Edison (1855 - 1884)|publisher=[[Find a Grave]] |accessdate=September 11, 2017}}</ref>\n* [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as [[J.
