He studied English literature and earned a master's degree in literature from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM).\n\nAs a playwright his first work was ''Rosalba y los Llaveros,'' which premiered at [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]] in 1950, directed by well-known poet and stage director [[Salvador Novo]]. This was followed by a huge number of plays, including ''Un peque\u00f1o d\u00eda de ira'' (1961), which earned him the [[Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas Prize]], ''\u00a1Silencio Pollos pelones, ya les van a echar su ma\u00edz!'' (1963), ''Te juro Juana que tengo ganas'' (1965), ''Yo tambi\u00e9n hablo de la rosa'' (1965), ''Acapulco los lunes'' (1969), ''Las cartas de Mozart'' (1974), and the box office hit ''Rosa de dos aromas'' (1986).\n\nSome of his works as a playwright were filmed for the screen, such as ''Rosalba y los llaveros'' (1954), ''Felicidad'' (1956), ''La danza que sue\u00f1a la tortuga'' (1975), ''[[El censo]]'' (1977), ''Orinoco'' (1984), and ''Rosa de dos aromas'' (1989). In addition to more than a hundred plays and scripts, he also wrote two volumes of short stories and nine novels, and worked randomly as a stage director.\n\nHis career in the Mexican film industry began with the script for ''La torre de marfil'', written in collaboration with [[Luisa Josefina Hern\u00e1ndez]] in 1957. In 1972 he received two [[Premio Ariel|Ariels]] for the storyline and script of [[Alfonso Arau]]'s ''El \u00c1guila Descalza''. On 27 May 2002 he was given the [[Ariel de Oro]] for his lifetime achievements which include more than 50 films, remarkably his collaboration in [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel]]'s ''[[Nazar\u00edn]]'' (1959).\n\nOn 16 March 2007, Carballido and his partner of 20&nbsp;years, H\u00e9ctor Herrera, were among the first couples to apply for a [[civil union]] following the enactment of the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]]'s 2006 [[Recognition of gay unions in Mexico|Ley de Sociedad de Convivencia]].\n\nCarballido died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on 11 February 2008 in [[Xalapa]].<ref>[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/481447.html Muere Emilio Carballido - El Universal - Cultura<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.eluniversal.com.mx</ref> Two days later, [[Governor of Veracruz]] [[Fidel Herrera Beltr\u00e1n]] ordered a day of mourning in the state and announced that the Theatre of the State and one of the state literary prizes would be renamed after him.<ref>[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/481737.html Rinden homenaje a Carballido en Veracruz - El Universal - Cultura<!-- bot-generated title -->] at www.eluniversal.com.mx</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/481539.html Perfil: Emilio Carballido] ''([[El Universal (Mexico City)|El Universal]])''\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Carballido, Emilio}}\n[[Category:1925 births]]\n[[Category:2008 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz]]\n[[Category:Golden Ariel Award winners]]\n[[Category:Mexican dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:Writers from Veracruz]]\n[[Category:LGBT writers from Mexico]]\n[[Category:Gay writers]]\n[[Category:LGBT dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:Male dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:20th-century dramatists and playwrights]]\n[[Category:20th-century Mexican male writers]]\n[[Category:Spanish-language LGBT writers]]\n", "text_old": "'''Emilio Carballido''' ([[C\u00f3rdoba, Veracruz]], 22 May 1925 &ndash; [[Xalapa, Veracruz]], 11 February 2008) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] writer who earned particular renown as a [[playwright]].\n\nCarballido belonged to the group of writers known as the ''Generaci\u00f3n de los 50'', alongside such figures as [[Sergio Maga\u00f1a]], [[Luisa Josefina Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Rosario Castellanos]], [[Jaime Sabines]], and [[Sergio Galindo]].

This was followed by a huge number of plays, including ''Un peque\u00f1o d\u00eda de ira'' (1961), which earned him the [[Casa de las Am\u00e9ricas Prize]], ''\u00a1Silencio Pollos pelones, ya les van a echar su ma\u00edz!''
