At the Nuremberg trials, the German physician, Dr. Werner Leibbrant was interrogated on the stand and it became evident that the Germans questioning him were attempting to identify parallels between the medical research they did during the war and the human subjects research taking place in the states especially at Stateville, Illinois.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/should-prisoners-be-used-in-medical-experiments/|title=Should Prisoners Be Used In Medical Experiments|last=Fine|first=Dina|website=Scientific American|access-date=2017-04-21}}</ref> This was unexpected for the United States front, and the biggest challenge for disputing these attempts was that there were no concrete guidelines and/or written documentation for the ethics of human medical experimentation. After Ivy initially appeared at the Nuremberg courtroom in January 1947 and heard these proceedings, he went back to Illinois and asked the state Governor, Dwight H. Green, to set up a committee with him as the lead to assess the ethicality of the prisoner experiments that took place at Stateville. The governor agreed and sent out letters to potential candidates to join him on the committee. The committee search resulted in six members, and it was collectively called the \u201cGreen committee\u201d. During the questioning of Ivy at the stand in June 1947 at the trials, the same attorney who had questioned Leibbrant to get his point across regarding the equivalence of the U.S. human experimentation at Stateville, also probed Ivy, but with more focus on the Green committee. After the trials, Ivy had returned to Illinois and wrote a letter to his fellow Green committee members to tell them the details of the testimony. For the next few months, the Green committee met and worked on a final report to submit to the governor regarding their determination of ethics at Statesville. Their major conclusions were that the \u201call subjects [prisoners at Stateville] have been volunteers in the absence of coercion in any form.\u201d The report was submitted to The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The report was published in February 1948 and it represented an important support for future prisoner experimentation in the United States. The conclusions drawn in the report, which praised the practices taking place in the research at Stateville, denounced all criticism of the work and would encourage it more.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Harkness|first=J.M.|date=1996|title=Nuremberg and the issue of wartime experiments on US prisoners|url=|journal=J.

Altogether, the important points of his principles for human experimentation included 1) a need for consent, 2) carefully designing and planning experiments based on the results of animal experimentation in order to benefit society, and 3) performing these experiments by trained personnel to avoid mishaps and injuries that may result in a disability for the subject.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weindling|first=P|date=2001|title=The Origins of Informed Consent: The International Scientific Commission on Medical War Crimes, and the Nuremberg Code|url=|journal=Bull.

He hypothesized that larger, multicellular organisms have an \u201canticancer substance\u201d that helped to suppress the cancer which should have been more likely with more cells present. This substance he called \u201ccarcalon.\u201d His work on the gastrointestinal system led to an important publication of his entitled \u201cPeptic Ulcer.\u201d This was co-authored with Drs. Morton Grossman and Bachrach. Ivy and his colleagues were able to publish more than 1500 papers. His work was so interesting that he was cited more than any other researcher between the years of 1964 to 1971. He is most known for this interest in gastroenterology in which he made breakthroughs in understanding pancreatic and gastric secretions, and the discovery of a hormone named cholecystokinin and urogastrone.
