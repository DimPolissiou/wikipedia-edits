She also finished top ten in [[1996 LPGA Tour|1996]], [[1997 LPGA Tour|1997]] and [[1998 LPGA Tour|1998]].\n\nThroughout her career on the LPGA Tour, she continued to play on the [[Ladies European Tour]], as well as in [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]. She won four times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]]. In [[1994 Ladies European Tour|1994]] Neumann topped the LET Order of Merit, was voted ''[[Golf World]]'''s Most Improved Golfer and awarded [[Swedish Golfer of the Year]] for the third time.\n\nNeumann played in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team against United States, six times in a row, [[1990 Solheim Cup|1990]], [[1992 Solheim Cup|1992]], [[1994 Solheim Cup|1994]], [[1996 Solheim Cup|1996]], [[1998 Solheim Cup|1998]], and [[2000 Solheim Cup|2000]]. She captained the team to victory in August, [[2013 Solheim Cup|2013]] at [[Colorado Golf Club]] in [[Parker, Colorado]], the first time team Europe won the cup on foreign soil, and the first time Europe won consecutive cups. Neumann won the [[Women's World Cup of Golf]] for Sweden in 2006 with [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]].\n\nShe was recognized during the LPGA\u2019s 50th Anniversary in 2000 as one of the LPGA\u2019s top 50 players and teachers.\n\nOn June 7, 2006, the Ladies European Tour announced that Neumann has earned Lifetime Membership of the LET, at the time a feat achieved by six other golfers, [[Helen Alfredsson]], [[Laura Davies]], [[Marie-Laure de Lorenzi]], [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Dale Reid]] and [[Annika S\u00f6renstam|Annika Sorenstam]].\n\n==Amateur wins==\n*1981 Swedish International

She won the inofficial national youth championships, Colgate Cup, in three different levels, as a 12-, 14-, and 16-year old.\n\nIn 1981, only 15 years of age, she sensationally won the Swedish International Amateur Stroke-Play Championship, one of three major amateur tournaments in Sweden at the time, at J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping Golf Club, with a record aggregate of 280 and a 9-stroke margin. At the time of her triumph, she wasn't even qualified for the Swedish national junior team, which, the same summer, won the European Lady Junior's Team Championship. The year after, she successfully defended her stroke-play title and,16 years old, was a member of the national team at the [[Espirito Santo Trophy]] in Geneva, Switzerland. In 1983, she finished second in Orange Bowl International Junior Championship in [[Coral Gables, Florida|Coral Gables]], [[Florida]]. In 1984, she was the Swedish Match Play champion, member of the winning Swedish team at the European Lady Junior's Team Championship at Campo de Golf El Saler, [[Valencia]], [[Spain]], and medalist at the 36-hole qualifying competition in the [[European Ladies' Team Championship|European Ladies Team Championship]], in [[Waterloo, Belgium|Waterloo]], [[Belgium]]. After another appearance at the [[Espirito Santo Trophy]] in Hong Kong in late 1984, she turned professional at the beginning of 1985, not yet 19 years old.<ref name=\"100years\">{{citeweb |url=http://www.e-magin.se/paper/1pfc350j/popup/1? |title=Golf - Den gr\u00f6na sporten' |language=Swedish |trans-title=Golf - the Green Sport |publisher=Swedish Golf Federation 100 Years |pages=192, 198, 211, 220, 221}}</ref>\n\n==Professional career==\nShe collected her first professional win at the Pierre Robert Cup, over 54 holes at Falsterbo Golf Club, on the Swedish Tour in May 1985 and played on the [[Ladies European Tour]] (at the time named the WPGA Tour) the second half of the year, were she won twice.\n\nShe led the 1986 Ladies European Tour Order of Merit for most of the season, but lost the lead to [[Laura Davies]] at the last tournament.\n\nNeumann became a member of the [[LPGA Tour]] in [[1988 LPGA Tour|1988]], after tying fourth at the LPGA Tour Final Qualifying Tournament in late 1987.\n\nAt the [[1988 U.S. Women's Open Golf Championship|1988]] [[U.S. Women's Open]] at [[Baltimore Country Club]], Five Farms, [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], July  21-24, at 22 years of age, Neumann led wire-to-wire in just her 16th LPGA Tour tournament, setting a new tournament first-round record 67 and 72-hole record 277, becoming the first Swedish major winner, male or female, as well as the first Swedish tournament winner on the LPGA Tour or the [[PGA Tour]].

The 1988 U.S. Women's Open remains her only [[LPGA major]], but she won the [[Women's British Open]] in 1994, when it was recognised as a major championship by the [[Ladies European Tour]], but not by the LPGA Tour. She also finished second five times in three other major championships.\n\nHer best finish on the LPGA Tour money list is third in [[1994 LPGA Tour|1994]]. She also finished top ten in [[1996 LPGA Tour|1996]], [[1997 LPGA Tour|1997]] and [[1998 LPGA Tour|1998]].\n\nThroughout her career on the LPGA Tour, she continued to play on the [[Ladies European Tour]], as well as in [[Asia]] and [[Australia]]. She won four times in [[Japan]] and the 1995 [[Holden Women's Australian Open|Women's Australian Open]]. Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]]. In [[1994 Ladies European Tour|1994]] Neumann topped the LET Order of Merit, was voted ''[[Golf World]]'''s Most Improved Golfer and awarded [[Swedish Golfer of the Year]] for the third time.\n\nNeumann played in the European [[Solheim Cup]] team against United States, six times in a row, [[1990 Solheim Cup|1990]], [[1992 Solheim Cup|1992]], [[1994 Solheim Cup|1994]], [[1996 Solheim Cup|1996]], [[1998 Solheim Cup|1998]], and [[2000 Solheim Cup|2000]]. She captained the team to victory in August, [[2013 Solheim Cup|2013]] at [[Colorado Golf Club]] in [[Parker, Colorado]], the first time team Europe won the cup on foreign soil, and the first time Europe won consecutive cups. Neumann won the [[Women's World Cup of Golf]] for Sweden in 2006 with [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]].\n\nShe was recognized during the LPGA\u2019s 50th Anniversary in 2000 as one of the LPGA\u2019s top 50 players and teachers.\n\nOn June 7, 2006, the Ladies European Tour announced that Neumann has earned Lifetime Membership of the LET, at the time a feat achieved by six other golfers, [[Helen

Physicians with access to free samples are more likely to prescribe brand name medication over equivalent generic medications.<ref name=Women08/>  Other studies found that free samples decreased the likelihood that physicians would follow standard of care practices.<ref name=Women08/>\n\nReceiving pharmaceutical samples does not reduce prescription costs. Even after receiving samples, sample recipients remain disproportionately burdened by prescription costs.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander GC, Zhang J, Basu A | year = 2008 | title = Characteristics of patients receiving pharmaceutical samples and association between sample receipt and out-of-pocket prescription costs | url = | journal = Medical Care | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 394\u2013402 | pmid = 18362819 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181618ee0}}</ref>\n\nIt is argued that a benefit to free samples is the \u201ctry it before you buy it\u201d approach. Free samples give immediate access to the medication and the patient can begin treatment right away.  Also, it saves time from going to a pharmacy to get it filled before treatment begins. Since not all medications work for everyone, and many do not work the same way for each person, free samples allow patients to find which dose and brand of medication works best before having to spend money on a filled prescription at a [[pharmacy]].<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n===Continuing medical education===\nHours spent by physicians in industry-supported [[continuing medical education]] (CME) is greater than that from either [[medical school]]s or professional societies.<ref name=Women08/>\n\n===Pharmaceutical representatives===\nCurrently, there are approximately 81,000 [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zsassociates.com/news_events/news_media/the_doctor_wont_see_you_mr_pharma_rep_now/ |title=ZS Associates; Pharmaceutical |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> pursuing some 830,000 pharmaceutical prescribers. A pharmaceutical representative will often try to see a given physician every few weeks. Representatives often have a call list of about 200\u2013300 physicians with 120\u2013180 targets that should be visited in 1\u20132 or 3 week cycle.\n\nBecause of the large size of the pharmaceutical sales force, the organization, management, and measurement of effectiveness of the sales force are significant business challenges. Management tasks are usually broken down into the areas of physician targeting, sales force size and structure, sales force optimization, call planning, and sales forces effectiveness. A few pharmaceutical companies have realized that training sales representatives on high science alone is not enough, especially when most products are similar in quality.  Thus, training sales representatives on relationship selling techniques in addition to medical science and product knowledge, can make a difference in sales force effectiveness.  Specialist physicians are relying more and more on specialty sales reps for product information, because they are more knowledgeable than primary care reps.\n\nThe United States has 81,000 pharmaceutical representatives or 1 for every 7.9 physicians.<ref name=Women08/> The number and persistence of pharmaceutical  representatives has placed a burden on the time of physicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=177968  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> \"As the  number of reps went up, the amount of time an average rep spent with  doctors went down\u2014so  far down, that tactical scaling has spawned a strategic crisis.  Physicians no longer spend much time with sales reps, nor do they see this as a serious problem.\"\n\nMarketers must  decide on the appropriate size of a sales force needed to sell a  particular portfolio of drugs to the target market. Factors influencing this decision are the optimal reach (how many physicians to see) and frequency (how often to see  them) for each individual physician, how many patients suffer from that disease state, how many sales representatives to devote to office and group practice and how many to devote to hospital accounts if needed. To aid this decision, customers are broken down into different classes according to their prescription behavior, patient population, and of course, their business potential.\n\nMarketers attempt to identify the set of physicians most likely to prescribe a given drug. Historically, this was done by measuring the number of total prescriptions (TRx) and new prescriptions (NRx) per week that each physician writes. This information is collected by commercial vendors. The physicians are then \"deciled\" into ten groups based on their writing patterns. Higher deciles are more aggressively targeted. Some pharmaceutical companies use additional information such as:\n* Profitability of a prescription (script),\n* Accessibility of the physician,\n* Tendency of the physician to use the pharmaceutical company's drugs,\n* Effect of managed care formularies on the ability of the physician to prescribe a drug,\n* The [[adoption sequence]] of the physician (that is, how readily the physician adopts new drugs in place of older treatments), and\n* The tendency of the physician to use a wide palette of drugs\n* Influence that physicians have on their colleagues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Kiefer|authorlink1=Kiefer Lee|last2=Carter|first2=Steve|date=2012|title=Global Marketing Management|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=524|isbn=978-0-19-960970-3}}</ref>\n\nPhysicians are perhaps the most important component in  sales. They  write the prescriptions that determine which drugs will be used by  people.  Influencing the physician is the key to pharmaceutical sales.  Historically, this was done by a large pharmaceutical sales force. A  medium-sized  pharmaceutical company might have a sales force of 1000  representatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  The largest companies have tens of thousands of representatives around  the world. Sales representatives called upon physicians regularly,  providing clinical information, approved journal articles, and free drug samples. This is still the approach  today; however, economic pressures on the industry are causing  pharmaceutical companies to rethink the traditional sales process to  physicians. The industry has seen a large scale adoption of Pharma CRM systems that works on laptops and more recently [[Tablet computer|tablets]]. The new age pharmaceutical representative is armed with key data at his fingertips and tools to maximize the time spent with physicians.\n\n===Peer influence===\n;Key opinion leaders\nKey opinion leaders (KOL), or \"thought leaders\", are  respected individuals, such as prominent medical school faculty, who  influence physicians through their professional status. Pharmaceutical  companies generally engage key opinion leaders early in the drug  development process to provide advocacy and key marketing feedback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharma-mkting.com/glossary/keyopinionleader.htm  |title=Glossary Term: Key Opinion Leader |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> Some  pharmaceutical companies identify key opinion leaders through direct  inquiry of physicians (primary research).  Recently, pharmaceutical companies have begun to use [[social network analysis]] to uncover thought leaders; because it does not introduce respondent bias, which is commonly found in primary research; it can identify and map out the entire scientific community for a disease state; and it has greater compliance with state and federal regulations; because physician prescribing patterns are not used to create the social network.<ref>http://www.lnxpharma.com/images/pages/Lnx_Whitepaper_1.pdf</ref>\n\nAlternatives  to  segmenting physicians purely on the basis of prescribing do exist,  and  marketers can call upon strategic partners who specialize in   delineating which characteristics of true opinion leadership, a   physician does or does not possess.  Such analyses can help guide   marketers in how to optimize KOL engagements as bona fide advisors to a   brand, and can help shape clinical development and clinical data   publication plans for instance, ultimately advancing patient care.\n\n;Colleagues\nPhysicians  acquire information through informal contacts with their colleagues,  including social events, professional affiliations, common hospital  affiliations, and common medical school affiliations. Some  pharmaceutical companies identify influential colleagues through  commercially available prescription writing and patient level data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=395598  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\nDoctor  dinner meetings are an effective way for physicians to acquire  educational information from respected peers.

Not only can the insurer affect drug sales by including or excluding a particular drug from a formulary, they can affect sales by tiering, or placing bureaucratic hurdles to prescribing certain drugs. In January 2006, the United States instituted a new public prescription drug plan through its [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program. Known as [[Medicare Part&nbsp;D]], this program engages private insurers to negotiate with [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] for the placement of drugs on tiered formularies.\n\n==To consumers==\nOnly two countries as of 2008 allow [[direct to consumer advertising]] (DTCA): the United States and New Zealand.<ref name=\"NYT-20151127\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Women08/> Since the late 1970s, DTCA of prescription drugs has become important in the United States.

In some areas it is required that ads for drugs include a list of possible side effects, so that users are informed of both facets of a medicine. [[Canada]]'s limitations on pharmaceutical advertising ensure that commercials that mention the name of a product cannot in any way describe what it does. Commercials that mention a medical problem cannot also mention the name of the product for sale; at most, they can direct the viewer to a website or telephone number operated by the pharmaceutical company.\n\nReynold Spector has provided examples of how positive and negative hype can affect perceptions of pharmaceuticals using examples of certain cancer drugs, such as [[Avastin]] and [[Opdivo]], in the former case and [[statin]]s in the latter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spector |first1=Reynold |title=Drug Therapy Hype: The Misuse of Data |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=44\u201349}}</ref>\n\n===Drug coupons===\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical companies often provide [[drug coupon]]s to consumers to help offset the [[copayment]]s charged by health insurers for prescription medication.

[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations require all prescription drug promotion to be truthful and not misleading, based on \"substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience\", to provide a \"fair balance\" between the risks and benefits of the promoted drug, and to maintain consistency with labeling approved by the FDA. The FDA Office of Prescription Drug Promotion enforces these requirements.\n\nIn the 1990s, antipsychotics were \"still seen as treatments for the most serious mental illnesses, like hallucinatory schizophrenia, and recast them for much broader uses\". Drugs such as [[Abilify]] and [[Geodon]] were given to a broad range of patients, from preschoolers to octogenarians. In 2010, more than a half-million youths took antipsychotic drugs, and one-quarter of nursing-home residents have used them. Yet the government warns that the drugs may be fatal to some older patients and have unknown effects on children.<ref name=bied2010/>\n\nEvery major company selling the drugs\u2014[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]], and [[Johnson & Johnson]]\u2014has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud.

One involved Eli Lilly\u2019s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]].

Both physicians  and users are increasing their reliance on the Internet as a source of health and medical information, prompting pharmaceutical marketers to look at digital channels for opportunities to reach their target  audiences.\n\nIn 2008, 84% of U.S. physicians used the  Internet and other technologies to access pharmaceutical, biotech or  medical device information\u2014a 20% increase from 2004. At the same time, sales reps are  finding it more difficult to get time with doctors for in-person details.  Pharmaceutical companies are exploring online marketing as an alternative way to reach physicians. Emerging e-promotional activities include live video detailing, online events, electronic sampling, and physician customer service portals such as PV Updates, MDLinx, Aptus Health (former Physicians Interactive), and [[Epocrates]].\n\nDirect-to-users  marketers are also recognizing the need to shift to digital channels as audiences become more fragmented and the number of access points for news, entertainment and information multiplies. Standard television,  radio and print direct-to-users (DTC) advertisements are less relevant than in the past, and companies  are beginning to focus more on digital marketing efforts like product websites, [[display advertising|online display advertising]], [[search engine marketing]], [[social media]] campaigns, place-based media and [[mobile advertising]] to reach the over 145 million U.S. adults online for health information.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications issued a warning letter concerning two unbranded consumer targeted Web sites sponsored by [[Novartis]] Pharmaceuticals Corporation as the websites promoted a drug for an unapproved use, the websites failed to disclose the risks associated with the use of the drug and made unsubstantiated dosing claims.<ref>{{citation |author=Debra Dunne |title=Unbranded Web Sites: FDA Finds Violative Promotional Practices |date=October 4, 2010 |publisher=Stradley Ronon  |url= https://www.natlawreview.com/article/unbranded-web-sites-fda-finds-violative-promotional-practices|access-date=May 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n\n* [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory]]\n* ''[[Big Pharma (book)|Big Pharma: How the World's Biggest Drug Companies Control Illness]]'' (2006) by Jacky Law\n* ''[[Side Effects (Bass book)|Side Effects]]'' (2008) by [[Alison Bass]]\n* ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' (2012) by [[Ben Goldacre]]\n* [[Disease mongering]]\n* [[Ethics in pharmaceutical sales]]\n* [[Inverse benefit law]]\n* [[National pharmaceuticals policy]]\n* [[Pharmaceutical lobby]]\n* [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act]]\n* [[Prescription drug prices in the United States]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{refbegin}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Insider's Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales'', Seventh Edition ({{ISBN|0-9704153-6-2}})\n* Merrill Goozner, ''The $800 million pill''.

Physicians with access to free samples are more likely to prescribe brand name medication over equivalent generic medications.<ref name=Women08/>  Other studies found that free samples decreased the likelihood that physicians would follow standard of care practices.<ref name=Women08/>\n\nReceiving pharmaceutical samples does not reduce prescription costs. Even after receiving samples, sample recipients remain disproportionately burdened by prescription costs.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Alexander GC, Zhang J, Basu A | year = 2008 | title = Characteristics of patients receiving pharmaceutical samples and association between sample receipt and out-of-pocket prescription costs | url = | journal = Medical Care | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 394\u2013402 | pmid = 18362819 | doi=10.1097/MLR.0b013e3181618ee0}}</ref>\n\nIt is argued that a benefit to free samples is the \u201ctry it before you buy it\u201d approach. Free samples give immediate access to the medication and the patient can begin treatment right away.  Also, it saves time from going to a pharmacy to get it filled before treatment begins. Since not all medications work for everyone, and many do not work the same way for each person, free samples allow patients to find which dose and brand of medication works best before having to spend money on a filled prescription at a [[pharmacy]].<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/>\n\n===Continuing medical education===\nHours spent by physicians in industry-supported [[continuing medical education]] (CME) is greater than that from either [[medical school]]s or professional societies.<ref name=Women08/>\n\n===Pharmaceutical representatives===\nCurrently, there are approximately 81,000 [[pharmaceutical sales representative]]s in the United States<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zsassociates.com/news_events/news_media/the_doctor_wont_see_you_mr_pharma_rep_now/ |title=ZS Associates; Pharmaceutical |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> pursuing some 830,000 pharmaceutical prescribers. A pharmaceutical representative will often try to see a given physician every few weeks. Representatives often have a call list of about 200-300 physicians with 120-180 targets that should be visited in 1-2 or 3 week cycle.\n\nBecause of the large size of the pharmaceutical sales force, the organization, management, and measurement of effectiveness of the sales force are significant business challenges. Management tasks are usually broken down into the areas of physician targeting, sales force size and structure, sales force optimization, call planning, and sales forces effectiveness. A few pharmaceutical companies have realized that training sales representatives on high science alone is not enough, especially when most products are similar in quality.  Thus, training sales representatives on relationship selling techniques in addition to medical science and product knowledge, can make a difference in sales force effectiveness.  Specialist physicians are relying more and more on specialty sales reps for product information, because they are more knowledgeable than primary care reps.\n\nThe United States has 81,000 pharmaceutical representatives or 1 for every 7.9 physicians.<ref name=Women08/> The number and persistence of pharmaceutical  representatives has placed a burden on the time of physicians.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=177968  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> \"As the  number of reps went up, the amount of time an average rep spent with  doctors went down\u2014so  far down, that tactical scaling has spawned a strategic crisis.  Physicians no longer spend much time with sales reps, nor do they see this as a serious problem.\"\n\nMarketers must  decide on the appropriate size of a sales force needed to sell a  particular portfolio of drugs to the target market. Factors influencing this decision are the optimal reach (how many physicians to see) and frequency (how often to see  them) for each individual physician, how many patients suffer from that disease state, how many sales representatives to devote to office and group practice and how many to devote to hospital accounts if needed. To aid this decision, customers are broken down into different classes according to their prescription behavior, patient population, and of course, their business potential.\n\nMarketers attempt to identify the set of physicians most likely to prescribe a given drug. Historically, this was done by measuring the number of total prescriptions (TRx) and new prescriptions (NRx) per week that each physician writes. This information is collected by commercial vendors. The physicians are then \"deciled\" into ten groups based on their writing patterns. Higher deciles are more aggressively targeted. Some pharmaceutical companies use additional information such as:\n* Profitability of a prescription (script),\n* Accessibility of the physician,\n* Tendency of the physician to use the pharmaceutical company's drugs,\n* Effect of managed care formularies on the ability of the physician to prescribe a drug,\n* The [[adoption sequence]] of the physician (that is, how readily the physician adopts new drugs in place of older treatments), and\n* The tendency of the physician to use a wide palette of drugs\n* Influence that physicians have on their colleagues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Kiefer|authorlink1=Kiefer Lee|last2=Carter|first2=Steve|date=2012|title=Global Marketing Management|edition=3rd|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=524|isbn=978-0-19-960970-3}}</ref>\n\nPhysicians are perhaps the most important component in  sales. They  write the prescriptions that determine which drugs will be used by  people.  Influencing the physician is the key to pharmaceutical sales.  Historically, this was done by a large pharmaceutical sales force. A  medium-sized  pharmaceutical company might have a sales force of 1000  representatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}  The largest companies have tens of thousands of representatives around  the world. Sales representatives called upon physicians regularly,  providing clinical information, approved journal articles, and free drug samples. This is still the approach  today; however, economic pressures on the industry are causing  pharmaceutical companies to rethink the traditional sales process to  physicians. The industry has seen a large scale adoption of Pharma CRM systems that works on laptops and more recently [[Tablet computer|tablets]]. The new age pharmaceutical representative is armed with key data at his fingertips and tools to maximize the time spent with physicians.\n\n===Peer influence===\n;Key opinion leaders\nKey opinion leaders (KOL), or \"thought leaders\", are  respected individuals, such as prominent medical school faculty, who  influence physicians through their professional status. Pharmaceutical  companies generally engage key opinion leaders early in the drug  development process to provide advocacy and key marketing feedback.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharma-mkting.com/glossary/keyopinionleader.htm  |title=Glossary Term: Key Opinion Leader |website= |accessdate=}}</ref> Some  pharmaceutical companies identify key opinion leaders through direct  inquiry of physicians (primary research).  Recently, pharmaceutical companies have begun to use [[social network analysis]] to uncover thought leaders; because it does not introduce respondent bias, which is commonly found in primary research; it can identify and map out the entire scientific community for a disease state; and it has greater compliance with state and federal regulations; because physician prescribing patterns are not used to create the social network.<ref>http://www.lnxpharma.com/images/pages/Lnx_Whitepaper_1.pdf</ref>\n\nAlternatives  to  segmenting physicians purely on the basis of prescribing do exist,  and  marketers can call upon strategic partners who specialize in   delineating which characteristics of true opinion leadership, a   physician does or does not possess.  Such analyses can help guide   marketers in how to optimize KOL engagements as bona fide advisors to a   brand, and can help shape clinical development and clinical data   publication plans for instance, ultimately advancing patient care.\n\n;Colleagues\nPhysicians  acquire information through informal contacts with their colleagues,  including social events, professional affiliations, common hospital  affiliations, and common medical school affiliations. Some  pharmaceutical companies identify influential colleagues through  commercially available prescription writing and patient level data.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pharmexec.com/pharmexec/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=395598  |title=www.pharmexec.com |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\nDoctor  dinner meetings are an effective way for physicians to acquire  educational information from respected peers.  These meetings are  sponsored by some pharmaceutical companies.\n\n===Journal articles and technical documentation===\n\nRecent legal cases and US congressional  hearings have provided access to [[Drug Industry Document Archive|pharmaceutical industry documents]]  revealing new marketing strategies for drugs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/abstract/145/4/284  |title=Narrative Review: The Promotion of Gabapentin: An Analysis of Internal Industry Documents -- Steinman et al. 145 (4): 284 -- Annals of Internal Medicine |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>  Activities  once considered independent of promotional intent, including [[continuing medical education]] and [[medical research]],  are used, including paying to publish articles about promoted drugs for  the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study  results.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/145/4/305?etoc  |title=Safeguarding Patient Welfare: Who's In Charge? -- Henney 145 (4): 305 -- Annals of Internal Medicine |format= |website= |accessdate=}}</ref>\n\n===Private and public insurers===\nPublic and private insurers affect the writing of prescriptions by physicians through [[Formulary (pharmacy)|formularies]] that restrict the number and types of drugs that the insurer will cover. Not only can the insurer affect drug sales by including or excluding a particular drug from a formulary, they can affect sales by tiering, or placing bureaucratic hurdles to prescribing certain drugs. In January 2006, the United States instituted a new public prescription drug plan through its [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program. Known as [[Medicare Part&nbsp;D]], this program engages private insurers to negotiate with [[Pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] for the placement of drugs on tiered formularies.\n\n==To consumers==\nOnly two countries as of 2008 allow [[direct to consumer advertising]] (DTCA): the United States and New Zealand.<ref name=\"NYT-20151127\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=Women08/> Since the late 1970s, DTCA of prescription drugs has become important in the United States. It takes two main forms: the promotion or creation of a disease out of a non-pathologic physical condition or the promotion of a medication.<ref name=Women08/> The rhetorical objective of direct-to-consumer advertising is to directly influence the patient-physician dialogue.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mogull|first=Scott A.|last2=Balzhiser|first2=Deborah|date=September 2015|title=Pharmaceutical Companies Are Writing the Script for Health Consumerism|journal=Commun.

In some areas it is required that ads for drugs include a list of possible side effects, so that users are informed of both facets of a medicine. [[Canada]]'s limitations on pharmaceutical advertising ensure that commercials that mention the name of a product cannot in any way describe what it does. Commercials that mention a medical problem cannot also mention the name of the product for sale; at most, they can direct the viewer to a website or telephone number operated by the pharmaceutical company.\n\nReynold Spector has provided examples of how positive and negative hype can affect perceptions of pharmaceuticals using examples of certain cancer drugs, such as [[Avastin]] and [[Opdivo]], in the former case and [[statin]]s in the latter.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spector |first1=Reynold |title=Drug Therapy Hype: The Misuse of Data |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2018 |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=44\u201349}}</ref>\n\n===Drug coupons===\nIn the United States, pharmaceutical companies often provide [[drug coupon]]s to consumers to help offset the [[copayment]]s charged by health insurers for prescription medication. These coupons are generally used to promote medications that compete with non-preferred products and cheaper, generic alternatives by reducing or eliminating the extra out-of-pocket costs that an insurers typically charge a patient for a non-preferred drug product.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lunzer Kritz|first=Francesca|title=Check out drug coupons, then check bottom line|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/dec/03/health/he-coupons3|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=3 December 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Economics==\nPharmaceutical company spending on marketing exceeds that spent on research.<ref name=\"Brezis2008\" /><ref name=Women08/>  In 2004 in Canada $1.7 billion a year was spent marketing drugs to physicians and in the United States $21 billion were spent in 2002.<ref name=McGill04>{{cite web  |url=http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/MJM/issues/v08n01/orig_articles/barfett.pdf  |title=www.medicine.mcgill.ca |format= |website=  |accessdate=}}</ref>  In 2005 money spent on pharmaceutical marketing in the United States was estimated at $29.9 billion with one estimate as high as $57 billion.<ref name=Women08>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sufrin CB, Ross JS |title=Pharmaceutical industry marketing: understanding its impact on women's health |journal=Obstet Gynecol Surv |volume=63 |issue=9 |pages=585\u201396 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18713478 |doi=10.1097/OGX.0b013e31817f1585 |url=}}</ref>  When the US number are broken down 56% was free samples, 25% was detailing of physicians, 12.5% was direct to users advertising, 4% on hospital detailing, and 2% on journal ads.<ref name=McGill04/> In the United States approximately $20 billion could be saved if generics were used instead of equivalent brand name products.<ref name=Women08/>\n\nAlthough pharmaceutical companies have made large investments in marketing their products, overall promotional spending has been decreasing over the last few years, and declined by 10 percent from 2009 to 2010.

[[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulations require all prescription drug promotion to be truthful and not misleading, based on \"substantial evidence or substantial clinical experience\", to provide a \"fair balance\" between the risks and benefits of the promoted drug, and to maintain consistency with labeling approved by the FDA. The FDA Office of Prescription Drug Promotion enforces these requirements.\n\nIn the 1990s, antipsychotics were \"still seen as treatments for the most serious mental illnesses, like hallucinatory schizophrenia, and recast them for much broader uses\". Drugs such as [[Abilify]] and [[Geodon]] were given to a broad range of patients, from preschoolers to octogenarians. In 2010, more than a half-million youths took antipsychotic drugs, and one-quarter of nursing-home residents have used them. Yet the government warns that the drugs may be fatal to some older patients and have unknown effects on children.<ref name=bied2010/>\n\nEvery major company selling the drugs\u2014[[Bristol-Myers Squibb]], [[Eli Lilly]], [[Pfizer]], [[AstraZeneca]], and [[Johnson & Johnson]]\u2014has either settled recent government cases, under the False Claims Act, for hundreds of millions of dollars or is currently under investigation for possible health care fraud. Following charges of illegal marketing, two of the settlements in 2009 set records for the largest criminal fines ever imposed on corporations. One involved Eli Lilly\u2019s antipsychotic [[Zyprexa]], and the other involved  [[Bextra]]. In the Bextra case, the government also charged Pfizer with illegally marketing another antipsychotic, [[Geodon]]; Pfizer settled that part of the claim for $301 million, without admitting any wrongdoing.<ref name=bied2010>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/03psych.html?_r=3&hp=&pagewanted=all |title=Side Effects May Include Lawsuits |author=Duff Wilson |date=2 October 2010  |work=[[New York Times]] }}</ref>\n\nThe following is a list of the four largest settlements reached with [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] from 1991 to 2012, rank ordered by the size of the total settlement.

Both physicians  and users are increasing their reliance on the Internet as a source of health and medical information, prompting pharmaceutical marketers to look at digital channels for opportunities to reach their target  audiences.\n\nIn 2008, 84% of U.S. physicians used the  Internet and other technologies to access pharmaceutical, biotech or  medical device information\u2014a 20% increase from 2004. At the same time, sales reps are  finding it more difficult to get time with doctors for in-person details.  Pharmaceutical companies are exploring online marketing as an alternative way to reach physicians. Emerging e-promotional activities include live video detailing, online events, electronic sampling, and physician customer service portals such as PV Updates, MDLinx, Aptus Health (former Physicians Interactive), and [[Epocrates]].\n\nDirect-to-users  marketers are also recognizing the need to shift to digital channels as audiences become more fragmented and the number of access points for news, entertainment and information multiplies. Standard television,  radio and print direct-to-users (DTC) advertisements are less relevant than in the past, and companies  are beginning to focus more on digital marketing efforts like product websites, [[display advertising|online display advertising]], [[search engine marketing]], [[social media]] campaigns, place-based media and [[mobile advertising]] to reach the over 145 million U.S. adults online for health information.\n\nIn 2010, the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]]'s Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising and Communications issued a warning letter concerning two unbranded consumer targeted Web sites sponsored by [[Novartis]] Pharmaceuticals Corporation as the websites promoted a drug for an unapproved use, the websites failed to disclose the risks associated with the use of the drug and made unsubstantiated dosing claims.<ref>{{citation |author=Debra Dunne |title=Unbranded Web Sites: FDA Finds Violative Promotional Practices |date=October 4, 2010 |publisher=Stradley Ronon  |url= https://www.natlawreview.com/article/unbranded-web-sites-fda-finds-violative-promotional-practices|access-date=May 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=27em}}\n\n* [[Big Pharma conspiracy theory]]\n* ''[[Big Pharma (book)|Big Pharma: How the World's Biggest Drug Companies Control Illness]]'' (2006) by Jacky Law\n* ''[[Side Effects (Bass book)|Side Effects]]'' (2008) by [[Alison Bass]]\n* ''[[Bad Pharma]]'' (2012) by [[Ben Goldacre]]\n* [[Disease mongering]]\n* [[Ethics in pharmaceutical sales]]\n* [[Inverse benefit law]]\n* [[National pharmaceuticals policy]]\n* [[Pharmaceutical lobby]]\n* [[Prescription Drug Marketing Act]]\n* [[Prescription drug prices in the United States]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}{{refbegin}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* ''Insider's Guide to the World of Pharmaceutical Sales'', Seventh Edition ({{ISBN|0-9704153-6-2}})\n* Merrill Goozner, ''The $800 million pill''.

The interplay of exceptional strengths and weaknesses in a single individual results in inconsistency in performance. They might present any of the three profiles identified by educator and researcher Susan Baum:\n* Bright but not trying hard enough\n* Learning disabled but with no exceptional abilities\n* Average\nIn the case of behavioral/socioemotional, rather than cognitive problems, both strengths and deficits can be intensified.\nA 2e student's grades commonly alternate between high and low, sometimes within the same subject. The child might have advanced vocabulary and ideas but be unable to organize those ideas and express them on paper. They might be a skilled artist or builder but turn in assignments that are messy or illegible. They might complete assignments but lose them or forget to turn them in. To the parents and teachers observing this behavior, it may seem that the child just isn't trying. In fact, many 2e children work as hard if not harder than others, but with less to show for their efforts.\nThis struggle to accomplish tasks that appear easy for other students can leave 2e children frustrated, anxious, and depressed. It can rob them of their enthusiasm and energy for school and damage their self-esteem.\n\n==Identifying twice exceptionality==\nTwice exceptionality is not something that can solidly be diagnosed and therefore is not easily identified in students. Children identified as twice exceptional can exhibit a wide range of traits, many of them typical of gifted children. Like those who are gifted, 2e children often show greater asynchrony than average children (that is, a larger gap between their [[mental age]] and physical age). They are often intense and highly sensitive to their emotional and physical environments.

In their early years, these children often seem very bright, with varied interests and advanced vocabularies (particularly with reference to same-age peers); and many times parents are unaware that they have a child with 2e. Teachers sometimes spot problems in school; sometimes parents are the first to notice their children's frustrations with school. During the early years it may be social difficulties. The 2e child may find it hard to make friends and fit in. Academic problems often appear later. As work demands increase, teachers may see a drop or inconsistencies in the student's performance, sometimes accompanied by an increase in problem behaviors. Some 2e students withdraw, showing reluctance to speak out or take other risks in class; while others play the class clown. Some are unable to stay focused, find it hard to sit still and work quietly, and have difficulty controlling anger or frustration.\n\nIf these difficulties persist, school personnel or parents may decide that evaluation is needed. Along with a physical examination, children may undergo psycho-educational testing to determine the cause of their struggles. The professionals who take part in the process should be knowledgeable about giftedness. Some characteristics of giftedness can look very much like those of a learning disability or disorder and, as a result, gifted children are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with disorders.<ref>Webb, J.T.;  Amend, E.R.; Webb, N.E.; Goerss, J.; Beljan, P.; Olenchak, F.R. (2005). The Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults: ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, Asperger's, Depression, and Other Disorders. Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.</ref> Evaluation results should indicate the child's areas of strength and weakness and identify whether any disorders or learning disabilities are present. In addition, the results should include information on what the child needs in order to build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses that have been identified. Teaching to students' abilities rather than disabilities increases self-concept scores.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=M.E.|last2=Mortorff-Albert|first2=S.|title=The effects of special education service on the self-concept and school attitude of learning disabled/gifted students|journal=Roeper Review|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29\u201336|doi=10.1080/02783198909553227}}</ref>\n\n==Support==\nTheir strengths are the key to success for twice-exceptional children. They thrive on intellectual challenges in their areas of interest and ability. Many 2e children do best when given work that engages multiple senses and offers opportunities for hands-on learning. However, a requirement for success for these students is support, either given informally as needed or formalized in an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|504 plan]].\n\nSupport can come in several forms. An essential form is encouragement; others include compensation strategies and accommodations in the child's areas of weakness. For example, 2e students may benefit from learning time-management skills and organizational techniques; and they may need to have extra time on tests and reduced homework. The student's strengths should not merely be viewed as means through which they can compensate for their areas of weakness. Proper support for a twice-exceptional student must include accommodations to allow them to develop and challenge their gifts as well. It is essential for these students to feel as though they are being noticed for their gifts more than just their weaknesses, otherwise the student may fall into negative behavioral patterns such as the ones aforementioned. In sum, appropriate interventions should address both the academic and social emotional needs of 2e learners.\n\nSchool counselors have a unique role in supporting 2e students. Counselors are positioned to be a valuable resource for teachers, other school personnel, and community members who might not be familiar with twice-exceptionality. Foley-Nicpon and Assouline (2015) conducted a systematic review of the existing research regarding 2e students.<ref name=\"sdsu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

They also found that 2e individuals with ASD may generally have both high ability and significant differences in their ability and achievement profiles, including weaknesses in processing information quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

The 2e education approach is backed by 35 years of research and best practices tailored to the unique needs of 2e students. It is a marriage between special education and gifted education\u2014a strengths-based, differentiated approach that provides special educational supports. Many argue that talent development is the most critical aspect of their education.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Meeting the needs of gifted students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}</ref>\n\nWhen teaching 2e students there are methods an educator should avoid. Twice exceptionality students do not respond well to lectures, and tend to gravitate more toward \"big picture\" learning{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. These students have a hard time following unnecessarily strict rules, and should not be expected to conform to them. Instead, being flexible with them, and focusing more on holistic, big-picture learning is recommended.\n\nStill, finding schools that can meet the needs of twice exceptional children can be a challenge for many parents. Public and private schools with programs that combine the appropriate levels of challenge and support for these learners are in the minority. For this reason, a number of parents choose [[alternative education]]al options for their 2e children, including [[homeschooling]] and [[virtual schools]].<ref>Neumann, L. C. (2008).

Mansfield Center, CT: Creative Learning Press.</ref> although as yet there is no empirical research to confirm this theory. The interplay of exceptional strengths and weaknesses in a single individual results in inconsistency in performance. They might present any of the three profiles identified by educator and researcher Susan Baum:\n* Bright but not trying hard enough\n* Learning disabled but with no exceptional abilities\n* Average\nIn the case of behavioral/socioemotional, rather than cognitive problems, both strengths and deficits can be intensified.\nA 2e student's grades commonly alternate between high and low, sometimes within the same subject. The child might have advanced vocabulary and ideas but be unable to organize those ideas and express them on paper. They might be a skilled artist or builder but turn in assignments that are messy or illegible. They might complete assignments but lose them or forget to turn them in. To the parents and teachers observing this behavior, it may seem that the child just isn't trying. In fact, many 2e children work as hard if not harder than others, but with less to show for their efforts.\nThis struggle to accomplish tasks that appear easy for other students can leave 2e children frustrated, anxious, and depressed. It can rob them of their enthusiasm and energy for school and damage their self-esteem.\n\n==Identifying twice exceptionality==\nTwice exceptionality is not something that can solidly be diagnosed and therefore is not easily identified in students. Children identified as twice exceptional can exhibit a wide range of traits, many of them typical of gifted children. Like those who are gifted, 2e children often show greater asynchrony than average children (that is, a larger gap between their [[mental age]] and physical age). They are often intense and highly sensitive to their emotional and physical environments.

In their early years, these children often seem very bright, with varied interests and advanced vocabularies (particularly with reference to same-age peers); and many times parents are unaware that they have a child with 2e. Teachers sometimes spot problems in school; sometimes parents are the first to notice their children's frustrations with school. During the early years it may be social difficulties. The 2e child may find it hard to make friends and fit in. Academic problems often appear later. As work demands increase, teachers may see a drop or inconsistencies in the student's performance, sometimes accompanied by an increase in problem behaviors. Some 2e students withdraw, showing reluctance to speak out or take other risks in class; while others play the class clown. Some are unable to stay focused, find it hard to sit still and work quietly, and have difficulty controlling anger or frustration.\n\nIf these difficulties persist, school personnel or parents may decide that evaluation is needed. Along with a physical examination, children may undergo psycho-educational testing to determine the cause of their struggles. The professionals who take part in the process should be knowledgeable about giftedness. Some characteristics of giftedness can look very much like those of a learning disability or disorder and, as a result, gifted children are sometimes incorrectly diagnosed with disorders.<ref>Webb, J.T.;  Amend, E.R.; Webb, N.E.; Goerss, J.; Beljan, P.; Olenchak, F.R. (2005). The Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults: ADHD, Bipolar, OCD, Asperger's, Depression, and Other Disorders. Scottsdale, AZ: Great Potential Press.</ref> Evaluation results should indicate the child's areas of strength and weakness and identify whether any disorders or learning disabilities are present. In addition, the results should include information on what the child needs in order to build on the strengths and compensate for the weaknesses that have been identified. Teaching to students' abilities rather than disabilities increases self-concept scores.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=M.E.|last2=Mortorff-Albert|first2=S.|title=The effects of special education service on the self-concept and school attitude of learning disabled/gifted students|journal=Roeper Review|date=1989|volume=12|issue=1|pages=29\u201336|doi=10.1080/02783198909553227}}</ref>\n\n==Support==\nTheir strengths are the key to success for twice-exceptional children. They thrive on intellectual challenges in their areas of interest and ability. Many 2e children do best when given work that engages multiple senses and offers opportunities for hands-on learning. However, a requirement for success for these students is support, either given informally as needed or formalized in an [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|504 plan]].\n\nSupport can come in several forms. An essential form is encouragement; others include compensation strategies and accommodations in the child's areas of weakness. For example, 2e students may benefit from learning time-management skills and organizational techniques; and they may need to have extra time on tests and reduced homework. The student's strengths should not merely be viewed as means through which they can compensate for their areas of weakness. Proper support for a twice-exceptional student must include accommodations to allow them to develop and challenge their gifts as well. It is essential for these students to feel as though they are being noticed for their gifts more than just their weaknesses, otherwise the student may fall into negative behavioral patterns such as the ones aforementioned. In sum, appropriate interventions should address both the academic and social emotional needs of 2e learners.\n\nSchool counselors have a unique role in supporting 2e students. Counselors are positioned to be a valuable resource for teachers, other school personnel, and community members who might not be familiar with twice-exceptionality. Foley-Nicpon and Assouline (2015) conducted a systematic review of the existing research regarding 2e students.<ref name=\"sdsu-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com\">{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

They also found that 2e individuals with ASD may generally have both high ability and significant differences in their ability and achievement profiles, including weaknesses in processing information quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Foley-Nicpon |first1=M. |last2=Assouline |first2=S.

The 2e education approach is backed by 35 years of research and best practices tailored to the unique needs of 2e students.

Many argue that talent development is the most critical aspect of their education.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=S.M.|last2=Owen|first2=S.V.|title=To be gifted and learning disabled: Meeting the needs of gifted students with LD, ADHD and more|date=2004|publisher=Creative Learning Press|location=Mansfield Center, CT}}</ref>\n\nWhen teaching 2e students there are methods an educator should avoid. Twice exceptionality students do not respond well to lectures, and tend to gravitate more toward \"big picture\" learning{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}. These students have a hard time following unnecessarily strict rules, and should not be expected to conform to them. Instead, being flexible with them, and focusing more on holistic, big-picture learning is recommended.\n\nStill, finding schools that can meet the needs of twice exceptional children can be a challenge for many parents. Public and private schools with programs that combine the appropriate levels of challenge and support for these learners are in the minority. For this reason, a number of parents choose [[alternative education]]al options for their 2e children, including [[homeschooling]] and [[virtual schools]].<ref>Neumann, L. C. (2008).

Before the advent of motorized transport, an officer's batman was also in charge of the officer's \"bat-horse\" that carried the pack saddle with his officer's kit during a campaign.\n\nThe UK English term is derived from the obsolete ''bat'', meaning \"[[pack saddle]]\" (from [[French language|French]] ''b\u00e2t'', from [[Old French]] ''bast'', from [[Late Latin]] ''bastum'').\n\n== Duties ==\nA batman's duties often include:\n* acting as a \"runner\" to convey orders from the officer to subordinates\n* maintaining the officer's [[uniform]] and personal equipment as a [[valet]]\n* driving the officer's vehicle, sometimes under combat conditions\n* acting as the officer's [[bodyguard]] in combat\n* digging the officer's [[Defensive fighting position|foxhole]] in combat, giving the officer time to direct his unit<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scheffel|type=Kindle|first1=Charles|last2=Basden|first2=Barry|title=Crack! and Thump: With a Combat Infantry Officer in World War II|date=8 January 2007|publisher=Camroc Press LLC|page=28|chapter=3 Operation Torch|quote=Your batman's first job [...] is to dig a slit trench.

In armies where officers typically came from the upper class, it was not unusual for a former batman to follow the officer into later civilian life as a [[domestic servant]].\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== France ===\n<!-- UK English term {{contradiction|date=November 2012}} -->\n\n[[File:Napoleon Orderly officer by Bellange.jpg|thumb|French orderly, [[Napoleonic Wars]].]]\nIn the [[French Army]] the term for batman was ''ordonnance'' (\"orderly\"). Batmen were officially abolished after [[World War II]]. However, in the 1960s there were still batmen in the French Army.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn the [[German Army]] the batman was known as ''Ordonnanz'' (\"orderly\") from the French \"ordonnance\", or colloquially as ''Putzer'' (\"cleaner\") or as ''Bursche'' (\"boy\" or \"valet\").\n\nThe main character [[\u0160vejk]] of the antimilitarist, satirical novel ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'' by the Czech author [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]] is the most famous portrayal of a batman drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. (The 1967 German song \"''[[Ich war der Putzer vom Kaiser]]''\" is actually based on the British instrumental hit \"[[I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman]]\" of the same year, with original German lyrics.)<ref>\"S\u00e4nger der F\u00fcnfziger Jahre\" is a web-page maintained by G\u00fcnter Schiemenz dedicated to the popular music of the 1950s under www.fuenfzigerjahresaenger.de.

It has now, however, been replaced with the [[Hindi]] word ''sahayak'', which translates as \"assistant\" or \"helper\". There have been suggestions to do away with the practice, as the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force already have.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100305/jsp/nation/story_12180561.jsp |title=Sahayak scrap cry |work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)]] |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn the [[Italian Army]] the term for batman was ''attendente'', from the Italian verb ''attendere'' (same meaning of the English verb ''to attend''). ''Attendenti'' were eventually abolished in 1971.\n\n=== Nigeria ===\nThe term ''Orderly'' is in use for both the military and police assistants.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nThe term \"batman\" in the [[Pakistan Army]] dates from the period of the [[British Indian Army]]. In the modern Pakistan Army, civilian personnel are employed in this role and are designated as NCB (Non-Combatant Bearer). The term implies that the present-day batman is not a soldier or part of the fighting cadre of the army, and works only as a personal servant to each officer.\n\nThe employment of NCBs in the [[Pakistan Air Force]] and the [[Pakistan Navy]] is not officially recognized. However both these services pay their officers an extra allowance comparable to the average pay of a household servant.\n\n=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===\n[[File:17 2398 Book illustrations of Historical description of the clothes and weapons of Russian troops.jpg|thumb|right|192px|<center> Batman (military) (1802\u20131812)</center>]]\n\nThe [[Imperial Russian Army]] used the term ''denshchik'' ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a}}) for a batman. In the Russian Empire higher-ranking [[cavalry]] officers often chose [[Cossacks]] for these roles as they could be reasonably depended on to survive [[combat]], and were also known for resourcefulness on [[Military campaign|campaign]]. However, they were hired help, and had to be provided with a horse also. The lower-ranking officers from serf-owning families brought a servant from home they were familiar with, particularly the [[infantry]] and [[artillery]] officers that did not require additional protection in combat, and tended to leave the servants with the unit [[baggage train]]. After the abolition of [[serfdom]] in the Russian Empire (1861), many officers went on campaign without servants.\n\nAlthough the positions were abolished in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, the recognition that higher-ranking officers required assistance soon fostered an unofficial reintroduction of the role through secondment of an NCO to the officer's staff, usually also as the driver, which also at one stage became their unofficial role and title as many officers often \"lived\" out of their vehicles. The term was borrowed from the French, but adopted to Russian pronunciation as ''ordinarets'' ({{lang-ru|\u041e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0446}}).\n\nSeveral ''ordirnartsy'' of the [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|marshals]] and generals commanding fronts and armies during the [[Second World War]] wrote memoirs about their service. For example, [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]]'s \"driver\" was a semi-professional racing car driver Aleksandr Nikolaevich Buchin who met Zhukov by accident on the first day of the war when Zhukov's previous elderly driver failed to get the vehicle he was in out of the rut. Buchin drove Zhukov throughout the war and although he began the war as a private, he ended the war with the rank of captain. Buchin wrote his memoirs called ''One hundred and seventy thousand kilometres with Zhukov'', at the suggestion of the marshal in the 1970s.\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe term \"emir eri\" was used for a soldier that attends an officer. The practice was abolished in 1950.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe official term used by the [[British Army]] in the First World War was \"soldier-servant\". Every officer was assigned a servant, usually chosen by the officer from among his men. The term ''batman'' replaced this in the inter-war years. By the Second World War, only senior officers of the army and [[Royal Air Force]] were officially assigned batmen, with junior officers usually sharing the services of one batman among several officers. Batwomen also served in the women's services.\n\nBatman was usually seen as a desirable position. The soldier was exempted from more onerous duties and often got better rations and other favours from his officer. Senior officers' batmen usually received fast promotion to [[lance-corporal]], with many becoming [[corporal]]s and even [[sergeant]]s. The position was generally phased out after the war. Officers of the [[Household Division]] however still have orderlies, because of the high proportion of ceremonial duties required of them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Family History : Bretz-Halliday-George-Neilson|url=http://www.bretz.ca/GenWeb/html/george/narratives/4/|website=Our Family History|language=en-CA}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]] stewards performed many of the duties of batmen in the other services. Aboard ship, only [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captains]] and [[admiral]]s were assigned personal stewards, with the other officers being served by a pool of officers' stewards. Most vessels carried at least two stewards, with larger vessels carrying considerably more.\n\nThe term \"orderly\" was often used instead of \"batman\" in the [[British Empire|colonial forces]], especially in the [[British Indian Army]]. The orderly was frequently a civilian instead of a soldier.

In armies where officers typically came from the upper class, it was not unusual for a former batman to follow the officer into later civilian life as a [[domestic servant]].\n\n== By country ==\n\n=== France ===\n<!-- UK English term {{contradiction|date=November 2012}} -->\n\n[[File:Napoleon Orderly officer by Bellange.jpg|thumb|French orderly, [[Napoleonic Wars]].]]\nIn the [[French Army]] the term for batman was ''ordonnance'' (\"orderly\"). Batmen were officially abolished after [[World War II]]. However, in the 1960s there were still batmen in the French Army.\n\n=== Germany ===\nIn the [[German Army]] the batman was known as ''Ordonnanz'' (\"orderly\") from the French \"ordonnance\", or colloquially as ''Putzer'' (\"cleaner\") or as ''Bursche'' (\"boy\" or \"valet\").\n\nThe main character [[\u0160vejk]] of the antimilitarist, satirical novel ''[[The Good Soldier \u0160vejk]]'' by the Czech author [[Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek]] is the most famous portrayal of a batman drafted into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during the [[World War I|First World War]].

It has now, however, been replaced with the [[Hindi]] word ''sahayak'', which translates as \"assistant\" or \"helper\". There have been suggestions to do away with the practice, as the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force already have.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.telegraphindia.com/1100305/jsp/nation/story_12180561.jsp |title=Sahayak scrap cry |work=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)]] |date=5 March 2010 |accessdate=21 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Italy ===\nIn the [[Italian Army]] the term for batman was ''attendente'', from the Italian verb ''attendere'' (same meaning of the English verb ''to attend''). ''Attendenti'' were eventually abolished in 1971.\n\n=== Nigeria ===\nThe term ''Orderly'' is in use for both the military and police assistants.\n\n=== Pakistan ===\nThe term \"batman\" in the [[Pakistan Army]] dates from the period of the [[British Indian Army]]. In the modern Pakistan Army, civilian personnel are employed in this role and are designated as NCB (Non-Combatant Bearer). The term implies that the present-day batman is not a soldier or part of the fighting cadre of the army, and works only as a personal servant to each officer.\n\nThe employment of NCBs in the [[Pakistan Air Force]] and the [[Pakistan Navy]] is not officially recognized. However both these services pay their officers an extra allowance comparable to the average pay of a household servant.\n\n=== Russia and the Soviet Union ===\n[[File:17 2398 Book illustrations of Historical description of the clothes and weapons of Russian troops.jpg|thumb|right|192px|<center> Batman (military) (1802\u20131812)</center>]]\n\nThe [[Imperial Russian Army]] used the term ''denshchik'' ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u0435\u043d\u0449\u0438\u043a}}) for a batman. In the Russian Empire higher-ranking [[cavalry]] officers often chose [[Cossacks]] for these roles as they could be reasonably depended on to survive [[combat]], and were also known for resourcefulness on [[Military campaign|campaign]]. However, they were hired help, and had to be provided with a horse also. The lower-ranking officers from serf-owning families brought a servant from home they were familiar with, particularly the [[infantry]] and [[artillery]] officers that did not require additional protection in combat, and tended to leave the servants with the unit [[baggage train]]. After the abolition of [[serfdom]] in the Russian Empire (1861), many officers went on campaign without servants.\n\nAlthough the positions were abolished in the post-revolutionary Soviet Union, the recognition that higher-ranking officers required assistance soon fostered an unofficial reintroduction of the role through secondment of an NCO to the officer's staff, usually also as the driver, which also at one stage became their unofficial role and title as many officers often \"lived\" out of their vehicles. The term was borrowed from the French, but adopted to Russian pronunciation as ''ordinarets'' ({{lang-ru|\u041e\u0440\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0446}}).\n\nSeveral ''ordirnartsy'' of the [[Marshal of the Soviet Union|marshals]] and generals commanding fronts and armies during the [[Second World War]] wrote memoirs about their service. For example, [[Georgy Zhukov|Zhukov]]'s \"driver\" was a semi-professional racing car driver Aleksandr Nikolaevich Buchin who met Zhukov by accident on the first day of the war when Zhukov's previous elderly driver failed to get the vehicle he was in out of the rut. Buchin drove Zhukov throughout the war and although he began the war as a private, he ended the war with the rank of captain. Buchin wrote his memoirs called ''One hundred and seventy thousand kilometres with Zhukov'', at the suggestion of the marshal in the 1970s.\n\n=== Turkey ===\nThe term \"emir eri\" was used for a soldier that attends an officer. The practice was abolished in 1950.\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nThe official term used by the [[British Army]] in the First World War was \"soldier-servant\". Every officer was assigned a servant, usually chosen by the officer from among his men. The term ''batman'' replaced this in the inter-war years. By the Second World War, only senior officers of the army and [[Royal Air Force]] were officially assigned batmen, with junior officers usually sharing the services of one batman among several officers. Batwomen also served in the women's services.\n\nBatman was usually seen as a desirable position. The soldier was exempted from more onerous duties and often got better rations and other favours from his officer. Senior officers' batmen usually received fast promotion to [[lance-corporal]], with many becoming [[corporal]]s and even [[sergeant]]s. The position was generally phased out after the war. Officers of the [[Household Division]] however still have orderlies, because of the high proportion of ceremonial duties required of them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Family History : Bretz-Halliday-George-Neilson|url=http://www.bretz.ca/GenWeb/html/george/narratives/4/|website=Our Family History|language=en-CA}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Royal Navy]] stewards performed many of the duties of batmen in the other services. Aboard ship, only [[Captain (Royal Navy)|captains]] and [[admiral]]s were assigned personal stewards, with the other officers being served by a pool of officers' stewards. Most vessels carried at least two stewards, with larger vessels carrying considerably more.\n\nThe term \"orderly\" was often used instead of \"batman\" in the [[British Empire|colonial forces]], especially in the [[British Indian Army]]. The orderly was frequently a civilian instead of a soldier. However, from 1903 to 1939 four Indian officers from different regiments were appointed each year to serve as \"King's (or Queen's) Indian Orderly Officers\" in attendance on the monarch in London. While performing some routine orderly functions the main role of these officers was to represent the Indian Army in [[full dress uniform]] at ceremonial functions in front of the British public who might otherwise seldom be made aware of its existence.<ref>Pages 161, 163 and 164, \"The Indian Army\", Boris Mollo, {{ISBN|0 7137 1074 8}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[British Armed Forces]], the term \"batman\" or \"batwoman\" was formerly also applied to a civilian who cleaned officers' messes or married quarters.

In the earlier series, taking place between the 1400s and the early 1800s, he plays Edmund Blackadder's [[dogsbody]] Baldrick, a similar, non-military role.\n\nIn the ''[[Honor Bound series|Honor Bound]]'' book series (1993\u20132012), the character of Sergeant Major Enrico Rodriguez served in this capacity to Cletus Frade's father.\n\nIn the animated television series ''[[ReBoot]]'' (1994\u20132001), 1 binome Binky Ffarquarson is batman to 0 binome fighter pilot Algernon Cholmondley-Worthington III (who is addressed in canon only as \"sir\").\n\nIn the television show ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'' (created in 2009), the eponymous character's valet, Woodhouse, was the batman of his superior officer in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War.\n\nIn the television series ''[[Downton Abbey]]'' (2010\u20132015), Lord Grantham's valet, Mr Bates, was his batman in the [[Boer War]]; it also appears that William Mason was assigned to be Matthew Crawley's batman in the First World War.\n\nIn the television series \n''[[Blunt Talk]]'' (2015\u20132016), Adrian Scarborough played Harry Chandler,[8] Falklands War veteran and former Royal Marines lance corporal turned Walter's valen.\n\nIn the 2012 novel ''[[Cold Days]]'' by [[Jim Butcher]], the lead character, Harry Dresden is assigned a batman, and initially both Harry and Cat Sith are very unhappy with this assignment.\n\nIn [[Terry Pratchett]]'s 2013 novel ''[[Monstrous Regiment (novel)|Monstrous Regiment]]'', the main character serves as batman to her lieutenant.\n\n[[Frank Herbert]]\u2019s 1984 novel ''[[Heretics of Dune (novel)|Heretics of Dune]]'', Patrin, the aide of Miles Teg, is referred to as the Bashar\u2019s Batman.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Adjutant]]\n*[[Aide-de-camp]] (ADC)\n*[[Bagman]]\n*[[Squire]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links ==\n{{Wiktionary|batman}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/july/batmen.htm |title=Recollections from memory about batmen |first=Muhammad |last=Akhtar Khan |work=Defence Journal |location=Karachi |date=July 2001 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020818015349/http://www.defencejournal.com/2001/july/batmen.htm |archivedate=18 August 2002  }}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Batman (Military)}}\n[[Category:Military life]]\n[[Category:Personal care and service occupations]]\n", "name_user": "66.227.192.133", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eFiction:Again attempt link fix)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_(military)"}

The term has its origin in the [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|[[\u015bi\u1e63ya]]}}'', meaning \"disciple, learner\" or ''{{IAST|\u015bik\u1e63a}}'', meaning \"instruction\".\n\n==Historical importance to [[Sikh]] religion==\n*'''[[Bhai Mardana]]''' (1459-1534) was Guru Nanak Dev's companion on all of his Udasis (travels) and he played kirtan.\n*'''[[Bebe Nanaki]]''' (1464-1518) is known as the first Sikh. She was the elder sister of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder and first Guru (teacher) of Sikhism.

Sri Chand was a renounciate [[yogi]]. After his father left Sri Chand stayed in [[Dera Baba Nanak]] and maintained Guru Nanak's temple. He established the [[Udasi]] order who travelled far and wide to spread the Word of Nanak.\n* '''[[Mata Khivi]]''' ( \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a16\u0a40\u0a35\u0a40 ) (1506\u20131582) is the only woman mentioned in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib. She was the wife of Guru Angad, and established the langar system, a free kitchen where all people were served as equals. Only the best possible ingredients were used, and everyone was treated with utmost courtesy. Her hospitality has been emulated over the centuries and has become the first cultural identity of the Sikhs. She helped her husband to establish the infant Sikh community on a stronger footing, and is described as good natured, efficient, and beautiful.\n* '''[[Baba Buddha]]''' (6 October 1506 \u2013 8 September 1631) was one of the earliest disciples of Guru Nanak. He lived an exemplary life and was called on to perform the ceremony passing the guruship on to five gurus, up to Guru Hargobind.  Baba Buddha trained the sixth Guru in martial arts as a young man to prepare him for the challenges of the guruship.\n* '''[[Bhai Gurdas]]''' ( \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a26\u0a3e\u0a38 ) (1551\u20131637) is one of the most eminent literary personalities in the history of the [[Sikh]] [[religion]]. He was a scholar, poet and the [[scribe]] of the [[Adi Granth]]. He was an able [[missionary]] and an accomplished [[theologian]]. Being well versed in Indian religious thought, he was able to elaborate profoundly the tenets of [[Sikhism]].\n* '''[[Mata Gujri]]''' (1624\u20131705) joined the ninth Guru in his long meditation at [[Baba Bakala]] before he assumed the guruship.  She gave birth to and raised the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh.  Mata Gujri accompanied her youngest grandsons, Baba Fateh Singh and Baba Zorawar Singh to their martyrdom at [[Sirhind-Fategarh]], and subsequently passed as well.\n* '''[[Mai Bhago]]''' (\u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a17\u0a4b)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|title=Great Sikh Warriors|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320221721/http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> is one of the most famous women in Sikh history. She is always pictured on horseback wearing a turban with her headscarf gracefully flowing in the wind, courageously leading an army into battle. A staunch Sikh by birth and upbringing, she was distressed to hear in 1705 that some of the Sikhs of her village who had gone to Anandpur to fight for Guru Gobind Singh had deserted him under adverse conditions. She rallied the deserters, persuading them to meet the Guru and apologize to him. She led them back to Guru Gobind Singh Ji in the battlefield at Muktsar (Khidrana) Punjab. She thereafter stayed on with Guru Gobind Singh as one of his bodyguards, in male attire. After Guru Gobind Singh left his body at Nanded in 1708, she retired further south. She settled in Jinvara, where, immersed in meditation, she lived to an old age.\n* '''[[Bhai Mani Singh]]''' (1644-1738) was an 18th-century Sikh scholar and martyr. He was a childhood companion of Guru Gobind Singh[1] and took the vows of Sikhism when the Guru inaugurated the Khalsa in March 1699. Soon after that, the Guru sent him to Amritsar to take charge of the Harmandar, which had been without a custodian since 1696. He took control and steered the course of Sikh destiny at a critical stage in Sikh history. The nature of his death in which he was dismembered joint by joint has become a part of the daily Sikh Ardas (prayer).\n* '''[[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]''' (1780 \u20131839) was the leader of the Sikh Empire which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century. Ranjit Singh's reign introduced reforms, modernization, investment into infrastructure, and general prosperity. His government and army included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. Ranjit Singh's legacy includes a period of Sikh cultural and artistic renaissance, including the rebuilding of the Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar as well as other major gurudwaras, including Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Bihar and Hazur Sahib Nanded, Maharashtra under his sponsorship. He was popularly known as Sher-i-Punjab, or \"Lion of Punjab\".\n* '''[[Bhagat Puran Singh]]'''( \u0a2d\u0a17\u0a24 \u0a2a\u0a41\u0a30\u0a28 \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a18 )(1904\u20131992) was a great visionary, an accomplished environmentalist and a symbol of selfless service to humanity. He was the founder of the All India [[Pingalwara]] charitable society which imparts service to the poor, downtrodden, the dying, and the mentally and physically handicapped people.\n* '''[[Harbhajan Singh Khalsa]]''' (1929-2004) spread awareness of Sikhism in the West.  Through his influence, thousands of young people adopted the Sikh faith.  Harbhajan Singh's interfaith work included meetings with popes and archbishops in the 1970s and 80s, when Sikhism was little known outside of India.  A number of scholars have concurred that Harbhajan Singh Khalsa's introduction of Sikh teachings into the West helped identify Sikhism as a world religion while at the same time creating a compelling counter-narrative to that which identified Sikhs solely as race with a shared history in India.<ref>Verne A.

The term has its origin in the [[Sanskrit]] term ''{{IAST|[[\u015bi\u1e63ya]]}}'', meaning \"disciple, learner\" or ''{{IAST|\u015bik\u1e63a}}'', meaning \"instruction\".\n\n==Historical importance to [[Sikh]] religion==\n*'''[[Bhai Mardana]]''' (1459-1534) was Guru Nanak Dev's companion on all of his Udasis (travels) and he played kirtan.\n*'''[[Bebe Nanaki]]''' (1464-1518) is known as the first Sikh. She was the elder sister of Guru Nanak Dev, the founder and first Guru (teacher) of Sikhism. Bebe Nanaki was the first to realize her brother's spiritual eminence.\n* '''[[Sri Chand]]''' ( \u0a38\u0a4d\u0a30\u0a40 \u0a1a\u0a70\u0a26 )(1494\u20131629)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-heritage.co.uk/personalities/baba%20srichand/babasrichand.htm|title=Untitled Document|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016}}</ref> was the first son of [[Guru Nanak]], raised by his sister. Sri Chand was a renounciate [[yogi]]. After his father left Sri Chand stayed in [[Dera Baba Nanak]] and maintained Guru Nanak's temple. He established the [[Udasi]] order who travelled far and wide to spread the Word of Nanak.\n* '''[[Mata Khivi]]''' ( \u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a24\u0a3e \u0a16\u0a40\u0a35\u0a40 ) (1506\u20131582) is the only woman mentioned in the Siri Guru Granth Sahib. She was the wife of Guru Angad, and established the langar system, a free kitchen where all people were served as equals. Only the best possible ingredients were used, and everyone was treated with utmost courtesy. Her hospitality has been emulated over the centuries and has become the first cultural identity of the Sikhs. She helped her husband to establish the infant Sikh community on a stronger footing, and is described as good natured, efficient, and beautiful.\n* '''[[Baba Buddha]]''' (6 October 1506 \u2013 8 September 1631) was one of the earliest disciples of Guru Nanak. He lived an exemplary life and was called on to perform the ceremony passing the guruship on to five gurus, up to Guru Hargobind.  Baba Buddha trained the sixth Guru in martial arts as a young man to prepare him for the challenges of the guruship.\n* '''[[Bhai Gurdas]]''' ( \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a17\u0a41\u0a30\u0a26\u0a3e\u0a38 ) (1551\u20131637) is one of the most eminent literary personalities in the history of the [[Sikh]] [[religion]]. He was a scholar, poet and the [[scribe]] of the [[Adi Granth]]. He was an able [[missionary]] and an accomplished [[theologian]]. Being well versed in Indian religious thought, he was able to elaborate profoundly the tenets of [[Sikhism]].\n* '''[[Mata Gujri]]''' (1624\u20131705) joined the ninth Guru in his long meditation at [[Baba Bakala]] before he assumed the guruship.  She gave birth to and raised the tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh.  Mata Gujri accompanied her youngest grandsons, Baba Fateh Singh and Baba Zorawar Singh to their martyrdom at [[Sirhind-Fategarh]], and subsequently passed as well.\n* '''[[Mai Bhago]]''' (\u0a2e\u0a3e\u0a08 \u0a2d\u0a3e\u0a17\u0a4b)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|title=Great Sikh Warriors|publisher=|accessdate=2 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320221721/http://www.sikh-history.com/sikhhist/warriors/bhago.html|archive-date=20 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> is one of the most famous women in Sikh history. She is always pictured on horseback wearing a turban with her headscarf gracefully flowing in the wind, courageously leading an army into battle. A staunch Sikh by birth and upbringing, she was distressed to hear in 1705 that some of the Sikhs of her village who had gone to Anandpur to fight for Guru Gobind Singh had deserted him under adverse conditions. She rallied the deserters, persuading them to meet the Guru and apologize to him. She led them back to Guru Gobind Singh Ji in the battlefield at Muktsar (Khidrana) Punjab. She thereafter stayed on with Guru Gobind Singh as one of his bodyguards, in male attire. After Guru Gobind Singh left his body at Nanded in 1708, she retired further south. She settled in Jinvara, where, immersed in meditation, she lived to an old age.\n* '''[[Bhai Mani Singh]]''' (1644-1738) was an 18th-century Sikh scholar and martyr. He was a childhood companion of Guru Gobind Singh[1] and took the vows of Sikhism when the Guru inaugurated the Khalsa in March 1699. Soon after that, the Guru sent him to Amritsar to take charge of the Harmandar, which had been without a custodian since 1696. He took control and steered the course of Sikh destiny at a critical stage in Sikh history. The nature of his death in which he was dismembered joint by joint has become a part of the daily Sikh Ardas (prayer).\n* '''[[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]]''' (1780 \u20131839) was the leader of the Sikh Empire which ruled the northwest Indian subcontinent in the early half of the 19th century. Ranjit Singh's reign introduced reforms, modernization, investment into infrastructure, and general prosperity. His government and army included Sikhs, Hindus, Muslims and Europeans. Ranjit Singh's legacy includes a period of Sikh cultural and artistic renaissance, including the rebuilding of the Harimandir Sahib in Amritsar as well as other major gurudwaras, including Takht Sri Patna Sahib, Bihar and Hazur Sahib Nanded, Maharashtra under his sponsorship. He was popularly known as Sher-i-Punjab, or \"Lion of Punjab\".\n* '''[[Bhagat Puran Singh]]'''( \u0a2d\u0a17\u0a24 \u0a2a\u0a41\u0a30\u0a28 \u0a38\u0a3f\u0a70\u0a18 )(1904\u20131992) was a great visionary, an accomplished environmentalist and a symbol of selfless service to humanity. He was the founder of the All India [[Pingalwara]] charitable society which imparts service to the poor, downtrodden, the dying, and the mentally and physically handicapped people.\n* '''[[Harbhajan Singh Khalsa]]''' (1929-2004) spread awareness of Sikhism in the West.  Through his influence, thousands of young people adopted the Sikh faith.  Harbhajan Singh's interfaith work included meetings with popes and archbishops in the 1970s and 80s, when Sikhism was little known outside of India.  A number of scholars have concurred that Harbhajan Singh Khalsa's introduction of Sikh teachings into the West helped identify Sikhism as a world religion while at the same time creating a compelling counter-narrative to that which identified Sikhs solely as race with a shared history in India.<ref>Verne A.

However, her attitude has since softened, and she has developed a maternal demeanor towards the residents in the hospital.  She goes through a divorce in Season 5 and turns down a fellowship in [[pediatric surgery]] because she was going to be a single mother and would not be able to raise her child with long hours as a pediatric fellow. After having a short-lived relationship with a nurse, Eli, she dates anesthesiologist Ben Warren, whom she eventually marries. In Season 10, Bailey discovers that she has OCD and is forced to work with an occupational therapist to help her get control of her disorder. Eventually, Bailey decides to start taking a medication that will help control it. In Season 12, Bailey is named Chief of Surgery, making her the first female chief in the history of the hospital. In Season 14, she suffers a heart attack due to all the stress she is having in her life, notably the hospital hacking and Ben making a career change for the third time. In Season 15, Bailey takes a sabbatical from her position as Chief of Surgery and asks to take a break from their marriage from Ben, though they eventually reconcile. In Season 16, after experiencing menopausal symptoms, she learns that she is pregnant, but she later loses the baby to a miscarriage. After taking some time to grieve, she bonds with Joey, a teenage foster kid and patient at Grey Sloan, and asks him to come stay with her.\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"#6699CC\"|\n|-\n| [[Owen Hunt]] || [[Kevin McKidd]] || [[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|5]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|6]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|7]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|8]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 9)|9]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 10)|10]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 11)|11]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 12)|12]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 13)|13]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 14)|14]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 15)|15]] , [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|16]]||[[Grey's Anatomy (season 5)|5]] || Former Chief of [[Trauma surgery|Trauma Surgery]], Attending Trauma Surgeon, Former Chief of Surgery ||  M.D., FACS\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" |Entering the series as a tough veteran in Season 5, Owen Hunt immediately begins a relationship with [[Cristina Yang]].

After [[Richard Webber]] resigns, he is given the position of Chief of Surgery. He and Cristina experience marital problems after his affair with a woman at a bar is revealed; they also continue to disagree over the fact that Cristina does not want kids.

In Season 10, he starts a relationship with Emma Marling, an attending at Seattle Presbyterian, but they break up due to their different values in life. He starts to sleep with Cristina again until she moves to Zurich, ending their relationship for good. At the end of Season 11, Owen begins a relationship with [[Amelia Shepherd]], and they marry in the Season 12 finale. However, even at the start of their marriage, they begin to have problems, partially due to the fact that they got married so impulsively. They start living apart, and by Season 14, they decide to get a divorce when Amelia discovers she has a brain tumor that had been impeding on her judgement for the last 10 years, including her decision to marry Owen. After that, Owen has flings with Carina DeLuca and Teddy, both of which fail. In Season 15, he and Amelia get back together after they start fostering a baby boy named Leo, as well as Leo's teenage birth mother, Betty. They eventually break up again after Teddy reveals that she is pregnant with Owen's baby.

When Adele no longer recognizes him, Richard starts a relationship with Catherine Avery, whom he marries at the end of Season 11.

This puts a strain on his relationship with Catherine, and they eventually decide to separate, with Catherine shutting down PacNorth in spite. Richard is able to return to work at Grey Sloan but is noticeably solemn; he later reveals to a patient that he has a tremor in his hand that may end his medical career.\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\" bgcolor=\"#6699CC\"|\n|-\n|}\n\n== Department Chiefs ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; margin-right:auto; background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n!style=\"background-color:#6699CC; width:20%\"| Name\n!style=\"background-color:#6699CC; width:30%\"| Actor\n!style=\"background-color:#6699CC; width:10%\"| Starring seasons\n!style=\"background-color:#6699CC; width:10%\"| Recurring seasons\n!style=\"background-color:#6699CC; width:30%\"| Occupation at Grey Sloan<br><small>(or its predecessors)</small>\n!style=\"background-color:#6699CC; width:30%\"| Job Title\n|-\n| [[Teddy Altman|Theodora \"Teddy\" Altman]] || [[Kim Raver]] || [[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|6]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 7)|7]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 8)|8]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 15)|15]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 16)|16]]||[[Grey's Anatomy (season 6)|6]], [[Grey's Anatomy (season 14)|14]] || Former Chief of [[Cardiothoracic Surgery]], Attending Cardiothoracic Surgeon, Chief of [[Trauma surgery|Trauma Surgery]]||[[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]], [[Fellow of the American College of Surgeons|FACS]]\n|-\n|colspan=\"7\"| Teddy Altman takes over the job of Chief of Cardiothoracic Surgery at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital in Season 6.

When Amelia informs Herman that she believes she could remove the tumor, Herman initially rejects the idea until deciding it's what's best. Amelia operates and, despite some complications, successfully removes Herman's tumor. However, Herman doesn't wake up for several days after the surgery, leading Amelia to look for a cause. An MRI shows signs of a stroke, and when Herman finally wakes up, though she is fully aware of her surroundings and shows no loss of mental faculties, she becomes completely blind. After being discharged from the hospital, Herman goes to the Blind Institute, where she learns to live her daily life as a blind person. In Season 14, Herman returns to the hospital in fear that her tumor has returned, but it turns out just to be a build up of cerebrospinal fluid.
