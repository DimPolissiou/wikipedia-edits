Ct. at 1047.</ref> Since Tyson Foods had failed to keep records on employee time, representative evidence was necessary.<ref name=Tyson1047/> The key inquiry, according to the Supreme Court, was whether the employees would have similarly used the representative evidence in individual lawsuits if they had brought individual suits instead of a class action.<ref name=Tyson1047/>\n\nIt was on that point that the Court distinguished ''[[Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.

Ct. at 1048.</ref> The plaintiffs wanted to use representative evidence to show that there was a common policy of discretion in employment.<ref name=Tyson1048/> However, in that case, since the employees were not similarly situated, they would not have been able to use the representative evidence even if they had brought individual lawsuits.<ref name=Tyson1048/>\n\nIn ''Tyson Foods'', however, the representative evidence could be used to support a finding for individual plaintiffs.<ref name=Tyson1048/> The Court noted that Tyson Foods did not challenge the expert testimony or the study on which the plaintiffs relied.<ref>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S. Ct. at 1049.</ref> Also, Tyson Foods argued that because not all class members would be found to be injured and receive compensation, the employees haf to show a clear mechanism by which the district court could identify the class members who were not injured and so should not recover.<ref>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S. Ct. at 1049-50.</ref> That question was not presented in the lower courts, and the record was not developed on that point, however, so the Supreme Court remanded for further proceedings on that matter.<ref name=Tyson1050>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S.

Ct. at 1050 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part).</ref> Part I suggested that the Court was not relaxing rules for representative evidence in this case but had found that the study met the required standard of proof.<ref name=Roberts1051>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S. Ct. at 1051 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part).</ref> Part II expressed concern that there is no clear way to determine how much time the jury thought should be compensated for donning and doffing since it awarded a sum lower than the study suggested to ve appropriate.<ref name=Roberts1051/> To be compensated, each employee must have gone uncompensated for some of the donning and doffing time and must have worked overtime once that time was factored in.<ref>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S. Ct. at 1051-52 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part).</ref> However, since the jury did not report how much time they found should be compensated for the different departments, it is unclear how the district court would be able to award damages only to employees who were found by the jury found to be injured.<ref>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S. Ct. at 1052-53 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part).</ref>\n\n===Dissent===\n[[Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]] dissented, joined by Justice Alito.<ref>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S. Ct. at 1053 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</ref> The dissent believed the district court was wrong in finding that the class satisfied Rule 23's predominance requirement because it did not recognize that whether each employee worked overtime was a critical individual issue.<ref name=Thomas>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S. Ct. at 1054 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</ref> Because the district court did not appropriately analyze the class certification requirements, according to the dissent, Tyson Foods could be held liable to a large group without proof that each individual within the class was injured.<ref name=Thomas/> The dissent suggested that the majority also opinion improperly construed the predominance inquiry, relaxed the rule for representative evidence, and failed to adhere to prior precedent.<ref>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S.

Dukes]]'', 564 U.S. 338 (2011). In ''Wal-Mart'', the class had failed to meet the more basic commonality requirement of class actions.<ref name=Tyson1048>''Tyson Foods'', 136 S.

The only countries with more appearances are [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]] (63), [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]] (62) and the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] (62). Belgium have been absent only three times in total, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]], due to low scores in the previous contests that relegated them from the contest. Belgium has won the contest once, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]].\n\nIn the first 20 years of the contest, Belgium's best result was [[Tonia (singer)|Tonia]]'s fourth place in 1966. In 1978, [[Jean Vall\u00e9e]] achieved Belgium's first top three placement, when he was second. [[Sandra Kim]] became the first and to date only winner for Belgium in {{escyr|1986}}, when she won as a 13-year-old in [[Bergen]], performing the song \"[[J'aime la vie]]\". Belgium's only other top three result came in {{escyr|2003}}, when the group [[Urban Trad]] finished second in [[Riga]], losing out by only two points. Belgium has finished last in the contest five times, most recently in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], and has twice received \"nul points\" (no points); in {{escyr|1962}} and {{escyr|1965}}.\n\nAfter the introduction of the semi-final round in {{escyr|2004}}, Belgium failed to reach the final for five consecutive years (2005\u201309). Since 2010, Belgium has become more successful, qualifying for the final in five out of nine contests and placing in the top 10 four times, with [[Tom Dice]] sixth  ({{escyr|2010}}), [[Lo\u00efc Nottet]] fourth ({{escyr|2015}}), [[Laura Tesoro]] tenth ({{escyr|2016}}), and [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]] fourth ({{escyr|2017}}).\n\n\n==Broadcasting==\n\nBelgium has two national broadcasters of the contest, [[Flemish Community|Flemish]] broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]] (VRT) and [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking]] broadcaster [[RTBF|Radio t\u00e9l\u00e9vision belge de la communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF). The two broadcasters rotate selection for the Eurovision Song Contest each year (currently starting with 2002, VRT in the even-numbered years and RTBF in the odd-numbered years; until 1993 BRT/BRTN in the odd-numbered years and RTB/RTBF in the even-numbered years).\n\n==Contest history==\n[[Tonia (singer)|Tonia]]'s fourth-place at the {{escyr|1966}} contest remained Belgium's best result until [[Jean Vall\u00e9e]] finished second in {{escyr|1978}}.\n\nFollowing good results for [[Stella Maessen|Stella]] (fourth in {{escyr|1982}}) and [[Jacques Zegers]] (fifth in {{escyr|1984}}), Belgium finished last for the third time in {{escyr|1985}}. This was followed by Belgium's first (and only) Eurovision victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]], when [[Sandra Kim]] won with her song \"[[J'aime la vie]]\" in [[Bergen]], Norway. Although she claimed she was 15 years old, she was actually only 13, but was allowed to keep her victory. Currently the minimum age for participation is 16 and thus Sandra Kim will remain the youngest winner unless the age limit is lowered. By winning in 1986, Belgium became the last of the French-speaking countries to win the contest, as France, Luxembourg, Monaco and Switzerland all had won at least once before. Belgium scored an absolute record at the time, with Sandra Kim earning a never seen before number of 176 points (that record remained until 1993, with Ireland scoring 187 points), an average of 9.26 points per voting nation. Kim received 77.2% of the maximum possible score, which, as of 2017, still ranks eighth among all Eurovision winners.\n\nBelgium finished last for the fourth time at the {{escyr|1993}} contest, before achieving its only top ten result of the decade at the {{escyr|1998}} contest in [[Birmingham]], where [[M\u00e9lanie Cohl]] finished sixth.\n\n===2000s===\nBelgium finished last in the contest for the fifth and (as of 2018) final time at the {{escyr|2000}} contest in [[Stockholm]], before achieving its best result of the 21st century in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], where [[Urban Trad]] sang in an invented language and earned second place with 165 points, losing out to [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkey]]'s [[Sertab Erener]] by just two points. [[Ishtar (band)|Ishtar]] did the same in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], but finished 17th in the first semi-final, failing to qualify for the final. In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], Belgium participated in the first semi-final on 12 May 2009, however they received just one point which came from Armenia and left them in second-last position.\n\n===2010s===\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] entry for Belgium was [[Tom Dice]], runner-up of the [[X Factor (Belgium)|Belgian Flemish version]] of ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2008.

It was also the first time ever that an entry that finished fourth scored over 200 points.\n\nOn 26 May 2015 VRT confirmed that it would use Eurosong again as the national final for the 2016 competition. This time the show only had 5 participants. Eurosong 2016 would span over 3 shows, but only in the last show could people vote for the entry who would represent Belgium at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]]. On 17 January 2016 [[Laura Tesoro]] won Eurosong 2016 with her song [[What's the Pressure]], co-written by Belgian singer [[Selah Sue]]. Other contenders were Tom Frantzis, Adil Aarab, Amaryllis Uitterlinden and Astrid Destuyver.\n\nLaura Tesoro performed last at the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in third place on 274 points. In the final on 14 May 2016, she performed first and placed tenth on 181 points.\n\nThe Walloon broadcaster RTBF announced on 22 November 2016 that Ellie Delvaux would represent Belgium in the 2017 contest under her stage name [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]]. Blanche had also appeared on \"The Voice Belgique\", like her predecessors Roberto Bellarosa (2013), Axel Hirsoux (2014) and Lo\u00efc Nottet (2015). It will be the fifth consecutive year that the Belgian representative was a former \"The Voice\" contestant. Laura Tesoro (2016) previously appeared on the Flemish version \"The Voice van Vlaanderen\".\n\nOn 8 March 2017, the song \"City Lights\" was officially announced as the Belgian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. It was leaked the night before it's official release on 7 March 2017 through [[Spotify]]. Competing in the first half of the first semi-final on 9 May 2017, [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]] qualified for the final on 13 May and performed in the second half of the show, finishing in fourth place. Blanche's fourth-place finish gave Belgium its third top six result of the decade. The only other decade where Belgium achieved this, was the 1980s.\n\nDuring the Eurovision weekend of {{escyr|2017}}, [[Peter Van de Veire]] announced that VRT would internally select the participant for {{escyr|2018}}. On 28 September 2017, VRT announced [[Laura Groeseneken]] as the Belgian entrant during the talk show ''Van Gils & gasten'', aired on [[\u00c9\u00e9n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/150246/belgium-vrt-will-reveal-the-belgian-act-for-eurovision-2018-tonight/|title=Belgium: VRT will reveal the Belgian act for Eurovision 2018 tonight|publisher=Esctoday.com|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.een.be/een/laura-groeseneken-naar-het-eurovisiesongfestival|title=Laura Groeseneken naar het Eurovisiesongfestival!|publisher=VRT|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=28 September 2017|language=nl}}</ref> Although initially a favorite with bookmakers, \"[[A Matter of Time (Sennek song)|A Matter of Time]]\" was the first Belgian entry since 2014 to not qualify for the final. She finished 12th with 91 points in the first semi-final.\n\nIn January 2019, the RTBF announced that it had internally selected [[Eliot Vassamillet|Eliot]] as their representative for the {{escyr|2019}} contest. His song \"[[Wake Up (Eliot song)|Wake Up]]\" was released on the 28th of February 2019. The song was written and produced by Pierre Dumoulin, who also wrote and produced \"City Lights\" by Blanche. The song competed in the first semi-final on 16 May 2019, but failed to qualify for the grand final for the second year in a row. It was the first RTBF act not to qualify since 2011. The entry finished 13th in the first semi-final scoring 70 points.\n\n===2020s===\nDuring the {{escyr|2019}} contest, Flemish broadcaster VRT announced that it already was searching a representative for the {{escyr|2020}} contest and that it already had contacted several artists.

The broadcasters take turns to send the Belgian entry to Eurovision, with Flemish VRT being in charge on even years and French-speaking RTBF on odd years. Following the cancellation of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2020|2020 edition]], [[Hooverphonic]], the original act for the year was reinvited to represented the country in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2021|2021]], thus switching the order of the previous rotation between the broadcasters. \n\nThere has been a significant difference in the results achieved by the 2 broadcasters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}{{POV statement|date=March 2020}} French-speaking RTBF is to thank for Belgium's only Eurovision win (in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]]), all of Belgium's ten top 5 placings, and 18 out of Belgium's 25 top 10 placings. On the other hand, Flemish VRT has never won, never placed in the top 5, and has only placed in the top 10 seven times, while scoring 6 out of Belgium's 8 last place.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  In the 90s, the [[Eurovision Song Contest#Pre-selections and relegation|relegation rule]] was introduced (the lowest-placed countries in the score table were not invited the following year, to accommodate for the growing number of participating countries) and Belgium was relegated 3 times (in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]]): 2 times following a poor placing by a VRT-sent act the previous year, and once after RTBF act [[Nathalie Sorce]] placed last in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSince 2004 and the introduction of the semi-finals, the 2 broadcasters have scored similarly in terms of qualification: RTBF qualified 3 times out of 8 semi-finals, while VRT qualified 2 times out of 7 semi-finals and broke Belgium's 5 year non-qualification streak, with [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] contestant [[Tom Dice]] qualifying Belgium for the first time.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n!Broadcaster(s)\n!Entries\n!Winner\n!Runner up\n!Top 5\n!Top 10\n!Last Place\n!SF Entered\n!SF Qualification\n!SF Qualification Rate\n|-\n|Flanders (VRT)\n|30\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|6\n|7\n|2\n|28.6%\n|-\n|Wallonia (RTBF)\n|31\n|1\n|3\n|10\n|18\n|2\n|8\n|3\n|37.5%\n|-\n!Belgium\n!61\n!1\n!3\n!10\n!25\n!8\n!15\n!5\n!33.3%\n|}-->\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|style=\"background:#A4EAA9\"|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Song\n!width=50px data-sort-type=\"number\"|Final\n!width=50px data-sort-type=\"number\"|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"silver\"\n!rowspan=2|{{Escyr|1956}}\n|[[Fud Leclerc]] \n|[[French language|French]]\n|\"[[Messieurs les noy\u00e9s de la Seine]]\"\n|align=center|2{{Efn|name=\"esc 1956\"|The full results for the first contest in 1956 are unknown, only the winner was announced.

Both broadcast the event and over the years VRT and RTBF commentary has been provided by several experienced radio and television presenters, including [[Nand Baert]], [[Jacques Mercier]], [[Luc Appermont]] and [[Paule Herreman]]. However, from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991 Contest]], [[Andr\u00e9 Vermeulen]] has provided the Dutch language commentary every year, with the exception of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 Contest]]. Whilst [[Jean-Pierre Hautier]] has provided the French language commentary every year since the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 Contest]] until the 2013 contest. In 1962, then BRT used the commentary from [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] (The Netherlands broadcast), the reason for that was unknown.\n\nSince 1998 VRT has supplied a dual commentator to join [[Andr\u00e9 Vermeulen]], between 1999 and 2010 Dual commentary was provided by [[Bart Peeters]] and [[Anja Daems]]. Peeters provided the commentary during the years when VRT selected the entries whilst Daems commentated the years RTBF selected the entries. Since 2011 Sven Pichal has replaced Daems as commentator, whilst [[Peter Van de Veire]] has replaced Peeters. Since 2007 Jean-Louis Lahaye has joint [[Jean-Pierre Hautier]] as dual commentator for [[RTBF]]. After Hautier's death in 2012 Lahaye was joined by [[Maureen Louys]] in 2013.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Flemish

The only countries with more appearances are [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest|Germany]] (63), [[France in the Eurovision Song Contest|France]] (62) and the [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] (62). Belgium have been absent only three times in total, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]], due to low scores in the previous contests that relegated them from the contest. Belgium has won the contest once, in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]].\n\nIn the first 20 years of the contest, Belgium's best result was [[Tonia (singer)|Tonia]]'s fourth place in 1966. In 1978, [[Jean Vall\u00e9e]] achieved Belgium's first top three placement, when he was second. [[Sandra Kim]] became the first and to date only winner for Belgium in {{escyr|1986}}, when she won as a 13-year-old in [[Bergen]], performing the song \"[[J'aime la vie]]\". Belgium's only other top three result came in {{escyr|2003}}, when the group [[Urban Trad]] finished second in [[Riga]], losing out by only two points. Belgium has finished last in the contest five times, most recently in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2000|2000]], and has twice received \"nul points\" (no points); in {{escyr|1962}} and {{escyr|1965}}.\n\nAfter the introduction of the semi-final round in {{escyr|2004}}, Belgium failed to reach the final for five consecutive years (2005\u201309). Since 2010, Belgium has become more successful, qualifying for the final in five out of nine contests and placing in the top 10 four times, with [[Tom Dice]] sixth  ({{escyr|2010}}), [[Lo\u00efc Nottet]] fourth ({{escyr|2015}}), [[Laura Tesoro]] tenth ({{escyr|2016}}), and [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]] fourth ({{escyr|2017}}).\n\n\n==Broadcasting==\n\nBelgium has two national broadcasters of the contest, [[Flemish Community|Flemish]] broadcaster [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep]] (VRT) and [[French Community of Belgium|French-speaking]] broadcaster [[RTBF|Radio t\u00e9l\u00e9vision belge de la communaut\u00e9 fran\u00e7aise]] (RTBF). The two broadcasters rotate selection for the Eurovision Song Contest each year (currently starting with 2002, VRT in the even-numbered years and RTBF in the odd-numbered years; until 1993 BRT/BRTN in the odd-numbered years and RTB/RTBF in the even-numbered years).\n\n==Contest history==\n[[Tonia (singer)|Tonia]]'s fourth-place at the {{escyr|1966}} contest remained Belgium's best result until [[Jean Vall\u00e9e]] finished second in {{escyr|1978}}.\n\nFollowing good results for [[Stella Maessen|Stella]] (fourth in {{escyr|1982}}) and [[Jacques Zegers]] (fifth in {{escyr|1984}}), Belgium finished last for the third time in {{escyr|1985}}. This was followed by Belgium's first (and only) Eurovision victory in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]], when [[Sandra Kim]] won with her song \"[[J'aime la vie]]\" in [[Bergen]], Norway. Although she claimed she was 15 years old, she was actually only 13, but was allowed to keep her victory. Currently the minimum age for participation is 16 and thus Sandra Kim will remain the youngest winner unless the age limit is lowered. By winning in 1986, Belgium became the last of the French-speaking countries to win the contest, as France, Luxembourg, Monaco and Switzerland all had won at least once before. Belgium scored an absolute record at the time, with Sandra Kim earning a never seen before number of 176 points (that record remained until 1993, with Ireland scoring 187 points), an average of 9.26 points per voting nation. Kim received 77.2% of the maximum possible score, which, as of 2017, still ranks eighth among all Eurovision winners.\n\nBelgium finished last for the fourth time at the {{escyr|1993}} contest, before achieving its only top ten result of the decade at the {{escyr|1998}} contest in [[Birmingham]], where [[M\u00e9lanie Cohl]] finished sixth.\n\n===2000s===\nBelgium finished last in the contest for the fifth and (as of 2018) final time at the {{escyr|2000}} contest in [[Stockholm]], before achieving its best result of the 21st century in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]], where [[Urban Trad]] sang in an invented language and earned second place with 165 points, losing out to [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest|Turkey]]'s [[Sertab Erener]] by just two points. [[Ishtar (band)|Ishtar]] did the same in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008]], but finished 17th in the first semi-final, failing to qualify for the final. In the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2009]], Belgium participated in the first semi-final on 12 May 2009, however they received just one point which came from Armenia and left them in second-last position.\n\n===2010s===\nThe [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] entry for Belgium was [[Tom Dice]], runner-up of the [[X Factor (Belgium)|Belgian Flemish version]] of ''[[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2008. Dice was internally selected and announced by VRT on 25 November 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/14532 |title=Tom Dice to represent Belgium in Oslo |last=Hondal |first=Victor |date=2009-11-25 |publisher=ESCToday |accessdate=25 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091128092312/http://esctoday.com/news/read/14532 |archivedate=28 November 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.een.be/programmas/de-rode-loper/naar-het-eurovisiesongfestival |title=Tom Dice gaat naar het Eurovisiesongfestival |date=2009-11-25 |publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]] |language=Dutch |accessdate=25 November 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091129150655/http://www.een.be/programmas/de-rode-loper/naar-het-eurovisiesongfestival |archivedate=29 November 2009 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> Tom Dice finished 1st in the first semi-final, allowing Belgium to participate to the final for the first time since the introduction of the semi-finals.

For the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], they choose 17-year-old singer [[Iris (singer)|Iris]] but decided to let the public choose what song she would sing to represent [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012|Belgium]]. However, she didn't qualify after finishing 17th of 18 entrants in the first semi-final, scoring just 16 points which was the second lowest total of all the 36 semi-final entrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hbvl.be/nieuws/media-en-cultuur/aid863978/een-begraaft-eurosong-als-selectie-voor-het-songfestival.aspx|title=E\u00e9n begraaft Eurosong als selectie voor het Songfestival\n|last=Sietse|date=2009-09-09|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]]|language=Dutch|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927054355/http://www.hbvl.be/nieuws/media-en-cultuur/aid863978/een-begraaft-eurosong-als-selectie-voor-het-songfestival.aspx|archivedate=2011-09-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurosong.be/?p=28049|title=No Euroson in 2012 but internal|last=Sietse|date=2011-02-14|language=Dutch}}</ref><ref>http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=1573</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[Roberto Bellarosa]], winner of ''[[The Voice Belgique]]'', was chosen to represent Belgium for the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6, Sweden.

Axel Hirsoux won the national final, with more than 50 percent of the televotes and four times (out of 7 international juries) the maximum of 12 points from the international juries. The song which represented Belgium was called 'Mother' and is a slow ballad.<ref>{{cite news|title=Belgium: Axel Hirsoux wins Eurosong with 'Mother'|url=http://wiwibloggs.com/2014/03/16/belgium-axel-hirsoux-wins-eurosong-with-mother/43335/|accessdate=23 March 2014|newspaper=wiwibloggs.com|date=16 March 2014}}</ref> The song failed to qualify for the final, finishing 14th out of 16.\n\nIn 2015, RTBF chose another \"The Voice Belgique\" participant [[Lo\u00efc Nottet]], who came second in 2014. He represented Belgium with his song [[Rhythm Inside (Lo\u00efc Nottet song)|Rhythm Inside]] in the first semi-final of the competition. He managed to qualify and came second with 149 points. In the final Lo\u00efc finished fourth with 217 points. It was the best result for Belgium since 2003 and it was the highest number of points ever awarded to Belgium. It was also the first time ever that an entry that finished fourth scored over 200 points.\n\nOn 26 May 2015 VRT confirmed that it would use Eurosong again as the national final for the 2016 competition. This time the show only had 5 participants. Eurosong 2016 would span over 3 shows, but only in the last show could people vote for the entry who would represent Belgium at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]]. On 17 January 2016 [[Laura Tesoro]] won Eurosong 2016 with her song [[What's the Pressure]], co-written by Belgian singer [[Selah Sue]]. Other contenders were Tom Frantzis, Adil Aarab, Amaryllis Uitterlinden and Astrid Destuyver.\n\nLaura Tesoro performed last at the second semi-final on 12 May 2016, and qualified for the final by finishing in third place on 274 points. In the final on 14 May 2016, she performed first and placed tenth on 181 points.\n\nThe Walloon broadcaster RTBF announced on 22 November 2016 that Ellie Delvaux would represent Belgium in the 2017 contest under her stage name [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]]. Blanche had also appeared on \"The Voice Belgique\", like her predecessors Roberto Bellarosa (2013), Axel Hirsoux (2014) and Lo\u00efc Nottet (2015). It will be the fifth consecutive year that the Belgian representative was a former \"The Voice\" contestant. Laura Tesoro (2016) previously appeared on the Flemish version \"The Voice van Vlaanderen\".\n\nOn 8 March 2017, the song \"City Lights\" was officially announced as the Belgian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. It was leaked the night before it's official release on 7 March 2017 through [[Spotify]]. Competing in the first half of the first semi-final on 9 May 2017, [[Blanche (singer)|Blanche]] qualified for the final on 13 May and performed in the second half of the show, finishing in fourth place. Blanche's fourth-place finish gave Belgium its third top six result of the decade. The only other decade where Belgium achieved this, was the 1980s.\n\nDuring the Eurovision weekend of {{escyr|2017}}, [[Peter Van de Veire]] announced that VRT would internally select the participant for {{escyr|2018}}. On 28 September 2017, VRT announced [[Laura Groeseneken]] as the Belgian entrant during the talk show ''Van Gils & gasten'', aired on [[\u00c9\u00e9n]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/150246/belgium-vrt-will-reveal-the-belgian-act-for-eurovision-2018-tonight/|title=Belgium: VRT will reveal the Belgian act for Eurovision 2018 tonight|publisher=Esctoday.com|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=28 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.een.be/een/laura-groeseneken-naar-het-eurovisiesongfestival|title=Laura Groeseneken naar het Eurovisiesongfestival!|publisher=VRT|accessdate=28 September 2017|date=28 September 2017|language=nl}}</ref> Although initially a favorite with bookmakers, \"[[A Matter of Time (Sennek song)|A Matter of Time]]\" was the first Belgian entry since 2014 to not qualify for the final. She finished 12th with 91 points in the first semi-final.\n\nIn January 2019, the RTBF announced that it had internally selected [[Eliot Vassamillet|Eliot]] as their representative for the {{escyr|2019}} contest. His song \"[[Wake Up (Eliot song)|Wake Up]]\" was released on the 28th of February 2019. The song was written and produced by Pierre Dumoulin, who also wrote and produced \"City Lights\" by Blanche. The song competed in the first semi-final on 16 May 2019, but failed to qualify for the grand final for the second year in a row. It was the first RTBF act not to qualify since 2011. The entry finished 13th in the first semi-final scoring 70 points.\n\n===2020s===\nDuring the {{escyr|2019}} contest, Flemish broadcaster VRT announced that it already was searching a representative for the {{escyr|2020}} contest and that it already had contacted several artists.

The broadcasters take turns to send the Belgian entry to Eurovision, with Flemish VRT being in charge on even years and French-speaking RTBF on odd years. Following the cancellation of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2020|2020 edition]], [[Hooverphonic]], the original act for the year was reinvited to represented the country in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2021|2021]], thus switching the order of the previous rotation between the broadcasters. \n\nThere has been a significant difference in the results achieved by the 2 broadcasters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}{{POV statement|date=March 2020}} French-speaking RTBF is to thank for Belgium's only Eurovision win (in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986]]), all of Belgium's ten top 5 placings, and 18 out of Belgium's 25 top 10 placings. On the other hand, Flemish VRT has never won, never placed in the top 5, and has only placed in the top 10 seven times, while scoring 6 out of Belgium's 8 last place.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  In the 90s, the [[Eurovision Song Contest#Pre-selections and relegation|relegation rule]] was introduced (the lowest-placed countries in the score table were not invited the following year, to accommodate for the growing number of participating countries) and Belgium was relegated 3 times (in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994]], [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001|2001]]): 2 times following a poor placing by a VRT-sent act the previous year, and once after RTBF act [[Nathalie Sorce]] placed last in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nSince 2004 and the introduction of the semi-finals, the 2 broadcasters have scored similarly in terms of qualification: RTBF qualified 3 times out of 8 semi-finals, while VRT qualified 2 times out of 7 semi-finals and broke Belgium's 5 year non-qualification streak, with [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] contestant [[Tom Dice]] qualifying Belgium for the first time.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+\n!Broadcaster(s)\n!Entries\n!Winner\n!Runner up\n!Top 5\n!Top 10\n!Last Place\n!SF Entered\n!SF Qualification\n!SF Qualification Rate\n|-\n|Flanders (VRT)\n|30\n|0\n|0\n|0\n|7\n|6\n|7\n|2\n|28.6%\n|-\n|Wallonia (RTBF)\n|31\n|1\n|3\n|10\n|18\n|2\n|8\n|3\n|37.5%\n|-\n!Belgium\n!61\n!1\n!3\n!10\n!25\n!8\n!15\n!5\n!33.3%\n|}-->\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place\n|-\n|style=\"background:#A4EAA9\"|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Song\n!width=50px data-sort-type=\"number\"|Final\n!width=50px data-sort-type=\"number\"|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"silver\"\n!rowspan=2|{{Escyr|1956}}\n|[[Fud Leclerc]] \n|[[French language|French]]\n|\"[[Messieurs les noy\u00e9s de la Seine]]\"\n|align=center|2{{Efn|name=\"esc 1956\"|The full results for the first contest in 1956 are unknown, only the winner was announced.

Both broadcast the event and over the years VRT and RTBF commentary has been provided by several experienced radio and television presenters, including [[Nand Baert]], [[Jacques Mercier]], [[Luc Appermont]] and [[Paule Herreman]]. However, from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1991|1991 Contest]], [[Andr\u00e9 Vermeulen]] has provided the Dutch language commentary every year, with the exception of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996 Contest]]. Whilst [[Jean-Pierre Hautier]] has provided the French language commentary every year since the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|1994 Contest]] until the 2013 contest. In 1962, then BRT used the commentary from [[Nederlandse Omroep Stichting|NOS]] (The Netherlands broadcast), the reason for that was unknown.\n\nSince 1998 VRT has supplied a dual commentator to join [[Andr\u00e9 Vermeulen]], between 1999 and 2010 Dual commentary was provided by [[Bart Peeters]] and [[Anja Daems]]. Peeters provided the commentary during the years when VRT selected the entries whilst Daems commentated the years RTBF selected the entries. Since 2011 Sven Pichal has replaced Daems as commentator, whilst [[Peter Van de Veire]] has replaced Peeters. Since 2007 Jean-Louis Lahaye has joint [[Jean-Pierre Hautier]] as dual commentator for [[RTBF]]. After Hautier's death in 2012 Lahaye was joined by [[Maureen Louys]] in 2013.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Flemish

As an academic lawyer and a powerful orator, Sumner was the leader of the anti-slavery forces in the state and a leader of the [[Radical Republican]]s in the U.S. Senate during the [[American Civil War]]. During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], he fought to minimize the power of the ex-Confederates and guarantee equal rights to the [[freedmen]].

It was several years before he could return to the Senate; Massachusetts not only did not replace him, it re-elected him, leaving his empty desk in the Senate as a reminder of the incident. The episode contributed significantly to the polarization of the country, leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nDuring the war, he was a leader of the [[Radical Republican]] faction that criticized President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] for being too moderate on the South. Sumner specialized in foreign affairs and worked closely with Lincoln to keep the British and the French from intervening on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War. As the chief Radical leader in the Senate during Reconstruction, Sumner fought hard to provide equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen on the grounds that \"[[consent of the governed]]\" was a basic principle of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]], and to block ex-Confederates from power so they would not reverse the gains made from the Union's victory in the Civil War. Sumner, teaming with House leader [[Thaddeus Stevens]], battled [[Andrew Johnson]]'s reconstruction plans and sought to impose a Radical program on the South. Although Sumner forcefully advocated the annexation of Alaska in the Senate, he was against the annexation of the [[Dominican Republic]], then known by the name of its capital, [[Santo Domingo]]. After leading Senators to defeat President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo Treaty]] in 1870, Sumner broke with Grant and denounced him in such terms that reconciliation was impossible. In 1871, President Grant and his Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] retaliated; through Grant's supporters in the Senate, Sumner was deposed as head of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner had become convinced that Grant was a corrupt despot and that the success of Reconstruction policies called for new national leadership. Sumner bitterly opposed Grant's re-election by supporting the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] candidate [[Horace Greeley]] in 1872 and lost his power inside the Republican Party. Less than two years later, he died in office.\n\n==Early life, education, and law career==\n[[File:Charles Sumner birthplace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Birthplace, Irving Street, [[Beacon Hill, Boston]]]]\nSumner was born on Irving Street in [[Boston]] on January 6, 1811.

Channing believed that human beings had an infinite potential to improve themselves. Expanding on this argument, Sumner concluded that environment had \"an important, if not controlling influence\" in shaping individuals.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|104}} By creating a society where \"knowledge, virtue and religion\" took precedence, \"the most forlorn shall grow into forms of unimagined strength and beauty.\"<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|105}} Moral law, he believed, was as important for governments as it was for individuals, and legal institutions that inhibited one's ability to grow\u2014like slavery or segregation\u2014were evil. While Sumner often viewed contemporary society critically, his faith in reform was unshakable. When accused of utopianism, he replied: \"The Utopias of one age have been the realities of the next.\"<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|105}}\n\nThe increased income Charles P. Sumner enjoyed after becoming Sheriff enabled him to afford higher education for his children. Charles Sumner attended the [[Boston Latin School]], where he counted [[Robert Charles Winthrop]], [[James Freeman Clarke]], [[Samuel Francis Smith]], and [[Wendell Phillips]], among his closest friends.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/> He attended Harvard College, where he lived in [[List of Harvard dormitories|Hollis Hall]] and was a member of the [[Porcellian Club]]. After his 1830 graduation, he attended [[Harvard Law School]] where he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Joseph Story]]. \n\nAfter hraduating from law school in 1834, Sumner was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] and entered private practice in Boston in partnership with [[George Stillman Hillard]]. A visit to Washington decided him against a political career, and he returned to Boston resolved to practice law. He contributed to the quarterly ''American Jurist'' and edited Story's court decisions as well as some law texts. From 1836 to 1837, Sumner lectured at Harvard Law School.\n\n==Travels in Europe==\n\nSumner traveled to Europe in 1837. He landed at [[Le Havre]] and found the [[Cathedral of Rouen|cathedral]] at [[Rouen]] striking: \"the great lion of the north of France \u2026 transcending all that my imagination had pictured.\"<ref>David McCullough, ''The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris'' (2011) pp 21, 23-4</ref> He reached Paris in December, began to study French, and visited the [[Louvre]] \"with a throb,\" describing how his ignorance of art made him feel \"cabined cribbed, confined\" until repeat visits allowed works by Raphael and Leonardo to change his understanding: \"They touched my mind, untutored as it is, like a rich strain of music.\"<ref>McCullough, 30, 42, 47</ref> He mastered French in six months and attended lectures at the Sorbonne on subjects ranging from geology to Greek history to criminal law.<ref>McCullough, 59, 130</ref> In his journal for January 20, 1838, he noted that one lecturer \"had quite a large audience among whom I noticed two or three blacks, or rather mulattos--two-thirds black perhaps--dressed quite ''\u00e0 la mode'' and having the easy, jaunty air of young men of fashion\u2026.\" who were \"well received\" by the other students after the lecture.

Worcester: American Antiquarian Society.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he delivered an Independence Day oration on \"The True Grandeur of Nations\" in Boston. He spoke against the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and made an impassioned appeal for freedom and peace.\n\nHe became a sought-after orator for formal occasions. His lofty themes and stately eloquence made a profound impression. His platform presence was imposing. He stood six feet four inches tall, with a massive frame. His voice was clear and of great power. His gestures were unconventional and individual, but vigorous and impressive. His literary style was florid, with much detail, allusion, and quotation, often from the Bible as well as the Greeks and Romans. [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote that he delivered speeches \"like a cannoneer ramming down cartridges\", while Sumner himself said that \"you might as well look for a joke in the [[Book of Revelation]].\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Walther |first=Eric H. |date=2004 |title=The Shattering of the Union: America in the 1850s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9qNIZfUdzsC&pg=PA14 |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=SR Books |page=14 |isbn=978-0-8420-2799-1}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the annexation of Texas as a new slave-holding state in 1845, Sumner took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. That same year, Sumner represented the plaintiffs in ''[[Roberts v. Boston]]'', a case which challenged the legality of [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Arguing before the Massachusetts [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Court]], Sumner noted that schools for blacks were physically inferior and that segregation bred harmful psychological and sociological effects\u2014arguments that would be made in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' over a century later.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|180}} Sumner lost the case, but the Massachusetts legislature abolished school segregation in 1855.\n\nSumner worked with [[Horace Mann]] to improve the system of public education in Massachusetts. He advocated [[prison reform]]. In opposing the Mexican\u2013American War, he considered it a war of aggression but was primarily concerned that captured territories would expand slavery westward. In 1847, Sumner denounced a Boston Representative's vote for the declaration of war against Mexico with such vigor that he became a leader of the [[Conscience Whigs]] faction of the Massachusetts [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. He declined to accept their nomination for U.S Representative in 1848. Instead, Sumner helped organize the [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed both the Democrats and the Whigs, who had nominated [[Zachary Taylor]], a slave-owning Southerner, for President. Sumner became chairman of the Massachusetts Free Soil Party's executive committee, a position he used to continue advocating for abolition by attracting anti-slavery Whigs and Democrats into a coalition with the Free Soil movement.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\nIn 1851, Democrats gained control of the Massachusetts state legislature in coalition with the Free Soilers. The Free Soilers named Sumner their choice for U.S. Senator. The Democrats initially opposed him and called for a less radical candidate. The impasse was broken after three months and Sumner was elected by a one-vote majority on April 24, 1851. His election marked a sharp break in Massachusetts politics, as his abolitionist politics contrasted sharply those of his most well-known predecessor in the seat, [[Daniel Webster]], who had been one of the foremost supporters of the [[Compromise of 1850]] and its [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref>Two short-term appointees held Webster's seat from July 1850 to March 1851, when Sumner's full term began.

For the first few sessions, Sumner did not promote any of his controversial causes. On August 26, 1852, Sumner, delivered his first major speech, despite strenuous efforts to dissuade him. This oratorical effort incorporated a popular abolitionist motto: \"Freedom National; Slavery Sectional\" as its title. In it, Sumner attacked the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|1850 Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref>Charles Sumner, ''Freedom National; Slavery Sectional: Speech of Hon. Charles Sumner\u2026'' (Boston: Ticknor, Reed and Fields, 1852), [https://archive.org/details/freedomnational00sumngoog available online], accessed June 24, 2011</ref> After his speech, a Senator from [[Alabama]] urged that there be no reply: \"The ravings of a maniac may sometimes be dangerous, but the barking of a puppy never did any harm.\" Sumner's outspoken opposition to slavery made him few friends in the Senate.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|236}}\n\nThough the conventions of both major parties had just affirmed the finality of every provision of the [[Compromise of 1850]], including the Fugitive Slave Act, Sumner called for the Act's repeal. For more than three hours he denounced it as a violation of the Constitution, an affront to the public conscience, and an offense against divine law.\n\n===The \"Crime against Kansas\" speech and subsequent beating by Brooks===\n{{main| Caning of Charles Sumner}}\n[[File:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Lithograph of [[Preston Brooks]]' 1856 attack on Sumner; the artist depicts the faceless assailant bludgeoning the learned martyr]]\n{{wikisource|The Crime against Kansas}}\nIn 1856, during the \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" crisis, Sumner denounced the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], and he continued this attack in his \"Crime against Kansas\" speech on May 19 and May 20. The long speech argued for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state, and went on to denounce the \"[[Slave Power]]\"\u2014the political arm of the slave owners.

Douglas]] of Illinois and [[Andrew Butler]] of South Carolina. He said:\n\n<blockquote>The senator from South Carolina has read many books of chivalry, and believes himself a chivalrous knight with sentiments of honor and courage. Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight -- I mean the harlot, slavery.

Keitt]], also a pro-slavery Democrat. Keitt told him that dueling was for gentlemen of equal social standing, and that Sumner was no better than a drunkard, due to the supposedly coarse language he had used during his speech.

Thousands attended rallies in support of Sumner in Boston, Albany, Cleveland, Detroit, New Haven, New York, and Providence. More than a million copies of Sumner's speech were distributed. Two weeks after the caning, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] described the divide the incident represented: \"I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state. I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom.\"<ref>Puleo, 36-7</ref> Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The ''Richmond Enquirer'' editorialized that Sumner should be caned \"every morning,\" praising the attack as \"good in conception, better in execution, and best of all in consequences\" and denounced \"these vulgar abolitionists in the Senate\" who \"have been suffered to run too long without collars. They must be lashed into submission.\" Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault.

His doctors advised a sea voyage and \"a complete separation from the cares and responsibilities that must beset him at home.\" He sailed for Europe and immediately found relief.<ref>McCullough, 225-6</ref> During two months in Paris in the spring of 1857, he renewed friendships, especially with [[Thomas Gold Appleton]], dined out frequently, and attended the opera several nights in a row. His contacts there included [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], poet [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], former French Prime Minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].<ref>McCullough, 226-9</ref> Sumner then toured several countries, including Germany and Scotland, before returning to Washington where he spent only a few days in the Senate in December. Both then and during several later attempts to return to work, he found himself exhausted just listening to Senate business. He sailed once more for Europe on May 22, 1858, the second anniversary of Brooks' attack.<ref>McCullough, 229-30</ref>\n\nIn Paris, prominent physician [[Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard]] diagnosed Sumner's condition as spinal cord damage that he could treat by burning the skin along the spinal cord. Sumner chose to refuse anesthesia, which was thought to reduce the effectiveness of the procedure. Observers both at the time and since doubt Brown-S\u00e9quard's efforts were of value.<ref>McCullough, 230-1</ref> After spending weeks recovering from these treatments, Sumner resumed his touring, this time traveling as far east as Dresden and Prague and south to Italy twice. In France he visited Brittany and Normandy, as well as Montpellier. He wrote his brother: \"If anyone cares to know how I am doing, you can say better and better.\"<ref>McCullough, 233</ref>\n\n===Returned to Senate===\nSumner returned to the Senate in 1859. When fellow Republicans advised taking a less strident tone than he had years earlier, he answered: \"When crime and criminals are thrust before us, they are to be met by all the energies that God has given us by argument, scorn, sarcasm and denunciation.\" He delivered his first speech following his return on June 4, 1860, during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. In \"The Barbarism of Slavery\", he attacked attempts to depict slavery as a benevolent institution, said it had stifled economic development in the South and that it left slaveholders reliant on \"the bludgeon, the revolver, and the bowie-knife\". He addressed an anticipated objection on the part of one of his colleagues: \"Say, sir, in your madness, that you own the sun, the stars, the moon; but do not say that you own a man, endowed with a soul that shall live immortal, when sun and moon and stars have passed away.\" Even allies found his language too strong, one calling it \"harsh, vindictive, and slightly brutal\".<ref>Puleo, 113-9</ref> He spent the summer rallying the anti-slavery forces and opposing talk of compromise.<ref>Puleo, 119-20</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\n\n====Radicals====\nSenator Sumner was a member of a faction of the Republican Party known as the [[Radical Republicans|Radical]]s.<ref name=\"Oates\">[[#Oates|Oates]] (December 1980), ''The Slaves Freed'', American Heritage Magazine</ref> In March 1861, after the withdrawal of Southern Senators, Sumner became chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. The Radicals primarily advocated the immediate abolition of slavery and the destruction of the Southern planter class. Senate Radicals included Sumner, Sen. [[Zachariah Chandler]], and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]].<ref name=\"Oates\"/> During the American Civil War, after the fall of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], in April 1861, Sumner, Chandler and Wade repeatedly visited President [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[White House]], speaking on slavery and the rebellion.<ref name=\"Oates\"/> Although like-minded on slavery, the Radicals were loosely organized and disagreed with one another on other issues such as the tariff and currency issues.<ref>Stanley Coben, \"Northeastern Business and Radical Reconstruction: A Re-examination\", ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' Vol. 46, No. 1 (Jun., 1959), pp. 67-90 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1892388 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n====Slave emancipation====\n[[File:Sumner-Longfellow.jpg|thumb |180px |right |Senator Sumner and his friend [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], photograph by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Gardner]], 1863]]\n\nAlthough the Radical Senators desired the immediate emancipation of slaves, President Lincoln, in 1861, was initially resistant to freeing the slaves, since the Union slave states [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Missouri]] would be encouraged to join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].<ref name=\"Oates\"/> Sumner, however, knew that the pressure of the Civil War would eventually cause President Lincoln to free the slaves. As a compromise, the Radicals and President Lincoln passed two Confiscation Acts in 1861 and 1862 that allowed the Union military to free confiscated slaves who were carrying weapons, among other tasks, for the Confederate army. Sumner and other Radicals had persistently advocated that Lincoln emancipate the slaves.<ref name=\"Oates\"/> Lincoln, however, had adopted a moderated plan of gradual emancipation of slaves and compensation to the slave owners. Sumner believed that emancipating the slaves would keep Britain from entering the Civil War and the millions of slaves freed from bondage would give America higher moral standing. Lincoln described Sumner as \"my idea of a bishop\" and consulted him as an embodiment of the conscience of the American people.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|319}} On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln, out of military necessity, issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=\"Oates\"/>\n\n====Castigated Union Brig. Gen. Stone====\nOn December 9, 1861, the Senate Radicals established the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], whose purpose was to investigate battle defeats and determine the loyalty of generals fighting for the Union War effort.<ref name=\"Williams\">[[#Williams|Williams]] (December 1958), ''Investigation: 1862''</ref> The committee was formed at the instigation of Radical Sen. Chandler after the Union defeat at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]], under the command of Union Brig. General [[Charles Pomeroy Stone|Charles P. Stone]].<ref name=\"Williams\"/> At the Ball's Bluff battle on October 21, 1861, Union Senator and Colonel [[Edward D. Baker]], who was a close friend of President Lincoln's, was killed and Brig. Gen. Stone was blamed for the defeat by the Union press. Sen. Sumner, upset at having learned Brig. Gen. Stone had ordered two runaway slaves to be denied [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the Union Army, castigated Brig. Gen. Stone in a Senate speech.<ref name=\"Williams\"/> Brig. Gen. Stone wrote Sen. Sumner a terse letter and [[duel|demanded satisfaction]] from Sen. Sumner. On January 31, 1862, Brig. Gen. Stone defended himself in front of the Senate Committee under Radical chairman Sen. Wade.<ref name=\"Williams\"/> Indicted under suspicion of treason, without any trial, Brig. Gen. Stone was arrested on February 8, 1862, and federally imprisoned for 189 days.<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\n====Martial law, emancipation, speech controversy====\nOn the onset of the American Civil War in 1861, the Lincoln administration made a great effort to ensure the war would not be a revolution waged against slavery.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\">Haynes (1909), Charles Sumner, pp. 247-251</ref> Sumner had counseled Lincoln in May to make the end of slavery the primary objective, as Sumner believed Lincoln's policy to save the Union would be impossible without abolishing slavery.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/> In October 1861, at the Massachusetts state Republican Convention in Worcester, Sumner took an unprecedented step and spoke openly in a speech that the Civil War's sole cause was slavery and the primary objective of the Union government was to destroy slavery. Sumner stated that the Union government had the power to invoke [[martial law]] and emancipate the slaves.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/> The speech caused controversy among the conservative Boston press. Sumner's speech was denounced as [[wikt:incendiary|incendiary]] and Sumner was viewed as mentally ill and a \"candidate for the insane asylum.\"<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/> The Free Soil faction of the Republican Party fully endorsed Sumner's speech. Sumner continued to make public speeches that the goal of the Civil War was to end slavery by emancipation.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/>\n\n====''Trent'' Affair====\n{{main|Trent Affair}}\nOn November 8, 1861, the Union naval ship {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|6}}, under the command of Capt. [[Charles Wilkes]], intercepted the British steamer {{RMS|Trent}}, captured and put into U.S. port custody two Confederate diplomats [[James M. Mason]] and [[John Slidell]].<ref name=\"Haynes Trent Affair\">Haynes (1909), ''Charles Sumner'', pp. 251-258</ref> The northern people and press were in favor of the capture; however, there was concern that the British would use this as grounds to go to war with the United States. The British government dispatched 8,000 British troops on the Canada\u2013US border and efforts were made to strengthen the British fleet.<ref name=\"Haynes Trent Affair\"/> Sec. Seward believed that Mason and Slidell were contraband of war. Sumner, however, believed that the men did not qualify as war contraband, since they were unarmed, and that their release with an apology by the U.S. government was appropriate. In the Senate, Sumner suppressed open debate in order to save Lincoln's administration from embarrassment. On December 25, 1861, at Lincoln's invitation, Sumner read to Lincoln's Cabinet letters he received from prominent British political figures, including [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[John Bright|Bright]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], and [[George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|the Duke of Argyll]]. The letters provided critical information on political sentiment in Britain and supported the envoys' return to the British.<ref>David Donald, Jean Harvey Baker, and Michael F. Holt, ''The Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), 135-8</ref> \"One war at a time\" was Lincoln's response; he then quietly but reluctantly ordered the release of the Confederate captives to British custody and apologized for their capture. After the ''Trent'' Affair, Sen. Sumner's reputation improved among conservative Northerners.<ref name=\"Haynes Trent Affair\"/>\n\n====Haitian recognition====\nAs chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sumner renewed his efforts to win U.S. [[diplomatic recognition]] of [[Haiti]]. Haiti had sought recognition since winning independence in 1804, but faced opposition from Southern Senators. In their absence, the U.S. recognized Haiti in 1862.<ref>Alfred N. Hunt, ''Haiti's Influence on Antebellum America: Slumbering Volcano in the Caribbean'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1988), 187</ref>\n\n====Two civilizations argument====\nOsofsky argues that Sumner and like minded Yankees saw the war as a \"death struggle\" between \"two mutually contradictory civilizations.\" The solution for Sumner, \"the way to 'civilize' and 'Americanize' the South\" was to make it over into an idealized version of New England. It was to be conquered and then forcibly molded into a society defined in northern terms.<ref>Gilbert Osofsky, \"Cardboard Yankee: How Not to Study the Mind of Charles Sumner\", ''Reviews in American History'' Vol. 1, No. 4 (Dec., 1973), pp. 595-606 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2701730 in JSTOR] quotes are in Osofsky's words on pp 595, 596</ref>\n\n====Objection to Taney memorial====\nIn February 1865, there was considerable debate over authorizing the creation of a memorial to [[United States Chief Justice]] [[Roger Taney]]. Sumner was a longtime enemy of Taney and attacked his decision in the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case. Speaking on the Senate floor, in an argument with Sen. [[Lyman Trumbull]], Sen. Sumner, who objected to the memorial's creation, stated:<ref>[[Wikisource:Congressional Globe February 23, 1865]], ''Congressional Globe'', February 23, 1865.

As one of the Radical Republican leaders in the post-war Senate, Sumner fought to provide equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen on the grounds that \"consent of the governed\" was a basic principle of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]] and in order to keep ex-Confederates from gaining political offices and undoing the North's victory in the Civil War.\n\nThe [[Reconstruction Era]] of the United States after the American Civil War was in the nineteenth and early twentieth century usually viewed as an era of Southern exploitation and corruption by Northern politicians and harsh federal policies, led by the Radical Republicans.<ref name=\"Foner-Reconstruction\">[[#Foner|Foner]] (1983), ''The New View Of Reconstruction'', [[American Heritage Magazine]]</ref> The plight of the freedmen during Reconstruction was largely ignored by conservative historians who followed the [[Dunning School]]. According to historian Eric Foner, during the 1960s, revisionist historians have reinterpreted Reconstruction \"in the light of changed attitudes toward the place of blacks within American society.\"<ref name=\"Foner-Reconstruction\"/> Charles Sumner, a Radical Republican, has emerged as an idealist and a champion for African American civil rights through this turbulent and controversial period of United States History.<ref name=\"Foner-Reconstruction\"/> Sumner joined his fellow Republicans in overriding President Johnson's vetoes and imposed some of their views, though Sumner's most radical ideas were not implemented. Senator Sumner, however, in late 1866 favored impartial [[suffrage]] for African Americans, desiring to put in a [[literacy]] requirement on all southerners in order to vote.<ref name=Goldstone_p18>Goldstone, p. 18</ref> Had Sumner's literacy clause been enacted, only a small portion of blacks would have been able to vote, which would have been far more than Congress or the white southern governments were prepared to enact at that time. When Congress did open the vote to all loyal adult males in the South the following year, Sumner was strongly supportive.<ref name=Goldstone_p18/>\n\nSumner's radical theory of Reconstruction proposed that nothing beyond the confines of the Constitution restricted the Congress in determining how to treat the eleven defeated states, but that even that document had to be read in light of the Declaration of Independence, which he saw as an essential part of fundamental law. Not going as far as Thaddeus Stevens in seeing the seceded states as \"conquered provinces,\" he nonetheless argued that by declaring [[secession]], they had committed ''[[felo de se]]'' (''state suicide'') and could now be turned into territories that should be prepared for statehood, under conditions set by the national government. He objected to Lincoln's and later [[Andrew Johnson]]'s more lenient Reconstruction policies as ungenerous to the former slaves, inadequate in their guarantees of equal rights, and an encroachment upon the powers of Congress.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} When Andrew Johnson was impeached, Sumner voted for conviction. He was only sorry that he had to vote on each article of impeachment, for as he said, he would have rather voted, \"Guilty of all, and infinitely more.\"<ref>Donald, ''Rights of Man'', 337</ref>\n\nSumner was a friend of [[Samuel Gridley Howe]] and a guiding force for the [[American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission]], started in 1863. He was one of the most prominent advocates for suffrage for blacks, along with free homesteads and free public schools. His uncompromising attitude did not endear him to moderates and his arrogance and inflexibility often inhibited his effectiveness as a legislator. He was largely excluded from work on the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], in part because he did not get along with Illinois Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]], who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and did much of the work on it. Sumner introduced an alternative amendment that combined the Thirteenth Amendment with elements of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It would have abolished slavery and declared that \"all people are equal before the law.\" During Reconstruction, he often attacked civil rights legislation as inadequate and fought for legislation to give land to freed slaves and to mandate education for all, regardless of race, in the South. He viewed segregation and slavery as two sides of the same coin.<ref>Donald, 2: 532</ref> He introduced a civil rights bill in 1872 to mandate equal accommodation in all public places and required suits brought under the bill to be argued in the federal courts.<ref>Donald, ''Rights of Man'', 532</ref> The bill failed, but Sumner revived it in the next Congress, and on his deathbed begged visitors to see that it did not fail.<ref>Donald, 587</ref>\n\nSumner repeatedly tried to remove the word \"white\" from naturalization laws. He introduced bills to that effect in 1868 and 1869, but neither came to a vote. On July 2, 1870, Sumner moved to amend a pending bill in a way that would strike the word \"white\" wherever in all Congressional acts pertaining to [[naturalization]] of immigrants. On July 4, 1870, he said: \"Senators undertake to disturb us&nbsp;\u2026 by reminding us of the possibility of large numbers swarming from China; but the answer to all this is very obvious and very simple. If the Chinese come here, they will come for citizenship or merely for labor. If they come for citizenship, then in this desire do they give a pledge of loyalty to our institutions; and where is the peril in such vows? They are peaceful and industrious; how can their citizenship be the occasion of solicitude?\" He accused legislators promoting anti-Chinese legislation of betraying the principles of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]: \"Worse than any heathen or pagan abroad are those in our midst who are false to our institutions.\" Sumner's bill failed, and from 1870 to 1943, and in some cases as late as 1952, Chinese and other Asians were ineligible for naturalized U.S. citizenship.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HGM9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA5172&lpg=PA5172&dq=%22Worse+than+any+heathen+or+pagan+abroad+are+those+in+our+midst+who+are+false+to+our+institutions.%22#v=onepage&q=%22Worse%20than%20any%20heathen%20or%20pagan%20abroad%20are%20those%20in%20our%20midst%20who%20are%20false%20to%20our%20institutions.%22&f=false|first=Roger|last=Daniels|title=Guarding the Golden Door: American Immigration Policy and Immigrants since 1882|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang|date=2004|pages=13\u201316|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref>\nSumner remained a champion of civil rights for blacks.

In a 3-hour speech, Sumner spoke in favor of the treaty on the Senate floor, describing in detail Alaska's imperial history, natural resources, population, and climate. Sumner wanted to block British expansion from Canada, arguing that Alaska was geographically and financially strategic, especially for the Pacific Coast States. He said Alaska would increase America's borders, spread republican institutions, and represent an act of friendship with Russia.

The U.S. had claims against Britain for the damage inflicted by Confederate raiding ships fitted out in British ports. Sumner held that since Britain had accorded the rights of [[belligerent]]s to the Confederacy, it was responsible for extending the duration of the war and consequent losses. In 1869, he asserted that Britain should pay damages for not merely the raiders, but also \"that other damage, immense and infinite, caused by the prolongation of the war.\" He demanded $2,000,000,000 for these \"national claims\" in addition to $125,000,000 for damages from the raiders. Sumner did not expect that Britain ever would or could pay this immense sum, but he suggested that Britain turn over Canada as payment.<ref name=\"Corning 1918 59-84\">{{cite book |last=Corning|first=Amos Elwood|title=Hamilton Fish|url=https://archive.org/details/hamiltonfish00corngoog|pages=59\u201384|year=1918|publisher=Lamere Pub.

At the [[Alabama Claims|Geneva arbitration conference]] which settled U.S. claims against Britain, the panel of arbitrators refused to consider those \"constructive\" or \"national claims.\"\n\nSumner had some influence over [[J. Lothrop Motley]], the U.S. [[ambassador]] to Britain, causing him to disregard the instructions of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hamilton Fish]] on the matter, though not as far as some historians have indicated. This offended President Grant, but while it would be given as the official reason for Motley's removal, was not really so pressing: the dismissal took place a year after Motley's alleged misbehavior, and the real reason was an act of spite by the president against Sumner.<ref name=\"Corning 1918 59-84\"/>\n\n===Dominican Republic annexation treaty===\n{{main |Annexation of Santo Domingo}}\nIn 1869, President Grant, in an expansionist plan, looked into the annexation of a Caribbean island country, the [[Dominican Republic]], then known as Santo Domingo. Grant believed that the mineral resources on the island would be valuable to the United States, and that African Americans repressed in the South would have a safe haven to which to migrate. A labor shortage in the South would force Southerners to be tolerant towards African Americans.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 337</ref><ref>McFeely (1981), p. 332, 333</ref> In July and November 1869, under authority of President Grant and permission by the State Department on the second trip, [[Orville Babcock]], private secretary to President Grant, secretly negotiated a treaty with President [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]], President of the Dominican Republic. The initial treaty by Babcock had not been authorized by the State Department. The island nation, however, was on the verge of a civil war between President B\u00e1ez and ex-President Marcos A. Cabral.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 338, 339.</ref> President Grant sent in the U.S. Navy to keep the Dominican Republic free from invasion and civil war while the treaty negotiations took place.

Sumner's Washington home and mistakenly believed that Sumner had given consent for the treaty. Sen. Sumner stated that he had only promised to give the treaty friendly consideration. This meeting would later lead to bitter contention between Sumner and Grant.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', pp. 382-384</ref> The treaty was formally submitted to the [[United States Senate]] on January 10, 1870.<ref>Smith (2001), p. 504</ref>\n\n[[File:President Ulysses S.

As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', p. 384</ref> Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State, [[Bancroft Davis]], that U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect B\u00e1ez. Sumner's committee voted against annexation and at Sumner's suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment, the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session. Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14, 1870, and May 31, 1870.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', pp.384-385</ref> In closed session, Sumner spoke out against the treaty; warning that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island, and the risk that the independence of Haiti, recognized by the United States in 1862, would be lost. Sumner stated that Grant's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional.<ref>Sumner (March 21, 1871), ''Violations of International Law and Usurpations of War Powers'', p. 3</ref> Finally, on June 30, 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', pp. 385-386</ref>\n\nThe following day, Grant, feeling betrayed by Sumner, retaliated by ordering the dismissal of Sumner's close friend [[John Lothrop Motley]], Ambassador to Britain.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', p. 386</ref> By autumn, Sumner's personal hostility to the president was public knowledge, and he blamed the Secretary of State for failing to have resigned, rather than let Grant have his way. The two men, friends until then, cooled into bitter enemies. In December 1870, still fearful that Grant meant to acquire Santo Domingo somehow, Sumner gave a fiercely critical speech accusing the president of usurpation and Babcock of unethical conduct. Already Grant, supported by Fish, had initiated a campaign to depose Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although Sumner stated he was an \"Administration man,\" in addition to having stopped Grant's Dominican Republic treaty attempt, Sumner had defeated Grant's full repeal of the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], blocked Grant's nomination of [[Alexander Turney Stewart|Alexander Stewart]] as U.S. Secretary of Treasury, and been a constant harassing force pushing Reconstruction policies faster than Grant had been willing to go. Grant resented Sumner's superiority of manner, as well. Told once that Sumner did not believe in the Bible, the president is supposed to have said that he was not surprised: \"He didn't write it.\"<ref>Smith (2001), ''Grant'', pp. 503-504</ref> As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased, Sumner's health began to decline. When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, Senators affiliated with President Grant, known as \"New Radicals\" voted to oust Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', p. 392, 394</ref><ref>Donald (1970), ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'', pp. 446, 447</ref>\n\n===Liberal Republican revolt===\nSumner now turned against Grant. Like many other reformers, he decried the corruption in Grant's administration. Sumner believed that the civil rights program he championed could not be carried through by a corrupt government. In 1872, he joined the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] which had been started by reformist Republicans such as [[Horace Greeley]]. The Liberal Republicans supported black suffrage, the three Reconstruction amendments, and the basic civil rights already protected by law, but they also called for amnesty for ex-Confederates and decried the Republican governments in the South elected with the help of black votes, belittled the terrorism of the Ku-Klux Klan, and argued that the time had come to restore \"home rule\" in the South, which in practical terms meant white Democratic rule. For Sumner's civil rights bill they gave no support at all, but Sumner joined them because he convinced himself that the time had come for reconciliation, and that Democrats were sincere in declaring that they would abide by the Reconstruction settlement.<ref>Andrew L. Slap, ''The doom of Reconstruction: the liberal Republicans in the Civil War era'' p xiii, 225</ref>\n[[File:Senator Sumner.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Sumner in later years]]\n\n===Conciliation to South===\nSumner never saw his support for civil rights as hostile to the South. On the contrary, he had always contended that a guarantee for equality was the one condition essential for true reconciliation. Unlike some other Radical Republicans, he had strongly opposed any hanging or imprisonment of Confederate leaders. In December 1872, he introduced a Senate resolution providing that Civil War battle names should not appear as \"battle honors\" on the regimental flags of the U.S. Army. The proposal was not new: Sumner had offered a similar resolution on May 8, 1862, and in 1865 he had proposed that no painting hanging in the Capitol portray scenes from the Civil War, because, as he saw it, keeping alive the memories of a war between a people was barbarous. His proposal did not affect the vast majority of battle-flags, as nearly all the regiments that fought had been state regiments, and these were not covered. But Sumner's idea was that any United States regiment, that would in the future enlist southerners as well as northerners, should not carry on its ensigns any insult to those who joined it. His resolution had no chance of passing, but its presentation offended Union army veterans. The Massachusetts legislature censured Sumner for giving \"an insult to the loyal soldiery of the nation\" and as \"meeting the unqualified condemnation of the people of the Commonwealth.\" Poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] led an effort to rescind that censure the following year. He succeeded early in 1874 with the help of abolitionist [[Joshua Bowen Smith]], who happened to be serving in the legislature that year.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Boston Post |date=July 7, 1879 |title=Obituary.

At his March 16 burial in [[Mount Auburn Cemetery]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], the pallbearers included [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[John Greenleaf Whittier]].<ref>Puleo, 186-9</ref>\n\n==Historical interpretations==\nContemporaries and historians have explored Sumner's personality at length. Sumner's friend Senator [[Carl Schurz]] praised Sumner's integrity, his \"moral courage,\" the \"sincerity of his convictions,\" and the \"disinterestedness of his motives.\" However, Sumner's Pulitzer-prize-winning biographer, [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]], presents Sumner in his first volume, ''Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War'' (1960), as an insufferably arrogant moralist; an egoist bloated with pride; pontifical and Olympian, and unable to distinguish between large issues and small ones. What's more, concludes Donald, Sumner was a coward who avoided confrontations with his many enemies, whom he routinely insulted in prepared speeches.<ref>Osofsky, ''Cardboard Yankee'', p. 597-8</ref> But none of his friends at the time doubted his courage, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, who knew Sumner well, remembered that southerners in the 1850s in Washington wondered, every time Sumner left his house in the morning, whether he would return to it alive.<ref>Wendell Phillips letter, 'Boston Daily Advertiser,' March 11, 1873.</ref> Just before he died, Sumner turned to his friend Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar. \"Judge,\" he said, \"tell Emerson how much I love and revere him.\" \"He said of you once,\" Hoar replied, \"that he never knew so white a soul.\" <ref>David Donald, \"Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man,\" 587</ref>\n\nBiographers have varied in their appraisal of Sumner. The Pulitzer Prize went to biographer [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]] whose two-volume biography points up Sumner's troubles in dealing with his colleagues:<ref>Goodman's paraphrase of Donald in Goodman (1964) p 374</ref>\n\n{{quote|Distrusted by friends and allies, and reciprocating their distrust, a man of \"ostentatious culture\", \"unvarnished egotism\", and \"'a specimen of prolonged and morbid juvenility,'\" Sumner combined a passionate conviction in his own moral purity with a command of 19th-century \"rhetorical flourishes\" and a \"remarkable talent for rationalization\". Stumbling \"into politics largely by accident\", elevated to the United States Senate largely by chance, willing to indulge in \"Jacksonian demagoguery\" for the sake of political expediency, Sumner became a bitter and potent agitator of sectional conflict. Carving out a reputation as the South's most hated foe and the Negro's bravest friend, he inflamed sectional differences, advanced his personal fortunes, and helped bring about national tragedy.}}\n[[File:Sumner-death.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Death of Sumner]]\n\n[[Moorfield Storey]], Sumner's private secretary for two years and subsequent biographer, seeing some of the same qualities, interprets them more charitably:\n\n{{quote|Charles Sumner was a great man in his absolute fidelity to principle, his clear perception of what his country needed, his unflinching courage, his perfect sincerity, his persistent devotion to duty, his indifference to selfish considerations, his high scorn of anything petty or mean. He was essentially simple to the end, brave, kind, and pure\u2026. Originally modest and not self-confident, the result of his long contest was to make him egotistical and dogmatic. There are few successful men who escape these penalties of success, the common accompaniment of increasing years\u2026.Sumner's naively simple nature, his confidence in his fellows, and his lack of humor combined to prevent his concealing what many feel but are better able to hide. From the time he entered public life till he died he was a strong force constantly working for righteousness\u2026.To Sumner more than to any single man, except possibly Lincoln, the colored race owes its emancipation and such measure of equal rights as it now enjoys.<ref>Storey (1900), pp. 427-8</ref>}}\n\nSumner's reputation among historians in the first half of the 20th century was largely negative\u2014he was blamed especially for the excesses of Radical Reconstruction, which, in the prevailing scholarship, included letting blacks vote and hold office.<ref>Ruchames (1953)</ref> Both the [[Dunning School]] and the anti-Dunning revisionists were especially negative regarding his performance during Reconstruction.<ref>W. A. Dunning, ''Reconstruction, Political and Economic'' (1907); Howard K. Beale, ''The Critical Year'' (1930) was revisionist.</ref>\n\nHowever, in recent years scholars have emphasized his role as a foremost champion of black rights before, during and after the Civil War; one historian says he was \"perhaps the least racist man in America in his day.\"<ref>Kagan, Robert ''Dangerous Nation'', Page 278</ref>\n[[File:Charles Sumner House Boston.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Sumner House]], Boston]]\nAnne-Marie Taylor's biography of Sumner up to 1851 provided a much more sympathetic assessment of a young man, widely respected, conscientious, cultured, courageous, and driven into political prominence by his own sense of duty. Sumner's previously critical biographer David Herbert Donald, in the second volume of his biography, ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'' (1970), was much more favorable to Sumner, and though critical, recognized his large contribution to the positive accomplishments of Reconstruction. It has been noted that events in the Civil Rights Movement between 1960, when Donald's first volume was published, and 1970, when the second volume was published, likely swayed Donald somewhat further towards Sumner.<ref>Obituary of David Herbert Donald, available at https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/books/19donald.html?_r=0</ref>\n\n[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote of Sumner:\n\n{{quote|Mr. Sumner's position is exceptional in its honor\u2026. In Congress, he did not rush into party position. He sat long silent and studious. His friends, I remember, were told that they would find Sumner a man of the world like the rest; \"it is quite impossible to be at Washington and not bend; he will bend as the rest have done.\" Well, he did not bend. He took his position and kept it\u2026. I think I may borrow the language which Bishop Burnet applied to Sir Isaac Newton, and say that Charles Sumner \"has the whitest soul I ever knew.\"\u2026 Let him hear that every man of worth in New England loves his virtues.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-Lw5AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA245 Ralph Waldo Emerson, \"The Assault on Mr. Sumner\"].

In 1866, Sumner began courting Alice Mason Hooper, the widowed daughter-in-law of Massachusetts Representative [[Samuel Hooper]], and the two were married that October. Their marriage was unhappy. Sumner could not respond to his wife's humor, and Alice had a ferocious temper. That winter, Alice began going out to public events with Prussian diplomat [[Friedrich von Holstein]]. This caused gossip in Washington, but Alice refused to stop seeing Holstein. When Holstein was recalled to Prussia in the spring of 1867, Alice accused Sumner of engineering the action, which Sumner always denied. They separated the following September.<ref>Donald, 2:293</ref> Sumner's enemies used the affair to attack Sumner's manhood, calling Sumner \"The Great Impotency.\" The situation depressed and embarrassed Sumner.<ref>Donald, 2:571</ref> He obtained an uncontested divorce on the grounds of desertion on May 10, 1873.<ref>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1873/05/11/archives/hon-charles-sumner-obtains-a-decree-of-divorce.html Hon.

He was also shaped by Moral Philosophy, the dominant strain of American Enlightenment thinking, which included cosmopolitan ideals and a stress on the dignity of intellect and conscience. He was also keen on the idea of Natural Law. These influences came from readings and his close ties to [[John Quincy Adams]], [[William Ellery Channing]], and [[Joseph Story]]. Taylor says Sumner sought an American culture combining American liberty with European culture. He became a reformer regarding education, the arts, prison discipline, world peace, and anti-slavery.

As an academic lawyer and a powerful orator, Sumner was the leader of the anti-slavery forces in the state and a leader of the [[Radical Republican]]s in the U.S. Senate during the [[American Civil War]]. During [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]], he fought to minimize the power of the ex-Confederates and guarantee equal rights to the [[freedmen]]. He fell into a dispute with fellow Republican President [[Ulysses Grant|Grant]] over the control of [[Santo Domingo]] leading to the stripping of his power in the Senate and his subsequent effort to defeat Grant's re-election.\n\nSumner changed his political party several times as anti-slavery coalitions rose and fell in the 1830s and 1840s before coalescing in the 1850s as the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], the affiliation with which he became best known. He devoted his enormous energies to the destruction of what Republicans called the [[Slave Power]], the influence over the federal government of Southern slave owners who sought the continuation and expansion of slavery.<ref>{{cite book |last= Taylor |first= Anne-Marie |date= 2001 |title=Young Charles Sumner and the Legacy of the American Enlightenment, 1811-1851 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=an2KtqVlwlsC&pg=PA266&dq=%22charles+sumner%22+%22slave+power%22#v=onepage&q=%22charles%20sumner%22%20%22slave%20power%22&f=false |publisher= University of Massachusetts Press |page= 266|isbn= 9781558493001 }}</ref>  In 1856, South Carolina Democratic congressman [[Preston Brooks]] nearly killed Sumner with a cane on the Senate floor after Sumner delivered an anti-slavery speech, \"The Crime Against Kansas.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Sumner |first= Charles |title= The Crime Against Kansas |url= https://books.google.com/?id=_p7sjpWl1kgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=%22charles+sumner%22+%22crime+against+kansas%22#v=onepage&q=%22charles%20sumner%22%20%22crime%20against%20kansas%22&f=false |publisher= John P.

It was several years before he could return to the Senate; Massachusetts not only did not replace him, it re-elected him, leaving his empty desk in the Senate as a reminder of the incident. The episode contributed significantly to the polarization of the country, leading up to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\nDuring the war, he was a leader of the [[Radical Republican]] faction that criticized President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]] for being too moderate on the South. Sumner specialized in foreign affairs and worked closely with Lincoln to keep the British and the French from intervening on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil War. As the chief Radical leader in the Senate during Reconstruction, Sumner fought hard to provide equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen on the grounds that \"[[consent of the governed]]\" was a basic principle of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]], and to block ex-Confederates from power so they would not reverse the gains made from the Union's victory in the Civil War. Sumner, teaming with House leader [[Thaddeus Stevens]], battled [[Andrew Johnson]]'s reconstruction plans and sought to impose a Radical program on the South. Although Sumner forcefully advocated the annexation of Alaska in the Senate, he was against the annexation of the [[Dominican Republic]], then known by the name of its capital, [[Santo Domingo]]. After leading Senators to defeat President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo Treaty]] in 1870, Sumner broke with Grant and denounced him in such terms that reconciliation was impossible. In 1871, President Grant and his Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] retaliated; through Grant's supporters in the Senate, Sumner was deposed as head of the Foreign Relations Committee. Sumner had become convinced that Grant was a corrupt despot and that the success of Reconstruction policies called for new national leadership. Sumner bitterly opposed Grant's re-election by supporting the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican]] candidate [[Horace Greeley]] in 1872 and lost his power inside the Republican Party. Less than two years later, he died in office.\n\n==Early life, education, and law career==\n[[File:Charles Sumner birthplace.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Birthplace, Irving Street, [[Beacon Hill, Boston]]]]\nSumner was born on Irving Street in [[Boston]] on January 6, 1811. He was the son of Charles Pinckney Sumner, a liberal [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated lawyer, [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], an early proponent of racially integrated schools, who shocked 19th-century Boston by opposing anti-[[miscegenation]] laws.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">\"Charles Sumner.\" Dictionary of American Biography Base Set.

Channing believed that human beings had an infinite potential to improve themselves. Expanding on this argument, Sumner concluded that environment had \"an important, if not controlling influence\" in shaping individuals.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|104}} By creating a society where \"knowledge, virtue and religion\" took precedence, \"the most forlorn shall grow into forms of unimagined strength and beauty.\"<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|105}} Moral law, he believed, was as important for governments as it was for individuals, and legal institutions that inhibited one's ability to grow\u2014like slavery or segregation\u2014were evil. While Sumner often viewed contemporary society critically, his faith in reform was unshakable. When accused of utopianism, he replied: \"The Utopias of one age have been the realities of the next.\"<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|105}}\n\nThe increased income Charles P. Sumner enjoyed after becoming Sheriff enabled him to afford higher education for his children. Charles Sumner attended the [[Boston Latin School]], where he counted [[Robert Charles Winthrop]], [[James Freeman Clarke]], [[Samuel Francis Smith]], and [[Wendell Phillips]], among his closest friends.<ref name=\"Ref-1\"/> He graduated in 1830 from Harvard College, where he lived in [[List of Harvard dormitories|Hollis Hall]], and in 1834 from [[Harvard Law School]] where he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Joseph Story]]. At Harvard, he was a member of the [[Porcellian Club]].\n\nIn 1834, Sumner was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] and entered private practice in Boston in partnership with [[George Stillman Hillard]]. A visit to Washington decided him against a political career, and he returned to Boston resolved to practice law. He contributed to the quarterly ''American Jurist'' and edited Story's court decisions as well as some law texts. From 1836 to 1837, Sumner lectured at Harvard Law School.\n\n==Travels in Europe==\n\nSumner traveled to Europe in 1837. He landed at [[Le Havre]] and found the [[Cathedral of Rouen|cathedral]] at [[Rouen]] striking: \"the great lion of the north of France \u2026 transcending all that my imagination had pictured.\"<ref>David McCullough, ''The Greater Journey: Americans in Paris'' (2011) pp 21, 23-4</ref> He reached Paris in December, began to study French, and visited the [[Louvre]] \"with a throb,\" describing how his ignorance of art made him feel \"cabined cribbed, confined\" until repeat visits allowed works by Raphael and Leonardo to change his understanding: \"They touched my mind, untutored as it is, like a rich strain of music.\"<ref>McCullough, 30, 42, 47</ref> He mastered French in six months and attended lectures at the Sorbonne on subjects ranging from geology to Greek history to criminal law.<ref>McCullough, 59, 130</ref> In his journal for January 20, 1838, he noted that one lecturer \"had quite a large audience among whom I noticed two or three blacks, or rather mulattos--two-thirds black perhaps--dressed quite ''\u00e0 la mode'' and having the easy, jaunty air of young men of fashion\u2026.\" who were \"well received\" by the other students after the lecture. He continued:<ref>McCullough, 131</ref>\n\n{{quote|They were standing in the midst of a knot of young men and their color seemed to be no objection to them.

The French had no problem with blacks learning and interacting with others. Therefore, he determined to become an abolitionist upon his return to America.<ref>CSPAN 2 McCullough 2011 National Book Festival</ref>\n\nHe joined other Americans who were studying medicine on morning rounds at the city's great hospitals.<ref>McCullough, 130</ref> In the course of three more years, he became fluent in Spanish, German, and Italian,<ref>{{cite book |last=Langguth |first=A.

(1987). ''Members and Officers of the American Antiquarian Society''. Worcester: American Antiquarian Society.</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he delivered an Independence Day oration on \"The True Grandeur of Nations\" in Boston. He spoke against the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and made an impassioned appeal for freedom and peace.\n\nHe became a sought-after orator for formal occasions. His lofty themes and stately eloquence made a profound impression. His platform presence was imposing. He stood six feet four inches tall, with a massive frame. His voice was clear and of great power. His gestures were unconventional and individual, but vigorous and impressive. His literary style was florid, with much detail, allusion, and quotation, often from the Bible as well as the Greeks and Romans. [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] wrote that he delivered speeches \"like a cannoneer ramming down cartridges\", while Sumner himself said that \"you might as well look for a joke in the [[Book of Revelation]].\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Walther |first=Eric H. |date=2004 |title=The Shattering of the Union: America in the 1850s |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L9qNIZfUdzsC&pg=PA14 |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=SR Books |page=14 |isbn=978-0-8420-2799-1}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the annexation of Texas as a new slave-holding state in 1845, Sumner took an active role in the anti-slavery movement. That same year, Sumner represented the plaintiffs in ''[[Roberts v. Boston]]'', a case which challenged the legality of [[Racial segregation|segregation]]. Arguing before the Massachusetts [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court|Supreme Court]], Sumner noted that schools for blacks were physically inferior and that segregation bred harmful psychological and sociological effects\u2014arguments that would be made in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' over a century later.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|180}} Sumner lost the case, but the Massachusetts legislature abolished school segregation in 1855.\n\nSumner worked with [[Horace Mann]] to improve the system of public education in Massachusetts. He advocated [[prison reform]]. In opposing the Mexican\u2013American War, he considered it a war of aggression but was primarily concerned that captured territories would expand slavery westward. In 1847, Sumner denounced a Boston Representative's vote for the declaration of war against Mexico with such vigor that he became a leader of the [[Conscience Whigs]] faction of the Massachusetts [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. He declined to accept their nomination for U.S Representative in 1848. Instead, Sumner helped organize the [[Free Soil Party]], which opposed both the Democrats and the Whigs, who had nominated [[Zachary Taylor]], a slave-owning Southerner, for President. Sumner became chairman of the Massachusetts Free Soil Party's executive committee, a position he used to continue advocating for abolition by attracting anti-slavery Whigs and Democrats into a coalition with the Free Soil movement.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|152}}\n\nIn 1851, Democrats gained control of the Massachusetts state legislature in coalition with the Free Soilers. The Free Soilers named Sumner their choice for U.S. Senator. The Democrats initially opposed him and called for a less radical candidate. The impasse was broken after three months and Sumner was elected by a one-vote majority on April 24, 1851. His election marked a sharp break in Massachusetts politics, as his abolitionist politics contrasted sharply those of his most well-known predecessor in the seat, [[Daniel Webster]], who had been one of the foremost supporters of the [[Compromise of 1850]] and its [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref>Two short-term appointees held Webster's seat from July 1850 to March 1851, when Sumner's full term began.

For the first few sessions, Sumner did not promote any of his controversial causes. On August 26, 1852, Sumner, delivered his first major speech, despite strenuous efforts to dissuade him. This oratorical effort incorporated a popular abolitionist motto: \"Freedom National; Slavery Sectional\" as its title. In it, Sumner attacked the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850|1850 Fugitive Slave Act]].<ref>Charles Sumner, ''Freedom National; Slavery Sectional: Speech of Hon. Charles Sumner\u2026'' (Boston: Ticknor, Reed and Fields, 1852), [https://archive.org/details/freedomnational00sumngoog available online], accessed June 24, 2011</ref> After his speech, a Senator from [[Alabama]] urged that there be no reply: \"The ravings of a maniac may sometimes be dangerous, but the barking of a puppy never did any harm.\" Sumner's outspoken opposition to slavery made him few friends in the Senate.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|236}}\n\nThough the conventions of both major parties had just affirmed the finality of every provision of the [[Compromise of 1850]], including the Fugitive Slave Act, Sumner called for the Act's repeal. For more than three hours he denounced it as a violation of the Constitution, an affront to the public conscience, and an offense against divine law.\n\n===The \"Crime against Kansas\" speech and subsequent beating by Brooks===\n{{main| Caning of Charles Sumner}}\n[[File:Southern Chivalry.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Lithograph of [[Preston Brooks]]' 1856 attack on Sumner; the artist depicts the faceless assailant bludgeoning the learned martyr]]\n{{wikisource|The Crime against Kansas}}\nIn 1856, during the \"[[Bleeding Kansas]]\" crisis, Sumner denounced the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]], and he continued this attack in his \"Crime against Kansas\" speech on May 19 and May 20. The long speech argued for the immediate admission of Kansas as a free state, and went on to denounce the \"[[Slave Power]]\"\u2014the political arm of the slave owners.

It is the rape of a virgin Territory, compelling it to the hateful embrace of slavery; and it may be clearly traced to a depraved desire for a new Slave State, hideous offspring of such a crime, in the hope of adding to the power of slavery in the National Government.<ref>Michael William Pfau, \"Time, Tropes, and Textuality: Reading Republicanism in Charles Sumner's 'Crime Against Kansas'\", ''Rhetoric & Public Affairs'' vol 6 #3 (2003) 385-413, quote on p. 393 [http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/rhetoric_and_public_affairs/v006/6.3pfau.html online in Project MUSE]</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfterwards, Sumner verbally attacked authors of the Act, Democratic Senators [[Stephen A. Douglas]] of Illinois and [[Andrew Butler]] of South Carolina. He said:\n\n<blockquote>The senator from South Carolina has read many books of chivalry, and believes himself a chivalrous knight with sentiments of honor and courage. Of course he has chosen a mistress to whom he has made his vows, and who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight -- I mean the harlot, slavery. For her his tongue is always profuse in words.

Keitt told him that dueling was for gentlemen of equal social standing, and that Sumner was no better than a drunkard, due to the supposedly coarse language he had used during his speech.

Thousands attended rallies in support of Sumner in Boston, Albany, Cleveland, Detroit, New Haven, New York, and Providence. More than a million copies of Sumner's speech were distributed. Two weeks after the caning, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] described the divide the incident represented: \"I do not see how a barbarous community and a civilized community can constitute one state. I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom.\"<ref>Puleo, 36-7</ref> Conversely, Brooks was praised by Southern newspapers. The ''Richmond Enquirer'' editorialized that Sumner should be caned \"every morning,\" praising the attack as \"good in conception, better in execution, and best of all in consequences\" and denounced \"these vulgar abolitionists in the Senate\" who \"have been suffered to run too long without collars. They must be lashed into submission.\" Southerners sent Brooks hundreds of new canes in endorsement of his assault. One was inscribed \"Hit him again.\" Southern lawmakers made rings out of the cane's remains, which they wore on neck chains to show their solidarity with Brooks.<ref>Puleo, 102, 114\u2013115</ref> Brooks was remembered in [[Brooksville, Florida]] and [[Brooks County, Georgia]].\n\nHistorian William Gienapp has concluded that Brooks' \"assault was of critical importance in transforming the struggling Republican party into a major political force.\"<ref>William E.

The Massachusetts General Court re-elected him in November 1856, believing that his vacant chair in the Senate chamber served as a powerful symbol of [[free speech]] and resistance to slavery.<ref>Sumner's chair was later purchased by [[Bates College]], an abolitionist-leaning school with which Sumner was involved.

His doctors advised a sea voyage and \"a complete separation from the cares and responsibilities that must beset him at home.\" He sailed for Europe and immediately found relief.<ref>McCullough, 225-6</ref> During two months in Paris in the spring of 1857, he renewed friendships, especially with [[Thomas Gold Appleton]], dined out frequently, and attended the opera several nights in a row. His contacts there included [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], poet [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], former French Prime Minister [[Fran\u00e7ois Guizot]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]].<ref>McCullough, 226-9</ref> Sumner then toured several countries, including Germany and Scotland, before returning to Washington where he spent only a few days in the Senate in December. Both then and during several later attempts to return to work, he found himself exhausted just listening to Senate business. He sailed once more for Europe on May 22, 1858, the second anniversary of Brooks' attack.<ref>McCullough, 229-30</ref>\n\nIn Paris, prominent physician [[Charles-\u00c9douard Brown-S\u00e9quard]] diagnosed Sumner's condition as spinal cord damage that he could treat by burning the skin along the spinal cord. Sumner chose to refuse anesthesia, which was thought to reduce the effectiveness of the procedure. Observers both at the time and since doubt Brown-S\u00e9quard's efforts were of value.<ref>McCullough, 230-1</ref> After spending weeks recovering from these treatments, Sumner resumed his touring, this time traveling as far east as Dresden and Prague and south to Italy twice. In France he visited Brittany and Normandy, as well as Montpellier. He wrote his brother: \"If anyone cares to know how I am doing, you can say better and better.\"<ref>McCullough, 233</ref>\n\n===Returned to Senate===\nSumner returned to the Senate in 1859. When fellow Republicans advised taking a less strident tone than he had years earlier, he answered: \"When crime and criminals are thrust before us, they are to be met by all the energies that God has given us by argument, scorn, sarcasm and denunciation.\" He delivered his first speech following his return on June 4, 1860, during the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|1860 presidential election]]. In \"The Barbarism of Slavery\", he attacked attempts to depict slavery as a benevolent institution, said it had stifled economic development in the South and that it left slaveholders reliant on \"the bludgeon, the revolver, and the bowie-knife\". He addressed an anticipated objection on the part of one of his colleagues: \"Say, sir, in your madness, that you own the sun, the stars, the moon; but do not say that you own a man, endowed with a soul that shall live immortal, when sun and moon and stars have passed away.\" Even allies found his language too strong, one calling it \"harsh, vindictive, and slightly brutal\".<ref>Puleo, 113-9</ref> He spent the summer rallying the anti-slavery forces and opposing talk of compromise.<ref>Puleo, 119-20</ref>\n\n===Civil War===\n\n====Radicals====\nSenator Sumner was a member of a faction of the Republican Party known as the [[Radical Republicans|Radical]]s.<ref name=\"Oates\">[[#Oates|Oates]] (December 1980), ''The Slaves Freed'', American Heritage Magazine</ref> In March 1861, after the withdrawal of Southern Senators, Sumner became chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations. The Radicals primarily advocated the immediate abolition of slavery and the destruction of the Southern planter class. Senate Radicals included Sumner, Sen. [[Zachariah Chandler]], and Sen. [[Benjamin Wade]].<ref name=\"Oates\"/> During the American Civil War, after the fall of [[Battle of Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter]], in April 1861, Sumner, Chandler and Wade repeatedly visited President [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[White House]], speaking on slavery and the rebellion.<ref name=\"Oates\"/> Although like-minded on slavery, the Radicals were loosely organized and disagreed with one another on other issues such as the tariff and currency issues.<ref>Stanley Coben, \"Northeastern Business and Radical Reconstruction: A Re-examination\", ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' Vol. 46, No. 1 (Jun., 1959), pp. 67-90 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1892388 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n====Slave emancipation====\n[[File:Sumner-Longfellow.jpg|thumb |180px |right |Senator Sumner and his friend [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], photograph by [[Alexander Gardner (photographer)|Gardner]], 1863]]\n\nAlthough the Radical Senators desired the immediate emancipation of slaves, President Lincoln, in 1861, was initially resistant to freeing the slaves, since the Union slave states [[Delaware]], [[Maryland]], [[Kentucky]], and [[Missouri]] would be encouraged to join the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]].<ref name=\"Oates\"/> Sumner, however, knew that the pressure of the Civil War would eventually cause President Lincoln to free the slaves. As a compromise, the Radicals and President Lincoln passed two Confiscation Acts in 1861 and 1862 that allowed the Union military to free confiscated slaves who were carrying weapons, among other tasks, for the Confederate army. Sumner and other Radicals had persistently advocated that Lincoln emancipate the slaves.<ref name=\"Oates\"/> Lincoln, however, had adopted a moderated plan of gradual emancipation of slaves and compensation to the slave owners. Sumner believed that emancipating the slaves would keep Britain from entering the Civil War and the millions of slaves freed from bondage would give America higher moral standing. Lincoln described Sumner as \"my idea of a bishop\" and consulted him as an embodiment of the conscience of the American people.<ref name=\"Donald\"/>{{rp|319}} On January 1, 1863, President Lincoln, out of military necessity, issued the [[Emancipation Proclamation]].<ref name=\"Oates\"/>\n\n====Castigated Union Brig. Gen. Stone====\nOn December 9, 1861, the Senate Radicals established the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War|Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War]], whose purpose was to investigate battle defeats and determine the loyalty of generals fighting for the Union War effort.<ref name=\"Williams\">[[#Williams|Williams]] (December 1958), ''Investigation: 1862''</ref> The committee was formed at the instigation of Radical Sen. Chandler after the Union defeat at the [[Battle of Ball's Bluff]], under the command of Union Brig. General [[Charles Pomeroy Stone|Charles P. Stone]].<ref name=\"Williams\"/> At the Ball's Bluff battle on October 21, 1861, Union Senator and Colonel [[Edward D. Baker]], who was a close friend of President Lincoln's, was killed and Brig. Gen. Stone was blamed for the defeat by the Union press. Sen. Sumner, upset at having learned Brig. Gen. Stone had ordered two runaway slaves to be denied [[Right of asylum|asylum]] in the Union Army, castigated Brig. Gen. Stone in a Senate speech.<ref name=\"Williams\"/> Brig. Gen. Stone wrote Sen. Sumner a terse letter and [[duel|demanded satisfaction]] from Sen. Sumner. On January 31, 1862, Brig. Gen. Stone defended himself in front of the Senate Committee under Radical chairman Sen. Wade.<ref name=\"Williams\"/> Indicted under suspicion of treason, without any trial, Brig. Gen. Stone was arrested on February 8, 1862, and federally imprisoned for 189 days.<ref name=\"Williams\"/>\n\n====Martial law, emancipation, speech controversy====\nOn the onset of the American Civil War in 1861, the Lincoln administration made a great effort to ensure the war would not be a revolution waged against slavery.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\">Haynes (1909), Charles Sumner, pp. 247-251</ref> Sumner had counseled Lincoln in May to make the end of slavery the primary objective, as Sumner believed Lincoln's policy to save the Union would be impossible without abolishing slavery.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/> In October 1861, at the Massachusetts state Republican Convention in Worcester, Sumner took an unprecedented step and spoke openly in a speech that the Civil War's sole cause was slavery and the primary objective of the Union government was to destroy slavery. Sumner stated that the Union government had the power to invoke [[martial law]] and emancipate the slaves.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/> The speech caused controversy among the conservative Boston press. Sumner's speech was denounced as [[wikt:incendiary|incendiary]] and Sumner was viewed as mentally ill and a \"candidate for the insane asylum.\"<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/> The Free Soil faction of the Republican Party fully endorsed Sumner's speech. Sumner continued to make public speeches that the goal of the Civil War was to end slavery by emancipation.<ref name=\"Haynes Boston Speech Controversy\"/>\n\n====''Trent'' Affair====\n{{main|Trent Affair}}\nOn November 8, 1861, the Union naval ship {{USS|San Jacinto|1850|6}}, under the command of Capt. [[Charles Wilkes]], intercepted the British steamer {{RMS|Trent}}, captured and put into U.S. port custody two Confederate diplomats [[James M. Mason]] and [[John Slidell]].<ref name=\"Haynes Trent Affair\">Haynes (1909), ''Charles Sumner'', pp. 251-258</ref> The northern people and press were in favor of the capture; however, there was concern that the British would use this as grounds to go to war with the United States. The British government dispatched 8,000 British troops on the Canada\u2013US border and efforts were made to strengthen the British fleet.<ref name=\"Haynes Trent Affair\"/> Sec. Seward believed that Mason and Slidell were contraband of war. Sumner, however, believed that the men did not qualify as war contraband, since they were unarmed, and that their release with an apology by the U.S. government was appropriate. In the Senate, Sumner suppressed open debate in order to save Lincoln's administration from embarrassment. On December 25, 1861, at Lincoln's invitation, Sumner read to Lincoln's Cabinet letters he received from prominent British political figures, including [[Richard Cobden|Cobden]], [[John Bright|Bright]], [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]], and [[George Douglas Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll|the Duke of Argyll]]. The letters provided critical information on political sentiment in Britain and supported the envoys' return to the British.<ref>David Donald, Jean Harvey Baker, and Michael F. Holt, ''The Civil War and Reconstruction'' (2001), 135-8</ref> \"One war at a time\" was Lincoln's response; he then quietly but reluctantly ordered the release of the Confederate captives to British custody and apologized for their capture. After the ''Trent'' Affair, Sen. Sumner's reputation improved among conservative Northerners.<ref name=\"Haynes Trent Affair\"/>\n\n====Haitian recognition====\nAs chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sumner renewed his efforts to win U.S. [[diplomatic recognition]] of [[Haiti]]. Haiti had sought recognition since winning independence in 1804, but faced opposition from Southern Senators. In their absence, the U.S. recognized Haiti in 1862.<ref>Alfred N. Hunt, ''Haiti's Influence on Antebellum America: Slumbering Volcano in the Caribbean'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1988), 187</ref>\n\n====Two civilizations argument====\nOsofsky argues that Sumner and like minded Yankees saw the war as a \"death struggle\" between \"two mutually contradictory civilizations.\" The solution for Sumner, \"the way to 'civilize' and 'Americanize' the South\" was to make it over into an idealized version of New England. It was to be conquered and then forcibly molded into a society defined in northern terms.<ref>Gilbert Osofsky, \"Cardboard Yankee: How Not to Study the Mind of Charles Sumner\", ''Reviews in American History'' Vol. 1, No. 4 (Dec., 1973), pp. 595-606 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2701730 in JSTOR] quotes are in Osofsky's words on pp 595, 596</ref>\n\n====Objection to Taney memorial====\nIn February 1865, there was considerable debate over authorizing the creation of a memorial to [[United States Chief Justice]] [[Roger Taney]]. Sumner was a longtime enemy of Taney and attacked his decision in the ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'' case. Speaking on the Senate floor, in an argument with Sen. [[Lyman Trumbull]], Sen. Sumner, who objected to the memorial's creation, stated:<ref>[[Wikisource:Congressional Globe February 23, 1865]], ''Congressional Globe'', February 23, 1865.

As one of the Radical Republican leaders in the post-war Senate, Sumner fought to provide equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen on the grounds that \"consent of the governed\" was a basic principle of [[Republicanism in the United States|American republicanism]] and in order to keep ex-Confederates from gaining political offices and undoing the North's victory in the Civil War.\n\nThe [[Reconstruction Era]] of the United States after the American Civil War was in the nineteenth and early twentieth century usually viewed as an era of Southern exploitation and corruption by Northern politicians and harsh federal policies, led by the Radical Republicans.<ref name=\"Foner-Reconstruction\">[[#Foner|Foner]] (1983), ''The New View Of Reconstruction'', [[American Heritage Magazine]]</ref> The plight of the freedmen during Reconstruction was largely ignored by conservative historians who followed the [[Dunning School]]. According to historian Eric Foner, during the 1960s, revisionist historians have reinterpreted Reconstruction \"in the light of changed attitudes toward the place of blacks within American society.\"<ref name=\"Foner-Reconstruction\"/> Charles Sumner, a Radical Republican, has emerged as an idealist and a champion for African American civil rights through this turbulent and controversial period of United States History.<ref name=\"Foner-Reconstruction\"/> Sumner joined his fellow Republicans in overriding President Johnson's vetoes and imposed some of their views, though Sumner's most radical ideas were not implemented. Senator Sumner, however, in late 1866 favored impartial [[suffrage]] for African Americans, desiring to put in a [[literacy]] requirement on all southerners in order to vote.<ref name=Goldstone_p18>Goldstone, p. 18</ref> Had Sumner's literacy clause been enacted, only a small portion of blacks would have been able to vote, which would have been far more than Congress or the white southern governments were prepared to enact at that time. When Congress did open the vote to all loyal adult males in the South the following year, Sumner was strongly supportive.<ref name=Goldstone_p18/>\n\nSumner's radical theory of Reconstruction proposed that nothing beyond the confines of the Constitution restricted the Congress in determining how to treat the eleven defeated states, but that even that document had to be read in light of the Declaration of Independence, which he saw as an essential part of fundamental law. Not going as far as Thaddeus Stevens in seeing the seceded states as \"conquered provinces,\" he nonetheless argued that by declaring [[secession]], they had committed ''[[felo de se]]'' (''state suicide'') and could now be turned into territories that should be prepared for statehood, under conditions set by the national government. He objected to Lincoln's and later [[Andrew Johnson]]'s more lenient Reconstruction policies as ungenerous to the former slaves, inadequate in their guarantees of equal rights, and an encroachment upon the powers of Congress.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} When Andrew Johnson was impeached, Sumner voted for conviction. He was only sorry that he had to vote on each article of impeachment, for as he said, he would have rather voted, \"Guilty of all, and infinitely more.\"<ref>Donald, ''Rights of Man'', 337</ref>\n\nSumner was a friend of [[Samuel Gridley Howe]] and a guiding force for the [[American Freedmen's Inquiry Commission]], started in 1863. He was one of the most prominent advocates for suffrage for blacks, along with free homesteads and free public schools. His uncompromising attitude did not endear him to moderates and his arrogance and inflexibility often inhibited his effectiveness as a legislator. He was largely excluded from work on the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], in part because he did not get along with Illinois Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]], who chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee and did much of the work on it. Sumner introduced an alternative amendment that combined the Thirteenth Amendment with elements of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. It would have abolished slavery and declared that \"all people are equal before the law.\" During Reconstruction, he often attacked civil rights legislation as inadequate and fought for legislation to give land to freed slaves and to mandate education for all, regardless of race, in the South. He viewed segregation and slavery as two sides of the same coin.<ref>Donald, 2: 532</ref> He introduced a civil rights bill in 1872 to mandate equal accommodation in all public places and required suits brought under the bill to be argued in the federal courts.<ref>Donald, ''Rights of Man'', 532</ref> The bill failed, but Sumner revived it in the next Congress, and on his deathbed begged visitors to see that it did not fail.<ref>Donald, 587</ref>\n\nSumner repeatedly tried to remove the word \"white\" from naturalization laws. He introduced bills to that effect in 1868 and 1869, but neither came to a vote. On July 2, 1870, Sumner moved to amend a pending bill in a way that would strike the word \"white\" wherever in all Congressional acts pertaining to [[naturalization]] of immigrants. On July 4, 1870, he said: \"Senators undertake to disturb us&nbsp;\u2026 by reminding us of the possibility of large numbers swarming from China; but the answer to all this is very obvious and very simple. If the Chinese come here, they will come for citizenship or merely for labor. If they come for citizenship, then in this desire do they give a pledge of loyalty to our institutions; and where is the peril in such vows? They are peaceful and industrious; how can their citizenship be the occasion of solicitude?\" He accused legislators promoting anti-Chinese legislation of betraying the principles of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]: \"Worse than any heathen or pagan abroad are those in our midst who are false to our institutions.\" Sumner's bill failed, and from 1870 to 1943, and in some cases as late as 1952, Chinese and other Asians were ineligible for naturalized U.S. citizenship.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HGM9AQAAMAAJ&pg=PA5172&lpg=PA5172&dq=%22Worse+than+any+heathen+or+pagan+abroad+are+those+in+our+midst+who+are+false+to+our+institutions.%22#v=onepage&q=%22Worse%20than%20any%20heathen%20or%20pagan%20abroad%20are%20those%20in%20our%20midst%20who%20are%20false%20to%20our%20institutions.%22&f=false|first=Roger|last=Daniels|title=Guarding the Golden Door: American Immigration Policy and Immigrants since 1882|location=New York|publisher=Hill and Wang|date=2004|pages=13\u201316|accessdate=May 18, 2016}}</ref>\nSumner remained a champion of civil rights for blacks.

In a 3-hour speech, Sumner spoke in favor of the treaty on the Senate floor, describing in detail Alaska's imperial history, natural resources, population, and climate. Sumner wanted to block British expansion from Canada, arguing that Alaska was geographically and financially strategic, especially for the Pacific Coast States. He said Alaska would increase America's borders, spread republican institutions, and represent an act of friendship with Russia.

The U.S. had claims against Britain for the damage inflicted by Confederate raiding ships fitted out in British ports. Sumner held that since Britain had accorded the rights of [[belligerent]]s to the Confederacy, it was responsible for extending the duration of the war and consequent losses. In 1869, he asserted that Britain should pay damages for not merely the raiders, but also \"that other damage, immense and infinite, caused by the prolongation of the war.\" He demanded $2,000,000,000 for these \"national claims\" in addition to $125,000,000 for damages from the raiders. Sumner did not expect that Britain ever would or could pay this immense sum, but he suggested that Britain turn over Canada as payment.<ref name=\"Corning 1918 59-84\">{{cite book |last=Corning|first=Amos Elwood|title=Hamilton Fish|url=https://archive.org/details/hamiltonfish00corngoog|pages=59\u201384|year=1918|publisher=Lamere Pub.

At the [[Alabama Claims|Geneva arbitration conference]] which settled U.S. claims against Britain, the panel of arbitrators refused to consider those \"constructive\" or \"national claims.\"\n\nSumner had some influence over [[J. Lothrop Motley]], the U.S. [[ambassador]] to Britain, causing him to disregard the instructions of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hamilton Fish]] on the matter, though not as far as some historians have indicated. This offended President Grant, but while it would be given as the official reason for Motley's removal, was not really so pressing: the dismissal took place a year after Motley's alleged misbehavior, and the real reason was an act of spite by the president against Sumner.<ref name=\"Corning 1918 59-84\"/>\n\n===Dominican Republic annexation treaty===\n{{main |Annexation of Santo Domingo}}\nIn 1869, President Grant, in an expansionist plan, looked into the annexation of a Caribbean island country, the [[Dominican Republic]], then known as Santo Domingo. Grant believed that the mineral resources on the island would be valuable to the United States, and that African Americans repressed in the South would have a safe haven to which to migrate. A labor shortage in the South would force Southerners to be tolerant towards African Americans.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 337</ref><ref>McFeely (1981), p. 332, 333</ref> In July and November 1869, under authority of President Grant and permission by the State Department on the second trip, [[Orville Babcock]], private secretary to President Grant, secretly negotiated a treaty with President [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]], President of the Dominican Republic. The initial treaty by Babcock had not been authorized by the State Department. The island nation, however, was on the verge of a civil war between President B\u00e1ez and ex-President Marcos A. Cabral.<ref>McFeely (1981), p. 338, 339.</ref> President Grant sent in the U.S. Navy to keep the Dominican Republic free from invasion and civil war while the treaty negotiations took place. This military action was controversial since the naval protection was unauthorized by the U.S. Congress.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', pp. 379-381</ref> The official treaty, drafted by Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] in October 1869, annexed the Dominican Republic to the United States, gave eventual statehood, the lease of [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for $150,000 yearly, and a $1,500,000 payment of the Dominican national debt.<ref>Smith (2001), p. 501, 502</ref> In January 1870, in order to gain support for the treaty, President Grant visited Sen. Sumner's Washington home and mistakenly believed that Sumner had given consent for the treaty. Sen. Sumner stated that he had only promised to give the treaty friendly consideration. This meeting would later lead to bitter contention between Sumner and Grant.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', pp. 382-384</ref> The treaty was formally submitted to the [[United States Senate]] on January 10, 1870.<ref>Smith (2001), p. 504</ref>\n\n[[File:President Ulysses S. Grant seated portrait Brady.jpg|thumb|180px|President [[Ulysses S. Grant]]<br/>The Dominican Republic annexation treaty caused bitter contention between President Grant and Sen. Sumner. --Brady 1869]]\n\nSumner, opposed to American imperialism in the [[Caribbean]] and fearful that annexation would lead to the conquest of the neighboring black republic of Haiti, became convinced that corruption lay behind the treaty, and that men close to the president shared in the corruption. As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sumner initially withheld his opinion on the treaty on January 18, 1870.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', p. 384</ref> Sumner had been leaked information from Assistant Secretary of State, [[Bancroft Davis]], that U.S. Naval ships were being used to protect B\u00e1ez. Sumner's committee voted against annexation and at Sumner's suggestion and quite possibly to save the party from an ugly fight or the president from embarrassment, the Senate held its debate of the treaty behind closed doors in executive session. Grant persisted and sent messages to Congress in favor of annexation on March 14, 1870, and May 31, 1870.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', pp.384-385</ref> In closed session, Sumner spoke out against the treaty; warning that there would be difficulty with the foreign nationals, noting the chronic rebellion that took place on the island, and the risk that the independence of Haiti, recognized by the United States in 1862, would be lost. Sumner stated that Grant's use of the U.S. Navy as a protectorate was a violation of International law and unconstitutional.<ref>Sumner (March 21, 1871), ''Violations of International Law and Usurpations of War Powers'', p. 3</ref> Finally, on June 30, 1870 the treaty was voted on by the Senate and failed to gain the required 2/3 majority for treaty passage.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', pp. 385-386</ref>\n\nThe following day, Grant, feeling betrayed by Sumner, retaliated by ordering the dismissal of Sumner's close friend [[John Lothrop Motley]], Ambassador to Britain.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', p. 386</ref> By autumn, Sumner's personal hostility to the president was public knowledge, and he blamed the Secretary of State for failing to have resigned, rather than let Grant have his way. The two men, friends until then, cooled into bitter enemies. In December 1870, still fearful that Grant meant to acquire Santo Domingo somehow, Sumner gave a fiercely critical speech accusing the president of usurpation and Babcock of unethical conduct. Already Grant, supported by Fish, had initiated a campaign to depose Sumner from the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Although Sumner stated he was an \"Administration man,\" in addition to having stopped Grant's Dominican Republic treaty attempt, Sumner had defeated Grant's full repeal of the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], blocked Grant's nomination of [[Alexander Turney Stewart|Alexander Stewart]] as U.S. Secretary of Treasury, and been a constant harassing force pushing Reconstruction policies faster than Grant had been willing to go. Grant resented Sumner's superiority of manner, as well. Told once that Sumner did not believe in the Bible, the president is supposed to have said that he was not surprised: \"He didn't write it.\"<ref>Smith (2001), ''Grant'', pp. 503-504</ref> As the rift between Grant and Sumner increased, Sumner's health began to decline. When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, Senators affiliated with President Grant, known as \"New Radicals\" voted to oust Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship.<ref>Storey (1900), ''Charles Sumner'', p. 392, 394</ref><ref>Donald (1970), ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'', pp. 446, 447</ref>\n\n===Liberal Republican revolt===\nSumner now turned against Grant. Like many other reformers, he decried the corruption in Grant's administration. Sumner believed that the civil rights program he championed could not be carried through by a corrupt government. In 1872, he joined the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]] which had been started by reformist Republicans such as [[Horace Greeley]]. The Liberal Republicans supported black suffrage, the three Reconstruction amendments, and the basic civil rights already protected by law, but they also called for amnesty for ex-Confederates and decried the Republican governments in the South elected with the help of black votes, belittled the terrorism of the Ku-Klux Klan, and argued that the time had come to restore \"home rule\" in the South, which in practical terms meant white Democratic rule. For Sumner's civil rights bill they gave no support at all, but Sumner joined them because he convinced himself that the time had come for reconciliation, and that Democrats were sincere in declaring that they would abide by the Reconstruction settlement.<ref>Andrew L. Slap, ''The doom of Reconstruction: the liberal Republicans in the Civil War era'' p xiii, 225</ref>\n[[File:Senator Sumner.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Sumner in later years]]\n\n===Conciliation to South===\nSumner never saw his support for civil rights as hostile to the South. On the contrary, he had always contended that a guarantee for equality was the one condition essential for true reconciliation. Unlike some other Radical Republicans, he had strongly opposed any hanging or imprisonment of Confederate leaders. In December 1872, he introduced a Senate resolution providing that Civil War battle names should not appear as \"battle honors\" on the regimental flags of the U.S. Army. The proposal was not new: Sumner had offered a similar resolution on May 8, 1862, and in 1865 he had proposed that no painting hanging in the Capitol portray scenes from the Civil War, because, as he saw it, keeping alive the memories of a war between a people was barbarous. His proposal did not affect the vast majority of battle-flags, as nearly all the regiments that fought had been state regiments, and these were not covered. But Sumner's idea was that any United States regiment, that would in the future enlist southerners as well as northerners, should not carry on its ensigns any insult to those who joined it. His resolution had no chance of passing, but its presentation offended Union army veterans. The Massachusetts legislature censured Sumner for giving \"an insult to the loyal soldiery of the nation\" and as \"meeting the unqualified condemnation of the people of the Commonwealth.\" Poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] led an effort to rescind that censure the following year. He succeeded early in 1874 with the help of abolitionist [[Joshua Bowen Smith]], who happened to be serving in the legislature that year.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Boston Post |date=July 7, 1879 |title=Obituary.

Sumner's friend Senator [[Carl Schurz]] praised Sumner's integrity, his \"moral courage,\" the \"sincerity of his convictions,\" and the \"disinterestedness of his motives.\" However, Sumner's Pulitzer-prize-winning biographer, [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]], presents Sumner in his first volume, ''Charles Sumner and the Coming of the Civil War'' (1960), as an insufferably arrogant moralist; an egoist bloated with pride; pontifical and Olympian, and unable to distinguish between large issues and small ones. What's more, concludes Donald, Sumner was a coward who avoided confrontations with his many enemies, whom he routinely insulted in prepared speeches.<ref>Osofsky, ''Cardboard Yankee'', p. 597-8</ref> But none of his friends at the time doubted his courage, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, who knew Sumner well, remembered that southerners in the 1850s in Washington wondered, every time Sumner left his house in the morning, whether he would return to it alive.<ref>Wendell Phillips letter, 'Boston Daily Advertiser,' March 11, 1873.</ref> Just before he died, Sumner turned to his friend Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar. \"Judge,\" he said, \"tell Emerson how much I love and revere him.\" \"He said of you once,\" Hoar replied, \"that he never knew so white a soul.\" <ref>David Donald, \"Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man,\" 587</ref>\n\nBiographers have varied in their appraisal of Sumner. The Pulitzer Prize went to biographer [[David Herbert Donald|David Donald]] whose two-volume biography points up Sumner's troubles in dealing with his colleagues:<ref>Goodman's paraphrase of Donald in Goodman (1964) p 374</ref>\n\n{{quote|Distrusted by friends and allies, and reciprocating their distrust, a man of \"ostentatious culture\", \"unvarnished egotism\", and \"'a specimen of prolonged and morbid juvenility,'\" Sumner combined a passionate conviction in his own moral purity with a command of 19th-century \"rhetorical flourishes\" and a \"remarkable talent for rationalization\". Stumbling \"into politics largely by accident\", elevated to the United States Senate largely by chance, willing to indulge in \"Jacksonian demagoguery\" for the sake of political expediency, Sumner became a bitter and potent agitator of sectional conflict. Carving out a reputation as the South's most hated foe and the Negro's bravest friend, he inflamed sectional differences, advanced his personal fortunes, and helped bring about national tragedy.}}\n[[File:Sumner-death.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Death of Sumner]]\n\n[[Moorfield Storey]], Sumner's private secretary for two years and subsequent biographer, seeing some of the same qualities, interprets them more charitably:\n\n{{quote|Charles Sumner was a great man in his absolute fidelity to principle, his clear perception of what his country needed, his unflinching courage, his perfect sincerity, his persistent devotion to duty, his indifference to selfish considerations, his high scorn of anything petty or mean.

There are few successful men who escape these penalties of success, the common accompaniment of increasing years\u2026.Sumner's naively simple nature, his confidence in his fellows, and his lack of humor combined to prevent his concealing what many feel but are better able to hide.

Sumner's previously critical biographer David Herbert Donald, in the second volume of his biography, ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'' (1970), was much more favorable to Sumner, and though critical, recognized his large contribution to the positive accomplishments of Reconstruction. It has been noted that events in the Civil Rights Movement between 1960, when Donald's first volume was published, and 1970, when the second volume was published, likely swayed Donald somewhat further towards Sumner.<ref>Obituary of David Herbert Donald, available at https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/19/books/19donald.html?_r=0</ref>\n\n[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] wrote of Sumner:\n\n{{quote|Mr. Sumner's position is exceptional in its honor\u2026.

In 1866, Sumner began courting Alice Mason Hooper, the widowed daughter-in-law of Massachusetts Representative [[Samuel Hooper]], and the two were married that October. Their marriage was unhappy. Sumner could not respond to his wife's humor, and Alice had a ferocious temper. That winter, Alice began going out to public events with Prussian diplomat [[Friedrich von Holstein]]. This caused gossip in Washington, but Alice refused to stop seeing Holstein. When Holstein was recalled to Prussia in the spring of 1867, Alice accused Sumner of engineering the action, which Sumner always denied.

''Young Charles Sumner and the Legacy of the American Enlightenment, 1811\u20131851'' (U. of Massachusetts Press, 2001. 422 pp.) Disagrees with Donald and contends that Sumner internalized [[Republicanism in the United States|republican]] principles of duty, education, and liberty balanced by order. He was also shaped by Moral Philosophy, the dominant strain of American Enlightenment thinking, which included cosmopolitan ideals and a stress on the dignity of intellect and conscience. He was also keen on the idea of Natural Law. These influences came from readings and his close ties to [[John Quincy Adams]], [[William Ellery Channing]], and [[Joseph Story]]. Taylor says Sumner sought an American culture combining American liberty with European culture. He became a reformer regarding education, the arts, prison discipline, world peace, and anti-slavery. He saw reform work as a duty to work for the public good.\n*{{cite journal |ref=Williams |last=Williams |first=T.

It has an area of 629.95 km2 and makes up 2,568% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Prnjavor belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20131 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 31 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Prnjavor is 1,600 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Crkva brvnara u Palackovcima.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Wooden church Pala\u010dkovci]]\n[[File:Smoke pipe Sepiolite.JPG|thumb|Smoke pipe made out of [[Sepiolite]] from Prnjavor displayed at [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Sarajevo|Sara]]\n\n[[Sarajevo|jevo]].|275x275px]]\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nEven over 700 years ago people recognized the economic potential of the area of the present-day Municipality of Prnjavor. Although there had been some settlements from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period here, significant colonization and settlement (including the construction of monasteries, such as the one of at Stuplje) took place only in the [[Middle Age]]s. According to historical sources, medieval monasteries had their landed properties called ''Prnjavori'', and the locals living there were called ''Prnjavorci''. This is believed to be the origin of the name ''Prnjavor''.\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period the region suffered from border conflicts with the [[Austrian Empire]]. A significant number of [[Bosnians]] converted to Islam after the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia|conquest by the Ottoman Empire]] in the second half of the 15th century, giving it a unique character within the [[Balkan]] region. This conversion appears to have been not sudden but a gradual process based on various rules imposed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] \u2014 it took more than a hundred years for the number of Muslims to become the majority religion. The general view among scholars is that the Islamization of the Bosnian population was not the result of violent methods of conversions but was, for the most part, peaceful and voluntary.\n\nThe first time Prnjavor was mentioned in recorded history was in 1829. The current settlement itself is believed to be of a more recent date. In the mid-19th century and according to the records of the travel writer Juki\u0107, Prnjavor had about a hundred houses and around a thousand inhabitants.\n\n=== Austria-Hungary ===\nIn 1878 [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied [[Bosnia]] and the authorities decided the Prnjavor area was under-populated. Efforts were undertaken to attract settlers from other parts of the empire and consequently the municipal area was settled by [[Italians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Czechs]], [[Poles]], [[Hungarians]] and German-speaking folk from [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Bohemia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Russia]]. Although over half the population remained [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]], the multi-ethnic character of the population led the municipality of Prnjavor to be nicknamed \"Little Europe\".\n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\nIn 1918 Bosnia became part of [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and all immigration stopped. During the interwar period between 1918 and 1941 Prnjavor underwent more significant economic development through the opening of craftsman workshops, hotels, more shops and a few manufacturing plants. From 1929 to 1941 Prnjavor was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFollowing the collapse of internal security during [[World War II]] the [[Nazis]] decided to evacuate the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' (ethnic German) population from [[Bosnia]] and a treaty to this effect was signed with the [[Croatia]]n [[Usta\u0161e]] regime on 30 September 1942. After 1945 the [[Yugoslav Communist Party|Communist]] regime of [[Josip Broz Tito]] repopulated the ''Volksdeutsche'' villages with [[Serbs]] and destroyed or obscured all evidence of German history and heritage in the region.\n\nDuring the [[Socialist]] period of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] Prnjavor was not a highly developed municipality within [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\nAfter the war that erupted after the collapse of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)]], Prnjavor became part of the North-Eastern entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the [[Republika Srpska]], as per the [[Dayton Agreement]]. The warring that took place in the very proximity of Prnjavor e.g. in [[Derventa]], changed the demography in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], a total of 2,2 million people had to flee their homes from different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many people never returned, changing the ethnic composition in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality has 35,956 inhabitants, while the town of Prnjavor had a population of 7.651 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Prnjavor municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlment\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|\n|46,734\n|48,956\n|47,055\n|38,399\n|-\n|1\n|Babanovci\n|\n|\n|\n|398\n|188\n|-\n|2\n|Brezik\n|\n|\n|\n|304\n|125\n|-\n|3\n|Velika Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|1,041\n|699\n|-\n|4\n|Vr\u0161ani\n|\n|\n|\n|722\n|372\n|-\n|5\n|Gajevi\n|\n|\n|\n|191\n|148\n|-\n|6\n|Galjipovci\n|\n|\n|\n|400\n|186\n|-\n|7\n|Gornja Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|1,391\n|754\n|-\n|8\n|Donja Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|782\n|578\n|-\n|9\n|Gornji Vija\u010dani\n|\n|\n|\n|1,074\n|621\n|-\n|10\n|Gornji Galjipovci\n|\n|\n|\n|339\n|250\n|-\n|11\n|Gornji Pala\u010dkovci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,235\n|821\n|-\n|12\n|Gpornji Smrti\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|1,443\n|1,084\n|-\n|13\n|Gornji \u0160trpci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,356\n|1,157\n|-\n|14\n|Grabik Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|839\n|530\n|-\n|15\n|Gusak\n|\n|\n|\n|237\n|179\n|-\n|16\n|Doline\n|\n|\n|\n|193\n|167\n|-\n|17\n|Donja Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|817\n|511\n|-\n|18\n|Donji Vija\u010dani\n|\n|\n|\n|1,700\n|1,195\n|-\n|19\n|Donji Galjipovci\n|\n|\n|\n|426\n|433\n|-\n|20\n|Donji Pala\u010dkovci\n|\n|\n|\n|568\n|359\n|-\n|21\n|Donji Smrti\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|672\n|452\n|-\n|22\n|Donji \u0160trpci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,516\n|1,061\n|-\n|23\n|Drenova\n|\n|\n|\n|864\n|446\n|-\n|24\n|Jadovica\n|\n|\n|\n|93\n|63\n|-\n|25\n|Jasik\n|\n|\n|\n|227\n|282\n|-\n|26\n|Kara\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|96\n|111\n|-\n|27\n|Kokori\n|\n|\n|\n|606\n|358\n|-\n|28\n|Kojuhovci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,451\n|1,029\n|-\n|29\n|Kremna\n|\n|\n|\n|1,155\n|847\n|-\n|30\n|Kula\u0161i\n|\n|\n|\n|1,234\n|477\n|-\n|31\n|Li\u0161nja\n|\n|\n|\n|1,847\n|891\n|-\n|32\n|Lu\u017eani\n|\n|\n|\n|179\n|209\n|-\n|33\n|Ma\u0107ino Brdo\n|\n|\n|\n|170\n|231\n|-\n|34\n|Mravica\n|\n|\n|\n|548\n|288\n|-\n|35\n|Mra\u010daj\n|\n|\n|\n|219\n|135\n|-\n|36\n|Mujinci\n|\n|\n|\n|260\n|181\n|-\n|37\n|Naseobina Babanovci\n|\n|\n|\n|506\n|673\n|-\n|38\n|Naseobina Li\u0161nja\n|\n|\n|\n|477\n|277\n|-\n|39\n|Naseobina Hrva\u0107ani\n|\n|\n|\n|140\n|73\n|-\n|40\n|Novo Selo\n|\n|\n|\n|168\n|88\n|-\n|41\n|Okolica\n|\n|\n|\n|529\n|824\n|-\n|42\n|Ora\u0161je\n|\n|\n|\n|363\n|169\n|-\n|43\n|Otpo\u010divaljka\n|\n|\n|\n|229\n|124\n|-\n|44\n|Paramije\n|\n|\n|\n|289\n|175\n|-\n|45\n|Pe\u010deneg Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|1,287\n|841\n|-\n|46\n|Popovi\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|951\n|548\n|-\n|47\n|Poto\u010dani\n|\n|\n|\n|597\n|842\n|-\n|48\n|'''Prnjavor'''\n|2,939\n|4,055\n|6,187\n|8,104\n|8,484\n|-\n|49\n|Prosjek\n|\n|\n|\n|476\n|302\n|-\n|50\n|Pura\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|426\n|269\n|-\n|51\n|Ralutinac\n|\n|\n|\n|94\n|48\n|-\n|52\n|Ratkovac\n|\n|\n|\n|349\n|598\n|-\n|53\n|Skakavci\n|\n|\n|\n|365\n|227\n|-\n|54\n|Srpovci\n|\n|\n|\n|305\n|161\n|-\n|55\n|Hrva\u0107ani\n|\n|\n|\n|670\n|405\n|-\n|56\n|Crkvena\n|\n|\n|\n|721\n|468\n|-\n|57\n|\u010civ\u010dije\n|\n|\n|\n|374\n|228\n|-\n|58\n|\u010corle\n|\n|\n|\n|632\n|395\n|-\n|59\n|\u0160arinci\n|\n|\n|\n|862\n|510\n|-\n|60\n|\u0160ereg Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|449\n|306\n|-\n|61\n|\u0160ibovska\n|\n|\n|\n|249\n|232\n|-\n|62\n|\u0160tivor\n|\n|\n|\n|402\n|119<br />\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\nIn the end of the 19th century, during [[Austria-Hungary]], then sparsely populated area of the Municipality of Prnjavor was colonized by settlers from Eastern and Central Europe ([[Ukraine]], [[Italy|Italy (South Tirol)]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[Slovakia]], etc.). At the time of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and due to numerous national minorities (about 20) Prnjavor was called \"Little Europe\". Except the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Bohemians|Czech]] national minorities the others were mainly small communities.

As of 2013, it has a population of 38,399 inhabitants, while the town of Prnjavor has a population of 8,484 inhabitants.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Physical geography ===\nThe Municipality of Prnjavor is located in the basin of the [[Ukrina (river)|Ukrina river]] and is characterized by a mostly lowland hilly terrain configuration with the highest peak of 594m (mountain Ljubi\u0107). The Municipality of Prnjavor is shielded on all sides by low mountains such as Ljubi\u0107 (south) and Motajica (north). The town of Prnjavor is located at an altitude of 185m. As well as the river Ukrina which forms in the Municipality of Prnjavor by murging of Big and Small Ukrina near the village of Kula\u0161i, there are also the rivers of Vijaka and Li\u0161nja and various other streams. On the river Vijaka in the foothills of Ljubi\u0107 there is a man made lake Drenova and farther downstream a fishing ground Ribnjak.\n\n=== Political geography ===\nThe Municipality of Prnjavor is located in the northern part of Republika Srpska between the \u05f344\u00b052N 17\u00b039\u2032E and borders the municipalities of Derventa, Stanari, Tesli\u0107, \u010celinac, Lakta\u0161i and Srbac . The Municipality of Prnjavor is one of the larger municipalities of Republika Srpska, with an area of 629.95 km2. The area of the territory of the Municipality of Prnjavor makes up 2,568% of the total territory of the Republic of Srpska.\n\n=== Climate ===\nThe area of the municipality of Prnjavor belongs to the zone of temperate continental climate with moderately cold winters (average temperature in January \u20131 \u00baC) and moderately warm summers (average temperature in July 31 \u00baC). The average number of total hours of sunshine in the municipality of Prnjavor is 1.600 hours. The average annual rainfall is about 950 mm, and is evenly distributed throughout the year.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Crkva brvnara u Palackovcima.jpg|thumb|274x274px|Wooden church Pala\u010dkovci]]\n[[File:Smoke pipe Sepiolite.JPG|thumb|Smoke pipe made out of [[Sepiolite]] from Prnjavor displayed at [[National Museum of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in [[Sarajevo|Sara]]\n\n[[Sarajevo|jevo]].|275x275px]]\n\n=== Middle ages ===\nEven over 700 years ago people recognized the economic potential of the area of the present-day Municipality of Prnjavor. Although there had been some settlements from the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period here, significant colonization and settlement (including the construction of monasteries, such as the one of at Stuplje) took place only in the [[Middle Age]]s. According to historical sources, medieval monasteries had their landed properties called ''Prnjavori'', and the locals living there were called ''Prnjavorci''. This is believed to be the origin of the name ''Prnjavor''.\n\n=== Ottoman era ===\nDuring the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period the region suffered from border conflicts with the [[Austrian Empire]]. A significant number of [[Bosnians]] converted to Islam after the [[Ottoman conquest of Bosnia|conquest by the Ottoman Empire]] in the second half of the 15th century, giving it a unique character within the [[Balkan]] region. This conversion appears to have been not sudden but a gradual process based on various rules imposed by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] \u2014 it took more than a hundred years for the number of Muslims to become the majority religion. The general view among scholars is that the Islamization of the Bosnian population was not the result of violent methods of conversions but was, for the most part, peaceful and voluntary.\n\nThe first time Prnjavor was mentioned in recorded history was in 1829. The current settlement itself is believed to be of a more recent date. In the mid-19th century and according to the records of the travel writer Juki\u0107, Prnjavor had about a hundred houses and around a thousand inhabitants.\n\n=== Austria-Hungary ===\nIn 1878 [[Austria-Hungary]] occupied [[Bosnia]] and the authorities decided the Prnjavor area was under-populated. Efforts were undertaken to attract settlers from other parts of the empire and consequently the municipal area was settled by [[Italians]], [[Ukrainians]], [[Czechs]], [[Poles]], [[Hungarians]] and German-speaking folk from [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Bohemia]], [[Hungary]] and [[Russia]]. Although over half the population remained [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]], the multi-ethnic character of the population led the municipality of Prnjavor to be nicknamed \"Little Europe\".\n\n=== Yugoslavia ===\nIn 1918 Bosnia became part of [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] and all immigration stopped. During the interwar period between 1918 and 1941 Prnjavor underwent more significant economic development through the opening of craftsman workshops, hotels, more shops and a few manufacturing plants. From 1929 to 1941 Prnjavor was part of the [[Vrbas Banovina]] of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]].\n\nFollowing the collapse of internal security during [[World War II]] the [[Nazis]] decided to evacuate the ''[[Volksdeutsche]]'' (ethnic German) population from [[Bosnia]] and a treaty to this effect was signed with the [[Croatia]]n [[Usta\u0161e]] regime on 30 September 1942. After 1945 the [[Yugoslav Communist Party|Communist]] regime of [[Josip Broz Tito]] repopulated the ''Volksdeutsche'' villages with [[Serbs]] and destroyed or obscured all evidence of German history and heritage in the region.\n\nDuring the [[Socialist]] period of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] Prnjavor was not a highly developed municipality within [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].\n\nAfter the war that erupted after the collapse of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY)]], Prnjavor became part of the North-Eastern entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the [[Republika Srpska]], as per the [[Dayton Agreement]]. The warring that took place in the very proximity of Prnjavor e.g. in [[Derventa]], changed the demography in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], a total of 2,2 million people had to flee their homes from different parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Many people never returned, changing the ethnic composition in all parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n== Demographics ==\n\n=== Population ===\nAccording to the 2013 census results, the municipality has 35,956 inhabitants, while the town of Prnjavor had a population of 7.651 inhabitants.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"7\" |Population of settlements \u2013 Prnjavor municipality\n|-\n|\n|Settlment\n|1961.\n|1971.\n|1981.\n|1991.\n|2013.\n|-\n|\n|Total\n|\n|46,734\n|48,956\n|47,055\n|38,399\n|-\n|1\n|Babanovci\n|\n|\n|\n|398\n|188\n|-\n|2\n|Brezik\n|\n|\n|\n|304\n|125\n|-\n|3\n|Velika Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|1,041\n|699\n|-\n|4\n|Vr\u0161ani\n|\n|\n|\n|722\n|372\n|-\n|5\n|Gajevi\n|\n|\n|\n|191\n|148\n|-\n|6\n|Galjipovci\n|\n|\n|\n|400\n|186\n|-\n|7\n|Gornja Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|1,391\n|754\n|-\n|8\n|Donja Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|782\n|578\n|-\n|9\n|Gornji Vija\u010dani\n|\n|\n|\n|1,074\n|621\n|-\n|10\n|Gornji Galjipovci\n|\n|\n|\n|339\n|250\n|-\n|11\n|Gornji Pala\u010dkovci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,235\n|821\n|-\n|12\n|Gpornji Smrti\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|1,443\n|1,084\n|-\n|13\n|Gornji \u0160trpci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,356\n|1,157\n|-\n|14\n|Grabik Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|839\n|530\n|-\n|15\n|Gusak\n|\n|\n|\n|237\n|179\n|-\n|16\n|Doline\n|\n|\n|\n|193\n|167\n|-\n|17\n|Donja Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|817\n|511\n|-\n|18\n|Donji Vija\u010dani\n|\n|\n|\n|1,700\n|1,195\n|-\n|19\n|Donji Galjipovci\n|\n|\n|\n|426\n|433\n|-\n|20\n|Donji Pala\u010dkovci\n|\n|\n|\n|568\n|359\n|-\n|21\n|Donji Smrti\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|672\n|452\n|-\n|22\n|Donji \u0160trpci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,516\n|1,061\n|-\n|23\n|Drenova\n|\n|\n|\n|864\n|446\n|-\n|24\n|Jadovica\n|\n|\n|\n|93\n|63\n|-\n|25\n|Jasik\n|\n|\n|\n|227\n|282\n|-\n|26\n|Kara\u0107\n|\n|\n|\n|96\n|111\n|-\n|27\n|Kokori\n|\n|\n|\n|606\n|358\n|-\n|28\n|Kojuhovci\n|\n|\n|\n|1,451\n|1,029\n|-\n|29\n|Kremna\n|\n|\n|\n|1,155\n|847\n|-\n|30\n|Kula\u0161i\n|\n|\n|\n|1,234\n|477\n|-\n|31\n|Li\u0161nja\n|\n|\n|\n|1,847\n|891\n|-\n|32\n|Lu\u017eani\n|\n|\n|\n|179\n|209\n|-\n|33\n|Ma\u0107ino Brdo\n|\n|\n|\n|170\n|231\n|-\n|34\n|Mravica\n|\n|\n|\n|548\n|288\n|-\n|35\n|Mra\u010daj\n|\n|\n|\n|219\n|135\n|-\n|36\n|Mujinci\n|\n|\n|\n|260\n|181\n|-\n|37\n|Naseobina Babanovci\n|\n|\n|\n|506\n|673\n|-\n|38\n|Naseobina Li\u0161nja\n|\n|\n|\n|477\n|277\n|-\n|39\n|Naseobina Hrva\u0107ani\n|\n|\n|\n|140\n|73\n|-\n|40\n|Novo Selo\n|\n|\n|\n|168\n|88\n|-\n|41\n|Okolica\n|\n|\n|\n|529\n|824\n|-\n|42\n|Ora\u0161je\n|\n|\n|\n|363\n|169\n|-\n|43\n|Otpo\u010divaljka\n|\n|\n|\n|229\n|124\n|-\n|44\n|Paramije\n|\n|\n|\n|289\n|175\n|-\n|45\n|Pe\u010deneg Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|1,287\n|841\n|-\n|46\n|Popovi\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|951\n|548\n|-\n|47\n|Poto\u010dani\n|\n|\n|\n|597\n|842\n|-\n|48\n|'''Prnjavor'''\n|2,939\n|4,055\n|6,187\n|8,104\n|8,484\n|-\n|49\n|Prosjek\n|\n|\n|\n|476\n|302\n|-\n|50\n|Pura\u0107i\n|\n|\n|\n|426\n|269\n|-\n|51\n|Ralutinac\n|\n|\n|\n|94\n|48\n|-\n|52\n|Ratkovac\n|\n|\n|\n|349\n|598\n|-\n|53\n|Skakavci\n|\n|\n|\n|365\n|227\n|-\n|54\n|Srpovci\n|\n|\n|\n|305\n|161\n|-\n|55\n|Hrva\u0107ani\n|\n|\n|\n|670\n|405\n|-\n|56\n|Crkvena\n|\n|\n|\n|721\n|468\n|-\n|57\n|\u010civ\u010dije\n|\n|\n|\n|374\n|228\n|-\n|58\n|\u010corle\n|\n|\n|\n|632\n|395\n|-\n|59\n|\u0160arinci\n|\n|\n|\n|862\n|510\n|-\n|60\n|\u0160ereg Ilova\n|\n|\n|\n|449\n|306\n|-\n|61\n|\u0160ibovska\n|\n|\n|\n|249\n|232\n|-\n|62\n|\u0160tivor\n|\n|\n|\n|402\n|119<br />\n|}\n\n===Ethnic composition===\nIn the end of the 19th century, during [[Austria-Hungary]], then sparsely populated area of the Municipality of Prnjavor was colonized by settlers from Eastern and Central Europe ([[Ukraine]], [[Italy|Italy (South Tirol)]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Bohemia]], [[Slovakia]], etc.). At the time of the former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] and due to numerous national minorities (about 20) Prnjavor was called \"Little Europe\". Except the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Bohemians|Czech]] national minorities the others were mainly small communities.
