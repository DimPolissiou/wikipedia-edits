It is a fusion of African rhythmic elements and European elements, which reached his peak popularity in the 1940s and 1950s.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=\"FROM MEMPHIS TO KINGSTON\": AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE ORIGIN OF JAMAICAN SKA|journal = Social and Economic Studies|volume = 55|issue = 1/2|last=Kauppila|first=Paul|page=76|jstor = 27866458|year = 2006}}</ref> Mento typically features acoustic instruments, such as [[classical guitar|acoustic guitar]], [[banjo]], [[hand drum]]s, and the [[rhumba box]] \u2014 a large [[mbira]] in the shape of a box that can be sat on while played. The rhumba box carries the [[bass (sound)|bass]] part of the music.\n\nMento is often confused with [[Calypso music|calypso]], a musical form from [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. Although the two share many similarities, they are separate and distinct musical forms. During the mid-20th century, mento was conflated with calypso, and mento was frequently [[metonym|referred]] to as ''calypso'', ''kalypso'' and ''mento calypso.''<ref name=\"Shaping\" /> Mento singers frequently used calypso songs and techniques.  As in calypso, mento uses topical lyrics with a humorous slant, commenting on poverty and other social issues.<ref name=\"Shaping\" /> Sexual innuendos are also common.\n\n==History==\nMento draws on musical traditions brought by [[West Africa|West African]] slaves.<ref name=\"Shaping\">\"[http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20130811/ent/ent5.html Shaping Freedom, Finding Unity - The Power Of Music Displayed In Early Mento]\", ''[[Jamaica Gleaner]]'', 11 August 2013.

Retrieved 6 July 2014</ref>\n\nThe Jamaican mento style has a long history of conflation with Trinidadian [[calypso music|calypso]]. The lyrics of mento songs often deal with aspects of everyday life in a light-hearted and humorous way. Many comment on poverty, poor housing, and other social issues. Thinly veiled sexual references and [[innuendo]] are also common. Mento can be seen as a precursor of some of the movement motifs and themes dealing with such social issues found in modern [[dancehall]]. It became more popular in the late 1940s, with mento performances becoming a common aspect of dances, parties and other events in Jamaica.<ref name=\"Gleaner1407\" />\n\nMajor 1950s mento recording artists include [[Louise Bennett]], [[Count Lasher]], [[Harold Richardson (singer)|Harold Richardson]], [[Lord Flea]], [[Lord Fly]], [[Alerth Bedasse]] with [[Chin's Calypso Sextet]], [[Laurel Aitken]], [[Denzil Laing]], [[Lord Composer]], [[Lord Lebby]], [[Lord Power]], [[Hubert Porter]], and [[Harry Belafonte]], a New Yorker of Jamaican origin. His wildly popular hit records in 1956-1958, including \"[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)]]\" and \"[[Jamaica Farewell]],\" were mento songs sold as calypso. Previously recorded Jamaican versions of many Belafonte's classic \"calypso\" hits can be heard on the ''Jamaica - Mento 1951-1958'' CD released by Fr\u00e9meaux & Associ\u00e9s in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fremeaux.com/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&page=shop.livrets&content_id=5362&product_id=1176&category_id=128 |title=Fr\u00e9meaux & Associ\u00e9s \u00e9diteur, La Librairie Sonore |publisher=Fremeaux.com |date=1932-06-19 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}</ref>\n\nDue in part to Belafonte's popularity, mento became widely conflated with calypso in the 1950s. In a 1957 interview for ''Calypso Star'' magazine, [[Lord Flea]] explained:\n<blockquote>\"In Jamaica, we call our music 'mento' until very recently. Today, 'calypso' is beginning to be used for [[metonym|all kinds of West Indian music]]. This is because it's become so commercialized there. Some people like to think of West Indians as carefree natives who work and sing and play and laugh their lives away. But this isn't so. Most of the people there are hard working folks, and many of them are smart business men. If the tourists want \"calypso\", that's what we sell them.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Michael Garnice|date=11 March 2012|accessdate=15 April 2013|url=http://www.mentomusic.com/flea.htm|title=Mento Music Lord Flea}}</ref></blockquote> \nThis was the golden age of mento, as records pressed by [[Stanley Motta]], [[Ivan Chin,]] [[Ken Khouri]] and others brought the music to a new audience. In the 1960s it became overshadowed by [[ska]] and reggae. Mento is still played in Jamaica, especially in areas frequented by tourists. [[Lloyd Bradley]], reggae historian and author of the seminal reggae book, ''Bass Culture,'' said that [[Lee \"Scratch\" Perry]]\u2019s seminal 1976 [[Dub music|dub]] album, ''[[Super Ape]],'' contained some of the purest mento influences he knew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/mento-reggaes-forgotten-past |title=Mento: Reggae&#039;s Forgotten Past &#124; Clash Music Exclusive Interview |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=2010-07-21 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}</ref> This style of music was revived in popularity by the [[Jolly Boys]] in the late 1980s and early 1990s with the release of four recordings on [[First Warning Records]]/[[Rykodisc]] and a tour that included the [[United States]].<ref name=\"Gleaner1407\" /> [[Stanley Beckford]] and Gilzene and the Blue Light Mento Band also revived rural mento in the 2000s.

In addition, there are 1,460 public radio stations. Most of these stations are run by universities and public authorities for educational purposes and are financed by public or private funds, subscriptions, and corporate underwriting. Much public-radio broadcasting is supplied by [[NPR]] (formerly National Public Radio). NPR was incorporated in February 1970 under the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]]; its television counterpart, [[PBS]], was also created by the same legislation (NPR and PBS are operated separately from each other). {{As of|2014|09|30|df=US}}, there are 15,433 licensed full-power radio stations in the U.S. according to the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC).<ref>{{cite web |last=Waits |first=Jennifer |title=Number of U.S. Radio Stations on the Rise, Especially LPFM, according to New FCC Count |website=Radio Survivor |date=October 17, 2014 |accessdate=January 6, 2015 |url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2014/10/17/number-u-s-radio-stations-rise-especially-lpfm-according-latest-fcc-count/}}</ref>\n\nWell-known newspapers include ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', and ''[[USA Today]]''.<ref name=\"Shaffer2006\">{{cite book |author=Brenda Shaffer |title=The Limits of Culture: Islam and Foreign Policy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEOd-cDWVwQC&pg=PA116 |year=2006 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-19529-4 |page=116}}</ref> Although the cost of publishing has increased over the years, the price of newspapers has generally remained low, forcing newspapers to rely more on advertising revenue and on articles provided by a major wire service, such as the [[Associated Press]] or [[Reuters]], for their national and world coverage. With very few exceptions, all the newspapers in the U.S. are privately owned, either by large chains such as [[Gannett Company|Gannett]] or [[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]], which own dozens or even hundreds of newspapers; by small chains that own a handful of papers; or in a situation that is increasingly rare, by individuals or families. Major cities often have \"alternative weeklies\" to complement the mainstream daily papers, for example, New York City's ''[[The Village Voice]]'' or Los Angeles' ''[[LA Weekly]]'', to name two of the best-known. Major cities may also support a local business journal, trade papers relating to local industries, and papers for local ethnic and social groups. Early versions of the American newspaper [[comic strip]] and the [[American comic book]] began appearing in the 19th century. In 1938, [[Superman]], the comic book [[superhero]] of [[DC Comics]], developed into an American icon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Daniels |first=Les |authorlink=Les Daniels |year=1998 |title=Superman: The Complete History |page=11 |edition=1st |publisher=Titan Books |isbn=978-1-85286-988-5}}</ref> Aside from [[web portal]]s and [[web search engine|search engines]], the most popular websites are [[Facebook]], [[YouTube]], [[Wikipedia]], [[Yahoo!]], [[eBay]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], and [[Twitter]].<ref name=\"alexa-topsitesus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.alexa.com/topsites/countries/US |title=Top Sites in United States |year=2014 |publisher=Alexa |accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMore than 800 publications are produced in Spanish, the second most commonly used language in the United States behind English.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3newspapers.com/usa/spanish |title=Spanish Newspapers in United States |publisher=W3newspapers |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinenewspapers.com/usstate/spanish-language-newspapers-usa.htm |title=Spanish Language Newspapers in the USA : Hispanic Newspapers : Peri\u00f3discos en Espa\u00f1ol en los EE.UU |publisher=Onlinenewspapers.com |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|United States|North America}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Index of United States-related articles]]\n* [[Lists of U.S. state topics]]\n* [[List of regions of the United States]]\n* [[Outline of the United States]]{{-}}\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{notelist\n| colwidth =\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = pop\n| Excludes [[Puerto Rico]] and the other [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated islands]].\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = time\n| See [[Time in the United States]] for details about laws governing time zones in the United States.\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = drive\n| Except the [[United States Virgin Islands|U.S. Virgin Islands]].\n}}\n}}\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |title=Regulating Wall Street: The Dodd-Frank Act and the New Architecture of Global Finance |ref=Acharya10 |first1=Viral V. |last1=Acharya |first2=Thomas F. |last2=Cooley |first3=Matthew P. |last3=Richardson |first4=Ingo |last4=Walter |page=592 |publisher=Wiley |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-470-76877-8}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Half Has Never Been Told: Slavery and the Making of American Capitalism |first1=Edward E. |last1=Baptist|author-link= Edward E.

Meunier, and grew up in [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[China]], mostly in [[Shanghai]]. After the outbreak of [[World War II]], in anticipation of [[Japan]]'s entry into the war, his family moved in 1941 to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and changed their last name to \"Miller\". He was educated at [[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]] in Sydney, where he met his future colleague, [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].<ref name=odyssey>{{cite journal |title=A scientific odyssey: unravelling the secrets of the thymus  |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/183_11_051205/mil10893_fm.html |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |year=2005 |volume=183 |number=11/12 |pages=582\u2013584 |author=Miller, Jacques|doi=10.5694/j.1326-5377.2005.tb00041.x }}</ref>\n\nMiller studied medicine at the [[University of Sydney]], and had his first experience of laboratory research in the laboratory of Professor Patrick de Burgh where he studied virus infection.<ref name=odyssey/>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1958, Miller travelled to the United Kingdom on a Gaggin Research Fellowship from the University of Queensland.

There, with student Graham Mitchell, he discovered that mammalian lymphocytes can be separated into what were later called T cells and B cells, and that these interact to allow normal [[antibody]] production ([[T cell help]]). Miller went on to show that the thymus produces the T cells, that it removes autoreactive T cells (central T cell tolerance) and several other landmark findings in [[immunology]].

Meunier, and grew up in [[France]], [[Switzerland]] and [[China]], mostly in [[Shanghai]]. After the outbreak of [[World War II]], in anticipation of [[Japan]]'s entry into the war, his family moved in 1941 to [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], and changed their last name to \"Miller\". He was educated at [[St Aloysius' College (Sydney)|St Aloysius' College]] in Sydney, where he met his future colleague, [[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]].<ref name=odyssey>{{cite journal |title=A scientific odyssey: unravelling the secrets of the thymus  |url=http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/183_11_051205/mil10893_fm.html |journal=The Medical Journal of Australia |year=2005 |volume=183 |number=11/12 |pages=582\u2013584 |author=Miller, Jacques|doi=10.5694/j.1326-5377.2005.tb00041.x }}</ref>\n\nMiller studied medicine at the [[University of Sydney]], and had his first experience of laboratory research in the laboratory of Professor Patrick de Burgh where he studied virus infection.<ref name=odyssey/>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1958, Miller travelled to the United Kingdom on a Gaggin Research Fellowship from the University of Queensland.

There, with student Graham Mitchell, he discovered that mammalian lymphocytes can be separated into what were later called T cells and B cells, and that these interact to allow normal [[antibody]] production ([[T cell help]]). Miller went on to show that the thymus produces the T cells, that it removes autoreactive T cells (central T cell tolerance) and several other landmark findings in [[immunology]].

The first written descriptions of Maine coast Indians, recorded 100&nbsp;years after European trade contacts began, describe American Indians who lived off the land by hunting, fishing, collecting [[shellfish]], and gathering plants and berries. The [[Abenaki|Wabanaki Indian]]s knew Mount Desert Island as Pemetic, \"the sloping land\". They built bark-covered conical shelters, and traveled in exquisitely designed [[birch bark]] canoes. Historical notes record that the Wabanaki wintered in interior forests and spent their summers near the coast. Archeological evidence suggests the opposite pattern; in order to avoid harsh inland winters and to take advantage of [[salmon]] runs upstream, American Indians wintered on the coast and summered inland.<ref>\n*''Asticou's Island Domain: Wabanaki Peoples at Mount Desert Island 1500\u20132000'', by Harald E.L.

Champlain led an expedition from the [[Saint Croix Island, Maine#St. Croix Settlement|St. Croix Settlement]]. He was tasked with exploring the coast in a [[patache]] with twelve sailors and two American Indian guides. They were in search of a mythical walled and wealthy American Indian city named [[Norumbega]]. On September 6, 1604 the expedition crossed [[Frenchman Bay]] and sailed towards Otter Creek, where smoke could be seen rising from an American Indian encampment. During high tide the ship hit a ledge off Otter Cliff and while repairing a hole two American Indians boarded the ship as guides.<ref name=morison>{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=The Story of Mount Desert Island|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofmountdese00mori|url-access=registration|date=1960|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|location=Boston|pages=[https://archive.org/details/storyofmountdese00mori/page/8 8\u20139]}}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear whether Champlain sailed around the Island or was informed by the guides, but on that day, he wrote in his journal, \"''Le sommet de la plus part d\u2019icelles est desgarny d\u2019arbres parceque ce ne sont que roches.

Saint Sauveur Mountain, overlooking the point, still bears the name of the mission.\n\nThe French missionaries began to build a fort, plant their corn, and baptize the natives. Two months later, on July 2, 1613, Captain [[Samuel Argall]] of the [[Colony of Virginia]] arrived on board the ''Treasurer'' and destroyed their mission.<ref>Acadia National Park, Maine: Significance of St. Sauveur Mission, Established 1613, Mount Desert Island. Washington, D.C.: Office of History and Historic Architecture, Eastern Service Center, National Park Service, November 1970.</ref> Three of the missionaries were killed and three were wounded. The rest of the company, some twenty in all, were taken prisoner. Argall took many of the prisoners to [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. He eventually returned to Saint-Sauveur and cut down the cross the Jesuits had planted, replacing it with a Protestant version. He then set fire to the few buildings that were there.<ref name=\"Griffiths, E 2005. pp. 23-24\">{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=N.E.S.|author-link=Naomi E. S.

There is evidence that [[Claude de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour|Claude de La Tour]] immediately challenged the English action by re-establishing a fur-trading post in the nearby village of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] in the wake of Argall's raid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=N.E.S.|author-link=Naomi E.

In 1688, [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], an ambitious young man who had immigrated to New France and bestowed upon himself the title ''sieur de Cadillac'', asked for and received {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} of land along the Maine coast, including all of Mount Desert. Cadillac's hopes of establishing a feudal estate in the New World, however, were short-lived. Although he and his bride resided here for a time, they soon abandoned their enterprise. Cadillac later gained lasting recognition as the founder of [[Detroit]]. The island's highest point, at {{convert|1528|ft}} the highest point on the eastern seaboard of the [[United States]], bears the name [[Cadillac Mountain]], and is notable for the fact that its summit is among the first points in the United States touched by the rays of the rising sun.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=6820 |name=Katahdin, Maine |accessdate=June 16, 2010}} Analysis by Blanton C. Wiggin, published in the January 1972 issue of ''[[Yankee (magazine)|Yankee]]'' magazine, determined that the first sunrise in the U.S. occurs at [[Cadillac Mountain]] in the fall and winter, from October 7 to March 6.</ref>\n\n====Raid on Acadia (1704)====\n[[File:Mount Desert Island, Maine.jpg|thumb|Shorefront at evening]]\nDuring much of the seventeenth century, nearby [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] was the most southern settlement of Acadia. ([[Bristol, Maine]], was the most northern New England settlement.) No one settled in this contested territory, and for the next 150&nbsp;years Mount Desert Island's importance was primarily its use as a landmark for seamen, as for example when [[John Winthrop]], first governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], sketched the island's mountains on his voyage to the New World.\n\nDuring [[Queen Anne's War]], in response to the French [[Raid on Deerfield]], New Englander Major [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] raided the Acadian village of Castine before gathering at Mount Desert Island with other ships to continue with the Raid on [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], [[Raid on Grand Pr\u00e9]], the [[Military history of the Mi'kmaq people#Raids on Piziquid (Fort Edward)|Raid on Piziquid]], and the Raid on [[Isthmus of Chignecto|Chignecto]].<ref>Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake.

Benjamin Church.'' p. 261</ref>\n\n===British colony===\nIn 1759, after a century and a half of conflict, British troops triumphed in [[Quebec]], ending French dominion in [[Acadia]]. With Indians scattered and the [[fleur-de-lis]] banished, lands along the Maine coast opened for English settlement. Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] of Massachusetts obtained a royal land grant on Mount Desert Island.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1760, Bernard attempted to secure his claim by offering free land to settlers. [[Abraham Somes]] and James Richardson accepted the offer and settled their families at what is now Somesville.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===American Revolution===\nThe onset of the [[American Revolutionary War]] ended Bernard's plans for Mount Desert Island. In its aftermath, Bernard, who had sided with the British government, lost his claim. Massachusetts, now free of British rule, granted the western half of Mount Desert Island to John Bernard, son of the governor, who, unlike his father, sided with the rebels. The eastern half of the island was granted to Marie Therese de&nbsp;Gregoire, granddaughter of Cadillac. Bernard and de&nbsp;Gregoire soon sold their landholdings to nonresident landlords.\n\nTheir real estate transactions probably made very little difference to the increasing number of settlers homesteading on Mount Desert Island. By 1820, when Maine separated from Massachusetts and became a separate state, farming and lumbering vied with fishing and shipbuilding as major occupations. Settlers converted hundreds of acres of trees into wood products ranging from [[schooner]]s and barns to baby cribs and hand tools. Farmers harvested wheat, rye, corn, and potatoes. By 1850, the familiar sights of fishermen and sailors, fish racks and [[shipyard]]s, revealed a way of life linked to the sea. [[Quarry]]ing of [[granite]], which could be cut from hills close to deep water anchorage for shipment to major cities on the east coast, was also a major industry.\n\n==Rusticators==\nIt was the outsiders, artists, and journalists, who revealed and popularized this island to the world in the mid 19th&nbsp;century. Painters of the [[Hudson River School]], including [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederic Church]], glorified Mount Desert Island with their brushstrokes, inspiring patrons and friends to flock here. These were the \"rusticators\". Undaunted by crude accommodations and simple food, they sought out local fishermen and farmers to put them up for a modest fee. Summer after summer, the rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and, most of all, to savor the fresh salt air, scenery, and relaxed pace. Soon the villagers' cottages and fishermen's huts filled to overflowing, and by 1880, 30&nbsp;hotels competed for vacationers' dollars. Tourism was becoming the major industry.\n\nFor a select handful of Americans, the 1880s and the \"Gay Nineties\" meant affluence on a scale without precedent. Mount Desert, still remote from the cities of the East, became a retreat for prominent people of the time. The [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], [[J. P. Morgan|Morgan]]s, [[Ford family tree|Fords]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegies]], and [[Astor family|Astors]] chose to spend their summers here. Not content with the simple lodgings then available, these families transformed the landscape of Mount Desert Island with elegant estates, called \"cottages\". The landscape architect [[Beatrix Farrand]], at the Cadwalder Rawle - Rhinelander Jones family summer home [[Reef Point Estate]], designed the gardens for many of these people. Projects included the Chinese-inspired garden at \"The Eyrie\" for [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]] at [[Seal Harbor, Maine|Seal Harbor]] (1926\u201335), and the planting plans for subtle roads at [[Acadia National Park]] sponsored by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] (c.1930).<ref>Nolan, David, ''Beatrix. The Gardening Life of Beatrix Farrand, 1872\u20131959''. Viking, Penguin Group, 1995. {{ISBN|0-670-83217-0}}. pp. 208</ref> Luxury, refinement, and ostentatious gatherings replaced buckboard rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of an earlier era. Some rusticators also formed \"Village Improvement Societies\" which constructed hiking trails and walking paths connecting the Island's villages to its interior mountains. For over 40&nbsp;years, the wealthy held sway at Mount Desert, but the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] marked the end of such extravagance. The final blow came in 1947 when a fire of monumental proportions consumed many of the great estates.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Somes' Hotel, by John D. Heywood.jpg|Somes' Hotel c. 1870, [[John D. Heywood]]\nFile:Rock Inn, Northeast Harbor, ME.jpg|Rock Inn, Northeast Harbor c. 1908\nFile:Seal Harbor Mount Desert Island.JPG|Seal Harbor Yacht Club\n</gallery>\n\n==Acadia National Park==\nIn 1901, [[George Dorr|George B. Dorr]], disturbed by the growing development of the Bar Harbor area and the dangers he foresaw in the newly invented gasoline-powered portable sawmill, established along with others the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations. The corporation, whose sole purpose was to preserve land for the perpetual use of the public, acquired {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} by 1913. Dorr offered the land to the federal government, and in 1916, President Wilson announced the creation of Sieur de&nbsp;Monts National Monument. Dorr continued to acquire property and renewed his efforts to obtain full national park status for his beloved preserve. In 1919, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed the act establishing Lafayette National Park, the first national park east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. Dorr, whose labors constituted \"the greatest of one-man shows in the history of land conservation\", became the first park superintendent. In 1929, the park name was changed to [[Acadia National Park]].\n\n[[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] endowed the park with much of its land area. Like many rusticators, Rockefeller, whose family fortune was derived from the petroleum industry, wanted to keep the island free of automobiles, but local governments allowed the entry of automobiles on the island's roads. Rockefeller constructed about {{convert|50|mi|-1}} of carriage roads around the eastern half of the island. These roads were closed to automobiles and included several vistas and stone bridges. About {{convert|40|mi}} of these roads are within Acadia National Park and open only to hikers, bicyclists, horseback riders, horse-drawn carriages and cross country skiers.\n\nIn 1950, [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] and [[Grace Frick]] bought a house, \"Petite Plaisance\", in [[Northeast Harbor]] on the island. Yourcenar wrote a large part of her novel ''[[Memoires d'Hadrien]]'' on the island, and she died there in 1987.<ref>George Rousseau, \"Yourcenar\", 2004.</ref> Their house is now a museum. Both ladies were cremated and their ashes are buried in the Brookside Cemetery in [[Somesville]].\n\nIn 1969, [[College of the Atlantic]], the island's first and only institution of higher education, was established in Bar Harbor.\n\nIn 1986, [[Friends of Acadia]], the nonprofit organization that directs private philanthropy and volunteerism for the benefit of Acadia National Park, was founded.\n\n[[File:Mt Penobscot summit.jpg|thumb|300px|View from the summit of Mt.

The earliest formation on the island is the Ellsworth Schist Formation, which was a sea-floor mud deposit created during the [[Cambrian]] period by volcanic ash. During the [[Ordovician]] period, the [[Acadian orogeny]] \u2014 the collision of [[Laurentia]], [[Gondwanaland]], and [[Avalonia]] \u2014 caused the formation to fold, thrust, and lift above sea level, where later layers were eroded away and the schist was exposed. The Bar Harbor Formation, which is made up predominantly of sands and silts, and Cranberry Island Formation, made up from volcanic ash and magmatic debris, occurred under similar circumstances in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, and were deposited on top of the Ellsworth Schist. However, due to less tectonic activity at that time, their deformation was less severe.<ref>Gilman, R.A., Chapman, C.A., Lowell, T.V., and Borns, H.W., 1988, Summary of the Bedrock Geologic History of Mount Desert Island, ''in'' The geology of Mount Desert Island: Augusta, Maine Geological Survey Bulletin 38.</ref>\n\nQuarrying of granite was historically an important industry.  [[Orogenic]] activity during the Devonian period gave Mount Desert Island three [[granite]] units: the Cadillac Mountain granite, the fine-grained Somesville granite, and the medium-grained Somesville granite. Surrounding these granites (labeled \"DCg\" on geologic maps) is a zone of [[breccia]]ted material, known as DSz (Devonian Shatter Zone).<ref>Wiebe, R.A.: \"Silicic magma chambers as traps for basaltic magmas: the Cadillac Mountain Intrusive Complex, Mount Desert Island\", ''Journal of Geology'', 1994.</ref>\n\nMost recently, Mount Desert Island was host to the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] as it extended and receded during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. The glacier left visible marks upon the landscape, such as Bubble Rock, a [[glacial erratic]] carried {{convert|19|mi}} by the ice sheet from a Lucerne granite outcrop and deposited precariously on the side of South Bubble Mountain in [[Acadia National Park]]. Other examples are the [[moraine]]s deposited at the southern ends of many of the glacier-carved valleys on the Island such as the Jordan Pond valley, indicating the extent of the glacier; and the beach sediments in a regressional sequence beneath and around Jordan Pond, indicating the rebound of the continent after the glacier's recession about 25,000 years ago.<ref>Gilman, R.A., Chapman, C.A., Lowell, T.V., and Borns, H.W., 1988, \"Shaping of the Landscape by Glacial Erosion\", ''The Geology of Mount Desert Island''.

The first written descriptions of Maine coast Indians, recorded 100&nbsp;years after European trade contacts began, describe American Indians who lived off the land by hunting, fishing, collecting [[shellfish]], and gathering plants and berries. The [[Abenaki|Wabanaki Indian]]s knew Mount Desert Island as Pemetic, \"the sloping land\". They built bark-covered conical shelters, and traveled in exquisitely designed [[birch bark]] canoes. Historical notes record that the Wabanaki wintered in interior forests and spent their summers near the coast. Archeological evidence suggests the opposite pattern; in order to avoid harsh inland winters and to take advantage of [[salmon]] runs upstream, American Indians wintered on the coast and summered inland.<ref>\n*''Asticou's Island Domain: Wabanaki Peoples at Mount Desert Island 1500\u20132000'', by Harald E.L.

Champlain led an expedition from the [[Saint Croix Island, Maine#St. Croix Settlement|St. Croix Settlement]]. He was tasked with exploring the coast in a [[patache]] with twelve sailors and two American Indian guides. They were in search of a mythical walled and wealthy American Indian city named [[Norumbega]]. On September 6, 1604 the expedition crossed [[Frenchman Bay]] and sailed towards Otter Creek, where smoke could be seen rising from an American Indian encampment. During high tide the ship hit a ledge off Otter Cliff and while repairing a hole two American Indians boarded the ship as guides.<ref name=morison>{{cite book|last1=Morison|first1=Samuel Eliot|title=The Story of Mount Desert Island|url=https://archive.org/details/storyofmountdese00mori|url-access=registration|date=1960|publisher=Little, Brown & Company|location=Boston|pages=[https://archive.org/details/storyofmountdese00mori/page/8 8\u20139]}}</ref>\n\nIt is not clear whether Champlain sailed around the Island or was informed by the guides, but on that day, he wrote in his journal, \"''Le sommet de la plus part d\u2019icelles est desgarny d\u2019arbres parceque ce ne sont que roches.

Saint Sauveur Mountain, overlooking the point, still bears the name of the mission.\n\nThe French missionaries began to build a fort, plant their corn, and baptize the natives. Two months later, on July 2, 1613, Captain [[Samuel Argall]] of the [[Colony of Virginia]] arrived on board the ''Treasurer'' and destroyed their mission.<ref>Acadia National Park, Maine: Significance of St. Sauveur Mission, Established 1613, Mount Desert Island. Washington, D.C.: Office of History and Historic Architecture, Eastern Service Center, National Park Service, November 1970.</ref> Three of the missionaries were killed and three were wounded. The rest of the company, some twenty in all, were taken prisoner. Argall took many of the prisoners to [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. He eventually returned to Saint-Sauveur and cut down the cross the Jesuits had planted, replacing it with a Protestant version. He then set fire to the few buildings that were there.<ref name=\"Griffiths, E 2005. pp. 23-24\">{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=N.E.S.|author-link=Naomi E. S.

There is evidence that [[Claude de Saint-\u00c9tienne de la Tour|Claude de La Tour]] immediately challenged the English action by re-establishing a fur-trading post in the nearby village of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] in the wake of Argall's raid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=N.E.S.|author-link=Naomi E.

In 1688, [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]], an ambitious young man who had immigrated to New France and bestowed upon himself the title ''sieur de Cadillac'', asked for and received {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} of land along the Maine coast, including all of Mount Desert. Cadillac's hopes of establishing a feudal estate in the New World, however, were short-lived. Although he and his bride resided here for a time, they soon abandoned their enterprise. Cadillac later gained lasting recognition as the founder of [[Detroit]]. The island's highest point, at {{convert|1528|ft}} the highest point on the eastern seaboard of the [[United States]], bears the name [[Cadillac Mountain]], and is notable for the fact that its summit is among the first points in the United States touched by the rays of the rising sun.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=6820 |name=Katahdin, Maine |accessdate=June 16, 2010}} Analysis by Blanton C. Wiggin, published in the January 1972 issue of ''[[Yankee (magazine)|Yankee]]'' magazine, determined that the first sunrise in the U.S. occurs at [[Cadillac Mountain]] in the fall and winter, from October 7 to March 6.</ref>\n\n====Raid on Acadia (1704)====\n[[File:Mount Desert Island, Maine.jpg|thumb|Shorefront at evening]]\nDuring much of the seventeenth century, nearby [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] was the most southern settlement of Acadia. ([[Bristol, Maine]], was the most northern New England settlement.) No one settled in this contested territory, and for the next 150&nbsp;years Mount Desert Island's importance was primarily its use as a landmark for seamen, as for example when [[John Winthrop]], first governor of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], sketched the island's mountains on his voyage to the New World.\n\nDuring [[Queen Anne's War]], in response to the French [[Raid on Deerfield]], New Englander Major [[Benjamin Church (ranger)|Benjamin Church]] raided the Acadian village of Castine before gathering at Mount Desert Island with other ships to continue with the Raid on [[St. Stephen, New Brunswick|St. Stephen]], [[Raid on Grand Pr\u00e9]], the [[Military history of the Mi'kmaq people#Raids on Piziquid (Fort Edward)|Raid on Piziquid]], and the Raid on [[Isthmus of Chignecto|Chignecto]].<ref>Benjamin Church, Thomas Church, Samuel Gardner Drake.

Benjamin Church.'' p. 261</ref>\n\n===British colony===\nIn 1759, after a century and a half of conflict, British troops triumphed in [[Quebec]], ending French dominion in [[Acadia]]. With Indians scattered and the [[fleur-de-lis]] banished, lands along the Maine coast opened for English settlement. Governor [[Sir Francis Bernard, 1st Baronet|Francis Bernard]] of Massachusetts obtained a royal land grant on Mount Desert Island.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} In 1760, Bernard attempted to secure his claim by offering free land to settlers. [[Abraham Somes]] and James Richardson accepted the offer and settled their families at what is now Somesville.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n===American Revolution===\nThe onset of the [[American Revolutionary War]] ended Bernard's plans for Mount Desert Island. In its aftermath, Bernard, who had sided with the British government, lost his claim. Massachusetts, now free of British rule, granted the western half of Mount Desert Island to John Bernard, son of the governor, who, unlike his father, sided with the rebels. The eastern half of the island was granted to Marie Therese de&nbsp;Gregoire, granddaughter of Cadillac. Bernard and de&nbsp;Gregoire soon sold their landholdings to nonresident landlords.\n\nTheir real estate transactions probably made very little difference to the increasing number of settlers homesteading on Mount Desert Island. By 1820, when Maine separated from Massachusetts and became a separate state, farming and lumbering vied with fishing and shipbuilding as major occupations. Settlers converted hundreds of acres of trees into wood products ranging from [[schooner]]s and barns to baby cribs and hand tools. Farmers harvested wheat, rye, corn, and potatoes. By 1850, the familiar sights of fishermen and sailors, fish racks and [[shipyard]]s, revealed a way of life linked to the sea. [[Quarry]]ing of [[granite]], which could be cut from hills close to deep water anchorage for shipment to major cities on the east coast, was also a major industry.\n\n==Rusticators==\nIt was the outsiders, artists, and journalists, who revealed and popularized this island to the world in the mid 19th&nbsp;century. Painters of the [[Hudson River School]], including [[Thomas Cole]] and [[Frederic Church]], glorified Mount Desert Island with their brushstrokes, inspiring patrons and friends to flock here. These were the \"rusticators\". Undaunted by crude accommodations and simple food, they sought out local fishermen and farmers to put them up for a modest fee. Summer after summer, the rusticators returned to renew friendships with local islanders and, most of all, to savor the fresh salt air, scenery, and relaxed pace. Soon the villagers' cottages and fishermen's huts filled to overflowing, and by 1880, 30&nbsp;hotels competed for vacationers' dollars. Tourism was becoming the major industry.\n\nFor a select handful of Americans, the 1880s and the \"Gay Nineties\" meant affluence on a scale without precedent. Mount Desert, still remote from the cities of the East, became a retreat for prominent people of the time. The [[Rockefeller family|Rockefellers]], [[J. P. Morgan|Morgan]]s, [[Ford family tree|Fords]], [[Vanderbilt family|Vanderbilts]], [[Andrew Carnegie|Carnegies]], and [[Astor family|Astors]] chose to spend their summers here. Not content with the simple lodgings then available, these families transformed the landscape of Mount Desert Island with elegant estates, called \"cottages\". The landscape architect [[Beatrix Farrand]], at the Cadwalder Rawle - Rhinelander Jones family summer home [[Reef Point Estate]], designed the gardens for many of these people. Projects included the Chinese-inspired garden at \"The Eyrie\" for [[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]] at [[Seal Harbor, Maine|Seal Harbor]] (1926\u201335), and the planting plans for subtle roads at [[Acadia National Park]] sponsored by [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] (c.1930).<ref>Nolan, David, ''Beatrix. The Gardening Life of Beatrix Farrand, 1872\u20131959''. Viking, Penguin Group, 1995. {{ISBN|0-670-83217-0}}. pp. 208</ref> Luxury, refinement, and ostentatious gatherings replaced buckboard rides, picnics, and day-long hikes of an earlier era. Some rusticators also formed \"Village Improvement Societies\" which constructed hiking trails and walking paths connecting the Island's villages to its interior mountains. For over 40&nbsp;years, the wealthy held sway at Mount Desert, but the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]] marked the end of such extravagance. The final blow came in 1947 when a fire of monumental proportions consumed many of the great estates.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Somes' Hotel, by John D. Heywood.jpg|Somes' Hotel c. 1870, [[John D.

Dorr]], disturbed by the growing development of the Bar Harbor area and the dangers he foresaw in the newly invented gasoline-powered portable sawmill, established along with others the Hancock County Trustees of Public Reservations. The corporation, whose sole purpose was to preserve land for the perpetual use of the public, acquired {{convert|6000|acre|km2}} by 1913. Dorr offered the land to the federal government, and in 1916, President Wilson announced the creation of Sieur de&nbsp;Monts National Monument. Dorr continued to acquire property and renewed his efforts to obtain full national park status for his beloved preserve. In 1919, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed the act establishing Lafayette National Park, the first national park east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. Dorr, whose labors constituted \"the greatest of one-man shows in the history of land conservation\", became the first park superintendent. In 1929, the park name was changed to [[Acadia National Park]].\n\n[[John D. Rockefeller Jr.]] endowed the park with much of its land area. Like many rusticators, Rockefeller, whose family fortune was derived from the petroleum industry, wanted to keep the island free of automobiles, but local governments allowed the entry of automobiles on the island's roads. Rockefeller constructed about {{convert|50|mi|-1}} of carriage roads around the eastern half of the island. These roads were closed to automobiles and included several vistas and stone bridges. About {{convert|40|mi}} of these roads are within Acadia National Park and open only to hikers, bicyclists, horseback riders, horse-drawn carriages and cross country skiers.\n\nIn 1950, [[Marguerite Yourcenar]] and [[Grace Frick]] bought a house, \"Petite Plaisance\", in [[Northeast Harbor]] on the island. Yourcenar wrote a large part of her novel ''[[Memoires d'Hadrien]]'' on the island, and she died there in 1987.<ref>George Rousseau, \"Yourcenar\", 2004.</ref> Their house is now a museum. Both ladies were cremated and their ashes are buried in the Brookside Cemetery in [[Somesville]].\n\nIn 1969, [[College of the Atlantic]], the island's first and only institution of higher education, was established in Bar Harbor.\n\nIn 1986, Friends of Acadia, the nonprofit organization that directs private philanthropy and volunteerism for the benefit of Acadia National Park, was founded.\n\n[[File:Mt Penobscot summit.jpg|thumb|300px|View from the summit of Mt.

The earliest formation on the island is the Ellsworth Schist Formation, which was a sea-floor mud deposit created during the [[Cambrian]] period by volcanic ash. During the [[Ordovician]] period, the [[Acadian orogeny]] \u2014 the collision of [[Laurentia]], [[Gondwanaland]], and [[Avalonia]] \u2014 caused the formation to fold, thrust, and lift above sea level, where later layers were eroded away and the schist was exposed. The Bar Harbor Formation, which is made up predominantly of sands and silts, and Cranberry Island Formation, made up from volcanic ash and magmatic debris, occurred under similar circumstances in the [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] periods, and were deposited on top of the Ellsworth Schist. However, due to less tectonic activity at that time, their deformation was less severe.<ref>Gilman, R.A., Chapman, C.A., Lowell, T.V., and Borns, H.W., 1988, Summary of the Bedrock Geologic History of Mount Desert Island, ''in'' The geology of Mount Desert Island: Augusta, Maine Geological Survey Bulletin 38.</ref>\n\nQuarrying of granite was historically an important industry.  [[Orogenic]] activity during the Devonian period gave Mount Desert Island three [[granite]] units: the Cadillac Mountain granite, the fine-grained Somesville granite, and the medium-grained Somesville granite. Surrounding these granites (labeled \"DCg\" on geologic maps) is a zone of [[breccia]]ted material, known as DSz (Devonian Shatter Zone).<ref>Wiebe, R.A.: \"Silicic magma chambers as traps for basaltic magmas: the Cadillac Mountain Intrusive Complex, Mount Desert Island\", ''Journal of Geology'', 1994.</ref>\n\nMost recently, Mount Desert Island was host to the [[Laurentide Ice Sheet]] as it extended and receded during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. The glacier left visible marks upon the landscape, such as Bubble Rock, a [[glacial erratic]] carried {{convert|19|mi}} by the ice sheet from a Lucerne granite outcrop and deposited precariously on the side of South Bubble Mountain in [[Acadia National Park]]. Other examples are the [[moraine]]s deposited at the southern ends of many of the glacier-carved valleys on the Island such as the Jordan Pond valley, indicating the extent of the glacier; and the beach sediments in a regressional sequence beneath and around Jordan Pond, indicating the rebound of the continent after the glacier's recession about 25,000 years ago.<ref>Gilman, R.A., Chapman, C.A., Lowell, T.V., and Borns, H.W., 1988, \"Shaping of the Landscape by Glacial Erosion\", ''The Geology of Mount Desert Island''.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 14.8\n|Feb record high C =

donation document to the Patershausen monastery as ''Dicenbah''. The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449.

As with town council itself, there is a foreigners\u2019 advisory council session, which takes place a fortnight before the town council session.\n\nThe current chairman is since November 2015 Cengiz Hendek.\n\n=== Coat of arms and flag ===\nThe town\u2019s [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Gules a bend argent surmounted by a bend wavy azure, the whole between two bunches of grapes Or, each with two leaves vert.\n\nThe grapes refer to the town\u2019s winegrowing tradition, which came to an end in the 18th century but was revived in the 1960s on the Wingertsberg. The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route. Dietzenbach moreover has at its disposal its own town bus network with a central bus station at the ''Dietzenbach Mitte'' S-Bahn station. Bus lines which cross Dietzenbach are the town lines OF-56 and 57, the county lines OF95, 96, 97 and 99 as well as night line n71. ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]'' 459, the [[Autobahn]]en [[Bundesautobahn 3|A&nbsp;3]] and  [[Bundesautobahn 661|A&nbsp;661]] can be reached in a few minutes through the Offenbach [[interchange (road)|interchange]].\n\n== Culture ==\n\n=== Festival ===\nEach year in Dietzenbach, the following festivals offer a chance to pursue social contacts:\n* ''Apfelbl\u00fctenfest'' is being held in April.\n* ''Fest ohne Grenzen'' (\u201cFestival Without Borders\u201d), held at the Hessentagspark\n* ''Fest der Biere'' (\u201cFestival of Beers\u201d), held at the Harmonieplatz, lasts five days\n* ''Weinfest'' in the New Town Centre, runs ten days\n* ''Nacht der Lichter''(\u201cNight of the Lights\u201d)with \"Museumsnacht\" and \"Heimatfest\" held in the Old Town Centre\n* ''Trinkbornfest'' in the Old Town on the first weekend in September\n* ''Dietzenbacher Kelterfest'' about the \"\u00c4bbelwoi\" and the making of it\n* ''Kerb'' or ''[[Kirchweih]]'', always held on the last weekend in October. It stretches along Landwehrstra\u00dfe from Harmonieplatz to the Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-Schule (school). The revived tradition of the ''Kerbborsche'' \u2013 a group of young men who perform part of the ceremony<!--Perhaps someone can find out what part.

Before the [[Second World War]], the current town was a farming village with not quite 4,000 inhabitants. However, after the war, there was a considerable upswing in the population due to refugees settling in the community. From the 1970s onwards, Dietzenbach's population rose rapidly, reaching some 33,000 by 2006. Just under a third of the inhabitants have roots in more than a hundred nations outside Germany. Agricultural buildings are nowadays seldom seen in Dietzenbach.\n\nIn 2001, Dietzenbach hosted the 41st [[Hessentag]] state festival.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Neighbouring communities ===\nDietzenbach borders in the north on the town of [[Heusenstamm]], in the east on the town of [[Rodgau]], in the south on the town of [[R\u00f6dermark]] and in the west on the town of [[Dreieich]].\n\n=== Constituent communities ===\nThe town of Dietzenbach is made up of a number of ''[[Ortsteil|Stadtteile]]'', although not all places listed here have this official designation.\n\n==== Steinberg ====\nSteinberg is a constituent community. Parts of the north industrial area are found here, as well as daycare centres (''Kindertagesst\u00e4tten'') 3,5 and 11, the Siedlerstra\u00dfe Seniors\u2019 Centre and four schools: ''Astrid-Lindgren-Schule'' ([[primary school]]), ''Regenbogenschule'' (primary school), ''Helen-Keller-Schule'' (special school) and ''Heinrich-Mann-Schule'' (co\u00f6perative [[comprehensive school]] with [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] upper level). Furthermore, there is a sporting ground on Limesstra\u00dfe. In the centre is the Steinberg Shopping Centre. Just under 12,000 people live in Steinberg.\n\n==== Neue Stadtmitte ====\nBetween Steinberg and the old town centre, a new building area has sprung up over the years, in whose centre the town administration and Dietzenbach's community centre have settled. It is known as the ''Neue Stadtmitte'' \u2013 the New Town Centre.\n\nBefore this, the most prominent feature was a [[shopping centre]] with a big [[supermarket]], filling station and carpark, which the locals over time came to see as an [[eyesore]] for its rather unappealing 1970s architecture and the company's neglect of the building.\n\nSales dealings kept delaying any new development. Finally, in late 2005, agreements between the town and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Ten Brinke Group were signed.\n\nAfter the old toom<!--That\u2019s meant to be in lowercase; don\u2019t change it.--> Markt closed in mid-2005, the whole building complex was torn down in autumn 2006 to make way for a new shopping centre. The foundation stone was laid on 4 December 2006, and on 29 November 2007, the shopping centre opened, and was given the name ''Rathaus-Center''.\n\nThe Ten Brinke Group, the \u20ac37,500,000 project's investor, built a 230&nbsp;m-long and 101&nbsp;m broad building in which are found, on 8&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a toom Markt, and on 4&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 a [[Media Markt|Media-Markt]]. The rest of the 21&nbsp;000&nbsp;m\u00b2 is shared among [[C&A]] (1&nbsp;600&nbsp;m\u00b2), [[Heinrich Deichmann-Schuhe GmbH|Deichmann]] (two units of 500&nbsp;m\u00b2 each), the clothing chain Ernsting's Family (200&nbsp;m\u00b2), other shops and various catering businesses.\n\n==== Hexenberg ====\nHexenberg, whose name is [[German language|German]] for \u201cWitches\u2019 Mountain\u201d, is a constituent community. It is named after the highest elevation in Offenbach district. The buildings are mostly relatively low one-family and multiple-family dwellings as well as a few smaller shops in the middle of the community.\n\n==== Wingertsberg ====\nWingertsberg (called '''''der''' Wingertsberg'' in German) is not a constituent community as such, but rather a residential neighbourhood lying on a slope across from the Old Town. At the upper end of the neighbourhood are found, besides a sporting ground, a restaurant with a viewing terrace and the lookout tower built for the ''Hessentag'' state festival, from which it is possible to see Frankfurt.\n\n==== Altstadt ====\nIn Dietzenbach\u2019s Old Town, many [[Timber framing|timber-frame]] houses have been preserved. Besides these, the Old Town is where the local history museum, the town library and the police station are to be found.\n\n==== Spessartviertel (formerly Starkenburgring) ====\nThis constituent community, which borders right on the Old Town, is a neighbourhood built up with nothing but highrises. Originally planned as an upscale neighbourhood, social problems and the crime arising therefrom have brought the town and the surrounding area greater challenges than ever. Today, roughly 90% of the inhabitants have an immigration background. Most come from Turkey, Morocco, Afghanistan, Pakistan or various African countries.<!--This is queried on de:WP (\u201cQuelle ??\u201d), perhaps because one editor thought it was an anti-immigrant rant. Keep watching.-->\n\n==== Climate ====\nThe whole city and the surrounding cities and villages experience a dominant [[Seasonal tropical forest|seasonal tropical forest climate]]. Daily in the afternoon, there's a one-hour monsoon-like rainfall. The number of sunshine hours is high, and the annual temperature is at around 72 degrees Fahrenheit (22 degrees Celsius). This [[Tropical climate|climate]] is still very rare in Hesse and establishes itself by a free self-rearrangement of nature.\n\nThe vegetation is similar to the rest of Germany. Dietzenbach is surrounded by cozy [[Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe|beech forests]], which cover about 42% of the state of Hesse, making it the greenest state in Germany. The forests and rangelands are home to several [[Flora and fauna of Germany|midwest-European animal and mixed plant species]]. One of them is the apple tree, which is used to produce the regional famous [[Apfelwein|Hessian apple wine or cider]], as well as the wine grape, from which local [[wine]] is made by. The grape has a long traditional meaning in Dietzenbach and is therefore also seen on the coat of arms of the city. Besides that, [[Tropical vegetation|tropical plants]] can be found in the whole regions throughout the climate area. Therefore in many gardens [[Arecaceae|palm trees]], [[Banana|banana trees]], [[citrus]] fruits, [[Coffea|coffee]], and many other plants from all over the world can be found growing.\nDietzenbach falls under the [[USDA]] 10 Plant [[Hardiness zone]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Dietzenbach 2020-present\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 14.8\n|Feb record high C =

The later forsaken settlements of Ippingshausen and Richolshausen lay within what are now Dietzenbach\u2019s limits in the Early [[Middle Ages]].\n\nIn 1545, the Counts of [[Hanau]], who had been Dietzenbach\u2019s lords for a few centuries, introduced [[Protestantism]]. When the Counts of Hanau died out in 1736, the Landgraves [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt|Hesse-Darmstadt]] and of [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] fought over who had the right to be Dietzenbach\u2019s lords.\n\nThe ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Amt]]'' of [[Schaafheim]], with Dietzenbach, which lay within it, passed in 1773 to Hesse-Darmstadt. With the partition of the [[R\u00f6dermark]] in 1818, the community acquired its forest. In 1821, the ''Amt'' of Schaafheim was dissolved and Dietzenbach passed to the ''Landratsbezirk'' of [[Langen, Hesse|Langen]]. However, by 1832 Dietzenbach had already been assigned to the district of Offenbach.\n\nIn 1898, the [[railway]] through [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]], Bieber and Heusenstamm to Dietzenbach was dedicated and the [[railway station]] was built, which is now once again in use, after many years of seeing no passenger service at all, by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn]]. The line underwent an extensive modernization for S-Bahn operation.\n\nA British air raid in 1941 caused great damage in the community.\n\nDietzenbach was granted town rights in 1971. Since 2002, Dietzenbach has also been administrative seat of the district of Offenbach. However, it was only officially allowed to use the designation ''Kreisstadt'' (\u201cDistrict Seat\u201d) beginning in March 2003 as the result of a dispute with the neighbouring town of Rodgau, which had demanded this status on the grounds that it had a greater population.\n\n== Population development ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  align=\"right\"\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Year\n! class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\" | Inhabitants\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2009\n| align=right valign=top|33,224\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2007\n| align=right valign=top|34,773\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|2005\n| align=right valign=top|34,794\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1997\n| align=right valign=top|33,015\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1983\n| align=right valign=top|25,500\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1970\n| align=right valign=top|12,449\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1961\n| align=right valign=top|6,303\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1950\n| align=right valign=top|4,711\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1939\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n| align=center valign=top|1834\n| align=right valign=top|3,695\n|-\n|}\nIn 1834, Dietzenbach had 3,695 inhabitants. One hundred and five years later, in 1939, it was 3,695. After the [[Second World War]] ended, 4,711 people lived in the community in 1950. In 1961, this had risen to 6,303. After extensive new development had been undertaken in the 1960s, the town\u2019s population in 1970 was 12,449. In 1983 it was 25,500 and in 1997 33,015, 30% of whom held citizenship other than German.\n\nDietzenbach has one of the highest birthrates in the state (1990: ~380, 2006: 420 births).<ref>Frankfurter Rundschau: [http://www.fr-online.de/frankfurt_und_hessen/nachrichten/offenbach/?em_cnt=1262983 Die Kinderlein kommen]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

The blue wavy fess refers to the town\u2019s name, interpreted as being from the [[Old High German]] for \u201cbabbling brook\u201d or \u201cBrook of Dietz\u201d (compare here ''775 Jahre Dietzenbach'', published by Dietzenbach town executive). The town\u2019s current arms were determined by Dietzenbach\u2019s community councillors in 1957 and approved by the then Hessian Interior Minister Schneider.\n\nDietzenbach\u2019s flag consists of two narrower blue bands framing the broader yellow band in the middle, upon which appear the town\u2019s arms.\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Dietzenbach Bahnhof 20070912-2.jpg|thumb|[[Dietzenbach station]]]]\nSince late 2003, Dietzenbach is connected as the end-station with the [[S-train|suburban metropolitan network]] Frankfurt.[[Dietzenbach station|Dietzenbach]], [[Dietzenbach-Mitte station|Dietzenbach-Mitte]] and [[Dietzenbach-Steinberg station|Dietzenbach-Steinberg]] stations have been served by the [[Rhine-Main S-Bahn|S-Bahn]] [[S2 (Rhine-Main S-Bahn)|Line 2 (S2)]], which runs on the [[Niedernhausen station|Niedernhausen]] \u2013 [[Hofheim station|Hofheim]] \u2013 [[Frankfurt Central underground station|Frankfurt]] \u2013 [[Offenbach (Main) Ost station|Offenbach]] \u2013 Dietzenbach route.
