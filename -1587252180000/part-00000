Concerning French rap, Elvis considers the rapper Alpha Wann of the group [[1995 (band)|1995]] as \"the rap master playing for me in terms of placement and in terms of how to say things in a very meaningful way\". [[Fuzati]], leader of Klub des Loosers, strongly influences the rapper. Primarily in his somber aspect, but also in the manner that the rapper holds plenty of derision towards life. He also references the masked rapper in many of his titles, like in ''Dr\u00f4le de d\u00e9cision.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Romeo-elvis-drole-de-decision-lyrics|title=Rom\u00e9o Elvis \u2013 Dr\u00f4le de d\u00e9cision|website=Genius.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref> Elvis is also a fan of the French artist [[Philippe Katerine]].\n\n== Concerts and tours ==\nWhile he began performing at concerts while growing closer to L'Or du Commun, it was during the release of ''Morale,'' in 2015, that Rom\u00e9o Elvis and Le Motel began touring, with 19 performances across Belgium, France, and Luxembourg.

In 2016, his album EP ''Morale'' was released. In 2017 and 2018, two more albums were released: ''Morale 2'' and his reissue ''Morale 2 luxe'' (released from his collaboration with producer Le Motel).

His artistic training continued at ESA 75, in Brussels, where he studied photo-journalism. While continuing to practice rap, he became close to members of L'Or du Commun.\n\nWhile his first [[Extended play|EPs]] were being released, Rom\u00e9o Elvis was working as a cashier at the supermarket chain [[Carrefour]]. Despite his success, he was not able to earn enough money from rapping alone. Shortly before the release of the album ''Bruxelles arrive'', he quit his job and devoted himself solely to music.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|title=Rom\u00e9o Elvis : \"Bruxelles est arriv\u00e9e\" L'Interview Nova serr\u00e9s dans une caisse|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlpysmNzV2A|via=YouTube|date=7 April 2017|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref> His newest EP, ''Morale 2luxe'', was released on February 15, 2018. ''Morale 2luxe'' is a remake of his album, ''Morale 2'', released in March 2017.\n\nElvis suffers from [[tinnitus]], common among musicians.

While developing old-school instrumentals and a flow with similar ambiance to his first two EPs, his collaboration with the producer Le Motel on ''Morale'' and ''Morale 2'' profoundly changed his style. He currently allows himself to make more refrains and add electronic instrumentals, and in accord with the jazz of Le Motel, giving them a more current tone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.surlmag.fr/romeo-elvis-interview-morale-2017# |title=Notre g\u00e9n\u00e9ration est plus inqui\u00e8te que la pr\u00e9c\u00e9dente |access-date=1 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713042945/http://www.surlmag.fr/romeo-elvis-interview-morale-2017/# |archive-date=13 July 2018 |url-status= |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n<span>Elvis' influences are numerous</span>: the Belgian group L'or du Commun with which he made his rapping debut is one of his main ones. Their style can also be recognized in his first two projects with group members. He also frequently mentions the rapper Caballero as someone who greatly inspired him; they met while ''Bruxelles arrive'' was being recorded. Concerning French rap, Elvis considers the rapper Alpha Wann of the group [[1995 (band)|1995]] as \"the rap master playing for me in terms of placement and in terms of how to say things in a very meaningful way\". [[Fuzati]], leader of Klub des Loosers, strongly influences the rapper. Primarily in his somber aspect, but also in the manner that the rapper holds plenty of derision towards life. He also references the masked rapper in many of his titles, like in ''Dr\u00f4le de d\u00e9cision.''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Romeo-elvis-drole-de-decision-lyrics|title=Rom\u00e9o Elvis \u2013 Dr\u00f4le de d\u00e9cision|website=Genius.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}</ref> Elvis is also a fan of the French artist [[Philippe Katerine]].\n\n== Concerts and tours ==\nWhile he began performing at concerts while growing closer to L'Or du Commun, it was during the release of ''Morale,'' in 2015, that Rom\u00e9o Elvis and Le Motel began touring, with 19 performances across Belgium, France, and Luxembourg.

He was one of the strongest opponents of early [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus,<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince and his father, Arrybas, ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged King Neoptolemus.</ref> and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacides was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides' father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias' wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC, Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC, Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=14}}; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the [[Peloponnese]] and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC, Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=14\u201317}}.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 BC, Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=18}}.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC, he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bare to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000-25,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC, Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=34}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=34\u201335}}.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=37}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch. ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch. ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC, Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC, Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded an plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius, \"Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=37\u201339}}; {{harvnb|Greenwalt|2010|p=298: \"From 288 until 284, Pyrrhus and Lysimachus shared the rule of Macedonia until the latter drove the former back to Epirus (Plut., ''Pyrrhus'' 7\u201312).\"}}; Pausanius.

Although this was designed as a measure against the Italian peoples of [[Lucanians|Lucania]], the Tarentines grew nervous and attacked the Romans in Thurii, driving the Roman garrison from the city and sinking several Roman warships. Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]]. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans.<ref name=BritA/><ref name=encarta2008>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pyrrhus|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|year=2008}}</ref> Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the [[Oracle of Delphi]].

He made an alliance with [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], King of [[Macedon]] and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.\n\nPyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]], 2,000 [[archery|archers]], 500 [[sling (weapon)|slingers]], and 20 [[war elephant]]s in a bid to subdue the Romans.<ref name=BritA/> The elephants had been loaned to him by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.\n\nDue to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly [[macedonian phalanx|phalanx infantry]], he defeated the Romans, led by [[Consul]] [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC,<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Liberty-the-Ancient-Romans-Volume-2/105987/37 \"History of Liberty: The Ancient Romans\" (1853), p. 6.]</ref> in the Roman province of [[Lucania]]. There are conflicting sources about casualties. [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot.<ref name=\"Plutarch17.4\">Plutarch.

He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus tried to wrest [[Campania]] from the Romans, but was twarted in this by the reinforced army of Laevinus. He then boldly marched on Rome itself, but found its defences too formidable. Meanwhile, the Romans had made peace with the Etruscans and had recalled [[Tiberius Coruncanius]], the other consul, who was marching his army southwards from [[Etruria]] towards Rome. Pyrrhus now faced three armies; the garrison of Rome, Laevinus from the south and Curuncanius from the north. Not wanting to be caught between three armies Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum, where he wintered his troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=75\u201376}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Pyrrhus invaded [[Apulia]] (279 BC), the two armies met in the [[Battle of Asculum]], where Pyrrhus won a costly victory.<ref name=encarta2008/> The consul [[Publius Decius Mus (279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] was the Roman commander, and while his able force was ultimately defeated, they almost managed to break the back of Pyrrhus' Epirot army, which guaranteed the security of the city itself. In the end, the Romans lost 6,000 men and Pyrrhus 3,500 including many officers.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus later famously commented on his victory at Asculum, stating, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\">Plutarch. ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#21 21.9].</ref> It is from reports of this semi-legendary event that the term [[Pyrrhic victory]] originates.\n\n==Ruler of Sicily==\nIn 278 BC, Pyrrhus received two offers simultaneously. The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. The city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.\n\n==Last wars and death==\n{{Main|Siege of Sparta|}}\n[[File:The-Siege-Of-Sparta-By-Pyrrhus-319-272-Bc-1799-1800.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Sparta]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Topino-Lebrun]]]]\n\nHis western campaign had taken a heavy toll on his army as well as his treasury. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Pyrrhus went to war yet again.<ref>The easiest way for a king to raise funds was to invade his neighbours.</ref> The realm of his rival king [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedon was the most obvious target. Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=125\u2013128}}; Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 26.</ref>\n\nAntigonus managed to hold on to a number of coastal cities.<ref>He had inherited a powerful navy from his father, Demetrius.</ref> He then waited for an opportunity to reclaim his kingdom while Pyrrhus was already looking for another war to fight. Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=128}}.</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]]. This latter account is also given by [[Appian]].<ref name=\"Appian\">Appian.

As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them,<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/> and they received praise from [[Cicero]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tinsley|2006|p=211}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]] and a son named [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] in honour of her [[Ptolemy I Soter|stepfather]]. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since that was the same year her son was born.<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\">{{harvnb|Bennett|2010}}.</ref> His second wife was [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], daughter of King [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] (r. 317\u2013289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had two sons, [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\"/> and Helenus; Lanassa left Pyrrhus.

He was one of the strongest opponents of early [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus,<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince and his father, Arrybas, ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged King Neoptolemus.</ref> and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacides was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides' father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias' wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC, Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC, Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=14}}; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the [[Peloponnese]] and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC, Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=14\u201317}}.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 BC, Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=18}}.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC, he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bare to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000-25,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC, Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=34}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=34\u201335}}.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=37}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch. ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch. ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC, Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC, Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded an plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius, \"Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=37\u201339}}; {{harvnb|Greenwalt|2010|p=298: \"From 288 until 284, Pyrrhus and Lysimachus shared the rule of Macedonia until the latter drove the former back to Epirus (Plut., ''Pyrrhus'' 7\u201312).\"}}; Pausanius.

Although this was designed as a measure against the Italian peoples of [[Lucanians|Lucania]], the Tarentines grew nervous and attacked the Romans in Thurii, driving the Roman garrison from the city and sinking several Roman warships. Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]]. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans.<ref name=BritA/><ref name=encarta2008>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pyrrhus|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|year=2008}}</ref> Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the [[Oracle of Delphi]]. He recognized the possibility of carving out an empire for himself in [[Italy]]. He made an alliance with [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], King of [[Macedon]] and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.\n\nPyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]], 2,000 [[archery|archers]], 500 [[sling (weapon)|slingers]], and 20 [[war elephant]]s in a bid to subdue the Romans.<ref name=BritA/> The elephants had been loaned to him by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.\n\nDue to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly [[macedonian phalanx|phalanx infantry]], he defeated the Romans, led by [[Consul]] [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC,<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Liberty-the-Ancient-Romans-Volume-2/105987/37 \"History of Liberty: The Ancient Romans\" (1853), p. 6.]</ref> in the Roman province of [[Lucania]]. There are conflicting sources about casualties. [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot.<ref name=\"Plutarch17.4\">Plutarch.

He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus tried to wrest [[Campania]] from the Romans, but was twarted in this by the reinforced army of Laevinus. He then boldly marched on Rome itself, but found its defences too formidable. Meanwhile, the Romans had made peace with the Etruscans and had recalled [[Tiberius Coruncanius]], the other consul, who was marching his army southwards from [[Etruria]] towards Rome. Pyrrhus now faced three armies; the garrison of Rome, Laevinus from the south and Curuncanius from the north. Not wanting to be caught between three armies Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum, where he wintered his troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=75\u201376}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Pyrrhus invaded [[Apulia]] (279 BC), the two armies met in the [[Battle of Asculum]], where Pyrrhus won a costly victory.<ref name=encarta2008/> The consul [[Publius Decius Mus (279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] was the Roman commander, and while his able force was ultimately defeated, they almost managed to break the back of Pyrrhus' Epirot army, which guaranteed the security of the city itself. In the end, the Romans lost 6,000 men and Pyrrhus 3,500 including many officers.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus later famously commented on his victory at Asculum, stating, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\">Plutarch. ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#21 21.9].</ref> It is from reports of this semi-legendary event that the term [[Pyrrhic victory]] originates.\n\n==Ruler of Sicily==\nIn 278 BC, Pyrrhus received two offers simultaneously. The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy. The city of Tarentum remained under the dominion of the Epirotes.\n\n==Last wars and death==\n{{Main|Siege of Sparta|}}\n[[File:The-Siege-Of-Sparta-By-Pyrrhus-319-272-Bc-1799-1800.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Siege of Sparta]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Topino-Lebrun]]]]\n\nHis western campaign had taken a heavy toll on his army as well as his treasury. Despite (or perhaps because of) this, Pyrrhus went to war yet again.<ref>The easiest way for a king to raise funds was to invade his neighbours.</ref> The realm of his rival king [[Antigonus II Gonatas|Antigonus Gonatas]] of Macedon was the most obvious target. Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=125\u2013128}}; Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 26.</ref>\n\nAntigonus managed to hold on to a number of coastal cities.<ref>He had inherited a powerful navy from his father, Demetrius.</ref> He then waited for an opportunity to reclaim his kingdom while Pyrrhus was already looking for another war to fight. Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=128}}.</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]]. This latter account is also given by [[Appian]].<ref name=\"Appian\">Appian.

As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them,<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/> and they received praise from [[Cicero]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tinsley|2006|p=211}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]] and a son named [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] in honour of her [[Ptolemy I Soter|stepfather]]. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since that was the same year her son was born.<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\">{{harvnb|Bennett|2010}}.</ref> His second wife was [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], daughter of King [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] (r. 317\u2013289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had two sons, [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\"/> and Helenus; Lanassa left Pyrrhus.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

Based in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the unit was authorized on September 15, 1915, as an exclusively Canadian Grenadier Guards (CGG) formation with Guards uniforms and accoutrements approved by The [[Governor General of Canada]], HRH, Duke of Connaught (Colonel of the Canadian Grenadier Guards). Mobilization and recruiting for soldiers began on October 23, 1915.   \n  \nMore than 4,213 men served in the 87th Battalion, representing all regions of Canada, but predominantly Ontario, until&nbsp; the last few months of the&nbsp; war&nbsp; when the balance was furnished by soldiers from Quebec (included the need to form a&nbsp; francophone coy.) The Battalion earned 17  Battle Honours at a cost&nbsp; of 886 dead & 2,246 wounded, many of them wounded multiple times.  \n[[File:87th Battalion badges.jpg|thumb|Badges of the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF - Hayes-Rivet (MHR) collection]]\n\n== Unit distinctions & achievements ==\nThe 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) CEF holds several distinctions in compared to other CEF battalions:\n* CGG was one of only 7 Militia Regiments (out of 51 CEF units) to recruit their own battalions that fought as a distinct unit within the Canadian Corps.\n* The 87th Battalion was one of only 3 Canadian units authorized by the Minister of Militia, Sir Sam Hughes, to recruit across all of Canada. The other 2 were the [[Royal Canadian Regiment]] and [[Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry]].\n* The 87th Battalion was the only Canadian Foot Guards CEF unit active during The Great War. The Governor Generals Foot Guards (GGFG) contributed volunteers for the 2nd Battalion (Eastern Ontario Regiment), CEF, and the 77th Battalion CEF (Ottawa), CEF. The Governor Generals Horse Guards (GGHG) contributed men for the 4th and 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles (Bantams) CEF, but these were composite or regional units (more on that later) and none bore the title or accoutrements of Guards.\n* Title of 'Guardsman' was awarded by [[King George V]] in 1919 as a permanent distinction in conjunction with all other Guards units, in recognition of their collective contributions to victory in the Great War.\n* 87th Battalion were the first to liberate Belgium on 5 November, 1918. Patrols from the 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards), of the 4th Division, crossed the River Aunelle, thereby marking the liberation, by the Canadians, of the first part of occupied Belgium.\n\n== Unit milestones ==\n=== Mobilization and England ===\nThe 87th Battalion departed Canada after boarding R.M.S. [[RMS Empress of Britain (1905)|''Empress of Britain'']] on April 23, 1916 and arrived in Liverpool, England on May 5, 1916. The battalion arrived and billeted on May 27 at Bramshott Military Camp as part of the 12th Infantry Brigade (until June 1916) and then designated as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 4th Canadian Infantry Division in August of the same year. During the period in England, the battalion received training from an officer and four drill sergeants from the British Grenadier Guards, all trench veterans, all previously wounded in action (WIA). On August 11/12, the battalion crossed over to France and landed at Le Havre, France on August 13, 1916 with a total strength of 1,090 all ranks. The battalion served the duration of the war as part of the 11th Infantry Brigade, 4th Canadian Infantry Division.\n\n=== First Actions & casualties ===\nFollowing the [[Battle of Mont Sorrel]], 303 members of the 87th Battalion were detached to reinforce the [[1st Battalion (Ontario Regiment), CEF]]. Of these CGG members, two, 177281 Private John Leitch, (later KIA 9 April, 1917), and 178218 Private William Anson Ogilvie, would distinguish themselves with the 1st Battalion during the Battle of the Somme and win multiple Military Medals for bravery in the field. The initial loss of men were replaced by 391 officers & men from the 77th, Battalion, (Ottawa) CEF, from the GGFG. The battalion was introduced and indoctrinated into trench warfare beginning August 18, 1916 in the Ypres area. Their first casualties, two wounded, occurred that same day. The first 87th Battalion fatality occurred on August 26, 1916. Total casualties for the first weeks of the war were eventually 17 KIA / 25 WIA. On September 16, 1916, the 87th battalion participated in their first trench raid resulting in 36 casualties out of 60 engaged unit members.\n\n===  Battle of the Somme ===\nOn 10 October, 1916, the 87th Battalion was relocated to Albert area along the Ancre area and on the 21 October, attacked and took a section of Regina Trench. The first gallantry awards earned by the 87th Battalion were awarded to four members for the attack on Regina Trench, CSM W. Blaney, Sgt. J.C. Noon, Ptes J.E. Blaney, and J.D. Hunter. After some routine activities and tours along the front, on November 18, the 87th Battalion was assigned to capture a section of Desire Trench, as well as its support systems. The attack was launched from Regina Trench. It succeeded well beyond expectations, and in addition to capturing Desire, Major Franklin Hall, with 41 volunteers, with only their rifles, bayonets, grenades and 2 Lewis Guns advanced a further 500 yards and captured part of Grandcourt Trench, including taking 115 prisoners. 80 of these were taken unaided by four privates; Roy, Thompson, Garneau and Winke.  \n[[File:Plan of Attack Vimy Ridge.jpg|thumb|87th Battalion was to advance as part of the 11th Brigage, 4th Division. (2nd from top) Plan of Attack for Vimy Ridge 9 April 1917]]\n\n=== Battle of Vimy Ridge ===\nThe Battle of Vimy Ridge was a terrible tragedy for the battalion. Progress on the right was slow because, for a time and in part, the centre had practically collapsed.The 87th Battalion (Canadian Grenadier Guards) were in the first wave but for some reason, a section of enemy trench barely a hundred metres in front of them had been left untouched by the artillery bombardment. (it has been suggested that the 87th Battalion commanding officer, Major Harold Leroy Shaw wanted to use it as a first-aid station and battalion headquarters later on.) Subsequently,the company assaulting it was virtually wiped out in just six minutes, and \u2018sixty per cent of its strength lay dead on the ground.\u2019It was not a good beginning, delaying the other guardsmen so that they lost the barrage, and those who tried to continue the advance were cut down by German machine gunners firing from positions of relative safety in the untouched trenches.   \n\nThe 87th Battalion War diaries reports that six of the seven officers leading the 87th into battle were killed or wounded within the first hours. \"Word had been received that Captain Harry Sare, (Officer Commanding the Assault), had been shot through the head with a bullet and could no longer carry on. Lieutenant Yonkles had also been hit in the left arm, Majors Joy and Ross and Lieut. Savage had been killed, and Lieut. Sinclair badly wounded, leaving Lieutenant Hannaford the only available officer of those who went over.\" The 87th diary names 11 officers killed or wounded and notes 110 other ranks killed, 157 wounded and 25 missing.    \n\n==Officers Commanding==\n*Lieut.-Col.

A [[druid]] explains the meaning of the stone, and says the number of cries the stone made is the number of kings who will follow Conn, but he is not the man to name them. A magical mist arises, and a horseman approaches who throws three spears towards Conn, then asks him and the druid to follow him to his house, which stands on a plain by a golden tree. They enter, and are welcomed by a woman in a gold crown. First they see a silver vat, bound with gold hoops, full of red ale, and a golden cup and serving spoon.

The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother.

She had fallen in love with Art from a distance and sought him out in her [[currach]], but when she met Conn and learned he was without a wife, agreed to marry him instead, on the condition that Art be banished from Tara for a year. The men of Ireland thought this unjust, and Ireland was barren during that year. The druids discovered that this was B\u00e9 Chuille's fault, and declared that the famine could be ended by the sacrifice of the son of a sinless couple in front of Tara. Conn went in search of this boy in B\u00e9 Chuille's currach. He landed on a strange island of apple-trees. The queen of the island had a young son, the result of her only sexual union. Conn told her that Ireland would be saved if the boy bathed in the water of Ireland, and she agreed. He took him back to Ireland, but when the druids demanded his death, he, Art and Fionn mac Cumhaill swore to protect him. Just then, a woman driving a cow carrying two bags approached, and the cow was sacrificed instead of the boy. The bags were opened: one contained a bird with one leg, the other a bird with twelve legs. The two birds fought, and the one-legged bird won. The woman said the twelve-legged bird represented the druids, and the one-legged bird the boy, and revealed herself as his mother. She told Conn that the famine would end if he would put B\u00e9 Chuille away, but he refused. B\u00e9 Chuille was later banished from Tara as the result of a series of challenges she and Art made each other over a game of ''[[fidchell]]''.<ref>[http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/art.html \"The Adventures of Art son of Conn\"], Cross & Slover 1936, pp. 491\u2013502</ref>\n\n===Death===\n\nConn was eventually killed by [[Tipraite T\u00edrech]], king of the [[Ulaid]], on Tuesday 20 October according to [[Ruaidhr\u00ed \u00d3 Flaithbheartaigh]] in his 'Ogygia: seu Rerum Hibernicarum Chronologia' (1685).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/ogygiaorchronolo02oflaiala/page/214/mode/2up/search/conn+]</ref> The ''Lebor Gab\u00e1la'',<ref>[https://archive.org/details/leborgablare00macauoft/page/332/mode/2up]</ref> Baile in Sc\u00e1il,<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lecturesonmanusc00ocuruoft/page/620/mode/2up]</ref> Gilla C\u00f3em\u00e1in's poem \"Annalad annall uile\"<ref>[http://elverdissen.dyndns.org/~nodus/618-POEMS.pdf]</ref> and the ''Annals''<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Gb0_AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=%22T%C3%BAath+Amrois%22&source=bl&ots=PWyXzakIhg&sig=ACfU3U05_iImxpyz0e1xT69Ju-4suVrh-g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJ85yT0_DoAhX1tHEKHWffDt0Q6AEwA3oECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22T%C3%BAath%20Amrois%22&f=false]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/annalsoftigernac00stokuoft/page/8/mode/2up]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LY9nAAAAMAAJ&q=%22tuath+ambrois%22&dq=%22tuath+ambrois%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiq_e695PDoAhUOTBUIHed5DhwQ6AEIQjAD]</ref> say Tipraite defeated him in battle in T\u00faath Amrois.

G. Wodehouse]], first published on 7 October 1938, in the United Kingdom by [[Herbert Jenkins Ltd|Herbert Jenkins]], London, and in the United States by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]], New York.<ref>McIlvaine (1990), pp. 74\u201376, A60.</ref> It was serialised in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' (US) from 16 July to 3 September 1938 and in the London ''[[Daily Mail]]'' from 14 September to 6 October 1938.\n\n''The Code of the Woosters'' is the third full-length novel to feature two of Wodehouse's best-known creations, [[Bertie Wooster]] and his valet [[Jeeves]]. It introduces [[Sir Watkyn Bassett]], the owner of a country house called [[Totleigh Towers]] where the story takes place, and his intimidating friend [[Roderick Spode]]. It is also a sequel to ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'', continuing the story of Bertie's newt-fancying friend [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] and Gussie's droopy and overly sentimental fianc\u00e9e, [[Madeline Bassett]].\n\nBertie and Jeeves return to Totleigh Towers in a later novel, ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 30em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = I mean, imagine how some unfortunate Master Criminal would feel, on coming down to do a murder at the old Grange, if he found that not only was [[Sherlock Holmes]] putting in the weekend there, but [[Hercule Poirot]], as well.<br />The more I faced up to the idea of pinching that cow-creamer, the less I liked it.\n|salign    = right\n|source    = \u2014 Bertie is nervous about Sir Watkyn and Spode<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], chapter 2, p. 44.</ref>\n}}\nJeeves wants to go with Bertie on a round-the-world cruise but Bertie is not interested. Bertie's [[Aunt Dahlia]] sends Bertie to go to a particular antique shop and sneer at a silver eighteenth-century [[cow creamer|cow-creamer]], to drive down its price for Aunt Dahlia's collector husband [[Tom Travers]]. In the shop, Bertie encounters the magistrate Sir Watkyn Bassett, who is also a collector. Sir Watkyn is accompanied by his future nephew-in-law Roderick Spode, the leader of a Fascist organization called the Black Shorts.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], chapter 3, p. 66.</ref>\n\nLater, Bertie learns that, by playing an underhanded trick on Tom, Sir Watkyn has obtained the creamer. Aunt Dahlia tells Bertie to steal it back. Bertie goes to Totleigh Towers, where he is startled to find that not only is Sir Watkyn there to watch over the cow-creamer but Spode as well.\n\nBertie has another reason for going to Totleigh Towers: he hopes to heal a rift between Gussie Fink-Nottle and Madeline, Sir Watkyn's daughter. Madeline incorrectly believes Bertie is in love with her, and she has promised to marry him if her engagement to Gussie should ever fail. In fact Bertie dislikes the drippy, childish Madeline and wishes to avoid marrying her at all costs, but his personal code of chivalry will not allow him to insult her by telling her so. To his relief, he learns upon arriving at Totleigh Towers that Gussie and Madeline have reconciled.\n\nTo keep up his confidence for an upcoming speaking engagement, Gussie has been keeping a notebook in which he writes insults about Sir Watkyn and Spode. He loses the notebook and Bertie fears that if it should fall into Sir Watkyn's hands, Sir Watkyn will forbid Madeline to marry Gussie. The notebook is found by [[List of Jeeves characters#Stiffy Byng|Stephanie \"Stiffy\" Byng]], Sir Watkyn's niece, who wants approval from her uncle to marry the local curate, Bertie's friend, [[Harold Pinker|Harold \"Stinker\" Pinker]]. Sir Watkyn considers Harold insufficiently wealthy and therefore unsuitable. Stiffy uses the notebook to blackmail Bertie into going along with her plan, Bertie must pretend to steal the cow-creamer but allow Harold to heroically catch him in the act. She hopes Harold's \"heroism\" will motivate Sir Watkyn to gratefully approve his marriage to her.\n\nThinking Stiffy may be concealing the notebook in her stocking, Gussie tries to search her legs. Madeline sees this, misinterprets it as hanky-panky and breaks off their engagement. Spode, who has strong protective feelings for Madeline, angrily chases after Gussie, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life for his alleged infidelity.\n\nJeeves learns from the [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#The Junior Ganymede Club|Junior Ganymede]] club book (a confidential book in which valets and butlers record their employers\u2019 foibles) that Spode has a shameful secret. Because of the club's strict rules, Jeeves cannot reveal anything more to Bertie than one name, \"Eulalie\". Confident that he can blackmail Spode by pretending to know all about his secret, Bertie rebukes Spode with sarcastic insults, orders him to leave Gussie alone and is about to threaten to reveal the truth about \"Eulalie\" but at the crucial moment, forgets the name. Enraged by the insults, Spode attacks. A brief scuffle ensues; Bertie tries to flee but suddenly remembers the name, and tells Spode he knows about Eulalie. Terrified, Spode backs down and apologizes for his behaviour.\n\nHarold steals the helmet of the local policeman Constable Oates to impress Stiffy. Jeeves suggests a new plan to Stiffy: Bertie will tell Sir Watkyn he is engaged to her. Sir Watkyn, who dislikes Bertie, will then be so relieved to learn she wants to marry the curate that he will allow it. The plan works and Sir Watkyn reluctantly approves of Stiffy marrying Harold. Stiffy gratefully tells Bertie that she hid the notebook inside the cow-creamer.\n\nDisgusted by Gussie's apparent infidelity, Madeline tells Bertie that she will marry him. Bertie needs the notebook to prove to her that Gussie was merely searching Stiffy for it. Bertie obtains the notebook and gives it to Gussie, to show to Madeline. All seems well but Gussie carelessly breaks his newts' tank, and then tries to store them in Sir Watkyn's bath. Sir Watkyn flushes the newts down the bath-drain and angrily forbids the marriage. Speechless with rage, Gussie gives Sir Watkyn the notebook of insults. Bertie realizes that Sir Watkyn will now never relent unless compelled to do so and the only way to compel him seems to be to steal the cow-creamer and hold it as ransom for Sir Watkyn's approval of Gussie as a husband for Madeline.\n\nAunt Dahlia steals the cow-creamer and Jeeves puts it in a suitcase. Jeeves gives the suitcase to Gussie, who drives with it to London to escape the angered Sir Watkyn. Opening the other suitcase, Jeeves finds Oates's helmet, which Stiffy hid there. Bertie agrees to take the blame for stealing the helmet after Stiffy appeals to one of his personal rules, the Code of the Woosters, \"Never let a pal down\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], chapter 13, p. 254.</ref>\n\nUnable to prove that Bertie stole the cow-creamer, Sir Watkyn gleefully accuses him of stealing the helmet and vows to sentence him to a prison term. Jeeves blackmails Spode with the name Eulalie and forces Spode to announce that he stole the helmet. Jeeves then points out that Bertie can sue Sir Watkyn for wrongful arrest. Trapped, Sir Watkyn concedes approval for Madeline's and Stiffy's marriages.\n\nUnbearably curious about Spode's secret, Bertie agrees to go on the world cruise if Jeeves will tell him the truth about Eulalie. After hesitating, Jeeves reveals that Spode is a talented designer of ladies' underclothing, runs a shop called Eulalie Soeurs and fears that his authority with his followers would be jeopardized if this became known.\n\n==Themes==\n[[Roderick Spode]] is a satirical parody of the real-life British fascist politician [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]] (called the \"Blackshirts\"). As Gussie Fink-Nottle tells Bertie: \"Don't you ever read the papers? Roderick Spode is the founder and head of the Saviours of Britain, a Fascist organization better known as the [[Black Shorts]]. His general idea, if he doesn't get knocked on the head with a bottle in one of the frequent brawls in which he and his followers indulge, is to make himself a Dictator.\" The reference to bottle-breaking suggests that Spode can only ever hope to gain power by using brute force. Bertie and Gussie also discuss the name of Spode's organization:\n\n<blockquote>\"Well, I'm dashed. I thought he was something of that sort. That chin\u2026those eyes\u2026and for the matter of that, that moustache. By the way, when you say 'shorts' you mean 'shirts', of course.\"<br/>\"No. By the time Spode formed his association, there were no shirts left. He and his adherents wear black shorts.\"<br/>\"Footer bags, you mean?\"<br/>\"Yes.\"<br/>\"How perfectly foul.\"</blockquote>\n\nGussie's statement that \"there were no shirts left\" references a number of fascist groups with names like \"Blackshirts\" that existed in the 1930s. While Bertie finds the group's black shorts (which he compares to footer bags, or [[Association football|football]] shorts) absurd, the joke about shorts shows that the would-be dictator has a feebly derivative style. As the story progresses, Spode demonstrates a violent nature, and threatens to use violence not so much as a means to a political end but as a source of gratification in itself. For example, he threatens Bertie regarding the cow-creamer: \"'If the thing disappears, however cunningly you and your female accomplice may have covered your traces, I shall know where it has gone, and I shall immediately beat you to a jelly. To a jelly,' he repeated, rolling the words round his tongue as if they were vintage port\". Wodehouse portrays Spode as menacing by comically making Spode seem larger to Bertie throughout the story; at first Spode seems to be seven feet tall, but after making violent threats he grows in height and eventually seems to be about eight foot six. Ultimately, Jeeves provides Bertie with a secret about Spode that allows Bertie to denounce Spode.<ref>{{cite book |last=Green |first=Benny |date=1981 |title=P. G. Wodehouse: A Literary Biography |url= |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=194\u2013196 |isbn=0-19-281390-0 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\nIn ''The Code of the Woosters'', Wodehouse uses a variety of stylistic devices to create humour. For example, he uses vivid imagery to make exaggerated comparisons for comic effect: \"Have you ever heard Sir Watkyn Bassett dealing with a bowl of soup? It's not unlike the Scottish express going through a tunnel\" (chapter 4).<ref>Hall (1974), p. 108.</ref>\n\nWodehouse occasionally uses a \"neglected positive\" (a word most used in its negative form), as with ''gruntled'' in chapter 1: \"I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled\".<ref>Hall (1974), p. 84</ref> The expression \"part brass rags\" is comically rendered in passive voice in chapter 6: \"Brass rags had been parted by the young couple\".<ref>Hall (1974), p. 85</ref>\n\nWodehouse sometimes uses transliteration of ethnic or class-based mispronunciations; ''The Code of the Woosters'' features a rural policeman saying ''\"bersicle\"'' for \"bicycle\" and ''\"verlent\"'' for \"violent\" (chapter 4).<ref>Hall (1974), p. 70.</ref>\n\nThough [[malapropism]]s are rare in Bertie's speech, one occurs in chapter 5 when Bertie uses \"incredulous\" for \"incredible\"; Bertie also makes the same mistake in chapter five of ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves''.<ref>Hall (1974), pp. 96\u201397.</ref> Bertie often employs humorous abbreviations, such as ''exclamash'' for \"exclamation\" in chapter 4, and ''posish'' for \"position\" and ''compash'' for \"compassion\" in chapter 5.<ref>Hall (1974), pp. 74 and 77.</ref> Some words that have been repeated or are part of clich\u00e9 phrases are abbreviated to a single letter. For instance, Bertie sometimes refers to Aunt Dahlia as \"aged relative\", and abbreviates this when speaking to her in chapter 5: \"'Let me explain, aged r.'\".<ref>Thompson (1992), p. 324.</ref>\n\nAs in many of the Jeeves novels, Bertie takes time in the beginning of ''The Code of the Woosters'' to ponder how much he should summarize previous events. In chapter 1, after Gussie Fink-Nottle is first mentioned, Bertie states:\n\n<blockquote>A thing I never know, when I'm starting out to tell a story about a chap I've told a story about before, is how much explanation to bung in at the outset. It's a problem you've got to look at from every angle. I mean to say, in the present case, if I take it for granted that my public knows all about Gussie Fink-Nottle and just breeze ahead, those publicans who weren't hanging on my lips the first time are apt to be fogged. Whereas, if before kicking off I give about eight volumes of the man's life and history, other bimbos, who were so hanging, will stifle yawns and murmur \"Old stuff. Get on with it.\"</blockquote>\n\nBertie then says that he will \"put the salient facts as briefly as possible\", and further discusses his intention to recount the facts concisely. Part of the humour of this passage is that, despite his concerns about brevity, Bertie's lead-in is nearly as long as the following expositional passage itself.<ref>Thompson (1992), p. 210.</ref>\n\nBeginning with ''The Code of the Woosters'', in which he is suspected of stealing the cow-creamer and a policeman's helmet, Bertie is accused of a theft in every novel in which he appears, which often constitutes a major plot line. The motif of having Bertie suspected of theft creates humour because of its incongruity with Bertie's naive honesty.<ref>Thompson (1992), p. 212.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe novel was originally to be titled ''The Silver Cow''.<ref>Phelps (1992), p. 190.</ref>\n\nErd Brandt, an editor at the ''Saturday Evening Post'', criticized the original draft of ''The Code of the Woosters'' for having too many stage waits. Wodehouse agreed and removed them.<ref>Phelps (1992), p. 195.</ref>\n\nIn a 1932 letter to his friend William Townend of his acquaintances, Wodehouse discussed two of his acquaintances, the writer [[H. G. Wells]] and Wells's partner [[Odette Keun]]. Wodehouse noted that \"when you go to his residence, the first thing you see is an enormous fireplace, and round it are carved in huge letters the words: {{Small|TWO LOVERS BUILT THIS HOUSE}}. Her idea, I imagine. I can't believe Wells would have thought of that himself\". This real-life anecdote was incorporated into ''The Code of the Woosters'': Bertie recalls in chapter 3 that he \"once stayed at the residence of a newly married pal of mine, and his bride had had carved in large letters over the fireplace in the drawing-room, where it was impossible to miss it, the legend 'Two Lovers Built This Nest', and I can still recall the look of dumb anguish in the other half of the sketch's eyes every time he came in and saw it\".<ref>{{cite book | last= Wodehouse | first= P.

The cow-creamer is smaller than this in the episode.\n* In the episode, Jeeves has to go to London to learn about Eulalie; in the original story, he was able to acquire this information by telephone. \n* In the episode, when Bertie does not remember Eulalie, he guesses other similar names, and eventually Jeeves writes the name for him on a piece of paper; in the original story, Bertie does not make guesses, since he cannot even remember the beginning of the name, and remembers Eulalie after Aunt Dahlia shouts \"You!\" at Spode. \n* In the episode, Jeeves takes the suitcase that Gussie takes in the original story. \n* In both episodes, Sir Watkyn knows that Stiffy wants to marry Harold Pinker from the start, but disapproves of her marrying a curate; in the original story, Sir Watkyn was not aware of their engagement until Stiffy says she does not plan to marry Bertie.\n* In the episode, Jeeves does not agree to tell Bertie about Eulalie in exchange for a cruise, and instead Bertie discovers Spode in his shop. Bertie does tell Jeeves he can get rid of handkerchiefs with Bertie's initials, which were not mentioned in the original story.\n* In the episode, Sir Watkyn, thinking that Madeline and Bertie are engaged, initially approves of a marriage between Bertie and Stiffy, and only decides Harold Pinker is a better match for Stiffy after Bertie is discovered with Constable Oates's helmet.\n* Stiffy does not hide the notebook in the cow-creamer in the episode, and instead gives it to Spode. \n* In the episode, Sir Watkyn holds a fancy dress ball, which did not occur in the original story.\n\n===Theatre===\nThe play '' [[Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense]]'', based on ''The Code of the Woosters'', was first performed on 10 October 2013 at [[Richmond Theatre]], moving to the [[West End theatre|West End]] later that month, where its run at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]], London, was extended to 20 September 2014.

G. Wodehouse]], first published on 7 October 1938, in the United Kingdom by [[Herbert Jenkins Ltd|Herbert Jenkins]], London, and in the United States by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday, Doran]], New York.<ref>McIlvaine (1990), pp. 74\u201376, A60.</ref> It was serialised in ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]'' (US) from 16 July to 3 September 1938 and in the London ''[[Daily Mail]]'' from 14 September to 6 October 1938.\n\n''The Code of the Woosters'' is the third full-length novel to feature two of Wodehouse's best-known creations, [[Bertie Wooster]] and his valet [[Jeeves]]. It introduces [[Sir Watkyn Bassett]], the owner of a country house called [[Totleigh Towers]] where the story takes place, and his intimidating friend [[Roderick Spode]]. It is also a sequel to ''[[Right Ho, Jeeves]]'', continuing the story of Bertie's newt-fancying friend [[Gussie Fink-Nottle]] and Gussie's droopy and overly sentimental fianc\u00e9e, [[Madeline Bassett]].\n\nBertie and Jeeves return to Totleigh Towers in a later novel, ''[[Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves]]''.\n\n== Plot ==\n{{Quote box\n|width     = 30em\n|border    = 1px\n|align     = right\n|bgcolor   = #c6dbf7\n|fontsize  = 85%\n|title_bg  =\n|title_fnt =\n|title     =\n|quote     = I mean, imagine how some unfortunate Master Criminal would feel, on coming down to do a murder at the old Grange, if he found that not only was [[Sherlock Holmes]] putting in the weekend there, but [[Hercule Poirot]], as well.<br />The more I faced up to the idea of pinching that cow-creamer, the less I liked it.\n|salign    = right\n|source    = \u2014 Bertie is nervous about Sir Watkyn and Spode<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], chapter 2, p. 44.</ref>\n}}\nJeeves wants to go with Bertie on a round-the-world cruise but Bertie is not interested. Bertie's [[Aunt Dahlia]] sends Bertie to go to a particular antique shop and sneer at a silver eighteenth-century [[cow creamer|cow-creamer]], to drive down its price for Aunt Dahlia's collector husband [[Tom Travers]]. In the shop, Bertie encounters the magistrate Sir Watkyn Bassett, who is also a collector. Sir Watkyn is accompanied by his future nephew-in-law Roderick Spode, the leader of a Fascist organization called the Black Shorts.<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], chapter 3, p. 66.</ref>\n\nLater, Bertie learns that, by playing an underhanded trick on Tom, Sir Watkyn has obtained the creamer. Aunt Dahlia tells Bertie to steal it back. Bertie goes to Totleigh Towers, where he is startled to find that not only is Sir Watkyn there to watch over the cow-creamer but Spode as well.\n\nBertie has another reason for going to Totleigh Towers: he hopes to heal a rift between Gussie Fink-Nottle and Madeline, Sir Watkyn's daughter. Madeline incorrectly believes Bertie is in love with her, and she has promised to marry him if her engagement to Gussie should ever fail. In fact Bertie dislikes the drippy, childish Madeline and wishes to avoid marrying her at all costs, but his personal code of chivalry will not allow him to insult her by telling her so. To his relief, he learns upon arriving at Totleigh Towers that Gussie and Madeline have reconciled.\n\nTo keep up his confidence for an upcoming speaking engagement, Gussie has been keeping a notebook in which he writes insults about Sir Watkyn and Spode. He loses the notebook and Bertie fears that if it should fall into Sir Watkyn's hands, Sir Watkyn will forbid Madeline to marry Gussie. The notebook is found by [[List of Jeeves characters#Stephanie \"Stiffy\" Byng|Stephanie \"Stiffy\" Byng]], Sir Watkyn's niece, who wants approval from her uncle to marry the local curate, Bertie's friend, [[Harold Pinker|Harold \"Stinker\" Pinker]]. Sir Watkyn considers Harold insufficiently wealthy and therefore unsuitable. Stiffy uses the notebook to blackmail Bertie into going along with her plan, Bertie must pretend to steal the cow-creamer but allow Harold to heroically catch him in the act. She hopes Harold's \"heroism\" will motivate Sir Watkyn to gratefully approve his marriage to her.\n\nThinking Stiffy may be concealing the notebook in her stocking, Gussie tries to search her legs. Madeline sees this, misinterprets it as hanky-panky and breaks off their engagement. Spode, who has strong protective feelings for Madeline, angrily chases after Gussie, vowing to beat him within an inch of his life for his alleged infidelity.\n\nJeeves learns from the [[P. G. Wodehouse locations#The Junior Ganymede Club|Junior Ganymede]] club book (a confidential book in which valets and butlers record their employers\u2019 foibles) that Spode has a shameful secret. Because of the club's strict rules, Jeeves cannot reveal anything more to Bertie than one name, \"Eulalie\". Confident that he can blackmail Spode by pretending to know all about his secret, Bertie rebukes Spode with sarcastic insults, orders him to leave Gussie alone and is about to threaten to reveal the truth about \"Eulalie\" but at the crucial moment, forgets the name. Enraged by the insults, Spode attacks. A brief scuffle ensues; Bertie tries to flee but suddenly remembers the name, and tells Spode he knows about Eulalie. Terrified, Spode backs down and apologizes for his behaviour.\n\nHarold steals the helmet of the local policeman Constable Oates to impress Stiffy. Jeeves suggests a new plan to Stiffy: Bertie will tell Sir Watkyn he is engaged to her. Sir Watkyn, who dislikes Bertie, will then be so relieved to learn she wants to marry the curate that he will allow it. The plan works and Sir Watkyn reluctantly approves of Stiffy marrying Harold. Stiffy gratefully tells Bertie that she hid the notebook inside the cow-creamer.\n\nDisgusted by Gussie's apparent infidelity, Madeline tells Bertie that she will marry him. Bertie needs the notebook to prove to her that Gussie was merely searching Stiffy for it. Bertie obtains the notebook and gives it to Gussie, to show to Madeline. All seems well but Gussie carelessly breaks his newts' tank, and then tries to store them in Sir Watkyn's bath. Sir Watkyn flushes the newts down the bath-drain and angrily forbids the marriage. Speechless with rage, Gussie gives Sir Watkyn the notebook of insults. Bertie realizes that Sir Watkyn will now never relent unless compelled to do so and the only way to compel him seems to be to steal the cow-creamer and hold it as ransom for Sir Watkyn's approval of Gussie as a husband for Madeline.\n\nAunt Dahlia steals the cow-creamer and Jeeves puts it in a suitcase. Jeeves gives the suitcase to Gussie, who drives with it to London to escape the angered Sir Watkyn. Opening the other suitcase, Jeeves finds Oates's helmet, which Stiffy hid there. Bertie agrees to take the blame for stealing the helmet after Stiffy appeals to one of his personal rules, the Code of the Woosters, \"Never let a pal down\".<ref>Wodehouse (2008) [1938], chapter 13, p. 254.</ref>\n\nUnable to prove that Bertie stole the cow-creamer, Sir Watkyn gleefully accuses him of stealing the helmet and vows to sentence him to a prison term. Jeeves blackmails Spode with the name Eulalie and forces Spode to announce that he stole the helmet. Jeeves then points out that Bertie can sue Sir Watkyn for wrongful arrest. Trapped, Sir Watkyn concedes approval for Madeline's and Stiffy's marriages.\n\nUnbearably curious about Spode's secret, Bertie agrees to go on the world cruise if Jeeves will tell him the truth about Eulalie. After hesitating, Jeeves reveals that Spode is a talented designer of ladies' underclothing, runs a shop called Eulalie Soeurs and fears that his authority with his followers would be jeopardized if this became known.\n\n==Themes==\n[[Roderick Spode]] is a satirical parody of the real-life British fascist politician [[Sir Oswald Mosley]], leader of the [[British Union of Fascists]] (called the \"Blackshirts\"). As Gussie Fink-Nottle tells Bertie: \"Don't you ever read the papers? Roderick Spode is the founder and head of the Saviours of Britain, a Fascist organization better known as the [[Black Shorts]]. His general idea, if he doesn't get knocked on the head with a bottle in one of the frequent brawls in which he and his followers indulge, is to make himself a Dictator.\" The reference to bottle-breaking suggests that Spode can only ever hope to gain power by using brute force. Bertie and Gussie also discuss the name of Spode's organization:\n\n<blockquote>\"Well, I'm dashed. I thought he was something of that sort. That chin\u2026those eyes\u2026and for the matter of that, that moustache. By the way, when you say 'shorts' you mean 'shirts', of course.\"<br/>\"No. By the time Spode formed his association, there were no shirts left. He and his adherents wear black shorts.\"<br/>\"Footer bags, you mean?\"<br/>\"Yes.\"<br/>\"How perfectly foul.\"</blockquote>\n\nGussie's statement that \"there were no shirts left\" references a number of fascist groups with names like \"Blackshirts\" that existed in the 1930s. While Bertie finds the group's black shorts (which he compares to footer bags, or [[Association football|football]] shorts) absurd, the joke about shorts shows that the would-be dictator has a feebly derivative style. As the story progresses, Spode demonstrates a violent nature, and threatens to use violence not so much as a means to a political end but as a source of gratification in itself. For example, he threatens Bertie regarding the cow-creamer: \"'If the thing disappears, however cunningly you and your female accomplice may have covered your traces, I shall know where it has gone, and I shall immediately beat you to a jelly. To a jelly,' he repeated, rolling the words round his tongue as if they were vintage port\". Wodehouse portrays Spode as menacing by comically making Spode seem larger to Bertie throughout the story; at first Spode seems to be seven feet tall, but after making violent threats he grows in height and eventually seems to be about eight foot six. Ultimately, Jeeves provides Bertie with a secret about Spode that allows Bertie to denounce Spode.<ref>{{cite book |last=Green |first=Benny |date=1981 |title=P. G. Wodehouse: A Literary Biography |url= |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=194\u2013196 |isbn=0-19-281390-0 |author-link= }}</ref>\n\n==Style==\n\nIn ''The Code of the Woosters'', Wodehouse uses a variety of stylistic devices to create humour. For example, he uses vivid imagery to make exaggerated comparisons for comic effect: \"Have you ever heard Sir Watkyn Bassett dealing with a bowl of soup? It's not unlike the Scottish express going through a tunnel\" (chapter 4).<ref>Hall (1974), p. 108.</ref>\n\nWodehouse occasionally uses a \"neglected positive\" (a word most used in its negative form), as with ''gruntled'' in chapter 1: \"I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled\".<ref>Hall (1974), p. 84</ref> The expression \"part brass rags\" is comically rendered in passive voice in chapter 6: \"Brass rags had been parted by the young couple\".<ref>Hall (1974), p. 85</ref>\n\nWodehouse sometimes uses transliteration of ethnic or class-based mispronunciations; ''The Code of the Woosters'' features a rural policeman saying ''\"bersicle\"'' for \"bicycle\" and ''\"verlent\"'' for \"violent\" (chapter 4).<ref>Hall (1974), p. 70.</ref>\n\nThough [[malapropism]]s are rare in Bertie's speech, one occurs in chapter 5 when Bertie uses \"incredulous\" for \"incredible\"; Bertie also makes the same mistake in chapter five of ''Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves''.<ref>Hall (1974), pp. 96\u201397.</ref> Bertie often employs humorous abbreviations, such as ''exclamash'' for \"exclamation\" in chapter 4, and ''posish'' for \"position\" and ''compash'' for \"compassion\" in chapter 5.<ref>Hall (1974), pp. 74 and 77.</ref> Some words that have been repeated or are part of clich\u00e9 phrases are abbreviated to a single letter. For instance, Bertie sometimes refers to Aunt Dahlia as \"aged relative\", and abbreviates this when speaking to her in chapter 5: \"'Let me explain, aged r.'\".<ref>Thompson (1992), p. 324.</ref>\n\nAs in many of the Jeeves novels, Bertie takes time in the beginning of ''The Code of the Woosters'' to ponder how much he should summarize previous events. In chapter 1, after Gussie Fink-Nottle is first mentioned, Bertie states:\n\n<blockquote>A thing I never know, when I'm starting out to tell a story about a chap I've told a story about before, is how much explanation to bung in at the outset. It's a problem you've got to look at from every angle. I mean to say, in the present case, if I take it for granted that my public knows all about Gussie Fink-Nottle and just breeze ahead, those publicans who weren't hanging on my lips the first time are apt to be fogged. Whereas, if before kicking off I give about eight volumes of the man's life and history, other bimbos, who were so hanging, will stifle yawns and murmur \"Old stuff. Get on with it.\"</blockquote>\n\nBertie then says that he will \"put the salient facts as briefly as possible\", and further discusses his intention to recount the facts concisely. Part of the humour of this passage is that, despite his concerns about brevity, Bertie's lead-in is nearly as long as the following expositional passage itself.<ref>Thompson (1992), p. 210.</ref>\n\nBeginning with ''The Code of the Woosters'', in which he is suspected of stealing the cow-creamer and a policeman's helmet, Bertie is accused of a theft in every novel in which he appears, which often constitutes a major plot line. The motif of having Bertie suspected of theft creates humour because of its incongruity with Bertie's naive honesty.<ref>Thompson (1992), p. 212.</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe novel was originally to be titled ''The Silver Cow''.<ref>Phelps (1992), p. 190.</ref>\n\nErd Brandt, an editor at the ''Saturday Evening Post'', criticized the original draft of ''The Code of the Woosters'' for having too many stage waits. Wodehouse agreed and removed them.<ref>Phelps (1992), p. 195.</ref>\n\nIn a 1932 letter to his friend William Townend of his acquaintances, Wodehouse discussed two of his acquaintances, the writer [[H. G. Wells]] and Wells's partner [[Odette Keun]]. Wodehouse noted that \"when you go to his residence, the first thing you see is an enormous fireplace, and round it are carved in huge letters the words: {{Small|TWO LOVERS BUILT THIS HOUSE}}. Her idea, I imagine. I can't believe Wells would have thought of that himself\". This real-life anecdote was incorporated into ''The Code of the Woosters'': Bertie recalls in chapter 3 that he \"once stayed at the residence of a newly married pal of mine, and his bride had had carved in large letters over the fireplace in the drawing-room, where it was impossible to miss it, the legend 'Two Lovers Built This Nest', and I can still recall the look of dumb anguish in the other half of the sketch's eyes every time he came in and saw it\".<ref>{{cite book | last= Wodehouse | first= P.

The stream never fails, although here and there it slows; and Bertie's character continues to be not more remarkable than his vocabulary\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Swinnerton |first=Frank |date=16 October 1938 |title=New Novels|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/258373379/ |work= The Observer|location=London |access-date=4 April 2018 }}</ref>\n* ''[[The Times]]'' (21 October 1938): \"The ardent devotee, it must be confessed, is always fearful that Mr. Wodehouse will one day come short of himself, but ''The Code of the Woosters'' may reassure him once more.

A little family blackmail, connected with a cream jug Uncle Tom desires for his collection, plunges Wooster into the heart of the Bassett territory \u2026 As if this were not enough there is also the fierce Roderick Spode, the leader of the Black Shorts, and at least two other troubles.

The cow-creamer is smaller than this in the episode.\n* In the episode, Jeeves has to go to London to learn about Eulalie; in the original story, he was able to acquire this information by telephone. \n* In the episode, when Bertie does not remember Eulalie, he guesses other similar names, and eventually Jeeves writes the name for him on a piece of paper; in the original story, Bertie does not make guesses, since he cannot even remember the beginning of the name, and remembers Eulalie after Aunt Dahlia shouts \"You!\" at Spode. \n* In the episode, Jeeves takes the suitcase that Gussie takes in the original story. \n* In both episodes, Sir Watkyn knows that Stiffy wants to marry Harold Pinker from the start, but disapproves of her marrying a curate; in the original story, Sir Watkyn was not aware of their engagement until Stiffy says she does not plan to marry Bertie.\n* In the episode, Jeeves does not agree to tell Bertie about Eulalie in exchange for a cruise, and instead Bertie discovers Spode in his shop. Bertie does tell Jeeves he can get rid of handkerchiefs with Bertie's initials, which were not mentioned in the original story.\n* In the episode, Sir Watkyn, thinking that Madeline and Bertie are engaged, initially approves of a marriage between Bertie and Stiffy, and only decides Harold Pinker is a better match for Stiffy after Bertie is discovered with Constable Oates's helmet.\n* Stiffy does not hide the notebook in the cow-creamer in the episode, and instead gives it to Spode. \n* In the episode, Sir Watkyn holds a fancy dress ball, which did not occur in the original story.\n\n===Theatre===\nThe play '' [[Jeeves and Wooster in Perfect Nonsense]]'', based on ''The Code of the Woosters'', was first performed on 10 October 2013 at [[Richmond Theatre]], moving to the [[West End theatre|West End]] later that month, where its run at the [[Duke of York's Theatre]], London, was extended to 20 September 2014.
