Barnes in turn sold the land to Edmond B. Bostwick, a land speculator from New York City three years later in 1835. Bostwick then sold portions of the land to H.I. Lawrence, Townsend Harris, and Francis Cochran. These four created the village which they named after Edmond Bostwick's wife Charlotte.  Jonathan Searles became the first postmaster on March 17, 1838.<ref>Walter Romig, ''Michigan Place Names'' (Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1986), 111.</ref>\n\nCharlotte was incorporated as a village on October 10, 1863, and as a city on March 29, 1871. At various times Charlotte had the unofficial names of Eaton Centre, and Carmel.<ref>Romig, ''Michigan Place Names'', 111.</ref> It was designated as the county seat when Eaton County was organized in 1837; however, due to a lack of population and buildings, county functions were conducted at [[Bellevue, Michigan|Bellevue]] until 1840.\n\nThe [[Dolson|Dolson automobile]] was manufactured in Charlotte from 1904 to 1907.\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.50|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|6.45|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2012-11-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archivedate=2012-01-25 }}</ref>\n\nCharlotte is situated on gently rolling prairie.

(However, in Canada, \u201cwashroom\u201d is equivalent to US \u201crestroom.\u201d) It is also common to see another loan translation, {{nihongo|''kesh\u014dshitsu''|\u5316\u7ca7\u5ba4|extra=lit. ''powder room''}}, on signs in department stores and supermarkets, as well as accompanying the public toilet [[pictogram]].\n\nThe plain word for toilet is {{nihongo|''benjo''|\u4fbf\u6240|extra=''place of convenience'' or ''place of excrement''}}, from the word {{nihongo|''ben''|\u4fbf|}} meaning \"convenience\" or \"excrement\", and this word is fairly common.<ref name=\"Toilet words\"/> It is often used in elementary schools, public swimming baths, and other such public places, and is not especially impolite, although some may prefer to use a more refined word. In many children's games, a child who is tagged \"out\" is sent to a special place, such as the middle of a circle, called the ''benjo''.  Japanese has many other words for places reserved for excretory functions, including ''kawaya'' (\u53a0) and ''habakari'' (\u619a\u308a), but most are rare or archaic.\n\nThe toilet itself\u2014that is, the bowl or in-floor receptacle, the water tank, et cetera\u2014is called ''benki'' (\u4fbf\u5668).

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right.{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}<ref name = \"AsianToilet\">{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~AD8y-hys/movie.htm\n| title = How to use Japanese style toilet.\n| accessdate = 2006-11-08\n\n}}\n</ref> A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: \"small\" (\u5c0f) and \"large\" (\u5927). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally \"small excretion\") and the latter for feces (\"large excretion\"). The lever is often pushed to the \"small\" setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.\n\nA combination squat/Western toilet also exists, where a seat can be flipped down over a squat toilet, and the toilet can be used essentially the same way as the Western style.<ref name = \"Iwate Handbook\">\n{{cite book\n |author=Julie Parsons\n | title = Iwate Pre-Departure Handbook\n | chapter-url = http://www.handaweb.com/anthony/handbook/toilet.html\n | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120416085518/http://www.handaweb.com/anthony/handbook/toilet.html\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = 2012-04-16\n | accessdate = 2006-11-08\n | chapter = \"You call this a toilet?!\" And Other Oddities of Japanese Housing\n | year = 1995\n }}\n</ref> This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to a functional sit-down toilet are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert a squat toilet into a Western-style washlet.\n\n\nThere is a trend in Japan since the 1960s to replace squat toilets at schools and public places with sitting toilets.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00360/|title=Japan Phasing Out Squat Toilets|date=8 January 2019|website=Nippon.com|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref> This trend is thought to accelerate in the run-up to the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Western-style ===\n{{Main|Flush toilet}}\nA flush toilet which has a pedestal for sitting is known in Japan as a {{nihongo|''Western-style''|\u6d0b\u5f0f|y\u014dshiki}} toilet. Western-style toilets, including high tech toilets, are now more common in Japanese homes than the traditional squat toilets,<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> though some older apartments retain stickers on the toilet or in its room illustrating the proper way to use it for [[urination]] and defecation. Many [[public toilet]]s at schools, temples, and train stations are still equipped with only squat toilets.<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> In their own homes, however, Japanese people prefer being able to sit, especially older or physically disabled individuals for whom prolonged squatting is physically demanding or uncomfortable.\n\n==== Japanese bidets ====\n{{Main|Washlet}}\n{{Anchor|Japanese bidets|_jb|bidets}}\nThe modern toilet in Japan, in English sometimes called ''Super Toilet'', and commonly known in [[Japanese language|Japanese]] as {{nihongo|''[[Washlet]]''|\u30a6\u30a9\u30b7\u30e5\u30ec\u30c3\u30c8|Woshuretto}} or as {{nihongo|''warm-water cleaning toilet seat''|\u6e29\u6c34\u6d17\u6d44\u4fbf\u5ea7|onsui senj\u014d benza}} is one of the most advanced types of toilet worldwide, showing a dazzling array of features.<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\">\n{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/world/nara-journal-japanese-masters-get-closer-to-the-toilet-nirvana.html?scp=1&sq=Japanese%20Masters%20Get%20Closer%20to%20the%20Toilet%20Nirvana&st=cse|title= Nara Journal; Japanese Masters Get Closer to the Toilet Nirvana|work=The New York Times|date= October 8, 2002 | first=James | last=Brooke | accessdate=2010-04-09}}\n</ref> The Toto product ''Washlet Zoe'' is listed in ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' as the world's most sophisticated toilet, with seven functions. However, as the model was introduced in 1997, it is now likely to be inferior to the latest model by Toto, ''Neorest''.<ref name=\"DamnInteresting\"/> The idea for the ''washlet'' came from abroad, and the first [[toilet seat]] with integrated bidet was produced in Switzerland by Closomat in 1957.

As of 2002, almost half of all private homes in Japan have such a toilet, exceeding the number of households with a personal computer.<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/><ref name=\"High-Tech Toilets\">\n{{cite web\n |url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/hitech/toilet/index.html \n |publisher=Web Japan \n |title=High-Tech Toilets \n}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20070101044850/http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/techno/toilet/index.html archive]</ref> While the toilet looks like a Western-style toilet at first glance, there are numerous additional features\u2014such as blow dryer, seat heating, massage options, water jet adjustments, automatic lid opening, automatic flushing, [[wireless]] control panel, room heating and air conditioning for the room\u2014included either as part of the toilet or in the [[toilet seat|seat]].<ref name=\"japanguide\"/>  These features can be accessed by an (often wireless) control panel attached to the seat or mounted on a nearby wall.<ref name=\"japanguide\"/>\n\n===== Basic features =====\n{{Anchor|Basic features|_bf}}\n[[Image:Modern japanese toilet.jpg|thumb|Control elements of a modern Japanese toilet]]\nThe most basic feature is the integrated bidet, a nozzle the size of a pencil that comes out from underneath the toilet seat and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the [[anus]] and one for the [[bidet]].<ref name=\"links\"/><ref name=\"High-Tech Toilets\"/> The former is called ''posterior wash'', ''general use'', or ''family cleaning'', and the latter is known as ''feminine cleaning'', ''feminine wash'' or simply ''bidet''. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the [[anus]] or [[vulva]] by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off.\n\nThe seat-heating feature is very common, found even on toilets that lack the bidet features. As most Japanese homes lack [[central heating]] \u2013 instead using [[space heater|space heating]] \u2013 the bathroom may be only a few degrees above freezing in the winter.<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/><ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/>\n\n===== Customization =====\n{{Anchor| Customization|_cu}}\nMost high-tech toilets allow water temperature and water pressure to be adjusted to match the preferences of the user. By default, the vulva receives less pressure than the anus.  Researchers in Japan have found that most users prefer a water temperature slightly above body temperature, with  {{convert|38|\u00b0C}} considered optimal. The nozzle position can also often be manually adjusted forward or aft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/toto-neorest-750h-toilet-review-and-photos-2017-5|title=I tried the 'Mercedes Benz of toilets' that comes with a remote control and costs $10,200|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Melia |last=Robinson |date=June 1, 2017|access-date=23 November 2017}}</ref> High-end washlets allow selection of vibrating and pulsating jets of water, claimed by manufacturers\nto be beneficial for [[constipation]] and hemorrhoids.<ref name=\"seaweed\"/> The most advanced washlets can mix the water jet with [[soap]] for an improved cleaning process.\n\nThe washlet can replace toilet paper completely, but many users opt to use both wash and paper in combination\u2014although use of paper may be omitted for cleaning of the vulva. Some wipe before washing, some wash before wiping, some wash only, and some wipe only\u2014each according to his/her preference. Another frequent feature is a blow dryer, often adjustable between 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, used to dry the washed areas.<ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/>\n\n===== Advanced features =====\n{{Anchor|Advanced features|_af}}\n[[Image:Wireless toilet control panel w. open lid.jpg|thumb|upright|A high-end wireless toilet control panel with 38 buttons and [[liquid-crystal display]]]]\n\nOther features may include a heated seat, which may be adjustable from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on the location of the user; and an air dryer and deodorizer.<ref>Sara Ito, [http://terrifictoilets.com/toto-neorest-700h/ \"Toto Neorest 700H\"], ''Terrific Toilets'', 02 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/> Some play music to relax the user's [[sphincter]]  (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 ''Fr\u00fchlingslied'' by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic [[air freshener|air deodorizing]], and a germ-resistant surface.<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/><ref name=\"DamnInteresting\"/><ref name=\"HighTech\">\n{{cite news\n |author= Fitzpatrick, M.\n |title=Japanese offer the world hi-tech toilet training.\n |work= Daily Telegraph\n |pages=8\u20139\n |date=May 14, 1998\n }}\n</ref> Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A ''soft close'' feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have [[air conditioning]] below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone standing in front of the toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/>\n\nText explaining the controls of these toilets tends to be in Japanese only. Although many of the buttons often have pictograms, the flush button is often written only in [[Kanji]], meaning that non-Japanese users may initially find it difficult to locate the correct button.\n\nIn January 2017, The Japan Sanitary Equipment Industry Association, a consortium of companies producing plumbing products including [[Toto Ltd.]], [[Panasonic]], and [[Toshiba]], has agreed to unify the iconography used on the often baffling control panels for Japanese toilets.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/17/14306464/japanese-toilet-control-icons-meaning-standard|title=Japanese toilet industry agrees to standardize complex bidet controls|website=The Verge|author=Sam Byford|date=17 January 2017|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref> The toilet manufacturers plan to implement the eight new pictogram on models released from this year onward, with a view to the system becoming an international standard.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://gizmodo.com/japanese-toilet-makers-agree-to-simplify-control-button-1791319522|title=Japanese Toilet Makers Agree to Simplify Control Buttons for Confused Foreigners|publisher=GIZMODO|author=Hudson Hongo|date=18 January 2017|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38660860|title=Japan's hi-tech toilets to get standardised symbols|publisher=BBC|date=18 January 2017|access-date=18 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===== Future developments =====\n{{Anchor|Future developments|_fd}}\nRecently, researchers have added medical sensors into these toilets, which can measure the blood sugar based on the [[urine]], and also measure the pulse, blood pressure, and the body fat content of the user.<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/><ref name=\"High-Tech Toilets\"/> Talking toilets that greet the user have also started being made.<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/> Other measurements are currently being researched.

The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a hand in front of a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a preset time or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to {{convert|20|l}} of water per use.<ref name=\"High-Tech Toilets\"/> However, some women believe that the ''Otohime'' sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the ''Otohime''.<ref name=\"oto\">{{cite web |url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/hitech/toilet/toilet04.html |publisher=Web Japan |title=A Hit with Self-Conscious Women |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref><!--\nPrevious version was archived here https://web.archive.org/web/20061231144419/http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/techno/toilet/women.html but the updated URL is being used as reference instead since the content of the article is the same. {{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/techno/toilet/women.html|publisher=Web Japan|title=Perfecting the Washlet|accessdate=2006-10-30}}-->\n\n=== Toilet slippers ===\n[[Image:JapaneseToiletSlippers.jpg|thumb|upright|A pair of toilet [[slipper]]s]]\nIn Japanese culture, there is a tendency to separate areas into ''clean'' and ''unclean'', and the contact between these areas is minimized. For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the ''unclean'' shoes do not touch the ''clean'' area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an ''unclean'' area. To minimize contact between the ''unclean'' toilet floor and the ''clean'' floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have {{nihongo|''toilet slippers''|\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1|toire surippa}} in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed immediately after leaving the toilet.<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> This also indicates if the toilet is in use. They can be as simple as a pair of rubber slippers, decorated slippers with prints of [[anime]] characters for small children, or even animal fur slippers. A frequent ''faux pas'' of foreigners is to forget to take off the toilet slippers after a visit to the restroom, and then use these in the non-toilet areas, hence mixing the ''clean'' and ''unclean'' areas.<ref name=\"Japanese customs for foreigners\">\n{{cite news\n | title =  Japanese customs for foreigners - part 1: toilet slippers\n | url = http://www.genkijacs.com/blog/index.php?itemid=19\n | publisher = Genki Japanese and Culture School\n | accessdate = 2006-11-13\n\n}}</ref><ref name=\"What's with toilet slippers?\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.aacircle.com.au/forums/f31/toilet-slippers-japan-6064/\n| archive-url = https://archive.is/20090108055340/http://www.aacircle.com.au/forums/f31/toilet-slippers-japan-6064/\n| url-status = dead\n| archive-date = January 8, 2009\n| title =What's with toilet slippers?\n| accessdate = 2006-11-13\n| author = Doug Jardine\n| date = September 5, 2006\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Tokyo gaijin Guide\">\n{{cite web\n | author = Anne R.

Some older public toilet buildings lack doors, meaning that men using the urinals are in full view of people walking past. Beginning in the 1990s, there has been a movement to make public toilets cleaner and more hospitable than they had been in the past.\n\nThe number of public restrooms that have both Western and squat types of toilets is increasing.<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> Many train stations in the Tokyo area and public schools throughout Japan, for example, only have squat toilets. In addition, parks, temples, traditional Japanese restaurants, and older buildings typically only have squat toilets. Western-style toilets are usually indicated by the [[kanji]] characters \u6d0b\u5f0f (y\u014dshiki), the English words \"Western-style\", a symbol for the type of toilet, or any combination of the three. Handicapped bathrooms are always Western style.\n\nMany public toilets do not have soap for washing hands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/opinions/view/japanese-style-toilets-can-be-challenge-for-visitors|title=Japanese-style toilets can be challenge for visitors|last=Eaton|first=Breawna|date=13 July 2013|website=Japan Today|publisher=|access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref> or towels for drying hands. Many people carry a [[handkerchief]] with them for such occasions,<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> and some even carry [[soap]]. Some public toilets are fitted with powerful [[hand dryer]]s to reduce the volume of waste generated from paper towels. Hand dryers and [[Tap (valve)|taps]] are sometimes installed with motion-sensors as an additional resource-saving measure.\n\n== Cultural aspects ==\n\nIn Japan, cleanliness is very important, and some Japanese words for \"clean\" can be used to describe beauty. The word ''kirei'' (\u304d\u308c\u3044, \u7dba\u9e97) can be defined as \"pretty, beautiful; clean; pure; orderly\". This may explain the success of the high-tech toilet with a built-in bidet. There is also a large market for deodorants and air fresheners that add a pleasant scent to the area.\n\nIn the often crowded living conditions of Japanese cities and with the lack of rooms that can be locked from inside in a traditional Japanese house, the toilet is one of the few rooms in the house that allows for privacy. Some toilet rooms are equipped with a bookshelf, in others people may enter with a newspaper, and some are even filled with character goods and posters. Even so, these toilets are, whenever possible, in rooms separate from those for bathing. This is due to the ethic in separating clean from unclean, and this fact is a selling point in properties for rent.<ref name=\"Tokyo Apartments\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://greggman.com/japan/apts/tokyo%20apts.htm\n| title = Tokyo Apartments\n| accessdate = 2006-11-13\n| author = Gregg Mann\n}}\n</ref>\n\nBoth the traditional squat toilet and the high-tech toilet are a source of confusion for foreigners unaccustomed to these devices. There are humorous reports of individuals using a toilet, and randomly pressing buttons on the control panel either out of curiosity or in search for the flushing control, and suddenly to their horror receiving a jet of water directed at the genitals or anus. As the water jet continues for a few seconds after he jumps up, he also gets himself or the bathroom wet.<ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/>{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}<ref name=\"Study of Japanese Toilets\">\n{{Cite journal\n  | author = Lim Tai Wei\n  | title = A Study of Japanese Toilets\n  | publisher = World Toilet Organization\n  | year = 2002\n  | url = http://www.worldtoilet.org/articles/articles_per_japanesetoilets.htm\n  | accessdate =  2006-11-07\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925154718/http://www.worldtoilet.org/articles/articles_per_japanesetoilets.htm |archivedate = September 25, 2006}}\n</ref> Many Japanese toilets now feature pressure-sensitive seats that automatically shut off the bidet when the user arises.

The largest producer is Toto, with 65% of the market share, while the second largest is Inax at 25%.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/><ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/> The main market for washlets is still in Japan, and TOTO reports that overseas sales account for just 5% of its revenue.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> The primary foreign market is [[China]], where Toto sells over one million washlets each year. In the US for example, sales are well below Japanese levels, even though sales improved from 600 units per month in 2001 to 1,000 units per month in 2003. In [[Europe]], Toto sells only 5,000 washlets annually.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> While most Europeans would probably regard Japanese washlets as quite a curiosity, the number of such toilets being installed in Europe is increasing. This is mainly for toilets for the handicapped. Depending on the type of disability, handicapped persons may have difficulties reaching the anus region to clean themselves after toilet use. Hence, the introduction of toilets with a water jet cleaner and blow dryer allows such persons to clean themselves without assistance.\n\nThere are several reasons for low sales outside of Japan. One main reason is that it takes time for customers to get used to the idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were slow when the device was introduced in 1980. After some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet; this number increased to over 50% in 2002.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within a few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms lack a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10\u201315&nbsp;cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30&nbsp;cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are much more expensive than traditional Western toilets.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> In Europe, there is competition of the traditional Western bidet, while North Americans are unaccustomed to bidets.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Nara period toilet paper.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nara period]] wooden scrapers called ''[[ch\u016bgi]]'' with modern [[toilet paper]] rolls in the background for size comparison]]\nDuring the [[J\u014dmon period]] (1400 B.C. to 300 B.C.) settlements were built in a horseshoe shape, with a central plaza in the middle and garbage heaps around the settlement.

A squat toilet differs from a Western toilet in both construction and method of employment. A squat toilet essentially looks like a miniature urinal set horizontally into the floor. Most squat toilets in Japan are made of porcelain, although in some cases (as on trains) stainless steel is used instead. The user squats over the toilet, facing the hemispherical hood, i.e., the wall in the back of the toilet in the picture seen on the right.{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}<ref name = \"AsianToilet\">{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~AD8y-hys/movie.htm\n| title = How to use Japanese style toilet.\n| accessdate = 2006-11-08\n\n}}\n</ref> A shallow trough collects the waste, instead of a large water-filled bowl as in a Western toilet. All other fixtures, such as the water tank, piping, and flushing mechanism, may be identical to those of a Western toilet. Flushing causes water to push the waste matter from the trough into a collecting reservoir which is then emptied, with the waste carried off into the sewer system. The flush is often operated in the same manner as a Western toilet, though some have pull handles or pedals instead. Many Japanese toilets have two kinds of flush: \"small\" (\u5c0f) and \"large\" (\u5927). The difference is in the amount of water used. The former is for urine (in Japanese, literally \"small excretion\") and the latter for feces (\"large excretion\"). The lever is often pushed to the \"small\" setting to provide a continuous covering noise for privacy, as discussed below.\n\nA combination squat/Western toilet also exists, where a seat can be flipped down over a squat toilet, and the toilet can be used essentially the same way as the Western style.<ref name = \"Iwate Handbook\">\n{{cite book\n |author=Julie Parsons\n | title = Iwate Pre-Departure Handbook\n | chapter-url = http://www.handaweb.com/anthony/handbook/toilet.html\n | archive-url = https://archive.is/20120416085518/http://www.handaweb.com/anthony/handbook/toilet.html\n | url-status = dead\n | archive-date = 2012-04-16\n | accessdate = 2006-11-08\n | chapter = \"You call this a toilet?!\" And Other Oddities of Japanese Housing\n | year = 1995\n }}\n</ref> This hybrid seems to be common only in rural areas for the benefit of resident foreigners. Adapters that sit on top of the Japanese toilet to convert it to a functional sit-down toilet are much more common. There are also permanently installed extensions available to convert a squat toilet into a Western-style washlet.\n\n\nThere is a trend in Japan since the 1960s to replace squat toilets at schools and public places with sitting toilets.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nippon.com/en/features/h00360/|title=Japan Phasing Out Squat Toilets|date=8 January 2019|website=Nippon.com|access-date=13 February 2018}}</ref> This trend is thought to accelerate in the run-up to the [[2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics]].<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Western-style ===\n{{Main|Flush toilet}}\nA flush toilet which has a pedestal for sitting is known in Japan as a {{nihongo|''Western-style''|\u6d0b\u5f0f|y\u014dshiki}} toilet.

It has two settings: one for washing the [[anus]] and one for the [[bidet]].<ref name=\"links\"/><ref name=\"High-Tech Toilets\"/> The former is called ''posterior wash'', ''general use'', or ''family cleaning'', and the latter is known as ''feminine cleaning'', ''feminine wash'' or simply ''bidet''. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the [[anus]] or [[vulva]] by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in the toilet seat, and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off.\n\nThe seat-heating feature is very common, found even on toilets that lack the bidet features. As most Japanese homes lack [[central heating]] \u2013 instead using [[space heater|space heating]] \u2013 the bathroom may be only a few degrees above freezing in the winter.<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/><ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/>\n\n===== Customization =====\n{{Anchor| Customization|_cu}}\nMost high-tech toilets allow water temperature and water pressure to be adjusted to match the preferences of the user. By default, the vulva receives less pressure than the anus.  Researchers in Japan have found that most users prefer a water temperature slightly above body temperature, with  {{convert|38|\u00b0C}} considered optimal. The nozzle position can also often be manually adjusted forward or aft.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/toto-neorest-750h-toilet-review-and-photos-2017-5|title=I tried the 'Mercedes Benz of toilets' that comes with a remote control and costs $10,200|work=[[Business Insider]]|first=Melia |last=Robinson |date=June 1, 2017|access-date=23 November 2017}}</ref> High-end washlets allow selection of vibrating and pulsating jets of water, claimed by manufacturers\nto be beneficial for [[constipation]] and hemorrhoids.<ref name=\"seaweed\"/> The most advanced washlets can mix the water jet with [[soap]] for an improved cleaning process.\n\nThe washlet can replace toilet paper completely, but many users opt to use both wash and paper in combination\u2014although use of paper may be omitted for cleaning of the vulva. Some wipe before washing, some wash before wiping, some wash only, and some wipe only\u2014each according to his/her preference. Another frequent feature is a blow dryer, often adjustable between 40&nbsp;\u00b0C and 60&nbsp;\u00b0C, used to dry the washed areas.<ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/>\n\n===== Advanced features =====\n{{Anchor|Advanced features|_af}}\n[[Image:Wireless toilet control panel w. open lid.jpg|thumb|upright|A high-end wireless toilet control panel with 38 buttons and [[liquid-crystal display]]]]\n\nOther features may include a heated seat, which may be adjustable from 30&nbsp;\u00b0C to 40&nbsp;\u00b0C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on the location of the user; and an air dryer and deodorizer.<ref>Sara Ito, [http://terrifictoilets.com/toto-neorest-700h/ \"Toto Neorest 700H\"], ''Terrific Toilets'', 02 May 2018</ref><ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/> Some play music to relax the user's [[sphincter]]  (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 ''Fr\u00fchlingslied'' by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]).

A ''soft close'' feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms the toilet seat only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have [[air conditioning]] below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone standing in front of the toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).<ref name=\"Toilet Nirvana\"/>\n\nText explaining the controls of these toilets tends to be in Japanese only.

This device was shaped like a cone and placed on the floor. However, those were never very popular, and only a few of them remain, including those underneath the now demolished [[National Olympic Stadium (Tokyo)|National Olympic Stadium]] from the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], which was added to accommodate people from a wide range of cultures.<ref name=\"seaweed\"/>\n\n== Japan-specific accessories ==\nToilets in Japan have very similar accessories as most toilets worldwide, including toilet paper, a [[toilet brush]], a sink, etc. However, there are some Japan-specific accessories that are rarely found outside Japan.\n\n=== The ''Sound Princess'' ===\n[[Image:OtoHimeSoundMaker.jpg|thumb|An ''Otohime'' in a women's room: The black square is the motion sensor for starting and stopping the sound]]\nMany Japanese women are embarrassed at the thought of being heard by others during urination<ref name=\"Otohime\">\n{{cite news\n |author=Sapa \n |title=Sound Princess eliminates toilet noises \n |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=29&art_id=qw1096879141756B215 \n |format=http \n |publisher=IOL \n |date=October 4, 2004 \n |accessdate=2006-11-05 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321122957/http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=29&art_id=qw1096879141756B215 \n |archivedate=March 21, 2007 \n}}</ref> (see [[paruresis]]). To cover the sound of bodily functions, many women used to flush public toilets continuously while using them, wasting a large amount of water in the process.<ref name=\"Otohime\"/> As education campaigns did not stop this practice, a device was introduced in the 1980s<ref name=\"High-Tech Toilets\"/> that, after activation, produces the sound of flushing water without the need for actual flushing. A Toto brand name commonly found is the {{nihongo|''Otohime''|\u97f3\u59eb|extra= lit. \"Sound Princess\", also homophone with a legendary goddess [[Otohime]]}}. This device is now routinely placed in most new public women's rooms, and many older public women's rooms have been upgraded.<ref name=\"Otohime\"/> The ''Otohime'' may be either a separate battery-operated device attached to the wall of the toilet, or included in an existing washlet. The device is activated by pressing a button, or by the wave of a hand in front of a motion sensor. When activated, the device creates a loud flushing sound similar to a toilet being flushed. This sound either stops after a preset time or can be halted through a second press on the button. It is estimated that this saves up to {{convert|20|l}} of water per use.<ref name=\"High-Tech Toilets\"/> However, some women believe that the ''Otohime'' sounds artificial and prefer to use a continuous flushing of the toilet instead of the recorded flush of the ''Otohime''.<ref name=\"oto\">{{cite web |url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/hitech/toilet/toilet04.html |publisher=Web Japan |title=A Hit with Self-Conscious Women |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref><!--\nPrevious version was archived here https://web.archive.org/web/20061231144419/http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/techno/toilet/women.html but the updated URL is being used as reference instead since the content of the article is the same. {{cite web|url=http://web-japan.org/kidsweb/techno/toilet/women.html|publisher=Web Japan|title=Perfecting the Washlet|accessdate=2006-10-30}}-->\n\n=== Toilet slippers ===\n[[Image:JapaneseToiletSlippers.jpg|thumb|upright|A pair of toilet [[slipper]]s]]\nIn Japanese culture, there is a tendency to separate areas into ''clean'' and ''unclean'', and the contact between these areas is minimized. For example, the inside of the house is considered a clean area, whereas the outside of the house is considered unclean. To keep the two areas separated, shoes are taken off before entering the house so that the ''unclean'' shoes do not touch the ''clean'' area inside of the house. Historically, toilets were located outside of the house, and shoes were worn for a trip to the toilet. Nowadays, the toilet is almost always inside the home and hygienic conditions have improved significantly, but the toilet is still considered an ''unclean'' area. To minimize contact between the ''unclean'' toilet floor and the ''clean'' floor in the rest of the house, many private homes and also some public toilets have {{nihongo|''toilet slippers''|\u30c8\u30a4\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30c3\u30d1|toire surippa}} in front of the toilet door that should be used when in the toilet and removed immediately after leaving the toilet.<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> This also indicates if the toilet is in use. They can be as simple as a pair of rubber slippers, decorated slippers with prints of [[anime]] characters for small children, or even animal fur slippers. A frequent ''faux pas'' of foreigners is to forget to take off the toilet slippers after a visit to the restroom, and then use these in the non-toilet areas, hence mixing the ''clean'' and ''unclean'' areas.<ref name=\"Japanese customs for foreigners\">\n{{cite news\n | title =  Japanese customs for foreigners - part 1: toilet slippers\n | url = http://www.genkijacs.com/blog/index.php?itemid=19\n | publisher = Genki Japanese and Culture School\n | accessdate = 2006-11-13\n\n}}</ref><ref name=\"What's with toilet slippers?\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.aacircle.com.au/forums/f31/toilet-slippers-japan-6064/\n| archive-url = https://archive.is/20090108055340/http://www.aacircle.com.au/forums/f31/toilet-slippers-japan-6064/\n| url-status = dead\n| archive-date = January 8, 2009\n| title =What's with toilet slippers?\n| accessdate = 2006-11-13\n| author = Doug Jardine\n| date = September 5, 2006\n}}</ref><ref name=\"Tokyo gaijin Guide\">\n{{cite web\n | author = Anne R.

Some older public toilet buildings lack doors, meaning that men using the urinals are in full view of people walking past. Beginning in the 1990s, there has been a movement to make public toilets cleaner and more hospitable than they had been in the past.\n\nThe number of public restrooms that have both Western and squat types of toilets is increasing.<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> Many train stations in the Tokyo area and public schools throughout Japan, for example, only have squat toilets. In addition, parks, temples, traditional Japanese restaurants, and older buildings typically only have squat toilets. Western-style toilets are usually indicated by the [[kanji]] characters \u6d0b\u5f0f (y\u014dshiki), the English words \"Western-style\", a symbol for the type of toilet, or any combination of the three. Handicapped bathrooms are always Western style.\n\nMany public toilets do not have soap for washing hands,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/opinions/view/japanese-style-toilets-can-be-challenge-for-visitors|title=Japanese-style toilets can be challenge for visitors|last=Eaton|first=Breawna|date=13 July 2013|website=Japan Today|publisher=|access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref> or towels for drying hands. Many people carry a [[handkerchief]] with them for such occasions,<ref name=\"japanguide\"/> and some even carry [[soap]]. Some public toilets are fitted with powerful [[hand dryer]]s to reduce the volume of waste generated from paper towels. Hand dryers and [[Tap (valve)|taps]] are sometimes installed with motion-sensors as an additional resource-saving measure.\n\n== Cultural aspects ==\n\nIn Japan, cleanliness is very important, and some Japanese words for \"clean\" can be used to describe beauty. The word ''kirei'' (\u304d\u308c\u3044, \u7dba\u9e97) can be defined as \"pretty, beautiful; clean; pure; orderly\". This may explain the success of the high-tech toilet with a built-in bidet. There is also a large market for deodorants and air fresheners that add a pleasant scent to the area.\n\nIn the often crowded living conditions of Japanese cities and with the lack of rooms that can be locked from inside in a traditional Japanese house, the toilet is one of the few rooms in the house that allows for privacy. Some toilet rooms are equipped with a bookshelf, in others people may enter with a newspaper, and some are even filled with character goods and posters. Even so, these toilets are, whenever possible, in rooms separate from those for bathing. This is due to the ethic in separating clean from unclean, and this fact is a selling point in properties for rent.<ref name=\"Tokyo Apartments\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://greggman.com/japan/apts/tokyo%20apts.htm\n| title = Tokyo Apartments\n| accessdate = 2006-11-13\n| author = Gregg Mann\n}}\n</ref>\n\nBoth the traditional squat toilet and the high-tech toilet are a source of confusion for foreigners unaccustomed to these devices. There are humorous reports of individuals using a toilet, and randomly pressing buttons on the control panel either out of curiosity or in search for the flushing control, and suddenly to their horror receiving a jet of water directed at the genitals or anus. As the water jet continues for a few seconds after he jumps up, he also gets himself or the bathroom wet.<ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/>{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}<ref name=\"Study of Japanese Toilets\">\n{{Cite journal\n  | author = Lim Tai Wei\n  | title = A Study of Japanese Toilets\n  | publisher = World Toilet Organization\n  | year = 2002\n  | url = http://www.worldtoilet.org/articles/articles_per_japanesetoilets.htm\n  | accessdate =  2006-11-07\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060925154718/http://www.worldtoilet.org/articles/articles_per_japanesetoilets.htm |archivedate = September 25, 2006}}\n</ref> Many Japanese toilets now feature pressure-sensitive seats that automatically shut off the bidet when the user arises.

Top-of-the-range washlets, including the ceramic bowl, can easily cost up to US$5,000.<ref>[https://www.wsj.com/articles/smart-toilets-arrive-in-u-s-1401160563 Smart Toilets Arrive in U.S. - WSJ<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n[[Toto Ltd.]] is the largest producer of toilets, including washlets, worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml?xml=/connected/2008/08/31/sv_hitechtoilets.xml&page=2 | title=Japan's hi-tech toilets | last=George | first=Rose | date=29 August 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Washlets and other toilet related products are also produced by [[Lixil Group|Inax]], and [[Panasonic]].\n\nThe total market worldwide for high-tech toilets was about US$800 million in 1997. The largest producer is Toto, with 65% of the market share, while the second largest is Inax at 25%.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/><ref name=\"But Do They Flush\"/> The main market for washlets is still in Japan, and TOTO reports that overseas sales account for just 5% of its revenue.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> The primary foreign market is [[China]], where Toto sells over one million washlets each year. In the US for example, sales are well below Japanese levels, even though sales improved from 600 units per month in 2001 to 1,000 units per month in 2003. In [[Europe]], Toto sells only 5,000 washlets annually.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> While most Europeans would probably regard Japanese washlets as quite a curiosity, the number of such toilets being installed in Europe is increasing. This is mainly for toilets for the handicapped. Depending on the type of disability, handicapped persons may have difficulties reaching the anus region to clean themselves after toilet use. Hence, the introduction of toilets with a water jet cleaner and blow dryer allows such persons to clean themselves without assistance.\n\nThere are several reasons for low sales outside of Japan. One main reason is that it takes time for customers to get used to the idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were slow when the device was introduced in 1980. After some acclimatization, sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet; this number increased to over 50% in 2002.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within a few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms lack a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10\u201315&nbsp;cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30&nbsp;cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are much more expensive than traditional Western toilets.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/> In Europe, there is competition of the traditional Western bidet, while North Americans are unaccustomed to bidets.<ref name=\"super-toilets worldwide\"/>\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:Nara period toilet paper.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Nara period]] wooden scrapers called ''[[ch\u016bgi]]'' with modern [[toilet paper]] rolls in the background for size comparison]]\nDuring the [[J\u014dmon period]] (1400 B.C. to 300 B.C.) settlements were built in a horseshoe shape, with a central plaza in the middle and garbage heaps around the settlement.

{"title_page": "Fleagle Gang", "text_new": "'''The Fleagle Gang''' was a group of early 20th century [[United States|American]] [[bank robber]]s and [[murder]]ers. They were found and executed or killed after robbing the [[First National Bank (Lamar, Colorado)|First National Bank]] in [[Lamar, Colorado]]. Their cases were the first in which the FBI used a single [[fingerprint]] as part of the [[evidence]] leading to a conviction. They were also suspected to have committed a series of previous bank robberies over a 10-year period.\n\n==Planning==\nOn May 23, 1928, Ralph Fleagle, his brother Jake Fleagle, George J. Abshier, (a.k.a. Bill Messick), and Howard \"Heavy\" Royston, came in to [[Lamar, Colorado]]. They planned to rob the [[First National Bank (Lamar, Colorado)|First National Bank]].\n\nThey met at a ranch near [[Marienthal, Kansas]] shortly before the robbery, but Jake Fleagle had planned on robbing the Lamar bank for some time. Like many professional robbers of that time, the Fleagles, together with Abshier, had carefully scouted the bank on several occasions before they decided to commit the crime\n\nThe gang had maps of the roads of [[Prowers County, Colorado]], and the brothers had been inside the bank building and knew its layout. Abshier said they had weighed the \"possibilities\" and decided that it was a job for no less than four men, so they recruited Heavy Royston.\n\nWhen they left Kansas on May 23, about 3 a.m., the men had license plates from [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[California]] to throw any witnesses off their track. Each man was heavily armed.\n\nThe drive took about six hours, but the plan required them to wait until the afternoon to commit the robbery. At about 1 p.m., they went into action.\n\n==The robbery==\nE. A. Lundgren, a one-armed [[bank teller|teller]] at the bank, was waiting on a customer when he saw the men come into the bank and heard one shout, \"You sons-a-bitches get them all up!\" and another yell, \"Hands up!\"\n\nIn the noise and confusion of the moment, Bank President A. N. Parrish ducked into his office and pulled out a [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt 45]] he called \"Old Betsy\" and fired at the closest bank robber from the door to his office, hitting Royston in the jaw, and then, by all, accounts, all hell broke loose.\n\nThe [[bank teller]], William Garrett and Miss Vivian Potter, another bank employee, later said two of the gunmen struggled with customers and most of the gang members were shouting to their victims to either lie down or put their hands up. Abshier, who later confessed to his role in the robbery and its aftermath, recalled:\n\n<blockquote>I grabs hold of the man standing alongside of me, shoved him to the floor; told him to get down. I wanted them out of the way of the bullets.</blockquote>\n\nDuring the struggle, the bank president, A.N. Parrish, shot \"Heavy\" Royston in the face and was, in turn, subsequently shot and killed. Jaddo Parrish, the son of the president, also a bank employee, was killed in the fusillade.\n\nThe bandits loaded their booty&nbsp;\u2014 $10,664 in cash, $12,400 in [[Liberty bond]]s, and almost $200,000 in [[commercial paper]]&nbsp;\u2014 into pillowcases and grabbed two hostages. The original plan had called for the gang to take Jaddo Parrish as hostage, because they felt that his father would not pursue them and risk his son's life, but, when Jaddo was killed, the gunmen took other hostages.\n\n==Escape==\nThe gang, along with hostages Edward A. Lundgren and a teller named Everett Kesinger, headed out to the car by a back door and drove out of town. After fending off the [[sheriff]] in a [[car chase]] that ended at a crossing on Sand Creek northeast of Lamar, where the robbers used rifles to disable the sheriff's car, the gang got away. Ralph Fleagle was driving the 1927 blue [[Buick Master Six]] [[crime scene getaway|getaway]] car.\n\nDuring the car chase the gang released the one-armed teller Lundgren. Kesinger pleaded that he had a wife and new baby, and asked to be let go, but the bandits refused, forcing Kesinger to ride on the floor of the back seat of the car while Royston in the front seat used a pillowcase to catch the blood from his wound.\n\nThe gang arrived back in Kansas by nightfall. Royston, who had been shot by the dead bank president, needed medical attention, so the gang tricked a local doctor into coming out from his [[Dighton, Kansas]] home at night by telling him that a young boy's foot had been crushed by a tractor.\n\nWhen Dr. W. W. Wineinger arrived at the ranch, he discovered the ruse, but treated Royston's wounds. After he finished, the gang bound him up and blindfolded him, took him out of the ranch, shot him in the back of the head with a shotgun, and rolled his body and his Buick into a ravine north of [[Scott City, Kansas]]. The car and doctor's body were spotted from the air by a [[Colorado National Guard]] airplane that had been brought from Denver to aid in the search. Dozens of citizen posses crisscrossed the counties along the Colorado border in search of the getaway car.\n\nThe Fleagle brothers took Kesinger to a shack near [[Liberal, Kansas]] and shot him. The body was discovered about three weeks after the bank robbery.\n\n== Manhunt ==\nThe gang divided the loot and separated, with Abshier driving Royston to Minneapolis, Minnesota to be seen by a dental surgeon. After reaching Minneapolis each man went to a different area of the country with Abshier going to Grand Junction, Colorado, Royston to San Andreas, California, and Ralph to San Francisco, California. It took police about 13 months to track down the owner of the single latent fingerprint left on the windows of Dr. Wineinger's car. Jake was arrested by Detective Paul Quyle after Quyle found a cache of weapons in a house he had rented to Fleagle in [[Stockton, California]] in March 1929. His fingerprints were sent to the Bureau of Investigation (later known as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]) in [[Washington, D.C.]], where they were identified as Jake Fleagle's and connected to the Lamar bank robbery. The Stockton Police had released Jake after fingerprinting. Ralph was arrested first in [[Kankakee, Illinois]], and after flying back to Kansas and being booked in Lamar he was taken to Colorado Springs, where he eventually confessed. Ralph agreed to provide authorities with information about the rest of the gang in exchange for the release of his two brothers Fred and Walt Fleagle. A nationwide manhunt for Jake resulted in his death in a [[shootout]] on a train in [[Branson, Missouri]], in October 1930 after his brother had been [[Hanging|hanged]] in Colorado. Royston was captured at his home in San Andreas, California, and Abshier was arrested in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]].\n\n==Legal process==\nThe three were tried first in Lamar, Colorado, and in a sensational series of trials in October and November 1929, and they were all sentenced to hang.\n\nTheir appeals to the Colorado Supreme Court did not succeed, and the men were executed over a two-week period in mid-July 1930. This was the very first time the FBI used a single fingerprint to convict someone of a crime, and was a major success for the [[FBI]].\n\n==Treasure==\nEven today treasure hunters scour the west looking for the caches of loot supposedly buried by skinflint Ralph Fleagle. Credible rumors, but little proof, abound about unrecovered loot buried in California, Kansas and possibly Missouri.

Betz {{ISBN|978-1-4208-1761-4}} (2005 Authorhouse)\n\n[[Category:American bank robbers]]\n[[Category:1928 in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "'''The Fleagle Gang''' was a group of early 20th century [[United States|American]] [[bank robber]]s and [[murder]]ers. They were found and executed or killed after robbing the [[First National Bank (Lamar, Colorado)|First National Bank]] in [[Lamar, Colorado]]. Their cases were the first in which the FBI used a single [[fingerprint]] as part of the [[evidence]] leading to a conviction. They were also suspected to have committed a series of previous bank robberies over a 10-year period.\n\n==Planning==\nOn May 23, 1928, Ralph Fleagle, his brother Jake Fleagle, George J. Abshier, (a.k.a. Bill Messick), and Howard \"Heavy\" Royston, came in to [[Lamar, Colorado]]. They planned to rob the [[First National Bank (Lamar, Colorado)|First National Bank]].\n\nThey met at a ranch near [[Marienthal, Kansas]] shortly before the robbery, but Jake Fleagle had planned on robbing the Lamar bank for some time. Like many professional robbers of that time, the Fleagles, together with Abshier, had carefully scouted the bank on several occasions before they decided to commit the crime\n\nThe gang had maps of the roads of [[Prowers County, Colorado]], and the brothers had been inside the bank building and knew its layout. Abshier said they had weighed the \"possibilities\" and decided that it was a job for no less than four men, so they recruited Heavy Royston.\n\nWhen they left Kansas on May 23, about 3 a.m., the men had license plates from [[Kansas]], [[Colorado]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[California]] to throw any witnesses off their track. Each man was heavily armed.\n\nThe drive took about six hours, but the plan required them to wait until the afternoon to commit the robbery. At about 1 p.m., they went into action.\n\n==The robbery==\nE. A. Lundgren, a one-armed [[bank teller|teller]] at the bank, was waiting on a customer when he saw the men come into the bank and heard one shout, \"You sons-a-bitches get them all up!\" and another yell, \"Hands up!\"\n\nIn the noise and confusion of the moment, Bank President A. N. Parrish ducked into his office and pulled out a [[Colt Single Action Army|Colt 45]] he called \"Old Betsy\" and fired at the closest bank robber from the door to his office, hitting Royston in the jaw, and then, by all, accounts, all hell broke loose.\n\nThe [[bank teller]], William Garrett and Miss Vivian Potter, another bank employee, later said two of the gunmen struggled with customers and most of the gang members were shouting to their victims to either lie down or put their hands up. Abshier, who later confessed to his role in the robbery and its aftermath, recalled:\n\n<blockquote>I grabs hold of the man standing alongside of me, shoved him to the floor; told him to get down. I wanted them out of the way of the bullets.</blockquote>\n\nDuring the struggle, the bank president, A.N. Parrish, shot \"Heavy\" Royston in the face and was, in turn, subsequently shot and killed. Jaddo Parrish, the son of the president, also a bank employee, was killed in the fusillade.\n\nThe bandits loaded their booty&nbsp;\u2014 $10,664 in cash, $12,400 in [[Liberty bond]]s, and almost $200,000 in [[commercial paper]]&nbsp;\u2014 into pillowcases and grabbed two hostages. The original plan had called for the gang to take Jaddo Parrish as hostage, because they felt that his father would not pursue them and risk his son's life, but, when Jaddo was killed, the gunmen took other hostages.\n\n==Escape==\nThe gang, along with hostages Edward A. Lundgren and a teller named Everett Kesinger, headed out to the car by a back door and drove out of town. After fending off the [[sheriff]] in a [[car chase]] that ended at a crossing on Sand Creek northeast of Lamar, where the robbers used rifles to disable the sheriff's car, the gang got away. Ralph Fleagle was driving the 1927 blue [[Buick Master Six]] [[crime scene getaway|getaway]] car.\n\nDuring the car chase the gang released the one-armed teller Lundgren. Kesinger pleaded that he had a wife and new baby, and asked to be let go, but the bandits refused, forcing Kesinger to ride on the floor of the back seat of the car while Royston in the front seat used a pillowcase to catch the blood from his wound.\n\nThe gang arrived back in Kansas by nightfall. Royston, who had been shot by the dead bank president, needed medical attention, so the gang tricked a local doctor into coming out from his [[Dighton, Kansas]] home at night by telling him that a young boy's foot had been crushed by a tractor.\n\nWhen Dr. W. W. Wineinger arrived at the ranch, he discovered the ruse, but treated Royston's wounds. After he finished, the gang bound him up and blindfolded him, took him out of the ranch, shot him in the back of the head with a shotgun, and rolled his body and his Buick into a ravine north of [[Scott City, Kansas]]. The car and doctor's body were spotted from the air by a [[Colorado National Guard]] airplane that had been brought from Denver to aid in the search. Dozens of citizen posses crisscrossed the counties along the Colorado border in search of the getaway car.\n\nThe Fleagle brothers took Kesinger to a shack near [[Liberal, Kansas]] and shot him. The body was discovered about three weeks after the bank robbery.\n\n==Manhunt==\nThe gang divided the loot and separated, with Abshier driving Royston to Minneapolis, Minnesota to be seen by a dental surgeon. After reaching Minneapolis each man went to a different area of the country with Abshier going to Grand Junction, Colorado, Royston to San Andreas, California, and Ralph to San Francisco, California. It took police about 13 months to track down the owner of the single latent fingerprint left on the windows of Dr. Wineinger's car. Jake was arrested by Detective Paul Quyle after Quyle found a cache of weapons in a house he had rented to Fleagle in [[Stockton, California]] in March 1929. His fingerprints were sent to the Bureau of Investigation (later known as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]) in [[Washington DC]], where they were identified as Jake Fleagle and connected to the Lamar bank robbery. The Stockton Police had released Jake after fingerprinting. Ralph was arrested first in [[Kankakee, Illinois]] and after flying back to Kansas and being booked in Lamar he was taken to Colorado Springs where he eventually confessed. Ralph agreed to provide authorities with information about the rest of the gang in exchange for the release of his two brothers Fred and Walt Fleagle. A nationwide manhunt for Jake resulted in his death in a [[shootout]] on a train in [[Branson, Missouri]], in October 1930 after his brother had been [[hanged]] in Colorado. Royston was captured at his home in San Andreas, California, and Abshier was arrested in [[Grand Junction, Colorado]].\n\n==Legal process==\nThe three were tried first in Lamar, Colorado, and in a sensational series of trials in October and November 1929, and they were all sentenced to hang.\n\nTheir appeals to the Colorado Supreme Court did not succeed, and the men were executed over a two-week period in mid-July 1930. This was the very first time the FBI used a single fingerprint to convict someone of a crime, and was a major success for the [[FBI]].\n\n==Treasure==\nEven today treasure hunters scour the west looking for the caches of loot supposedly buried by skinflint Ralph Fleagle. Credible rumors, but little proof, abound about unrecovered loot buried in California, Kansas and possibly Missouri. There is evidence that Ralph invested much of his money, and possibly owned an apartment building in San Francisco, where he had been living before being arrested in [[Kankakee, Illinois]]. Ralph's wife Margaret was sent away by the Fleagle family shortly after Ralph was hanged in Colorado, but there is no evidence of where she went.\n\n==Sources==\n*''Abshier v.

Lip\u0103, who was part of Romania's [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's eight|women's eight]], won her first in Los Angeles in 1984 followed by gold medals in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004, a record span of 20 years between her first and last gold medal.  It was also her eighth overall, which is more than any other rower, having won a silver and a bronze in 1988 and an additional silver in 1992. In winning her medal at age 39, Lip\u0103 became the oldest rower to win a gold medal and the oldest athlete in an endurance sport to win a gold medal.\n\n[[Image:USA Men's Lightweight Four Athens 2004.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Team USA competes in the lightweight four rowing competition.]]\n\n[[Matthew Pinsent]] also won his fourth consecutive medal, this time without legendary partner [[Steve Redgrave]].  The British men's [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's coxless four|coxless four]] of [[Steve Williams (rower)|Steve Williams]], [[James Cracknell]], [[Ed Coode]] with Pinsent at stroke narrowly saw off the challenge of the World Champion Canadian crew of [[Cameron Baerg]], [[Thomas Herschmiller]], [[Jake Wetzel]] and [[Barney Williams (rower)|Barney Williams]].  It was a dramatic stretch run with the lead literally changing hands with each stroke.  (In rowing, the boat will surge depending on where the rowers are during the stroke. Pinsent would later say that he thought they had won because they were in the best part of the stroke when they crossed the line).  Great Britain won with a time of 6:06.98, just 8/100ths of a second faster than the Canadians.  Pinsent later wept at the medal ceremony.\n\nMatching Lip\u0103's and Pinsent's feat of four consecutive gold medals was German sculler [[Kathrin Boron]] in the [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's quadruple sculls|women's quadruple sculls]].  She had won the doubles event in Barcelona 1992 and Sydney 2000 and the quadruple sculls in Atlanta 1996.\n\nAustralian [[James Tomkins (rower)|James Tomkins]], competing in his fifth games at the age of 39, won his third gold medal, and fourth medal overall, teaming with his longtime partner [[Drew Ginn]] in the [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's coxless pair|men's pair]]. Tomkins and Ginn had been part of the straight four that won the gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], and they had won the 1999 World Championship in the pair, but Ginn had missed the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] with a severe back injury, and Tompkins had finished third with a new partner [[Matthew Long (rower)|Matthew Long]] in the pair.  Tomkins was also the oldest male rower to win an Olympic gold medal, surpassing Steve Redgrave.\n\nNorway's [[Olaf Tufte]] won the [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's single sculls|men's single scull]], and Germany's [[Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski]] won with [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's single sculls|women's single scull]] beating two-time defending Olympic Champion [[Ekaterina Karsten]].\n\nThe Romanian [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's coxless pair|women's pair]] of [[Georgeta Damian]] and [[Viorica Susanu]] took gold before doubling up to help their [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's eight|eight]] take gold, giving Damian her fourth Olympic Gold medal &mdash; having won 2 golds in Sydney in the same disciplines.\n\nThe [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] won the prestigious [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's eight|men's eight]] for the twelfth time overall and the first time since [[Rowing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].  In the second preliminary heat, both the U.S. and Canadian crews broke the previous [[List of world records in rowing|world best time]], with the U.S. winning in 5:19.85, which stood as a world best time until the second World Cup regatta of 2012.<ref>http://www.worldrowing.com/events/2012-worldcup-2/mens-eight/heat/</ref> The United States would go on to win the final.\n\n==Medal

featured 550 competitors taking part in 14 events.<ref name=\"SR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/2004/ROW/ |title=Rowing at the 2004 Athens Summer Games |work=Sports Reference |accessdate=25 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe medals were split among 22 countries, [[Romania]] topping the medal table, their women winning 3 golds, with the traditionally strong [[Germany]], [[Great Britain]] and [[Australia]] picking up four medals in total.\n\nRomania's [[Elisabeta Lip\u0103]] won her fourth consecutive Olympic gold medal and fifth overall.  Lip\u0103, who was part of Romania's [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's eight|women's eight]], won her first in Los Angeles in 1984 followed by gold medals in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004, a record span of 20 years between her first and last gold medal.  It was also her eighth overall, which is more than any other rower, having won a silver and a bronze in 1988 and an additional silver in 1992. In winning her medal at age 39, Lip\u0103 became the oldest rower to win a gold medal and the oldest athlete in an endurance sport to win a gold medal.\n\n[[Image:USA Men's Lightweight Four Athens 2004.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Team USA competes in the lightweight four rowing competition.]]\n\n[[Matthew Pinsent]] also won his fourth consecutive medal, this time without legendary partner [[Steve Redgrave]].  The British men's [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's coxless four|coxless four]] of [[Steve Williams (rower)|Steve Williams]], [[James Cracknell]], [[Ed Coode]] with Pinsent at stroke narrowly saw off the challenge of the World Champion Canadian crew of [[Cameron Baerg]], [[Thomas Herschmiller]], [[Jake Wetzel]] and [[Barney Williams (rower)|Barney Williams]].  It was a dramatic stretch run with the lead literally changing hands with each stroke.  (In rowing, the boat will surge depending on where the rowers are during the stroke. Pinsent would later say that he thought they had won because they were in the best part of the stroke when they crossed the line).  Great Britain won with a time of 6:06.98, just 8/100ths of a second faster than the Canadians.  Pinsent later wept at the medal ceremony.\n\nMatching Lip\u0103's and Pinsent's feat of four consecutive gold medals was German sculler [[Kathrin Boron]] in the [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's quadruple sculls|women's quadruple sculls]].  She had won the doubles event in Barcelona 1992 and Sydney 2000 and the quadruple sculls in Atlanta 1996.\n\nAustralian [[James Tomkins (rower)|James Tomkins]], competing in his fifth games at the age of 39, won his third gold medal, and fourth medal overall, teaming with his longtime partner [[Drew Ginn]] in the [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's coxless pair|men's pair]]. Tomkins and Ginn had been part of the straight four that won the gold medal at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Atlanta Olympics]], and they had won the 1999 World Championship in the pair, but Ginn had missed the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]] with a severe back injury, and Tompkins had finished third with a new partner [[Matthew Long (rower)|Matthew Long]] in the pair.  Tomkins was also the oldest male rower to win an Olympic gold medal, surpassing Steve Redgrave.\n\nNorway's [[Olaf Tufte]] won the [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's single sculls|men's single scull]], and Germany's [[Katrin Rutschow-Stomporowski]] won with [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's single sculls|women's single scull]] beating two-time defending Olympic Champion [[Ekaterina Karsten]].\n\nThe Romanian [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's coxless pair|women's pair]] of [[Georgeta Damian]] and [[Viorica Susanu]] took gold before doubling up to help their [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's eight|eight]] take gold, giving Damian her fourth Olympic Gold medal &mdash; having won 2 golds in Sydney in the same disciplines.\n\nThe [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] won the prestigious [[Rowing at the 2004 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's eight|men's eight]] for the twelfth time overall and the first time since [[Rowing at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]].  In the second preliminary heat, both the U.S. and Canadian crews broke the previous [[List of world records in rowing|world best time]], with the U.S. winning in 5:19.85, which stood as a world best time until the second World Cup regatta of 2012.<ref>http://www.worldrowing.com/events/2012-worldcup-2/mens-eight/heat/</ref> The United States would go on to dominate the final.\n\n==Medal

When Rodan left the group, Zev found another MC, Onyx the Birthstone Kid, to replace Rodan.<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/> [[Artists and repertoire]] representative Dante Ross learned of KMD through the hip hop group [[3rd Bass]] and signed the group to [[Elektra Records]].<ref name=\"wax poetics\">Wax Poetics #9, Interview with Dante Ross</ref> Dumile and KMD's recording debut came on 3rd Bass's song \"The Gas Face\" from ''[[The Cactus Album]]'',<ref name=\"ALLMUSIC\"/> followed in 1991 with KMD's album ''[[Mr. Hood]]'', which became a minor hit through its singles \"Peachfuzz\", \"Who Me?\" and heavy video play on cable TV's ''[[Yo!

The album was shelved before it was released due to its controversial cover art,<ref name=\"wax poetics\"/> which featured a cartoon of a stereotypical [[pickaninny]] or [[Sambo (racial term)|sambo]] character being hanged.

He meanwhile had taken on a new identity, MF Doom, patterned after and wearing a mask similar to that of [[Marvel Comics]] super-villain [[Doctor Doom]], who is depicted rapping on the cover of the 1999 album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]''. The album, in an earlier incarnation, would have been called ''The Super M.F.

In 1999 Fondle 'Em released MF Doom's first full-length [[LP record|LP]], ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'', which included these singles and their b-sides, and additional tracks. Dumile had used the spelling variant \"M.F. Doom\" for the singles' releases, but thereafter changed this to MF Doom. Among the collaborators on these tracks were fellow members of the [[Monsta Island Czars]] collective (The M.I.C.), for which each artist took on the persona of a monster from the [[Godzilla]] mythos. Dumile went by the alias King Geedorah, a three-headed golden dragon space monster, modeled after [[King Ghidorah]], the [[Toho]] movie monster who was a three-headed dragon that often battled [[Godzilla]]. Some of his appearances on the LP are as, and are credited to, this persona instead of that of MF Doom. Dumile would revisit this character later under various name-spellings.\n\nIn 2001, he began working with [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], co-producing [[MC Paul Barman]]'s \"[[Paullelujah!]]\" with MikeTheMusicGuy and [[Phofo]]. In 2002, he appeared on the Sound-Ink's Colapsus collection, on a very hard to find track titled \"Monday Nite at Fluid\", featuring [[Kurious]] with production by King Honey, who also produced some tracks for Dumile's album ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]''.\n\nDumile has produced all the instrumentation tracks for his solo releases, with very few exceptions.<ref name=\"stonesthrow1\">{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/doom/discography|title=MF DOOM Discography|work=Official Doom Discography|accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref> Beginning in 2001, under the \"Metal Fingers\" moniker, Dumile began releasing his ''[[Special Herbs]]'' instrumentals series. Many of these beats can be heard as the instrumentation tracks throughout his body of work. A separate website catalogs for which tracks each instrumental has been used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalfacedoom.com|title=Metal Face Doom Special Herbs etc. series discography|work=metalfacedoom.com}}</ref>\n\n===2002\u20132004: King Geedorah, Viktor Vaughn, Madvillain===\nIn 2003, Dumile released the King Geedorah album ''[[Take Me to Your Leader (King Geedorah album)|Take Me to Your Leader]]''. Geedorah is credited as producer, but only appears as an MC on four tracks. The majority of vocal tracks feature guest MCs, and the album features several instrumental montages of sampled vocals from old movies and TV shows\u2014a technique employed on most of Dumile's albums. Later in 2003, Dumile released the LP ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]'' under the moniker Viktor Vaughn (another play on Doctor Doom, whose \"real name\" is ''Victor von'' Doom). In 2004 he released a follow-up LP under the Viktor Vaughn moniker, ''[[Venomous Villain]]''. Later in 2004, the second MF Doom album ''[[Mm..

Released by [[Stones Throw Records]], the album was a critical and commercial success. MF Doom was seen by mainstream audiences for the first time as Madvillain received publicity and acclaim in publications such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', and ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''. A video for \"All Caps\" and a four-date US tour followed the release of ''Madvillainy''.\n\n===2005\u20132009: Danger Doom and Ghostface collaboration===\nAlthough still an independent artist, MF Doom took a bigger step towards the mainstream in 2005 with ''[[The Mouse and the Mask]]'', a collaboration with producer [[DJ Danger Mouse]] under the group name [[Danger Doom]]. The album, released on 11 October 2005 by [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] and [[Lex Records|Lex]], was done in collaboration with [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] and featured voice-actors and characters from its programs (mostly ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'').

In 1999 Fondle 'Em released MF Doom's first full-length [[LP record|LP]], ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'', which included these singles and their b-sides, and additional tracks. Dumile had used the spelling variant \"M.F. Doom\" for the singles' releases, but thereafter changed this to MF Doom. Among the collaborators on these tracks were fellow members of the [[Monsta Island Czars]] collective (The M.I.C.), for which each artist took on the persona of a monster from the [[Godzilla]] mythos. Dumile went by the alias King Geedorah, a three-headed golden dragon space monster, modeled after [[King Ghidorah]], the [[Toho]] movie monster who was a three-headed dragon that often battled [[Godzilla]].

In 2002, he appeared on the Sound-Ink's Colapsus collection, on a very hard to find track titled \"Monday Nite at Fluid\", featuring [[Kurious]] with production by King Honey, who also produced some tracks for Dumile's album ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]''.\n\nDumile has produced all the instrumentation tracks for his solo releases, with very few exceptions.<ref name=\"stonesthrow1\">{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/doom/discography|title=MF DOOM Discography|work=Official Doom Discography|accessdate=2012-11-10}}</ref> Beginning in 2001, under the \"Metal Fingers\" moniker, Dumile began releasing his ''[[Special Herbs]]'' instrumentals series.

Geedorah is credited as producer, but only appears as an MC on four tracks.

Later in 2003, Dumile released the LP ''[[Vaudeville Villain]]'' under the moniker Viktor Vaughn (another play on Doctor Doom, whose \"real name\" is ''Victor von'' Doom).

The album, released on 11 October 2005 by [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] and [[Lex Records|Lex]], was done in collaboration with [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] and featured voice-actors and characters from its programs (mostly ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'').
