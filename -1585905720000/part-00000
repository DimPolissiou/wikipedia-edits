After featuring in one more match against [[Tiger Ali Singh]] at Penn State in Pennsylvania, Regal was sent to a training camp run by [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] in order to get into shape. On his last day, he twisted his ankle in a match against [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhyno]] and upon returning home aggravated this injury falling in his bathroom, breaking his ankle and leg.\n\nDuring this time, Regal was suffering from an addiction to [[gamma-Butyrolactone|Renewtrient]], pain medication and [[Diazepam|valium]] and was not seen on WWF television until he returned that fall with a \"Real Man's Man\" builder/lumberjack style looking gimmick created by [[Vince Russo]] that was based on the image of The Brawny Man.<ref name=\"RingsideMag\" /> Vignettes for the character showed him doing \"manly\" things like chopping wood, shaving with a [[straight razor]] and squeezing his own [[orange juice]]. After he made his full-time debut in October 1998, he faced [[Sean Waltman|X-Pac]] in the opening round of the tournament for the vacant [[WWE Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]],<ref name=\"RingsideMag\" /> ending in a double [[Professional wrestling|countout]] and thus eliminating both men from the tournament.\n\nRegal then began a feud with [[Charles Wright (wrestler)|The Godfather]], but he was taken off television soon after before subsequently checking into rehab in January 1999 and was released from the WWF in April.<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/w/william-regal.html|title=William Regal Profile|accessdate=20 March 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref>\n\n=== Return to WCW (1999\u22122000) ===\nAfter checking out of rehab, Matthews was invited back into the wrestling world, making a somewhat brief return to WCW as \"Lord Steven Regal\". His official pay-per-view return took place during [[Bash at the Beach (1999)|Bash at the Beach]], where he was one of many participants in the first [[Hardcore wrestling|Hardcore Invitational]]. The following night on ''Nitro'', Regal, accompanied by both [[Dave Finlay|Fit Finlay]] and [[Dave Taylor (wrestler, born 1957)|Dave Taylor]], fought [[Billy Kidman]]. Despite outside help from Finlay and Taylor, Regal was unable to pick up the win. Two weeks later, he faced [[Mikey Whipwreck]], but [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] came out to challenge [[The Blue Bloods]] at [[Road Wild (1999)|Road Wild]] for the Hardcore Trophy, causing Regal to lose the match. Nothing came of this challenge as neither the First Family or the Blue Bloods were featured on the Road Wild card. Similar to his previous run, much of Regal's performances took place in tag team bouts. Regal continued his role as a rule breaking villain and had small feuds with teams such as [[The Filthy Animals]]. In late February 2000, Regal lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Loser Leaves Town match|career vs. career match]] against [[Jim Duggan]] on ''Saturday Night'' for the World Television Championship, which was done in order to explain Regal's release from the company.\n\n=== Return to the WWF/E ===\n==== European Champion (2000\u20132001) ====\n{{main|The Invasion (professional wrestling)|l1=The Invasion|The Alliance (professional wrestling)|l2=The Alliance}}\n[[File:William-Regal-Entrance,-RLA-Melb-10.11.2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Regal during his ring entrance wearing his traditional robe (pictured here in 2007)]]\nRegal was once again hired by the WWF and sent to the developmental territory [[Memphis Championship Wrestling]] (MCW) for a short time.

It was interrupted before Regal was even able to enter the ring by [[The Mexicools]]. His first full match as part of the roster was a loss to [[Chris Benoit]] in a [[catch wrestling]] match on 16 July episode of ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''. On 4 August, Regal was scheduled to go one on one with [[Scotty 2 Hotty]], but the Mexicools came in and attacked both men. Two weeks later, they teamed up on ''SmackDown!'' against [[Psicosis]] and [[Super Crazy]] with [[Juventud Guerrera|Juventud]] in their corner. Halfway through the match, Regal betrayed Scotty by refusing to tag him and walked out of the ring with a smirk on his face, turning heel as a result and allowing the Mexicools to pick up the win. Two days later, Regal cut a promo telling the crowd that he had returned to his former self, referring to himself as a \"scoundrel\" and a \"rogue\". The [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Promo|promo]] ended when Scotty ran to the ring and attacked Regal. The following week, a match between the two was cut short when the debuting [[Paul Burchill]] interfered to aid his countryman. Regal went on to take Burchill under his wing and tag with him on the hunt for the [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|WWE Tag Team Championship]], but the team's biggest exposure was a loss in a handicap match against [[Bobby Lashley]] at [[Armageddon (2005)|Armageddon]].\n\nOn 3 February 2006 episode of ''SmackDown!'', Regal and Burchill told the \"network representative\" [[Brian Mailhot|Palmer Canon]] that they no longer wanted to be a tag team so they could go their separate ways. During this discussion, Burchill informed Canon that his family heritage traced back to the [[Piracy|pirate]] [[Blackbeard]] and that he wanted to turn this into a pirate [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Gimmick|gimmick]].<ref name=\"RingsideMag\"/> Burchill, with this heroic persona, started a rivalry with former teammate Regal, who tried to convince Burchill to return to his ruthless ways.

Soon after [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]] became King Booker after becoming [[King of the Ring (2006)|King of the Ring]], Regal joined King Booker's Court by playing the role of a [[town crier]]. As a member of the Court, Regal helped Booker in his feud against Bobby Lashley, occasionally teaming up with fellow Court member [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] in tag team matches. However, during this time he also feuded with Finlay for the United States Championship. Regal was knighted by King Booker and was given the title of \"Sir\".<ref name=\"RingsideMag\"/> At [[No Mercy (2006)|No Mercy]], Regal lost to a returning Chris Benoit, resulting in him turning his back on the Court afterwards by knocking down King Booker with a punch to the face after Booker slapped him and called him useless. During the broadcast, Regal was involved in a backstage segment with [[Vito LoGrasso|Vito]] in which he accidentally exposed his [[Human penis|penis]] for a brief second.<ref name=\"nomercy06\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/exclusives/3448980|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703183036/http://www.wwe.com/shows/nomercy/exclusives/3448980|archivedate=3 July 2007|title=WWE Apologizes|publisher=WWE|date=9 October 2006|accessdate=9 October 2006}}</ref>\n\nTwelve days after No Mercy, Regal stated that while he had once been one of the world's greatest wrestlers, he had since become a doormat for other SmackDown wrestlers. He referred to being dressed as a buxom wench for a pirate, the aforementioned locker room incident with Vito and being knighted by a false king as examples. After announcing he was finished being a whipping boy, he introduced his old tag team partner Dave Taylor and the two went on to easily defeat the team of Scotty 2 Hotty and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Though the pair reformed their previous tag team, they did not reuse the Blue Bloods gimmick and instead portrayed themselves as sadistic fighters. However, the team was quickly put into jeopardy in their second match together when Taylor suffered a torn [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his left knee, leaving him injured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/smackdown/archive/10242006/mainarticle|title=Mutiny|publisher=WWE|date=27 October 2006|accessdate=6 January 2009}}</ref> Taylor took a more relaxed role for a couple of weeks as a corner man for Regal and only wrestled in a few short house show matches. Taylor quickly healed from his injury and the pair feuded with the WWE Tag Team Champions [[Paul London and Brian Kendrick]].

On New Year's Eve, [[Triple H]] was scheduled to face [[Ric Flair]] in which Flair's win or retire ultimatum was still active. Regal announced that if Triple H lost the match in any way, he would not participate in the [[Royal Rumble#Match|Royal Rumble match]] at the [[Royal Rumble (2008)|2008 Royal Rumble]]. This was to give Triple H a reason to want to win the match rather than avoid ending the career of his best friend and idol.

A few weeks later, Regal made the Raw [[Elimination Chamber]] match for [[No Way Out (2008)|No Way Out]]. He later faced Randy Orton in a match during the European tour to try to teach him some respect. The following week, Regal won the [[King of the Ring (2008)|2008 King of the Ring tournament]] on a special three-hour ''Raw'', where he defeated Hornswoggle, [[Dave Finlay|Finlay]] and [[CM Punk]] all by submission, becoming the first man to make Punk submit.<ref name=\"KOTR\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/04212008/mainarticle|accessdate=6 July 2008|last=Adkins|first=Greg|title=Party Crasher|publisher=WWE}}</ref> Regal's coronation ceremony the next week was interrupted by the returning [[Ken Anderson (wrestler)|Mr. Kennedy]].

When he started learning violin in the Violin School Suzuki Shinichi at the age of four, he found his passion in music.

Hisaishi collaborated with [[Minimalist music|minimalist artists]] as a typesetter, furthering his experience in the musical world.\n\nHe enjoyed his first success of the business in 1974 when he composed music for the anime series called ''[[First Human Giatrus|Gyatoruzu]]''. This and other early works were created under his given name. During this period, he composed for ''Sasuga no Sarutobi'' (Academy of Ninja) and ''[[Futari Daka]]'' (A Full Throttle).\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Japanese popular music]], [[electronic music]], and new-age music flourished; those genres, as well as the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (a Japanese electronic band in 1978\u20131983), influenced Hisaishi's compositions. He developed his music from [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] ideas and expanded toward orchestral work. Around 1975, Hisaishi presented his first public performance, spreading his name around his community. Also, from 1978, he had worked for Brass Compositions for a long time. His first album, ''MKWAJU'', was released in 1981, with ''Information'' being released a year later. His first major anime scores were ''Hajime Ningen Gyatoruz'' (1974) and ''Robokko Beeton'' (1976).\n\nAs his works were becoming well known, Hisaishi formulated an alias inspired by [[Quincy Jones]], an African-American musician and producer. Retranscribed in Japanese, \"Quincy Jones\" became \"Joe Hisaishi\". (\"Quincy\", pronounced \"Kuinsh\u012b\u201d in Japanese, can be written using the same [[kanji]] in \"Hisaishi\"; \"Joe\" comes from \"Jones\".)<ref>[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/hisaishi/ Joe Hisaishi// Who's Who //] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128025222/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/hisaishi/|date=November 28, 2013}}.

Retrieved on 2015-08-18.</ref>\n\n===1981\u201398: Anime film industry===\nIn 1981 Hisaishi, with his new name, released his first album of art music, ''MKWAJU'', and in 1982 the electropop-minimalist album ''Information''. Then, in 1983, Hisaishi was recommended by Tokuma, who had published ''Information'', to create an image album for ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]''. Hisaishi and the director of the animated film, [[Hayao Miyazaki]], became great friends and would work together on many future projects.\n\nIn 1985, he founded his own recording studio\u2014the wonder station. Their collaboration has invited comparisons to the collaborations of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[John Williams]]. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]'' would be the first feature to appear under the Studio Ghibli banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/17384/looking-back-at-laputa-castle-in-the-sky|title=Looking back at Laputa: Castle In The Sky|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312023108/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/17384/looking-back-at-laputa-castle-in-the-sky|archivedate=March 12, 2018}}</ref> And later, in the 1990s, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' were released. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding [[anime]] industry's top musical contributors, his compositions (including eight theatrical films and one [[Original video animation|OAV]]) would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the 1980s and 1990s. Hisaishi also composed for such TV and movie hits as ''Sasuga no Sarutobi'', ''Two Down Full Base'', ''Tonde Mon Pe'' and the anime [[Techno Police 21C|''Tekuno porisu 21C'']] (all 1982), ''Sasuraiger'' (1983), ''[[Futari Daka|Futari Taka]]'' (1984), [[Hon\u014d no Alpen Rose: Judy & Randy|''Hon\u014d no Alpen Rose'']] (1985) and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1986 TV series)|Oz no mah\u00f4tsukai]]'' (1986). He also scored the sci-fi adventure series ''[[Mospeada]]'' (1983), which was later reworked (without his music) into the third segment of Carl Macek's compilation, ''[[Robotech]]''.

Lesser known are the other musical roles he plays; he is also a [[typesetter]], author, arranger, and conductor.\n\nHe has been associated with animator [[Hayao Miyazaki]] since 1984, having composed scores for all but one of his films. He is also recognized for the soundtracks he has provided for filmmaker [[Takeshi Kitano|'Beat' Takeshi Kitano]], including ''[[A Scene at the Sea]]'' (1991), ''[[Sonatine (1993 film)|Sonatine]]'' (1993), ''[[Kids Return]]'' (1996), ''[[Hana-bi]]'' (1997), ''[[Kikujiro]]'' (1999), and ''[[Dolls (2002 film)|Dolls]]'' (2002), as well for the video game series ''[[Ni no Kuni]]''. He was a student of legendary anime composer [[Takeo Watanabe]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}<!-- Note that BBC Music uses content from Wikipedia. -->\n\n==Life and career==\n===Early life===\nHisaishi was born in [[Nakano, Nagano]], Japan, as {{Nihongo|Mamoru Fujisawa|\u85e4\u6fa4 \u5b88|Fujisawa Mamoru}}. When he started learning violin in the Violin School Suzuki Shinichi at the age of four, he found his passion in music. At the same age, he also began watching 300 movies a year with his father, which influenced his career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lovejapanese.com.au/joe-hisaishi-studio-ghibli-music-composer/|title=Joe Hisaishi - The Composer Behind Studio Ghibli Songs & Music|last=Japanese|first=Love|date=2018-08-12|website=Love Japanese - Japanese Language & Culture Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Realizing his love, he attended the [[Kunitachi College of Music]] in 1969 to major in [[music composition]]. Hisaishi collaborated with [[Minimalist music|minimalist artists]] as a typesetter, furthering his experience in the musical world.\n\nHe enjoyed his first success of the business in 1974 when he composed music for the anime series called ''[[First Human Giatrus|Gyatoruzu]]''. This and other early works were created under his given name. During this period, he composed for ''Sasuga no Sarutobi'' (Academy of Ninja) and ''[[Futari Daka]]'' (A Full Throttle).\n\nIn the 1970s, [[Japanese popular music]], [[electronic music]], and new-age music flourished; those genres, as well as the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] (a Japanese electronic band in 1978\u20131983), influenced Hisaishi's compositions. He developed his music from [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] ideas and expanded toward orchestral work. Around 1975, Hisaishi presented his first public performance, spreading his name around his community. Also, from 1978, he had worked for Brass Compositions for a long time. His first album, ''MKWAJU'', was released in 1981, with ''Information'' being released a year later. His first major anime scores were ''Hajime Ningen Gyatoruz'' (1974) and ''Robokko Beeton'' (1976).\n\nAs his works were becoming well known, Hisaishi formulated an alias inspired by [[Quincy Jones]], an African-American musician and producer. Retranscribed in Japanese, \"Quincy Jones\" became \"Joe Hisaishi\". (\"Quincy\", pronounced \"Kuinsh\u012b\u201d in Japanese, can be written using the same [[kanji]] in \"Hisaishi\"; \"Joe\" comes from \"Jones\".)<ref>[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/hisaishi/ Joe Hisaishi// Who's Who //] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128025222/http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/hisaishi/|date=November 28, 2013}}.

Retrieved on 2015-08-18.</ref>\n\n===1981\u201398: Anime film industry===\nIn 1981 Hisaishi, with his new name, released his first album of art music, ''MKWAJU'', and in 1982 the electropop-minimalist album ''Information''. Then, in 1983, Hisaishi was recommended by Tokuma, who had published ''Information'', to create an image album for ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]''. Hisaishi and the director of the animated film, [[Hayao Miyazaki]], became great friends and would work together on many future projects.\n\nIn 1985, he founded his own recording studio\u2014the wonder station. Their collaboration has invited comparisons to the collaborations of [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[John Williams]]. This big break led to Hisaishi's overwhelming success as a composer of film scores. In 1986, ''[[Laputa: Castle in the Sky]]'' would be the first feature to appear under the Studio Ghibli banner, and its gentle, faintly melancholic tone would become a familiar trademark of much of the studio's later output.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/17384/looking-back-at-laputa-castle-in-the-sky|title=Looking back at Laputa: Castle In The Sky|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312023108/http://www.denofgeek.com/us/movies/17384/looking-back-at-laputa-castle-in-the-sky|archivedate=March 12, 2018}}</ref> And later, in the 1990s, ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' and ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' were released. As Hisaishi strengthened his reputation as one of the budding [[anime]] industry's top musical contributors, his compositions (including eight theatrical films and one [[Original video animation|OAV]]) would proceed to become some of the very hallmarks of early anime in the 1980s and 1990s. Hisaishi also composed for such TV and movie hits as ''Sasuga no Sarutobi'', ''Two Down Full Base'', ''Tonde Mon Pe'' and the anime [[Techno Police 21C|''Tekuno porisu 21C'']] (all 1982), ''Sasuraiger'' (1983), ''[[Futari Daka|Futari Taka]]'' (1984), [[Hon\u014d no Alpen Rose: Judy & Randy|''Hon\u014d no Alpen Rose'']] (1985) and ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1986 TV series)|Oz no mah\u00f4tsukai]]'' (1986). He also scored the sci-fi adventure series ''[[Mospeada]]'' (1983), which was later reworked (without his music) into the third segment of Carl Macek's compilation, ''[[Robotech]]''. Other films he scored included ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam|Mobile Suit Gundam Movie II: Soldiers of Sorrow]]'' (1981), ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam|Mobile Suit Gundam Movie III: Encounters in Space]]'', (1982), ''[[Birth (anime)|Birth (B\u00e2su)]]'' (1984), ''[[Arion (anime)|Arion]]'' (1986), ''[[Robot Carnival]]'' (1987), ''[[My Neighbor Totoro|Totoro]]'' (1988), ''[[Crest of the Royal Family]]'' and ''[[Maison Ikkoku|Maison Ikkoku \u2013 Apartment Fantasy]]'' (both 1988), ''[[Venus Wars]]'' (1989), ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'' (1989), ''[[Porco Rosso]]'' (1992) and ''[[Ocean Heaven]]'' (2010). He also did theme song arrangements and composed other anime opening, closing, and insert title theme songs such as ''[[Lalabel|Mah\u014d Sh\u014djo Lalabel]]'' (1980), ''[[Hello! Sandybell]]'' (1981), ''[[Meiken Jolie]]'' (1981), ''[[Voltron]]'' (1981), ''[[Ai Shite Knight]]'' (1983), ''[[Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel|Creamy Mami, the Magic Angel: Curtain Call]]'' (1986), and ''[[Kimagure Orange Road: The Movie]]'' (1988).\n\nAs more exposure was given to Hisaishi and the [[anime]] industry, his career grew. He initiated a solo career, began to produce music, and created his own label (Wonder Land Inc.) in 1988. A year later, Hisaishi released his solo album ''Pretender'' as the first album under the new label.\n\n===1998\u20132004: Worldwide success===\nIn 1998, Hisaishi provided the soundtrack to the [[1998 Winter Paralympics]]. The following year, he composed the music for the third installment in a series of popular computer-animated educational films about the human body. Again in 1999, he composed the score for the Takeshi Kitano film ''[[Kikujiro]]'', whose title track ''Summer'' went on to become one of Hisaishi's most recognizable compositions.\n\nIn 2001, Hisaishi produced music for another Kitano film, ''Brother'', and Hayao Miyazaki's animated film, ''[[Spirited Away]]''. He also served as executive producer of the Night Fantasia 4 Movement at the Japan Expo in Fukushima 2001. On October 6, Hisaishi made his debut as a film director in ''Quartet'', having also written both its music and script. The film received excellent reviews at the [[Montreal Film Festival]]. His first soundtrack for a foreign film, ''Le Petit Poucet'', was released in the same year.\n\n[[File:Joe Hisaishi in Krakow.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Hisaishi in Krak\u00f3w, 2011]]\n\nAnother Miyazaki film, ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'', for which Hisaishi composed the score, was released on November 20, 2004, in Japan. From November 3 to 29, 2004, Hisaishi embarked on his \"Joe Hisaishi Freedom \u2013 Piano Stories 2004\" tour with Canadian musicians. In 2005, he composed the soundtrack for the Korean film, ''[[Welcome to Dongmakgol]]'' ({{lang|ja|\uc6f0\ucef4 \ud22c \ub3d9\ub9c9\uace8}}). He also partook in Korea's historically landmarked big budget drama series production by composing the soundtrack for Korea's MBC drama series, ''[[The Legend (TV series)|The Legend]]'' ({{lang|ja|\ud0dc\uc655\uc0ac\uc2e0\uae30}} \"The Story of the First King's Four Gods\"), which released in 2007. Hisaishi has a large fan base in Korea due to the popularity of Miyazaki films.\n\n===2006\u20132013===\nIn 2006, Hisaishi released a studio album, ''Asian X.T.C.'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vgmdb.net/album/24637|title=UPCI-1051 {{!}} Asian X.T.C. / Joe Hisaishi - VGMdb|website=vgmdb.net|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> the compositions of which demonstrated a significantly eclectic and contemporary Eastern style.

It stars [[Elsie Fisher]] as Kayla, a [[middle school]] teenager who struggles with [[anxiety]] but strives to gain social acceptance from her peers on their final week of [[eighth grade]]. To cope, she publishes [[Vlog|video blogs]] as a self-styled motivational advice-giver, though spends much of her time obsessing over [[social media]]. This frustrates Kayla's otherwise supportive father ([[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]]), whom she alienates despite his wish to be present in her life as her sole parent.\n\nThe film is Burnham's feature-length debut as a writer and director. He began the screenplay in 2014 to reflect on his own anxiety and [[panic attack]]s stemming from his career as a [[comedian]]. Deciding to convey his experience through Kayla, he also wanted to explore how [[Generation Z|her generation]] cope with mental illness, grow with the presence of social media, navigate [[sexuality]] and [[Sexual consent|consent]], relate to their parents and develop their [[Self-awareness|sense of self]]. Burnham aimed for realism, casting actual eighth graders \u2014 including lead actress Fisher \u2014 who informed his script and directing. For research, he watched vlogs from teenagers on [[YouTube]], where he also discovered Fisher. [[Independent film|Independently financed]] with a small $2 million budget, production took place in 2017, in the suburban town of [[Suffern, New York]].\n\n''Eighth Grade'' premiered on January 19, 2018 at [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was later given wide theatrical release in the United States on July 13, 2018 by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. Instead of appealing the Motion Picture Association of America's [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film rating|R (Restricted)]] rating of the film, A24 and Burnham arranged free all-ages theatrical screenings in every state to let their young intended audience to more easily see it.\n\nUpon release, the film was a critical and commercial success. Burnham's writing, direction and Fisher's performance drew the most praise from critics, while domestic box office sales topped $13.5 million. The filmmakers won [[List of accolades received by Eighth Grade|many awards and nominations]], with Burnham winning both [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2018|Writers Guild]] and [[71st Directors Guild of America Awards|Directors Guild of America]] Awards, and Fisher nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress and winning the [[Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor|Gotham Award for Breakthrough Actor]]. At years' end, the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018|National Board of Review]] and the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] each chose ''Eighth Grade''  as one of the top-ten films of 2018, with the former naming Burnham's film as the year's Best Directorial Debut.\n\n==Plot==\nKayla Day is an [[eighth grade]] student finishing her final week at Miles Grove Middle School, a public school in the state of New York. She posts motivational videos on [[YouTube]] about confidence and self-image that get little to no views. Shy and struggling to make friends at school, she is voted \"Most Quiet\" by her classmates. Meanwhile, Mark, her single father, struggles to connect with her and break her reliance on social media.\n\nShe is invited to a pool party hosted by her classmate, Kennedy, who has done so only after being forced by her mother. At the party, Kayla has an [[panic attack]] in the bathroom but eventually goes outside to swim, where she meets Gabe, Kennedy's eccentric cousin. After trying to leave the party, Kayla has an awkward encounter with her crush, Aiden, who suggests that she rejoin the group. She overcomes her fear and volunteers to sing karaoke.\n\nHearing that Aiden broke up with his last girlfriend because she refused to send him nude photos, Kayla mentions to him in passing that she has a dirty photos folder on her phone, a fabricated story that piques his interest. He asks if she gives [[Fellatio|blowjobs]], and she says yes, unsure of what to say. She later looks up oral-sex instructions online and is disgusted.\n\nKayla attends a [[high school]] shadow program, where she meets Olivia, a friendly twelfth grader who shows her around the high school. Olivia gives Kayla her number, and she later invites Kayla to visit the [[Palisades Center|mall]] with some of her friends. They have a good time, though Kayla spots her father spying from afar and, embarrassed, tells him to leave. Olivia's friend Riley gives Kayla a ride home late at night. He initiates an awkward game of [[truth or dare]] where he asks about her sexual experience, takes off his shirt, and asks her to remove hers. She refuses, and he backs off, angrily claiming he was just trying to help her gain some experience. Kayla breaks down at home and is comforted by her father. She makes a video announcing that she intends to stop making videos, as she is not the person she pretends to be and feels unfit to give advice.\n\nKayla then opens a time capsule she created for herself in [[sixth grade]]. She watches a video she made where her past self asks questions about her current friends and love life. She asks her dad to help her burn the time capsule and asks if she makes him sad. He says that she fills him with pride and he could never be sad about her, and she hugs him tightly.\n\nAt graduation, Kayla rebukes Kennedy for ignoring her thank-you letter and acting indifferent towards her despite Kayla's attempts to be nice.

[[Bo Burnham]]. It stars [[Elsie Fisher]] as Kayla, a [[middle school]] teenager who struggles with [[anxiety]] but strives to gain social acceptance from her peers on their final week of [[eighth grade]]. To cope, she publishes [[Vlog|video blogs]] as a self-styled motivational advice-giver, though spends much of her time obsessing over [[social media]]. This frustrates Kayla's otherwise supportive father ([[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]]), whom she alienates despite his wish to be present in her life as her sole parent.\n\nThe film is Burnham's feature-length debut as a writer and director. He began the screenplay in 2014 to reflect on his own anxiety and [[panic attack]]s stemming from his career as a [[comedian]]. Deciding to convey his experience through Kayla, he also wanted to explore how [[Generation Z|her generation]] cope with mental illness, grow with the presence of social media, navigate [[sexuality]] and [[Sexual consent|consent]], relate to their parents and develop their [[Self-awareness|sense of self]]. Burnham aimed for realism, casting actual eighth graders \u2014 including lead actress Fisher \u2014 who informed his script and directing. For research, he watched vlogs from teenagers on [[YouTube]], where he also discovered Fisher. [[Independent film|Independently financed]] with a small $2 million budget, production took place in 2017, in the suburban town of [[Suffern, New York]].\n\n''Eighth Grade'' premiered on January 19, 2018 at [[Sundance Film Festival]]. It was later given wide theatrical release in the United States on July 13, 2018 by [[A24 (company)|A24]]. Instead of appealing the Motion Picture Association of America's [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#MPAA film rating|R (Restricted)]] rating of the film, A24 and Burnham arranged free all-ages theatrical screenings in every state to let their young intended audience to more easily see it.\n\nUpon release, the film was a critical and commercial success. Burnham's writing, direction and Fisher's performance drew the most praise from critics, while domestic box office sales topped $13.5 million. The filmmakers won [[List of accolades received by Eighth Grade|many awards and nominations]], with Burnham winning both [[Writers Guild of America Awards 2018|Writers Guild]] and [[71st Directors Guild of America Awards|Directors Guild of America]] Awards, and Fisher nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] for Best Actress and winning the [[Gotham Independent Film Award for Breakthrough Actor|Gotham Award for Breakthrough Actor]]. At years' end, the [[National Board of Review Awards 2018|National Board of Review]] and the [[American Film Institute Awards 2018#Top 10 Films|American Film Institute]] each chose ''Eighth Grade''  as one of the top-ten films of 2018, with the former naming Burnham's film as the year's Best Directorial Debut.\n\n==Plot==\nKayla Day is an [[eighth grade]] student finishing her final week at Miles Grove Middle School, a public school in the state of New York. She posts motivational videos on [[YouTube]] about confidence and self-image that get little to no views. Shy and struggling to make friends at school, she is voted \"Most Quiet\" by her classmates. Meanwhile, Mark, her single father, struggles to connect with her and break her reliance on social media.\n\nShe is invited to a pool party hosted by her classmate, Kennedy, who has done so only after being forced by her mother. At the party, Kayla has an [[panic attack]] in the bathroom but eventually goes outside to swim, where she meets Gabe, Kennedy's eccentric cousin. After trying to leave the party, Kayla has an awkward encounter with her crush, Aiden, who suggests that she rejoin the group. She overcomes her fear and volunteers to sing karaoke.\n\nHearing that Aiden broke up with his last girlfriend because she refused to send him nude photos, Kayla mentions to him in passing that she has a dirty photos folder on her phone, a fabricated story that piques his interest. He asks if she gives [[Fellatio|blowjobs]], and she says yes, unsure of what to say. She later looks up oral-sex instructions online and is disgusted.\n\nKayla attends a [[high school]] shadow program, where she meets Olivia, a friendly twelfth grader who shows her around the high school. Olivia gives Kayla her number, and she later invites Kayla to visit the [[Palisades Center|mall]] with some of her friends. They have a good time, though Kayla spots her father spying from afar and, embarrassed, tells him to leave. Olivia's friend Riley gives Kayla a ride home late at night. He initiates an awkward game of [[truth or dare]] where he asks about her sexual experience, takes off his shirt, and asks her to remove hers. She refuses, and he backs off, angrily claiming he was just trying to help her gain some experience. Kayla breaks down at home and is comforted by her father. She makes a video announcing that she intends to stop making videos, as she is not the person she pretends to be and feels unfit to give advice.\n\nKayla then opens a time capsule she created for herself in [[sixth grade]]. She watches a video she made where her past self asks questions about her current friends and love life. She asks her dad to help her burn the time capsule and asks if she makes him sad. He says that she fills him with pride and he could never be sad about her, and she hugs him tightly.\n\nAt graduation, Kayla rebukes Kennedy for ignoring her thank-you letter and acting indifferent towards her despite Kayla's attempts to be nice. She later has dinner at Gabe's house and they enjoy their time together. Kayla makes a new time capsule which she and her father bury in the backyard; she leaves a video message for her high school self encouraging her to persevere through tough times.\n\n==Cast==\nThe cast includes:<ref name=\"Debruge\"/>\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Elsie Fisher]] as Kayla Day\n* [[Josh Hamilton (actor)|Josh Hamilton]] as Mark Day\n* [[Emily Robinson]] as Olivia\n* Catherine Oliviere as Kennedy Graves\n* Jake Ryan as Gabe\n* Luke Prael as Aiden Wilson\n* Daniel Zolghadri as Riley\n* Fred Hechinger as Trevor\n* Imani Lewis as Aniyah\n}}\n\n==Themes==\nThe film explores anxiety.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/how-kanye-helped-bo-burnham-go-from-stand-up-to-eighth-grade.html |title=How Kanye Helped Bo Burnham Go From Having Panic Attacks Onstage to a Creative Breakthrough to Making Eighth Grade |website=[[Vulture.com]] |last=Fox |first=Jesse David |date=July 2, 2018 |accessdate=December 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204150036/https://www.vulture.com/2018/07/how-kanye-helped-bo-burnham-go-from-stand-up-to-eighth-grade.html |archive-date=December 4, 2018 |url-status=live  |quote=Burham: 'I wanted to make a movie about someone that\u2019s living with the internet as a texture, someone that\u2019s living with their anxiety untethered'. }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2018/07/18/630069876/director-bo-burnham-on-growing-up-with-anxiety-and-an-audience |title=Director Bo Burnham On Growing Up With Anxiety \u2014 And An Audience |publisher=[[NPR]] |last=Gross |first=Terry |date=July 18, 2018 |accessdate=December 20, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219090848/https://www.npr.org/2018/07/18/630069876/director-bo-burnham-on-growing-up-with-anxiety-and-an-audience |archive-date=December 19, 2018 |url-status=live  |quote=Burnham says the character was inspired by a period in his early 20s when he was dealing with panic attacks onstage. }}</ref> Professor Julianna W.

It was shot using in-flight cameras, most of the footage is aerial, and the viewer appears to be flying alongside birds of successive species, especially [[Canada geese]]. They traverse every kind of weather and [[landscape]], covering vast distances in a flight for survival. The filmmakers exposed over 590 miles of film to create an 89-minute piece. In one case, two months of filming in one location was edited down to less than one minute in the final film.\n\nMuch of the aerial footage was taken of \"tame\" birds. The filmmakers raised birds of several species, including [[stork]]s and [[pelican]]s, from birth. The newborn birds [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on staff members, and were trained to fly along with the film crews. The birds were also exposed to the film equipment over the course of their lives to ensure that the birds would react the way the filmmakers want. Several of these species had never been imprinted before. Film was shot from [[ultralight aviation|ultralights]], [[paraglider]]s, and [[hot air balloon]]s, as well as [[truck]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[motorboat]]s, remote-controlled [[robot]]s, and a [[French Navy]] warship. Its producer says that \"Winged Migration\" is neither a documentary nor [[fiction]], but rather a \"natural tale\".<ref name=\"makingof\">\"Making of\" special feature on the DVD</ref>\n\nThe film states that no [[special effect]]s were used in the filming of the birds, although some entirely [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] segments that view Earth from outer space augment the real-life footage.\n\nThe film's soundtrack by [[Bruno Coulais]] was recorded by Bulgarian vocal group [[Bulgarka Junior Quartet]] in Bulgarian, as well as [[Nick Cave]] in English and [[Robert Wyatt]]. The vocal effects include sequences in which panting is superimposed on wingbeats to give the effect that the viewer is a bird.\n\n'''Release date'''\n\n*\tFrance  2001/12/12

UK releases, or '''''The Travelling Birds: An Adventure in Flight''''' in Australia) is a 2001 [[documentary film]] directed by [[Jacques Cluzaud]], [[Michel Debats]] and [[Jacques Perrin]], who was also one of the writers and narrators, showcasing the immense journeys routinely made by birds during their [[Bird migration|migrations]].\n\nThe film is dedicated to the French [[ornithologist]] [[Jean Dorst]].\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was shot over the course of four years on all seven continents. It was shot using in-flight cameras, most of the footage is aerial, and the viewer appears to be flying alongside birds of successive species, especially [[Canada geese]]. They traverse every kind of weather and [[landscape]], covering vast distances in a flight for survival. The filmmakers exposed over 590 miles of film to create an 89-minute piece. In one case, two months of filming in one location was edited down to less than one minute in the final film.\n\nMuch of the aerial footage was taken of \"tame\" birds. The filmmakers raised birds of several species, including [[stork]]s and [[pelican]]s, from birth. The newborn birds [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinted]] on staff members, and were trained to fly along with the film crews. The birds were also exposed to the film equipment over the course of their lives to ensure that the birds would react the way the filmmakers want. Several of these species had never been imprinted before. Film was shot from [[ultralight aviation|ultralights]], [[paraglider]]s, and [[hot air balloon]]s, as well as [[truck]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[motorboat]]s, remote-controlled [[robot]]s, and a [[French Navy]] warship. Its producer says that \"Winged Migration\" is neither a documentary nor [[fiction]], but rather a \"natural tale\".<ref name=\"makingof\">\"Making of\" special feature on the DVD</ref>\n\nThe film states that no [[special effect]]s were used in the filming of the birds, although some entirely [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] segments that view Earth from outer space augment the real-life footage.\n\nThe film's soundtrack by [[Bruno Coulais]] was recorded by Bulgarian vocal group [[Bulgarka Junior Quartet]] in Bulgarian, as well as [[Nick Cave]] in English and [[Robert Wyatt]]. The vocal effects include sequences in which panting is superimposed on wingbeats to give the effect that the viewer is a bird.\n\n'''Release Date'''\n\n*\tFrance  2001/12/12                    \n*\tBelgium  2001/12/12\n*\tSwitzerland  2001/12/13...(German speaking region)\n*\tGreece  2001/12/14\n*\tSouth Korea  2002/03/29\n*\tGermany  2002/04/04\n*\tNetherlands  2002/04/18\n*\tHong Kong  2002/06/20\n*\tRussia  2002/06/21...(Moscow Film Festival)\n*\tCzech Republic  2002/07/8...(Karlovy Vary Film Festival)\n*\tCzech Republic  2002/07/18\n*\tCanada  2002/09/08...(Toronto Film Festival)\n*\tTurkey  2002/09/13\n*\tIsrael  2002/09/19\n*\tHungary  2002/09/19\n*\tSpain  2002/09/27\n*\tItaly  2002/11/15\n*\tLithuania  2002/12/27\n*\tPoland  2003/04/04\n*\tJapan  2003/04/05...(Tokyo)\n*\tUSA  2003/04/5...(Philadelphia International Film Festival)\n*\tSlovenia  2003/04/17\n*\tUSA  2003/04/18...(Limited)\n*\tNorway  2003/05/02...(Kristiansand International Children's Film Festival)\n*\tCanada  2003/05/30\n*\tAustralia  2003/06/19\n*\tNorway  2003/06/20\n*\tNew Zealand  2003/07/13...(Auckland International Film Festival)\n*\tMexico  2003/07/25\n*\tDenmark  2003/08/15...(Copenhagen International Film Festival)\n*\tFinland  2003/09/05\n*\tUK  2003/09/05\n*\tDenmark  2003/09/12\n*\tSweden  2003/ 11/07\n*\tIceland  2004/01/23...(French Film Festival)\n*\tArgentina  2004/07/29\n*\tChile  2005/03/31\n*\tIreland  2011/07/10...(Galway Film Fleadh)\n\n==Reception==\n''Winged Migration'' has an overall approval rating of 96% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/winged_migration/ |title=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=2011-05-23}}</ref>\nBy gross ticket sales, the film still holds seventh place in nature documentaries <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=naturedoc.htm|title=BoxOfficeMojo.org |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref> and eighteenth in documentary overall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=documentary.htm |title=BoxOfficeMojo.org |accessdate=2014-05-14}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and honors==\nThe film was nominated for an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]].<ref name=\"NY Times\">{{cite web |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/259504/Winged-Migration/details |title=NY Times: Le Peuple Migrateur |accessdate=2008-11-23|work=NY Times}}</ref> It won [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Editing|\"Best Editing\"]] at the [[27th C\u00e9sar Awards]], where it was also nominated for [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Music Written for a Film|\"Best Music\"]] and [[C\u00e9sar Award for Best Debut|\"Best Debut\"]].\n\n\u2022\tOscar 2003\nBest Documentary Feature (nominated) -Jacques Perrin\n\n\u2022\tEuropean Film Award 2002\nBest Documentary Feature (nominated) -Jacques Perrin\n\n\u2022\tCFCA Award 2004\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Laurent Charbonnier\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Luc Drion\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Laurent Fleutot\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Sylvie Carcedo\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Philippe Garguil\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Olli Barb\u00e9\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Dominique Gentil\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Thierry Machado\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -St\u00e9phane Martin\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Fabrice Moindrot\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Ernst Sasse\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -Thierry Thomas\nBest Cinematography (nominated) -

[[Robert Alan Aurthur]]'s screenplay was expanded from his original script, staged as the final episode of ''[[Philco Television Playhouse]]'', ''A Man Is Ten Feet Tall'' (1955), also featuring Poitier.\n\nThe film was considered unusual for its time because of its portrayal of an interracial friendship, and was praised by representatives of the [[NAACP]], [[Urban League]], [[American Jewish Committee]] and Interfaith Council because of its portrayal of racial brotherhood.<ref name='Man-Actor'/>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Dee Poitier and Cassavetes in Edge of the City.jpg|thumb|left|260px|[[Ruby Dee]], [[Sidney Poitier]] and [[John Cassavetes]]]]\nYoung drifter Axel Nordmann ([[John Cassavetes]]) arrives at the waterfront on the west side of Manhattan, seeking employment as a [[longshoreman]], and giving his name as \"Axel North.\" He goes to work in a gang of [[stevedore]]s headed by Charlie Malick ([[Jack Warden]]) a vicious bully, and is befriended by Tommy Tyler ([[Sidney Poitier]]), who also supervises a stevedore gang and has an engaging, charming sense of humor. Malick resents blacks in positions of authority, and is antagonized when Axel goes to work for Tommy.\n\nAxel moves into Tommy's neighborhood and becomes friends with Tommy's wife Lucy ([[Ruby Dee]]) and develops a romantic relationship with her friend Ellen Wilson ([[Kathleen Maguire]]). Tommy serves as a mentor to Axel, urging him to stand up to Malick, and that if he does he will be \"ten feet tall.\" It is apparent from the start that Axel is hiding something, and it emerges that he is a deserter from the United States Army. Malick is aware of that, and is extorting money from him.\n\nMalick frequently tries to provoke Tommy and Axel into fights, with Tommy coming to Axel's aid. Malick finally provokes Tommy into a fight, with both men using their baling hooks. At one point, Tommy disarms Malick and implores him to stop, but Malick seizes the hook and kills him. The police investigation is stymied by lack of cooperation from the longshoremen, including Axel. But after meeting with the distraught Lucy, who accuses him of never being Tommy's friend as he knows who killed Tommy but has not told the police, Axel finally decides to cooperate. He goes to Malick to tell him that. They get into a fight, and in the end, though beaten, Axel strangles Malick unconscious and drags him away to face justice.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Axel Nordmann\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Tommy Tyler\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Charlie Malick\n* [[Kathleen Maguire]] as Ellen Wilson\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Lucy Tyler\n* [[Val Avery]] as Brother\n* [[Robert F.

Poitier was paid $15,000 for the role and received his first co-star billing, though it was considered small by movie industry standards. Ritt, who had been blacklisted, was paid only $10,000.

Malick resents blacks in positions of authority, and is antagonized when Axel goes to work for Tommy.\n\nAxel moves into Tommy's neighborhood and becomes friends with Tommy's wife Lucy ([[Ruby Dee]]) and develops a romantic relationship with her friend Ellen Wilson ([[Kathleen Maguire]]). Tommy serves as a mentor to Axel, urging him to stand up to Malick, and that if he does he will be \"ten feet tall.\" It is apparent from the start that Axel is hiding something, and it emerges that he is a deserter from the United States Army. Malick is aware of that, and is extorting money from him.\n\nMalick frequently tries to provoke Tommy and Axel into fights, with Tommy coming to Axel's aid. Malick finally provokes Tommy into a fight, with both men using their baling hooks. At one point, Tommy disarms Malick and implores him to stop, but Malick seizes the hook and kills him. The police investigation is stymied by lack of cooperation from the longshoremen, including Axel. But after meeting with the distraught Lucy, who accuses him of never being Tommy's friend as he knows who killed Tommy but has not told the police, Axel finally decides to cooperate. He goes to Malick to tell him that. They get into a fight, and in the end, though beaten, Axel strangles Malick unconscious and drags him away to face justice.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[John Cassavetes]] as Axel Nordmann\n* [[Sidney Poitier]] as Tommy Tyler\n* [[Jack Warden]] as Charlie Malick\n* [[Kathleen Maguire]] as Ellen Wilson\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Lucy Tyler\n* [[Val Avery]] as Brother\n* [[Robert F.

Velan's father died heartbroken that his marriage with Velan's mother was not accepted by her sister-in-law and they had broken all links. Further, they believe that it was Parvathy's curse that killed her brother and sister-in-law in a car accident and they get a promise from the guardian, that their daughter should not be married to Parvathy's son. Velan's mother reveals that it is Velan's duty to marry her brother's daughter Sumathi to bring the separated family back together. Armed with only a picture of the girl when she was four, he leaves for Madras to fulfill his mother's wishes.\n\nVelan arrives at his friend Mano's house to implement his mission. Mano lives with three more roommates: Charlie, Vadivelu and Goundamani. Velan explains his mission and all of them offer to help him.\n\nThe next day, they visit a computer centre where the clerk generates an image of the teenage Sumathi. Velan  and his friends visit the beach to think for a plan but luckily they find a woman playing tennis to be Sumathi, the girl they search for. When Sumathi goes to fetch the ball from the sea, and Velan goes to help her. But he accidentally drowns her, but manage to pull an unconscious Sumathi out of the water. When she becomes conscious, she blames him for drowning her and didn't need any help as she was a trained long distance swimmer. Despite his friends' advice to drop the love for Sumathi due to her arrogant nature, Velan proceeds with next step of his mission as a challenge.\n\nLater, Velan and his friends follow Sumathi to a 5-star restaurant. On the stage in the dining hall, a flautist is performing. Once the performance ends, Sumathi gets up and kisses the old flautist's hand. Velan too offers his hand to be kissed, wherein he is asked whether he knows anything about music. To prove her wrong, Velan dresses up in a fancy leather suit, adorned with various musical instruments, singing \"Pudhu Cheri Katcheri\". But Sumathi insults the performance. Velan on his part teases with harmless intention, which also earns Sumathi's dislike.\n\nVelan meanwhile attempts to attract Thaiamma, the guardian of Sumathi by visiting her house daily. Thaiamma is attracted by Velan's entertaining nature. Velan lies by saying his mother's name as Mahalakshmi. Though Thaiamma certifies Velan as a good chap, Sumathi continues to hate him. Sumathi's uncle Natesan, who is a retired IG of police visits Velan to warn him to stop teasing his niece. There he comes to know about his father is an industrialist Kaliannan Gounder who has disowned him due to his passion for music. Unfortunately, he manages to meet the Industrialist to verify the Velan's family background and finds everything true via the mouth of industrialist. But Velan and his friends have already visited the industrialist and convinced him to lie to the general to help them out.\n\nThen Velan managed to attract Sumathi gradually through a series of events, which makes Sumathi realize her femininity. Their love becomes strong when Sumathi hears that Velan is very serious at hospital as he was attacked by some men hired by her uncle as he lied that he was the son of an industrialist. She finds Velan dressed up with full bandages on his body (a drama by Velan who counterattacked the men sent by the uncle and instructs them to convey that the men attacked Velan, to Sumathi as part of the love mission). Velan's mother is informed about her son's hospitalization by a person from Madras and immediately rushes to see her son. There she understands that facts are not true and feels easy.

Sivamani decides to kill Velan and marry Sumathi for her wealth and tricks Thaiamma to accept his proposal to marry Sumathi. He also uses one of his men to bring Velan in and to kill him, but Velan beats up all the bad guys and calls the police.\n\nTogether with the police, Sivamani's ally, his mother and friends he goes to the wedding hall and proves that Sivamani was the real killer and stops the wedding and gets him arrested.

Velan's father died heartbroken that his marriage with Velan's mother was not accepted by her sister-in-law and they had broken all links. Further, they believe that it was Parvathy's curse that killed her brother and sister-in-law in a car accident and they get a promise from the guardian, that their daughter should not be married to Parvathy's son. Velan's mother reveals that it is Velan's duty to get married to her brother's daughter Sumathi to bring the separated family back together. Armed with only a picture of the girl when she was four, he leaves for Madras to fulfill his mother's wishes.\n\nVelan arrives at his friend Mano's house to implement his mission. Mano lives with three more roommates: Charlie, Vadivelu and Goundamani. Velan explains his mission and all of them offer to help him.\n\nThe next day, they visit a computer centre where the clerk generates an image of the teenage Sumathi. Velan  and his friends visit the beach to think for a plan but luckily they find a woman playing tennis to be Sumathi, the girl they search for. When Sumathi goes to fetch the ball from the sea, and Velan goes to help her. But he accidentally drowns her, but manage to pull an unconscious Sumathi out of the water. When she becomes conscious, she blames him for drowning her and didn't need any help as she was a trained long distance swimmer. Despite his friends' advice to drop the love for Sumathi due to her arrogant nature, Velan proceeds with next step of his mission as a challenge.\n\nLater, Velan and his friends follow Sumathi to a 5-star restaurant. On the stage in the dining hall, a flautist is performing. Once the performance ends, Sumathi gets up and kisses the old flautist's hand. Velan too offers his hand to be kissed, wherein he is asked whether he knows anything about music. To prove her wrong, Velan dresses up in a fancy leather suit, adorned with various musical instruments, singing \"Pudhu Cheri Katcheri\". But Sumathi insults the performance. Velan on his part teases with harmless intention, which also earns Sumathi's dislike.\n\nVelan meanwhile attempts to attract Thaiamma, the guardian of Sumathi by visiting her house daily. Thaiamma is attracted by Velan's entertaining nature. Velan lies by saying his mother's name as Mahalakshmi. Though Thaiamma certifies Velan as a good chap, Sumathi continues to hate him. Sumathi's uncle Natesan, who is a retired IG of police visits Velan to warn him to stop teasing his niece. There he comes to know about his father is an industrialist Kaliannan Gounder who has disowned him due to his passion for music. Unfortunately, he manages to meet the Industrialist to verify the Velan's family background and finds everything true via the mouth of industrialist. But Velan and his friends have already visited the industrialist and convinced him to lie to the general to help them out.\n\nThen Velan managed to attract Sumathi gradually through a series of events, which makes Sumathi realize her femininity. Their love becomes strong when Sumathi hears that Velan is very serious at hospital as he was attacked by some men hired by her uncle as he lied that he was the son of an industrialist. She finds Velan dressed up with full bandages on his body (a drama by Velan who counterattacked the men sent by the uncle and instructs them to convey that the men attacked Velan, to Sumathi as part of the love mission). Velan's mother is informed about her son's hospitalization by a person from Madras and immediately rushes to see her son. There she understands that facts are not true and feels easy. Velan and Sumathi's love grows steadily and they decide to get engaged.\n\nOn the day of engagement, through 'Sincere' Sivamani, the manager at Sumathi's factory, Sumathi come to know that Velan is, in fact, the son of Paravathy, cancels the engagement and refuses to speak to him. In the meantime, the general finds that Sivamani is a crook who has been using Sumathi's premises to print [[Counterfeit money|counterfeit bills]]. Sivamani kills the General and frames Velan. Velan escapes the police and goes on the run. His friends, mother and the industrialist are arrested as accomplices. Sivamani decides to kill Velan and marry Sumathi for her wealth and tricks Thaiamma to accept his proposal to get married to Sumathi. He also uses one of his men to bring Velan in and to kill him, but Velan beats up all the bad guys and calls the police.\n\nTogether with the police, Sivamani's ally, his mother and friends he goes to the wedding hall and proves that Sivamani was the real killer and stops the wedding and gets him arrested. Sumathi realizes the true love of Velan and requests his mother to marry them. Velan and Sumathi get married. The story ends with the happiness of all members re-united at Velan's house.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Kamal Haasan]] as Singaravelan a.k.a.

It enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a \"manual mode\" and select any available gear, usually in a sequential \"up-shift/downshift\" manner. The two common divisions for this type of [[automobile transmission| transmission]] in road cars are the [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electrohydraulic or electromechanical single clutch]] automated manual, most commonly known under trademarked names, like \"F1\" by Ferrari, and \"SMG\" (Sequential manual gearbox) by BMW.<ref>[[https://www.autozine.org/technical_school/gearbox/Gearbox_Manual.html| AutoZine Technical School - Manual Transmission]]</ref><ref>[[https://www.autogravity.com/autogravitas/cars/manual-vs-automatic-transmission-shift-know-about| MANUAL VS. AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION: A SHIFT TO KNOW ABOUT]]</ref> Second, there's the newer [[dual-clutch transmission]], which was first used by the Volkswagen Group in the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]] in 2003, and now commonly used by other manufacturers. A common trade name for this transmission is \"DSG\" (Direct-shift gearbox). Both transmissions use computer-controlled ECU's & [[Transmission control unit|TCU's]], and generally use an electromechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic shift actuator to operate the electronic clutch and automated shifting process.<ref name=\"zf1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.zf.com/products/en/cars/products_29280.html\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission\n|website=zf.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\nSome automated transmissions allow the driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically at the low end and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. [[Torque converter|Hydraulically-coupled]] and most [[clutch]] transmissions also provide the option of operating in the same manner as a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few also allow an alternative automatic mode, often called \"sport\" mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by up shifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.\n\nModern \"semi-automatic\" transmissions divide into two groups; single-clutch[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmissions]] and [[dual-clutch]] automatics, which house two computer-controlled electronic clutches rather than the one with the single-clutch type. \n\nAutomated manuals facilitate gear changes by dispensing the need to depress a [[clutch]] pedal at the same time as changing gears. It uses [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators]] to execute [[gear shift]]s on input from the [[driving|driver]] or by a computer. This removes the need for a [[clutch]] pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronize the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by [[automobile manufacturer]]s to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some [[Semi-automatic transmission#Motorcycles|motorcycles]] also use an automated manual system with conventional gear change, but with an automatically actuated wet or dry single or dual-clutch mechanism, dispensing for the need of a clutch lever, and without the need for manual clutch operation.<ref name=\"ricardo1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://motorcycle.ricardo.com/engineering/powertrain-engineering\n|title=Motorcycle Power-train Engineering\n|website=ricardo.com\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>\n\nAutomated manual transmission (AMT) is a specific type of semi-automatic transmission. It consists of a conventional [[manual transmission]] with an electronically-controlled hydraulic clutch and computerized gear shift control, and the driver can usually override the computer control with a clutchless \"manual\" mode.<ref>[[https://www.aa.co.nz/cars/motoring-blog/mission-transmission/]]</ref> It has a lower cost than any other types of automatic transmissions<ref name=\"zf1\" /> \nAn Automated manual transmission can simply and best be described as a standard manual transmission, with an automated clutch, and automated clutch and gear shift control.<ref name=\"x-engineer1\" />\n\n==History==\n[[File:1913-1923 Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F Berline crop.jpg|thumb|Am\u00e9d\u00e9e BOLL\u00c9E Fils Type F gear shift ring (mounted inside steering wheel)]]\nIn 1901, [[Am\u00e9d\u00e9e Boll\u00e9e]] developed a method of shifting gears which did not require the use of a [[clutch]] and was activated by a ring mounted within the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\">{{cite web \n|title=The history of the 'paddle shift' \n|url=https://www.lemans.org/en/news/the-history-of-the-paddle-shift/2922\n|website=lemans.org\n|date=2011-02-21\n|access-date=2020-02-16}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1930s, automakers began to market cars with some sort of device that would reduce the amount of clutching and de-clutching and shifting required in stop and go driving. Most typically, a [[fluid coupling]] or a [[centrifugal clutch]] replaced the standard manual clutch to allow for stop and go driving without using the clutch pedal every time the car was brought to a stop. More sophisticated systems allowed for shifting while driving without using the clutch, and some systems did away with the clutch pedal altogether. Semi-automatic transmissions were phased out as technology advanced and automatic controls were developed to take care of changing gear ratios. Smaller, lower powered cars used semi-automatic transmissions with a dry clutch because the mechanical connection offered a more efficient powertrain compared to a fluid coupling.\n\nAnother early semi-automatic transmission was the Sinclair S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) [[Sinclair Powerflow|Powerflow]] gearbox. which was applied to Huwood-Hudswell diesel mines locomotives.<ref name=\"dmm1\">{{cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colleng/4805-01.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum - Colliery Engineering |publisher=Dmm.org.uk |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> It was also applied to some road vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035333/http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archivedate = 2017-09-06 | page = 69 | title=Vulcan-Sinclair Fluidrive Makes Headway | date = 1946-08-16 | journal = The Commercial Motor }}</ref>\n\nImproved semi-automatics appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. The [[Automotive Products]] Manumatic and Newtondrive systems were also known as \"two-pedal transmissions\". They relieve the driver of the need for skill in operating clutch and engine speed in conjunction with the gear change. The '''Manumatic''' has a clutch servo powered by the vacuum at the induction manifold operating the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operates a solenoid valve so that when the gear lever is moved, the clutch is disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.<ref>Staton Abbey (ed) ''Practical Automobile Engineering'' Clutch Systems p 193-194</ref> The '''Newtondrive''' system differed in making a provision for choke control and a cable linkage from clutch operating mechanism to the throttle. These systems could be fitted to smaller cars such as the [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Ferrari 640]] race car incorporated, in 1989, an [[Electrohydraulic_manual_transmission|electo-hydraulic]] gear shift mechanism activated by paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\"/><ref name=\"ferrarif1\">{{cite web |title=Ferrari F1-89 |url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |website=ferrari.com |access-date=2020-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927170637/http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other automated transmissions==\nModern \"Semi-automatic transmissions,\" also known as \"automated manual transmissions\" (AMTs) usually have a fully automatic mode, where the driver does not need to change gears at all, operating in the same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were [[redline|redlining]] the engine. The AMT can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions ([[manumatic]]s such as [[Tiptronic]]) and [[continuous variable transmission]]s (CVTs) (such as [[Lineartronic#Subaru Lineartronic CVT|Lineartronic]]).\n\nDespite superficial similarity to other automated transmissions, AMTs differ significantly in internal operation and driver's \"feel\" from manumatics and CVTs. A manumatic, like a standard [[automatic transmission]], uses a [[torque converter]] instead of [[clutch]] to manage the link between the transmission and the engine, while a CVT uses a belt instead of a fixed number of gears. An AMT offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications, while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts,<ref>{{cite web| first1=Tony | last1=Quiroga | others=Hoey, Patrick M.

In one early mass-production example, [[Ferrari]] offered their [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] model with a clutchless manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the [[gear stick]] of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.\n\nIn standard mass-production automobiles today, the gear lever appears similar to manual shifts, except that the gear stick only moves forward and backward to shift into higher and lower gears, instead of the traditional H-pattern. The [[Bugatti Veyron]] uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In [[Formula One]], the system is adapted to fit onto the [[steering wheel]] in the form of two paddles; depressing the right paddle shifts into a higher gear, while depressing the left paddle shifts into a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.\n\n[[Hall effect sensor]]s sense the direction of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the [[gear box]] which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a [[central processing unit]]. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a smooth clutch engagement, based on input from these two sensors as well as other factors, such as engine rotation, the [[Electronic Stability Control]], [[air conditioner]] and [[dashboard]] instruments.\n\nThe central processing unit powers a hydro-mechanical unit to either engage or disengage the clutch, which is kept in close synchronization with the gear-shifting action the driver has started. In some cases, the hydro-mechanical unit contains a [[Servomechanism|servo]]motor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear [[actuator]], which uses [[brake fluid]] from the braking system to impel a hydraulic cylinder to move the main clutch actuator. In other cases, the clutch actuator may be completely electric.\n\nThe power of the system lies in the fact that electronic equipment can react much faster and more precisely than a human, and takes advantage of the precision of electronic signals to allow a complete clutch operation without the intervention of the driver.\n\nFor the needs of parking, reversing and neutralizing the transmission, the driver must engage both paddles at once; after this has been accomplished, the car will prompt for one of the three options.\n\nThe clutch is really only needed to get the car in motion. For a quicker upshift, the engine power can be cut, and the collar disengaged until the engine drops to the correct speed for the next gear. For the teeth of the collar to slide into the teeth of the rings, both the speed and position must match. This needs sensors to measure not only the speed, but the positions of the teeth, and the throttle may need to be opened softer or harder. The even-faster shifting techniques like [[powershifting]] require a heavier gearbox or clutch or even a [[dual clutch transmission]].\n\nA typical transmission has the following gears: P, R, N, D, M+, M-\n* ''P'' is the parking gear. It locks the transmission.\n* ''R'' is the reverse gear. It is similar to R in both traditional manual and in full automatic cars;\n* ''N'' is the neutral gear. It is similar to N in both traditional manual and full automatic;\n* ''D'' is the drive gear. It is equivalent of D in a full automatic. The gearbox in an AMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a [[torque converter]] as in a traditional automatic;\n* ''M-'' downshifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars) to M1;\n* ''M+'' up-shifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[Selespeed]] was introduced in 1999 in the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].<ref name=\"fiatautopress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatautopress.com/index.php?method=cartelle&action=zoom&id=20041220314081583da688bf3dbbeee34b924a74271f8bc4|title=Press release 20 January 1999|accessdate=2007-05-08|work=fiatautopress.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327081230/http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/welcome.php|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Martin===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Sportshift]]\n\n=== BMW ===\nSteptronic, SMG/SSG.\n\n===Chevrolet===\nFor the 1968 model year, Chevrolet introduced a simplified version of Powerglide marketed under the name \"Torque Drive.\" This unit was basically two-speed [[Powerglide]] without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between Low and High. The quadrant indicator on Torque Drive cars was, Park R N Hi 1st. The driver would start the car in \"1st,\" then move the lever to \"Hi\" when desired.\n\nTorque Drive was only offered on low-horsepower engines for [[Camaro]], [[chevrolet Nova|Nova]], and the 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]. It was available on the Nova four cylinder engine, and on the Turbo-Thrift Sixes for Camaro as well as Nova. Despite its low introductory price of $68.65, most buyers apparently considered the Torque Drive a nuisance to shift, and for a hundred dollars more they could get fully automatic Powerglide, making Torque Drive installations very rare. Apparently the transmission wasn't very durable, since it depended on the driver's ability to shift between gears in a way that wouldn't damage the unit. After 1971, Chevrolet cancelled semi-automatic Torque Drive.\n\n=== Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / Ram ===\n{{main|Vacamatic|Presto-Matic}}\n\nHistorically, the first semi-automatic transmission which was marketed by a major manufacturer was the 1941 M4/Vacamatic Transmission by [[Chrysler]]. It was an attempt to compete against rivals' [[automatic transmission]]s, though it still had a [[clutch]], it was primarily used to change range. The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between [[engine]] and clutch, and the shifting mechanism.\n\nIn normal driving, the clutch was used to select low, high or reverse. Attached to the transmission was an \"underdrive\" with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the \"2nd\" position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the \"3rd\" position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in \"underdrive\" low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6&nbsp;mph (9.7&nbsp;km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would \"shift\" into direct drive.\nThis configuration had the effect of providing 4 gear ratios:\nUnderdrive Low, 3.57/1,\nLow 2.04/1,\nUnderdrive High, 1.75/1,\nHigh, 1/1.\nIn order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner's manual cautioned drivers not to use \"1st or 3rd\" gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the \"clunk\" that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot===\n[[Citro\u00ebn]] produced a number of variants on semi-automatic transmission. The [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.\n\nThe [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] gained an optional centrifugal clutch, marketed in English-speaking countries as \"Trafficlutch\". It did not help with gear changing, but it disengaged automatically when the engine slowed to an idle. A device was fitted to the carburettor to prevent the throttle closing abruptly, and the resultant clutch disengagement and lack of engine braking.\n\nLater, the manufacturer introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate models in the 1970s; the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]] and [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] models had the option of three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear selector rods and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a [[torque converter]]. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citro\u00ebn semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire gear selecting operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.\n\nThe smaller range of cars: [[Citro\u00ebn C1|C1]], [[Citro\u00ebn C2|C2]] and [[Citro\u00ebn C3|C3]] have all been offered with a semi-automatic transmission named [[Sensodrive]]. This is based on a standard 5-speed gearbox with servo-controlled clutch. The operation is automatic, but it also has a manual mode where the driver changes gear manually; although gears are always changed by an electric servo.\n\nAn improved version of Sensodrive is EGS (Electronic Gearbox System), which has six gears.\n\nAn even further improved version is called ETG6 (6 speed Efficient Tronic Gearbox). It has slightly better characteristics compared to EGS and an added \"creep\" function.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ETG6 Gearbox\n|website=Citro\u00ebn UK\n|url=http://www.citroen.co.uk/about-us/technology/driving-assistance/etg6-gearbox/\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref> The ETG6 gearbox is used by the 2013 [[Citro\u00ebn C4 Picasso]]. The gearbox is also utilized by [[PSA Group]]'s other offerings, like the [[Peugeot 208]].\n\n2-tronic, EGC (Electric Gearbox Control) or Piloted Manual in [[Peugeot]].\n\n==={{anchor|Daimatic}} Daihatsu===\nThe 993&nbsp;cc [[Daihatsu]] [[Daihatsu Charade|Charade]] from 1985 until 1991 had the option of a two-speed semi-automatic transmission called \"Daimatic\". This unit is similar to a conventional auto, featuring both a torque converter and a planetary gearset but lacking a full valve body for making decisions regarding shifting. This was left entirely to the driver and as a result could be accelerated from rest in top gear if desired, depending entirely on the torque converter action. The standing quartermile time with two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} occupants and using low gear appropriately was 21.0 sec while using top gear only was 21.5 sec. This unit was also installed in the [[Innocenti Minitre|Innocenti Matic]] of the same time period.\n\n===Ferrari===\nFerrari's first automated manual gearbox in a road car (used them previously in their [[Formula One]] cars since 1989) went on sale in 1993 in the [[Ferrari Mondial]]; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal, and the clutch mechanism was electronically actuated each time the gearshift was moved. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 [[Ferrari F355]]. The most recent version of its single-clutch automated manual was introduced in the [[Ferrari 599 GTO]] which was capable of changing gear in 60 ms. In the [[Ferrari California]] & [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], Ferrari opted to use a [[double-clutch transmission]]. Since then, Ferrari has expanded use of their [[double-clutch transmission]] to all new models.\n\n===Fiat===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 2000s, [[Fiat]] offered their Speedgear transmissions for some of its cars, like the [[Fiat Punto]]. In 2008, a new system came to the market, Dualogic transmission, that equipped a wide range of cars, like the [[Fiat 500]], [[Fiat Bravo]], [[Fiat Punto]], etc. In 2017, Fiat introduced its new generation of semi-automatic transmissions, called GSR (Gear Smart Riding), that was designed to work with their new car models such as the [[Fiat MOBI]] and the [[Fiat Argo]].\n\n===Ford===\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Co]]. offered the Semi-Automatic Transmission on the 1970 [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]] 6-cylinder model as a lower-cost option to the popular 3-speed C4 [[Cruise-o-Matic]] transmission.  The shift quadrant featured \"P R N Hi 2 1\" and the Maverick owner's manual provides the speeds at which the driver should move the selector between the three forward gears.  Like Chevrolet's Torque-Drive, the Ford Semi-Automatic was essentially the regular automatic without the self-shifting capability.  At $121.00 retail, it was pricey, rarely ordered, and was discontinued the following year.\n\n===General Motors===\nIn 1937, [[Oldsmobile]] introduced the four-speed Automatic Safety Transmission as an option. This was an automatic transmission with automated control and shifting between a pair of ranges, with manual control over high and low ratio pairs of the four. It was not a semi-automatic transmission.  This transmission was replaced by fully automatic [[Hydra-Matic]] for the 1940 model year.\n\nIn 1938, [[Buick]] introduced a five-speed semi-automatic{{citation needed|date=June 2015|reason=Automatic or semi-automatic?}} transmission for the [[Buick Special]].  This unit was failure prone, however, and eventually was replaced by the fully automatic [[Dynaflow]] transmission for 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile History: Drivetrain|url=http://www.motorera.com/history/hist10.htm|website=motera.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Honda / Acura===\n[[Honda]] marketed both cars and motorcycles with the [[Hondamatic]] transmission in the 1970s and early 1980s. This transmission is frequently referred to as the 'Bang-O-Matic' by mechanics.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The design is noteworthy because it preserves engine braking by eliminating a [[sprag clutch|sprag]] between first and second gears.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nOther Honda tradenames iShift & MultiMatic,\n\n===Hudson===\nDrive-Master, 1941-1950.\n\n===Hyundai & Kia===\nSportmatic, [[Sportronic]], HIVEC H-Matic.\n\n===Isuzu===\n{{main|NAVi5}}\n[[Isuzu]] introduced the \"NAVi5\" (New Advanced Vehicle with Intelligence 5-speed) in 1984. Based on a traditional 5-speed manual with a dry clutch, it was controlled by two hydraulic actuators and an electronic computer. The earlier version only had an automatic mode, but a manual mode was later added. It was first available in the [[Isuzu Aska|Aska]] and subsequently the other Isuzu vehicles (for Japanese domestic market only).\n\n===Lincoln-Mercury===\nFor 1942, Ford Motor Company announced a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic.  Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, as well as an electro-mechanical vacuum control that automated the shift between second and third speeds.  Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill.  Lincolns got an overdrive gear as a bonus.\n\nThe transmission proved to be so trouble-prone that Ford recalled virtually every unit, and replaced them with standard manual transmissions.  The only known unit to exist is in the possession of the Early Ford V8 Foundation Museum in Auburn, Indiana.  While Ford gave up on semi-automatic transmissions after Liquimatic, Lincoln started using General Motors' [[Hydra-Matic]] in 1949, while Mercury got its own automatic, [[Merc-O-Matic]], in 1951.\n\n===Maserati===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Cambiocorsa, DuoSelect, MC-Shift]]\n\n===Mercedes-Benz / Smart===\nMercedes used a system from 1957\u201361 similar to the VW [[Autostick]], called Hydrak. Hydrak had one major flaw: the [[oil]] supply for the [[torque converter]] was sealed within the converter itself and did not circulate via a pump, and also had no oil [[cooler (oil)|cooler]]. Idling in gear for even short periods would overheat the oil and burn up the seals in the converter, which would then need to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzponton.org/valueadded/maintenance/hydrak.htm|title=Mercedes-Benz Ponton Hydrak Automatic Clutch |first=Jeff|last=Miller|website=www.mbzponton.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Smart Fortwo]] employs an automated manual transmission designed and manufactured by [[Getrag]] to eliminate the clutch pedal.  The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation used a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode or via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\n===NSU===\nThe [[Germany|German]] automobile manufacturer [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] produced an automated system for the [[rotary engine|rotary-engined]] [[NSU Ro 80]] saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.\n\n===Opel===\n{{main|Easytronic}}\nOpel (Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom) produced a semi-automatic transmission gearbox, the Easytronic gearbox. As with all standard automateds, the Easytronic car has only two pedals (accelerator pedal and brake pedal) but it does have a clutch, though this is inbuilt into the car and is electrohydraulic. The Easytronic can be driven in \"manual mode\" simply by using the paddle shifter selector to change gears if the driver wishes to do so, or alternatively it can be driven in exactly the same way as a fully conventional automatic\u2014however, many Easytronic owners have complained that gear shifts in \"automatic mode\" are jerky; a common complaint with semi-autos based on a conventional manual gearbox. As with conventional, full automatic transmission cars, the Easytronic will \"creep\" forwards when the driver's foot is released from the brake pedal when the car is stationary.\n\n===Packard===\nAlso in 1941, [[Packard]] introduced the Electro-Matic [[clutch]], which was a vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by the position of the accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably due to the fact that the system was somewhat unstable during [[engine]] warm-up. [[Packard]]'s system was used in conjunction with their regular [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] so the H-pattern shifting remained.\n\nEarlier, and by many manufacturers, an arrangement to disengage the clutch (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called \"[[freewheel]]ing\", it was bedeviled by the absence of adequate brakes.\n\n===Plymouth===\nIn 1953, Plymouth fitted a torque converter, called 'Hy-Drive', to their standard 3-speed manual gearbox. The torque converter allowed the car to remain in High gear for most driving, providing fluid torque multiplication as needed. A clutch was provided for manual gear engagements and the driver could use all three speeds as desired.  Hy-Drive was also offered for the 1954 model year, but was soon replaced with Chrysler's fully automatic two-speed PowerFlite transmission.\n\n===Porsche===\nPorsche has created various automated manual and [[Manumatic]] transmissions, starting with Porsche's \"SportoMatic\" transmission in 1968. This transmission was marketed as an \"Automatic,\" despite it having no fully automatic mode. This automated manual transmission was a conventional four-speed manual gearbox, but with a vaccuum-operated single-disc dry clutch. A torque converter was utilized in place of a flywheel, and shifts and clutch were operated electromechanically whenever the driver moved the gearshift. The next \"automated\" transmission was the Porsche \"Tiptronic\" [[manumatic]] transmission of the 1990s, which was essentially a torque converter automatic transmission, but containing a built-in \"manual\" shift mechanism. The newest automated manual transmission by Porsche is the \"Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe\" (PDK), which literally translates to \"Porsche dual-clutch transmission.\" It has two separate clutches and shafts combined into one housing unit, essentially with one clutch operating the odd gears, and one the clutch the even gears.

These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated by a series of valve bodies and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last gear selected or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.\n\nIn the UK though, semi-automatic transmissions have been very popular on buses for some time, from the 1950s right through to the 1980s, an example being the well known London [[AEC Routemaster]], although the latter could also be driven as a full automatic in the three highest gears. Most heavy-duty bus manufacturers offered this option, using a gearbox from [[Self-Changing Gears]] Ltd of Coventry, and on urban single- and double-deck buses it was the norm by the 1970s. This coincided with the development of city buses with engines and transmissions at the rear rather than the front, which was beyond the capability of a manual gearchange/clutch linkage from the driver's position. [[Leyland Bus|Leyland]] manufactured many buses with semi-automatic transmissions, including its [[Leyland Leopard|Leopard]] and [[Leyland Tiger|Tiger]] coaches. Fully automatic transmission became popular with increasing numbers of continental buses being bought in the UK, and more and more British manufacturers began offering automatic options, mostly using imported gearboxes (such as those made by Voith and ZF), and semi-automatic transmissions lost favour. These days, very few buses with semi-automatic transmissions remain in service, although many are still on the roads with private owners. Modern types of [[manumatic]] transmissions though are becoming more common, mostly replacing manual gearboxes in coaches.\n\n===Trains===\n====Railcars====\nThe Self-Changing Gears automated gearbox was also fitted to the several thousand diesel railcars built for the British railway system in the late 1950s-early 1960s, which lasted in service until the 1990s-2000s. Their whole engine-transmission system was based on that from the main bus manufacturers of the period such as Leyland and [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]]. Gear selection was by the train driver with a hand-held lever as the train accelerated. Such trains were formed of a number of such railcars coupled together and each power car had two engine/automated gearbox units mounted under the floor. Synchronising controls by control cables connected through the train ensured all the gearboxes under all coaches of the train changed gear together.\n\n====Locomotives====\nSemi-automatic transmission was also used on many small diesel [[shunting locomotive]]s, such as [[British Rail Class 03]] and [[British Rail Class 04]]. A widely used type was the Wilson-Drewry epicyclic gearbox.\n\nA less common type was the SSS (synchro-self-shifting) Powerflow gearbox.  This gearbox was of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and [[dog clutch]] engagement.  A special feature was that the drive was maintained during upward gearchanges. This system was used on [[Hudswell Clarke|Huwood-Hudswell]] diesel mines locomotives<ref name=\"dmm1\" /> and on the [[British Rail Class D2/7]] and [[British Rail Class D2/12]].\n\n===Motorcycles===\n\nThe first motorcycles with semi-automatic gearboxes were developed and patented in the mid 1960s by the Czechoslovakian [[Jawa Moto|Jawa]] motorcycle company.<ref name=CZ>{{cite web |title=V\u00e1lka mechanik\u016f: Japonci okop\u00edrovali \u010desk\u00fd vyn\u00e1lez! |url=https://epochaplus.cz/valka-mechaniku-japonci-okopirovali-cesky-vynalez/ |website=EpochaPlus|language=cs-CZ|date=20 January 2015|last=Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk|first=Marek|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Honda copied the Jawa semi-automatic clutch for the [[Honda Super Cub|Honda Cub]] step-through motorcycle series and so Jawa sued them in court for patent infringement. Honda settled out of court and Jawa granted them indefinite licence with royalties charged on each Honda motorcycle that used the Jawa system.<ref name=CZ/>\n\nThe first large capacity motorcycle with a semi-automatic gearbox was the 1975 {{cvt|948|cc|abbr=on}} Moto Guzzi Convert (the name was chosen to denote the torque converter which was at the heart of this 110&nbsp;mph motorcycle){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} a fairly heavy motorcycle which despite its weight still handled, and cornered remarkably well, which was thanks to the race-bred frame from the Moto Guzzi Le Mans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHonda also had a range of bikes fitted with a gearbox that mated a torque converter and a two speed gearbox. This style of gearbox still required the rider to manually selected neutral and either of the two gears using the foot gear lever.<ref name=\"cyclemay1976p69\">{{cite journal|title=[[Cycle (magazine)|Cycle magazine]]|date=May 1976|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|p=67\u201373}}</ref> These models were the [[Honda CB750#CB750A Hondamatic|CB750A]], [[Honda CB400T#CB400A Hawk Hondamatic|CB400A]], [[Honda CM400|CM400A]] and [[Honda CM450A|CM450A]]. These bikes were badged and marketed as Hondamatics.\n\nIn addition to the Hondamatic system noted above, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year [[FJR1300]] [[sport-touring]] motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.\n\nHonda began production of the [[Honda VFR1200F|VFR1200F]] on 8 September 2009,<ref name=\"autoblog1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/09/honda-to-launch-first-ever-dual-clutch-gearbox-for-motorcycles-w/\n|title=Honda to launch first-ever dual clutch gearbox for motorcycles with new VFR\n|website=\n|last=Korzeniewski \n|first=Jeremy\n|date=Sep 9, 2009\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref> which includes an optional [[dual clutch transmission]], the first to be fitted to a motorcycle.\n\nThe [[BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster]] is available with a clutchless automatic transmission (the SE5 or SE6, with five or six speeds, depending on the model).\n\nSmall capacity [[Types of motorcycles#Scooters, underbones and mopeds|underbone]] or \"step-thru\" types of motorcycles, such as the Honda Super Cub, [[Suzuki FR50]] and [[Suzuki FR80|FR80]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] Townmate, use a semi-automatic gearbox with a \"heel and toe\" foot change in the standard motorcycle position but without the need for conventional clutch operation.\n\nMany modern motorcycles feature a device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes pressure on the gear shift rod and quickshifter sends a signal to the ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially \"blips\" the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===ATVs===\nHonda released automated electric shift ATVs starting in model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting is accomplished by pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal and the addition of an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (clutch assy, shift drum, etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever. In the event of a malfunction, a supplied override lever can be placed on a shaft protruding from the crankcase in the traditional spot where the pedal would have been. This electric shift technology was later applied to their complete line of ATVs.\n\n==Types==\n* [[Dual-clutch transmission]]\n* [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission]] (e.g. BMW sequential manual gearbox, SMG)\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Saxomat]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Overdrive (mechanics)|Overdrive]]\n* [[Shift kit]]\n* [[Shift time]]\n* [[Dual clutch transmission]] (DCT)\n* [[Automatic manual transmission]]\n* [[Multimode manual transmission]]\n* [[Honda I-SHIFT]]\n* [[Direct-Shift Gearbox]]\n* [[Automatic transmission]]\n* [[Tiptronic]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{Powertrain}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Semi-automatic transmission}}\n[[Category:Automotive transmission technologies]]\n[[Category:Automobile transmissions]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle transmissions]]\n[[Category:Mechanical power control]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2016}}\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{technical|date=March 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2010}}\n}}\n\n{{Transmission types}}\nA '''semi-automatic transmission''' (also known as an '''automated manual'''<ref>[[https://www.caradvice.com.au/278721/transmissions-explained-manual-v-automatic-v-dual-clutch-v-cvt-v-others/]]</ref> <ref name=\"nacfe1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://nacfe.org/technology/automated-manual-transmissions-2/\n|title=Automated Manual Transmissions\n|website=North American Council for Freight Efficiency\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-15 \n}}</ref>, '''clutchless manual'''<ref name=\"autonews1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autonews.com/article/20010401/SUB/104010719/the-next-shift-the-clutchless-manual\n|title=The next shift: The clutchless manual\n|website=autonews.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>, '''auto-manual'''<ref name=\"x-engineer1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://x-engineer.org/automotive-engineering/drivetrain/transmissions/automated-manual-transmissions-amt/\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission (AMT)\n|website=x-engineer.org\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>, '''semi-manual'''<ref name=\"thezebra1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.thezebra.com/insurance-news/2805/manual-vs-automatic/\n|title=Manual vs. Automatic Transmissions: Who's Winning? - Insurance News\n|website=thezebra.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=April 7, 2016\n|access-date=2020-02-15 \n}}</ref>, '''trigger shift''', '''flappy-paddle''' or '''paddle-shift''' gearbox) is an [[automobile transmission]] that combines [[manual transmission]] and [[automatic transmission]].\n\nSemi-automatic term refers to a single-clutch [[manual transmission]] (with an automated clutch, but requires the driver to shift the gears manually), allowing for convenient driver control of gear selection (in road cars), or a single-clutch [[Sequential manual transmission|sequential transmission]] with electronic operated paddle shifters and an electrohydraulic or electro-pneumatic actuated clutch and dog box gear engagement as used in race cars.<ref>Drivetribe.com \n[https://drivetribe.com/p/sequential-sorrow-1989-ferrari-U9zAMNPcScu0UqBZ4NZGPg?iid=VMEsFpv0Rru6efh8RBsrGA/ SEQUENTIAL SORROW - 1989 FERRARI 640]</ref><ref>Formula1-Dictionary.net [http://www.formula1-dictionary.net/gearbox.html/ Gearbox]</ref> For most of automotive history, conventional automatic transmissions already allowed some control of gear selection using the console or [[Gear stick|shifter]], usually to limit the transmission shifting beyond a certain gear (allowing engine braking on downhills) and/or locking out the use of [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] gears when towing.  It enhanced such features by providing either steering wheel mounted paddle shifters or a modified shift lever, allowing the driver to enter a \"manual mode\" and select any available gear, usually in a sequential \"up-shift/downshift\" manner. The two common divisions for this type of [[automobile transmission| transmission]] in road cars are the [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| electrohydraulic or electromechanical single clutch]] automated manual, most commonly known under trademarked names, like \"F1\" by Ferrari, and \"SMG\" (Sequential manual gearbox) by BMW.<ref>[[https://www.autozine.org/technical_school/gearbox/Gearbox_Manual.html| AutoZine Technical School - Manual Transmission]]</ref><ref>[[https://www.autogravity.com/autogravitas/cars/manual-vs-automatic-transmission-shift-know-about| MANUAL VS.

A common trade name for this transmission is \"DSG\" (Direct-shift gearbox). Both transmissions use computer-controlled ECU's & [[Transmission control unit|TCU's]], and generally use an electromechanical, hydraulic or pneumatic shift actuator to operate the electronic clutch and automated shifting process.<ref name=\"zf1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.zf.com/products/en/cars/products_29280.html\n|title=Automated Manual Transmission\n|website=zf.com\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\nSome automated transmissions allow the driver to have full control of gear selection, though most will intervene to prevent engine stalling and redlining by shifting automatically at the low end and/or high end of the engine's normal operating range. [[Torque converter|Hydraulically-coupled]] and most [[clutch]] transmissions also provide the option of operating in the same manner as a conventional automatic transmission, by allowing the transmission's computer to select gear changes. A few also allow an alternative automatic mode, often called \"sport\" mode, where gear selection is still fully automatic but the transmission will favor higher engine speeds (at which the engine will produce the highest horsepower and/or torque) by up shifting later when accelerating and downshifting earlier when slowing.\n\nModern \"semi-automatic\" transmissions divide into two groups; single-clutch[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission| automated manual transmissions]] and [[dual-clutch]] automatics, which house two computer-controlled electronic clutches rather than the one with the single-clutch type. \n\nAutomated manuals facilitate gear changes by dispensing the need to depress a [[clutch]] pedal at the same time as changing gears. It uses [[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|electronic sensors, pneumatics, processors and actuators]] to execute [[gear shift]]s on input from the [[driving|driver]] or by a computer. This removes the need for a [[clutch]] pedal which the driver otherwise needs to depress before making a gear change, since the clutch itself is actuated by electronic equipment which can synchronize the timing and torque required to make quick, smooth gear shifts. The system was designed by [[automobile manufacturer]]s to provide a better driving experience through fast overtaking maneuvers on highways. Some [[Semi-automatic transmission#Motorcycles|motorcycles]] also use an automated manual system with conventional gear change, but with an automatically actuated wet or dry single or dual-clutch mechanism, dispensing for the need of a clutch lever, and without the need for manual clutch operation.<ref name=\"ricardo1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://motorcycle.ricardo.com/engineering/powertrain-engineering\n|title=Motorcycle Power-train Engineering\n|website=ricardo.com\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref>\n\nAutomated manual transmission (AMT) is a specific type of semi-automatic transmission.

Most typically, a [[fluid coupling]] or a [[centrifugal clutch]] replaced the standard manual clutch to allow for stop and go driving without using the clutch pedal every time the car was brought to a stop. More sophisticated systems allowed for shifting while driving without using the clutch, and some systems did away with the clutch pedal altogether. Semi-automatic transmissions were phased out as technology advanced and automatic controls were developed to take care of changing gear ratios. Smaller, lower powered cars used semi-automatic transmissions with a dry clutch because the mechanical connection offered a more efficient powertrain compared to a fluid coupling.\n\nAnother early semi-automatic transmission was the Sinclair S.S.S. (synchro-self-shifting) [[Sinclair Powerflow|Powerflow]] gearbox. which was applied to Huwood-Hudswell diesel mines locomotives.<ref name=\"dmm1\">{{cite web|author=Durham Mining Museum |url=http://www.dmm.org.uk/colleng/4805-01.htm |title=Durham Mining Museum - Colliery Engineering |publisher=Dmm.org.uk |date=2012-12-17 |accessdate=2014-07-18}}</ref> It was also applied to some road vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170906035333/http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-august-1946/43/vulcan-sinclair-fluidrive-makes-headway | archivedate = 2017-09-06 | page = 69 | title=Vulcan-Sinclair Fluidrive Makes Headway | date = 1946-08-16 | journal = The Commercial Motor }}</ref>\n\nImproved semi-automatics appeared in the 1950s and 1960s. The [[Automotive Products]] Manumatic and Newtondrive systems were also known as \"two-pedal transmissions\". They relieve the driver of the need for skill in operating clutch and engine speed in conjunction with the gear change. The '''Manumatic''' has a clutch servo powered by the vacuum at the induction manifold operating the automatic clutch - a conventional clutch incorporating centrifugal operation. A switch in the gear lever operates a solenoid valve so that when the gear lever is moved, the clutch is disengaged. A control unit made throttle adjustments to keep the engine speed matched to the driven clutch plate and also varied the speed of clutch operation appropriate to road speed.<ref>Staton Abbey (ed) ''Practical Automobile Engineering'' Clutch Systems p 193-194</ref> The '''Newtondrive''' system differed in making a provision for choke control and a cable linkage from clutch operating mechanism to the throttle. These systems could be fitted to smaller cars such as the [[Ford Anglia]].\n\nThe [[Ferrari 640]] race car incorporated, in 1989, an [[Electrohydraulic_manual_transmission|electo-hydraulic]] gear shift mechanism activated by paddles mounted behind the steering wheel.<ref name=\"lemans-paddle\"/><ref name=\"ferrarif1\">{{cite web |title=Ferrari F1-89 |url=http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |website=ferrari.com |access-date=2020-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927170637/http://formula1.ferrari.com/cars/f1-89 |archive-date=2013-09-27}}</ref>\n\n==Comparison to other automated transmissions==\nModern \"Semi-automatic transmissions,\" also known as \"automated manual transmissions\" (AMTs) usually have a fully automatic mode, where the driver does not need to change gears at all, operating in the same manner as a conventional type of automatic transmission by allowing the transmission's computer to automatically change gear if, for example, the driver were [[redline|redlining]] the engine. The AMT can be engaged in manual mode wherein one can up-shift or down-shift using the console-mounted shifter selecter or the paddle shifters just behind the steering wheel, without the need of a clutch pedal. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions ([[manumatic]]s such as [[Tiptronic]]) and [[continuous variable transmission]]s (CVTs) (such as [[Lineartronic#Subaru Lineartronic CVT|Lineartronic]]).\n\nDespite superficial similarity to other automated transmissions, AMTs differ significantly in internal operation and driver's \"feel\" from manumatics and CVTs. A manumatic, like a standard [[automatic transmission]], uses a [[torque converter]] instead of [[clutch]] to manage the link between the transmission and the engine, while a CVT uses a belt instead of a fixed number of gears. An AMT offers a more direct connection between the engine and wheels than a manumatic and this responsiveness is preferred in high performance driving applications, while a manumatic is better for street use because its fluid coupling makes it easier for the transmission to consistently perform smooth shifts,<ref>{{cite web| first1=Tony | last1=Quiroga | others=Hoey, Patrick M.

In one early mass-production example, [[Ferrari]] offered their [[Ferrari Mondial|Mondial]] model with a clutchless manual, which Ferrari called the Valeo transmission. In this system, the [[gear stick]] of a traditional manual transmission was retained; moving the shifter automatically engaged the electro-hydraulic clutch. Saab's Sensonic transmission worked in a similar fashion.\n\nIn standard mass-production automobiles today, the gear lever appears similar to manual shifts, except that the gear stick only moves forward and backward to shift into higher and lower gears, instead of the traditional H-pattern. The [[Bugatti Veyron]] uses this approach for its seven-speed transmission. In [[Formula One]], the system is adapted to fit onto the [[steering wheel]] in the form of two paddles; depressing the right paddle shifts into a higher gear, while depressing the left paddle shifts into a lower one. Numerous road cars have inherited the same mechanism.\n\n[[Hall effect sensor]]s sense the direction of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the [[gear box]] which senses the current speed and gear selected, feeds into a [[central processing unit]]. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a smooth clutch engagement, based on input from these two sensors as well as other factors, such as engine rotation, the [[Electronic Stability Control]], [[air conditioner]] and [[dashboard]] instruments.\n\nThe central processing unit powers a hydro-mechanical unit to either engage or disengage the clutch, which is kept in close synchronization with the gear-shifting action the driver has started. In some cases, the hydro-mechanical unit contains a [[Servomechanism|servo]]motor coupled to a gear arrangement for a linear [[actuator]], which uses [[brake fluid]] from the braking system to impel a hydraulic cylinder to move the main clutch actuator. In other cases, the clutch actuator may be completely electric.\n\nThe power of the system lies in the fact that electronic equipment can react much faster and more precisely than a human, and takes advantage of the precision of electronic signals to allow a complete clutch operation without the intervention of the driver.\n\nFor the needs of parking, reversing and neutralizing the transmission, the driver must engage both paddles at once; after this has been accomplished, the car will prompt for one of the three options.\n\nThe clutch is really only needed to get the car in motion. For a quicker upshift, the engine power can be cut, and the collar disengaged until the engine drops to the correct speed for the next gear. For the teeth of the collar to slide into the teeth of the rings, both the speed and position must match. This needs sensors to measure not only the speed, but the positions of the teeth, and the throttle may need to be opened softer or harder. The even-faster shifting techniques like [[powershifting]] require a heavier gearbox or clutch or even a [[dual clutch transmission]].\n\nA typical transmission has the following gears: P, R, N, D, M+, M-\n* ''P'' is the parking gear. It locks the transmission.\n* ''R'' is the reverse gear. It is similar to R in both traditional manual and in full automatic cars;\n* ''N'' is the neutral gear. It is similar to N in both traditional manual and full automatic;\n* ''D'' is the drive gear. It is equivalent of D in a full automatic. The gearbox in an AMT car is a manual gearbox, instead of one with a [[torque converter]] as in a traditional automatic;\n* ''M-'' downshifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars) to M1;\n* ''M+'' up-shifts a gear in sequential fashion, from M1 to M5 (M6 in 6-speed AMT cars).\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Alfa Romeo===\n[[Selespeed]] was introduced in 1999 in the [[Alfa Romeo 156]].<ref name=\"fiatautopress.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatautopress.com/index.php?method=cartelle&action=zoom&id=20041220314081583da688bf3dbbeee34b924a74271f8bc4|title=Press release 20 January 1999|accessdate=2007-05-08|work=fiatautopress.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327081230/http://www.fiatgroupautomobilespress.com/welcome.php|archivedate=27 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Martin===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Sportshift]]\n\n=== BMW ===\nSteptronic, SMG/SSG.\n\n===Chevrolet===\nFor the 1968 model year, Chevrolet introduced a simplified version of Powerglide marketed under the name \"Torque Drive.\" This unit was basically two-speed [[Powerglide]] without the vacuum modulator, requiring the driver to manually shift gears between Low and High. The quadrant indicator on Torque Drive cars was, Park R N Hi 1st. The driver would start the car in \"1st,\" then move the lever to \"Hi\" when desired.\n\nTorque Drive was only offered on low-horsepower engines for [[Camaro]], [[chevrolet Nova|Nova]], and the 1971 [[Chevrolet Vega|Vega]]. It was available on the Nova four cylinder engine, and on the Turbo-Thrift Sixes for Camaro as well as Nova. Despite its low introductory price of $68.65, most buyers apparently considered the Torque Drive a nuisance to shift, and for a hundred dollars more they could get fully automatic Powerglide, making Torque Drive installations very rare. Apparently the transmission wasn't very durable, since it depended on the driver's ability to shift between gears in a way that wouldn't damage the unit. After 1971, Chevrolet cancelled semi-automatic Torque Drive.\n\n=== Chrysler / Dodge / Jeep / Ram ===\n{{main|Vacamatic|Presto-Matic}}\n\nHistorically, the first semi-automatic transmission which was marketed by a major manufacturer was the 1941 M4/Vacamatic Transmission by [[Chrysler]]. It was an attempt to compete against rivals' [[automatic transmission]]s, though it still had a [[clutch]], it was primarily used to change range. The main difference was the addition of a fluid coupling between [[engine]] and clutch, and the shifting mechanism.\n\nIn normal driving, the clutch was used to select low, high or reverse. Attached to the transmission was an \"underdrive\" with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column-mounted and had three positions: Low (in the \"2nd\" position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the \"3rd\" position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in \"underdrive\" low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of 6&nbsp;mph (9.7&nbsp;km/h), the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above 13&nbsp;mph (21&nbsp;km/h), the driver would lift his foot and the car would \"shift\" into direct drive.\nThis configuration had the effect of providing 4 gear ratios:\nUnderdrive Low, 3.57/1,\nLow 2.04/1,\nUnderdrive High, 1.75/1,\nHigh, 1/1.\nIn order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner's manual cautioned drivers not to use \"1st or 3rd\" gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the \"clunk\" that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.\n\n===Citro\u00ebn and Peugeot===\n[[Citro\u00ebn]] produced a number of variants on semi-automatic transmission. The [[Citro\u00ebn DS]], introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted behind the steering wheel. This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.\n\nThe [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV]] gained an optional centrifugal clutch, marketed in English-speaking countries as \"Trafficlutch\". It did not help with gear changing, but it disengaged automatically when the engine slowed to an idle. A device was fitted to the carburettor to prevent the throttle closing abruptly, and the resultant clutch disengagement and lack of engine braking.\n\nLater, the manufacturer introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate models in the 1970s; the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]] and [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]] models had the option of three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear selector rods and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a [[torque converter]]. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citro\u00ebn semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire gear selecting operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.\n\nThe smaller range of cars: [[Citro\u00ebn C1|C1]], [[Citro\u00ebn C2|C2]] and [[Citro\u00ebn C3|C3]] have all been offered with a semi-automatic transmission named [[Sensodrive]]. This is based on a standard 5-speed gearbox with servo-controlled clutch. The operation is automatic, but it also has a manual mode where the driver changes gear manually; although gears are always changed by an electric servo.\n\nAn improved version of Sensodrive is EGS (Electronic Gearbox System), which has six gears.\n\nAn even further improved version is called ETG6 (6 speed Efficient Tronic Gearbox). It has slightly better characteristics compared to EGS and an added \"creep\" function.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=ETG6 Gearbox\n|website=Citro\u00ebn UK\n|url=http://www.citroen.co.uk/about-us/technology/driving-assistance/etg6-gearbox/\n|date=\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref> The ETG6 gearbox is used by the 2013 [[Citro\u00ebn C4 Picasso]]. The gearbox is also utilized by [[PSA Group]]'s other offerings, like the [[Peugeot 208]].\n\n2-tronic, EGC (Electric Gearbox Control) or Piloted Manual in [[Peugeot]].\n\n==={{anchor|Daimatic}} Daihatsu===\nThe 993&nbsp;cc [[Daihatsu]] [[Daihatsu Charade|Charade]] from 1985 until 1991 had the option of a two-speed semi-automatic transmission called \"Daimatic\". This unit is similar to a conventional auto, featuring both a torque converter and a planetary gearset but lacking a full valve body for making decisions regarding shifting. This was left entirely to the driver and as a result could be accelerated from rest in top gear if desired, depending entirely on the torque converter action. The standing quartermile time with two {{convert|60|kg|lb|abbr=on}} occupants and using low gear appropriately was 21.0 sec while using top gear only was 21.5 sec. This unit was also installed in the [[Innocenti Minitre|Innocenti Matic]] of the same time period.\n\n===Ferrari===\nFerrari's first automated manual gearbox in a road car (used them previously in their [[Formula One]] cars since 1989) went on sale in 1993 in the [[Ferrari Mondial]]; the Mondial Valeo retained the traditional gated shifter, but removed the clutch pedal, and the clutch mechanism was electronically actuated each time the gearshift was moved. Four years later, a paddle-shifted transmission arrived in the 1997 [[Ferrari F355]]. The most recent version of its single-clutch automated manual was introduced in the [[Ferrari 599 GTO]] which was capable of changing gear in 60 ms. In the [[Ferrari California]] & [[Ferrari 458 Italia]], Ferrari opted to use a [[double-clutch transmission]]. Since then, Ferrari has expanded use of their [[double-clutch transmission]] to all new models.\n\n===Fiat===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2019}}\nIn the early 2000s, [[Fiat]] offered their Speedgear transmissions for some of its cars, like the [[Fiat Punto]]. In 2008, a new system came to the market, Dualogic transmission, that equipped a wide range of cars, like the [[Fiat 500]], [[Fiat Bravo]], [[Fiat Punto]], etc. In 2017, Fiat introduced its new generation of semi-automatic transmissions, called GSR (Gear Smart Riding), that was designed to work with their new car models such as the [[Fiat MOBI]] and the [[Fiat Argo]].\n\n===Ford===\n[[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motor Co]]. offered the Semi-Automatic Transmission on the 1970 [[Ford Maverick (Americas)|Maverick]] 6-cylinder model as a lower-cost option to the popular 3-speed C4 [[Cruise-o-Matic]] transmission.  The shift quadrant featured \"P R N Hi 2 1\" and the Maverick owner's manual provides the speeds at which the driver should move the selector between the three forward gears.  Like Chevrolet's Torque-Drive, the Ford Semi-Automatic was essentially the regular automatic without the self-shifting capability.  At $121.00 retail, it was pricey, rarely ordered, and was discontinued the following year.\n\n===General Motors===\nIn 1937, [[Oldsmobile]] introduced the four-speed Automatic Safety Transmission as an option. This was an automatic transmission with automated control and shifting between a pair of ranges, with manual control over high and low ratio pairs of the four. It was not a semi-automatic transmission.  This transmission was replaced by fully automatic [[Hydra-Matic]] for the 1940 model year.\n\nIn 1938, [[Buick]] introduced a five-speed semi-automatic{{citation needed|date=June 2015|reason=Automatic or semi-automatic?}} transmission for the [[Buick Special]].  This unit was failure prone, however, and eventually was replaced by the fully automatic [[Dynaflow]] transmission for 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile History: Drivetrain|url=http://www.motorera.com/history/hist10.htm|website=motera.com|accessdate=18 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Honda / Acura===\n[[Honda]] marketed both cars and motorcycles with the [[Hondamatic]] transmission in the 1970s and early 1980s. This transmission is frequently referred to as the 'Bang-O-Matic' by mechanics.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The design is noteworthy because it preserves engine braking by eliminating a [[sprag clutch|sprag]] between first and second gears.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nOther Honda tradenames iShift & MultiMatic,\n\n===Hudson===\nDrive-Master, 1941-1950.\n\n===Hyundai & Kia===\nSportmatic, [[Sportronic]], HIVEC H-Matic.\n\n===Isuzu===\n{{main|NAVi5}}\n[[Isuzu]] introduced the \"NAVi5\" (New Advanced Vehicle with Intelligence 5-speed) in 1984. Based on a traditional 5-speed manual with a dry clutch, it was controlled by two hydraulic actuators and an electronic computer. The earlier version only had an automatic mode, but a manual mode was later added. It was first available in the [[Isuzu Aska|Aska]] and subsequently the other Isuzu vehicles (for Japanese domestic market only).\n\n===Lincoln-Mercury===\nFor 1942, Ford Motor Company announced a new semi-automatic transmission for Lincolns and Mercurys, called Liquimatic.  Liquimatic consisted of a fluid coupling, as well as an electro-mechanical vacuum control that automated the shift between second and third speeds.  Like Chrysler's Fluid Drive, a clutch was used to start the car from a standstill.  Lincolns got an overdrive gear as a bonus.\n\nThe transmission proved to be so trouble-prone that Ford recalled virtually every unit, and replaced them with standard manual transmissions.  The only known unit to exist is in the possession of the Early Ford V8 Foundation Museum in Auburn, Indiana.  While Ford gave up on semi-automatic transmissions after Liquimatic, Lincoln started using General Motors' [[Hydra-Matic]] in 1949, while Mercury got its own automatic, [[Merc-O-Matic]], in 1951.\n\n===Maserati===\n[[Electrohydraulic manual transmission|Cambiocorsa, DuoSelect, MC-Shift]]\n\n===Mercedes-Benz / Smart===\nMercedes used a system from 1957\u201361 similar to the VW [[Autostick]], called Hydrak. Hydrak had one major flaw: the [[oil]] supply for the [[torque converter]] was sealed within the converter itself and did not circulate via a pump, and also had no oil [[cooler (oil)|cooler]]. Idling in gear for even short periods would overheat the oil and burn up the seals in the converter, which would then need to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mbzponton.org/valueadded/maintenance/hydrak.htm|title=Mercedes-Benz Ponton Hydrak Automatic Clutch |first=Jeff|last=Miller|website=www.mbzponton.org|accessdate=24 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Smart Fortwo]] employs an automated manual transmission designed and manufactured by [[Getrag]] to eliminate the clutch pedal.  The first generation used a six-speed version, and the second generation used a five-speed version, model 5AMT130. Input from floor-mounted shifter or optional steering-wheel-mounted paddles controls a servo-operated clutch and sequential automated gearbox. The vehicle may be driven in automatic mode or via paddle shifters, where the operator controls the shift points but cannot feather or adjust the speed of the clutch.\n\n===NSU===\nThe [[Germany|German]] automobile manufacturer [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] produced an automated system for the [[rotary engine|rotary-engined]] [[NSU Ro 80]] saloon car in the 1960s, similar in concept to VW's Automatic Stickshift: a three-speed manual gearbox with a vacuum operated dry clutch controlled by a contact in the gear lever, and a torque converter. There was no clutch pedal, but slightly moving the gearshift closed an electric switch that operated a vacuum system which disengaged the clutch. The gear lever itself then could be moved through a standard 'H pattern' gate.\n\n===Opel===\n{{main|Easytronic}}\nOpel (Vauxhall Motors in the United Kingdom) produced a semi-automatic transmission gearbox, the Easytronic gearbox. As with all standard automateds, the Easytronic car has only two pedals (accelerator pedal and brake pedal) but it does have a clutch, though this is inbuilt into the car and is electrohydraulic. The Easytronic can be driven in \"manual mode\" simply by using the paddle shifter selector to change gears if the driver wishes to do so, or alternatively it can be driven in exactly the same way as a fully conventional automatic\u2014however, many Easytronic owners have complained that gear shifts in \"automatic mode\" are jerky; a common complaint with semi-autos based on a conventional manual gearbox. As with conventional, full automatic transmission cars, the Easytronic will \"creep\" forwards when the driver's foot is released from the brake pedal when the car is stationary.\n\n===Packard===\nAlso in 1941, [[Packard]] introduced the Electro-Matic [[clutch]], which was a vacuum operated clutch pedal, signaled by the position of the accelerator. Significantly, it came with an 'off' switch, probably due to the fact that the system was somewhat unstable during [[engine]] warm-up. [[Packard]]'s system was used in conjunction with their regular [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] so the H-pattern shifting remained.\n\nEarlier, and by many manufacturers, an arrangement to disengage the clutch (via a ratchet-like device) during coasting was tried to ease shifting. Called \"[[freewheel]]ing\", it was bedeviled by the absence of adequate brakes.\n\n===Plymouth===\nIn 1953, Plymouth fitted a torque converter, called 'Hy-Drive', to their standard 3-speed manual gearbox. The torque converter allowed the car to remain in High gear for most driving, providing fluid torque multiplication as needed. A clutch was provided for manual gear engagements and the driver could use all three speeds as desired.  Hy-Drive was also offered for the 1954 model year, but was soon replaced with Chrysler's fully automatic two-speed PowerFlite transmission.\n\n===Porsche===\nPorsche has created various automated manual and [[Manumatic]] transmissions, starting with Porsche's \"SportoMatic\" transmission in 1968. This transmission was marketed as an \"Automatic,\" despite it having no fully automatic mode. This automated manual transmission was a conventional four-speed manual gearbox, but with a vaccuum-operated single-disc dry clutch. A torque converter was utilized in place of a flywheel, and shifts and clutch were operated electromechanically whenever the driver moved the gearshift. The next \"automated\" transmission was the Porsche \"Tiptronic\" [[manumatic]] transmission of the 1990s, which was essentially a torque converter automatic transmission, but containing a built-in \"manual\" shift mechanism. The newest automated manual transmission by Porsche is the \"Porsche Doppelkupplungsgetriebe\" (PDK), which literally translates to \"Porsche dual-clutch transmission.\" It has two separate clutches and shafts combined into one housing unit, essentially with one clutch operating the odd gears, and one the clutch the even gears. All this is actuated automatically, and operated through the electrohydraulic actuators of the transmission's computer.<ref name=\"caranddriver3\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15366473/shift-this-a-history-of-porsches-sportomatic-tiptronic-and-pdk-transmissions/\n|title=A History of Porsche\u2019s Sportomatic, Tiptronic, and PDK Transmissions\n|website=Car and Driver\n|last=\n|first=\n|date=Dec 10, 2013\n|access-date=2020-02-29\n}}</ref>\n\n===Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi / Dacia / Infiniti===\nFor the [[Renault Dauphine]], a Ferlec semi-automatic was offered from 1957 until 1963, when the \"fully automatic\" Jaeger electromechanical transmission control became available.

Once the driver's hand was removed, the clutch would re-engage automatically. The transmission was also equipped with a torque converter, allowing the car to idle in gear, like an automatic. The torque converter was operated by transmission fluid. This would allow the car to stop in any gear and start from a standing stop in any gear. This transmission was first available on the 1968 Volkswagen Beetle (on sale in August 1967), and was made available on the Karmann Ghia during 1968.

[[Volvo]] offers its [[Volvo I-Shift|I-Shift]] on its heavier [[Volvo Trucks|trucks]] and [[Volvo Buses|buses]] as well [[UD Trucks]] with ESCOT, while [[ZF Friedrichshafen AG|ZF]] markets its ASTronic system for trucks, buses and coaches. In North America, [[Eaton Corporation|Eaton]] offers the \"AutoShift\" system which is an add-on to traditional non-synchromesh [[manual transmission]]s for heavy trucks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_53974/title_Leading-Transmission-Maker-Predicts-Major-Shift-to-Automatics-in-Heavy-Vehicles/newsarticle.html |title=Leading Transmission Maker Predicts Major Shift to Automatics in Heavy Vehicles - AutoWeb News |publisher=Autoweb.com.au |accessdate=2014-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727024751/http://www.autoweb.com.au/cms/A_53974/title_Leading-Transmission-Maker-Predicts-Major-Shift-to-Automatics-in-Heavy-Vehicles/newsarticle.html |archivedate=27 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> These [[gearbox]]es have a place in [[public transport]] as they have been shown to reduce fuel consumption in some specific cases.\n\n====Bristol/Daimler/Leyland buses====\nThe British employed pneumatic valve bodies to regulate gear shifting by charging pistons with compressed air within the gearbox. These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated by a series of valve bodies and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last gear selected or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.\n\nIn the UK though, semi-automatic transmissions have been very popular on buses for some time, from the 1950s right through to the 1980s, an example being the well known London [[AEC Routemaster]], although the latter could also be driven as a full automatic in the three highest gears. Most heavy-duty bus manufacturers offered this option, using a gearbox from [[Self-Changing Gears]] Ltd of Coventry, and on urban single- and double-deck buses it was the norm by the 1970s. This coincided with the development of city buses with engines and transmissions at the rear rather than the front, which was beyond the capability of a manual gearchange/clutch linkage from the driver's position. [[Leyland Bus|Leyland]] manufactured many buses with semi-automatic transmissions, including its [[Leyland Leopard|Leopard]] and [[Leyland Tiger|Tiger]] coaches. Fully automatic transmission became popular with increasing numbers of continental buses being bought in the UK, and more and more British manufacturers began offering automatic options, mostly using imported gearboxes (such as those made by Voith and ZF), and semi-automatic transmissions lost favour. These days, very few buses with semi-automatic transmissions remain in service, although many are still on the roads with private owners. Modern types of [[manumatic]] transmissions though are becoming more common, mostly replacing manual gearboxes in coaches.\n\n===Trains===\n====Railcars====\nThe Self-Changing Gears automated gearbox was also fitted to the several thousand diesel railcars built for the British railway system in the late 1950s-early 1960s, which lasted in service until the 1990s-2000s. Their whole engine-transmission system was based on that from the main bus manufacturers of the period such as Leyland and [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]]. Gear selection was by the train driver with a hand-held lever as the train accelerated. Such trains were formed of a number of such railcars coupled together and each power car had two engine/automated gearbox units mounted under the floor. Synchronising controls by control cables connected through the train ensured all the gearboxes under all coaches of the train changed gear together.\n\n====Locomotives====\nSemi-automatic transmission was also used on many small diesel [[shunting locomotive]]s, such as [[British Rail Class 03]] and [[British Rail Class 04]]. A widely used type was the Wilson-Drewry epicyclic gearbox.\n\nA less common type was the SSS (synchro-self-shifting) Powerflow gearbox.  This gearbox was of the layshaft type with constant-mesh gears and [[dog clutch]] engagement.  A special feature was that the drive was maintained during upward gearchanges. This system was used on [[Hudswell Clarke|Huwood-Hudswell]] diesel mines locomotives<ref name=\"dmm1\" /> and on the [[British Rail Class D2/7]] and [[British Rail Class D2/12]].\n\n===Motorcycles===\n\nThe first motorcycles with semi-automatic gearboxes were developed and patented in the mid 1960s by the Czechoslovakian [[Jawa Moto|Jawa]] motorcycle company.<ref name=CZ>{{cite web |title=V\u00e1lka mechanik\u016f: Japonci okop\u00edrovali \u010desk\u00fd vyn\u00e1lez! |url=https://epochaplus.cz/valka-mechaniku-japonci-okopirovali-cesky-vynalez/ |website=EpochaPlus|language=cs-CZ|date=20 January 2015|last=Ko\u017eu\u0161n\u00edk|first=Marek|access-date=27 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, Honda copied the Jawa semi-automatic clutch for the [[Honda Super Cub|Honda Cub]] step-through motorcycle series and so Jawa sued them in court for patent infringement. Honda settled out of court and Jawa granted them indefinite licence with royalties charged on each Honda motorcycle that used the Jawa system.<ref name=CZ/>\n\nThe first large capacity motorcycle with a semi-automatic gearbox was the 1975 {{cvt|948|cc|abbr=on}} Moto Guzzi Convert (the name was chosen to denote the torque converter which was at the heart of this 110&nbsp;mph motorcycle){{citation needed|date=June 2018}} a fairly heavy motorcycle which despite its weight still handled, and cornered remarkably well, which was thanks to the race-bred frame from the Moto Guzzi Le Mans.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nHonda also had a range of bikes fitted with a gearbox that mated a torque converter and a two speed gearbox. This style of gearbox still required the rider to manually selected neutral and either of the two gears using the foot gear lever.<ref name=\"cyclemay1976p69\">{{cite journal|title=[[Cycle (magazine)|Cycle magazine]]|date=May 1976|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|p=67\u201373}}</ref> These models were the [[Honda CB750#CB750A Hondamatic|CB750A]], [[Honda CB400T#CB400A Hawk Hondamatic|CB400A]], [[Honda CM400|CM400A]] and [[Honda CM450A|CM450A]]. These bikes were badged and marketed as Hondamatics.\n\nIn addition to the Hondamatic system noted above, [[Yamaha Motor Company]] introduced a semi-automatic transmission on its 2007 model year [[FJR1300]] [[sport-touring]] motorcycle in 2006. Notably, this system can be shifted either with the lever in the traditional position near the left foot, or with a switch accessible to the left hand where the clutch lever would go on traditional motorcycles.\n\nHonda began production of the [[Honda VFR1200F|VFR1200F]] on 8 September 2009,<ref name=\"autoblog1\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2009/09/09/honda-to-launch-first-ever-dual-clutch-gearbox-for-motorcycles-w/\n|title=Honda to launch first-ever dual clutch gearbox for motorcycles with new VFR\n|website=\n|last=Korzeniewski \n|first=Jeremy\n|date=Sep 9, 2009\n|access-date=2020-02-29 \n}}</ref> which includes an optional [[dual clutch transmission]], the first to be fitted to a motorcycle.\n\nThe [[BRP Can-Am Spyder Roadster]] is available with a clutchless automatic transmission (the SE5 or SE6, with five or six speeds, depending on the model).\n\nSmall capacity [[Types of motorcycles#Scooters, underbones and mopeds|underbone]] or \"step-thru\" types of motorcycles, such as the Honda Super Cub, [[Suzuki FR50]] and [[Suzuki FR80|FR80]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] Townmate, use a semi-automatic gearbox with a \"heel and toe\" foot change in the standard motorcycle position but without the need for conventional clutch operation.\n\nMany modern motorcycles feature a device called quickshifter for up-shifts without pressing the clutch lever or closing the throttle. The special sensor recognizes pressure on the gear shift rod and quickshifter sends a signal to the ECU to either stop fuelling for a short time (milliseconds) or suppress the spark at the plug, which unloads the gearbox and allows a gear change. The idea came from racing where it helps to minimize the time when the motorcycle is not at full power. An alternative device for down-shifts is called auto-blipper and is less widespread. It artificially \"blips\" the throttle to match engine speed to speed of the rear wheel to avoid sudden spikes in torque transfer.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n===ATVs===\nHonda released automated electric shift ATVs starting in model year 1998 with the TRX450FE aka Foreman 450ES ESP (Electric Shift Program). Shifting is accomplished by pressing either one of the gear selector arrows on the left handlebar control. The current selected gear is indicated by a digital display. The primary components of the shifting mechanisms were the same on both the manual and electric shift models, but the major difference was the deletion of the shift pedal and the addition of an internal electric shift servo which actuated the components (clutch assy, shift drum, etc.)in one motion instead of the traditional foot lever. In the event of a malfunction, a supplied override lever can be placed on a shaft protruding from the crankcase in the traditional spot where the pedal would have been.

The order was founded in 1923 by [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]], a Carlist claimant to the [[Spanish throne]] and a Legitimist claimant to the [[French throne]], for rewarding loyalists to the Carlist movement. In modern times, there are two branches of the Order. One branch's [[Grand master (order)|Grand Master]] is [[Prince Carlos, Duke of Parma]] while the other's is his uncle, [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|Prince Sixtus Henry, Duke of Aranjuez]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Order of Prohibited Legitimacy was created on 16 April 1923 by [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]]. From exile in Paris, he sent a letter to his political secretary [[Jos\u00e9 Selva Mergelina|Jos\u00e9 Selva Mergelina, 5th Marquis de Villores]], explaining his creation of the order stating that it served to recognize \"all those who by their sufferings or services become worthy of it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3062557&interno=S&posicion=1&presentacion=pagina|title=Biblioteca Virtual de Prensa Hist\u00f3rica > B\u00fasqueda \u203a 'El Eco de Gerona : Semanario de Acci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica' - A\u00f1o...|website=prensahistorica.mcu.es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=fAUqAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA268#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Historia del tradicionalismo espa\u00f1ol|date=April 2, 1941|publisher=Ediciones Trajano|via=Google Books}}</ref> The Marquis de Villores was decorated with the Order soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=fAUqAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA159#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Historia del tradicionalismo espa\u00f1ol|date=April 2, 1941|publisher=Ediciones Trajano|via=Google Books}}</ref> By a Royal Decree on 8 December 1923, he granted it to Carlist loyalist youths and [[Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra|Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra, Count of Urquijo]] in Madrid.\n\nSince the death of Jaime, Duke of Madrid, the claimants to the Carlist dynastic legitimacy have acted as Grand Masters of the Order. Prince Jaime was succeeded as Head of the Order by [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime]] in 1931. Infante Alfonso was succeeded by [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Prince Xavier, Duke of Parma]].  Prince Xavier was succeeded by his son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma]] in 1977.\n\nPrince Carlos Hugo embraced [[Titoism|Titoist]] socialism in the 1970s and sought to reform the [[Carlist Party]]. In 1979 he renounced his Carlist claims. In response, his traditionalist brother [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma]], established himself as the Grand Master of the Order and Head of the House of Bourbon-Parma.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/faroagencia/documentosdonsixtoenrique.html|title=Agencia FARO - Documentos Don Sixto Enrique de Borbon|website=www.oocities.org}}</ref> In 2003, while in France, Prince Carlos Hugo re-asserted his Carlist claims and assumed the title [[Count of Montemolin]], also bestowing the Carlist titles [[Duke of Madrid]], [[Duke of San Jaime]], and [[Duchess of Guernica]] upon his children. He reestablished himself as the Grand Master of the Order of Prohibited Legitimacy. His brother, Prince Sixtus Henry, and the supporters of his brother did not recognize the claim made by Carlos Hugo.

The order was founded in 1923 by [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]], a Carlist claimant to the [[Spanish throne]] and a Legitimist claimant to the [[French throne]], for rewarding loyalists to the Carlist movement. In modern times, there are two branches of the Order. One branch's [[Grand master (order)|Grand Master]] is [[Prince Carlos, Duke of Parma]] while the other's is his uncle, [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma|Prince Sixtus Henry, Duke of Aranjuez]]. \n\n== History ==\nThe Order of Prohibited Legitimacy was created on 16 April 1923 by [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid]]. From exile in Paris, he sent a letter to his political secretary [[Jos\u00e9 Selva Mergelina|Jos\u00e9 Selva Mergelina, 5th Marquis de Villores]], explaining his creation of the order stating that it served to recognize \"all those who by their sufferings or services become worthy of it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?path=3062557&interno=S&posicion=1&presentacion=pagina|title=Biblioteca Virtual de Prensa Hist\u00f3rica > B\u00fasqueda \u203a 'El Eco de Gerona : Semanario de Acci\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica' - A\u00f1o...|website=prensahistorica.mcu.es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=fAUqAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA268#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Historia del tradicionalismo espa\u00f1ol|date=April 2, 1941|publisher=Ediciones Trajano|via=Google Books}}</ref> The Marquis de Villores was decorated with the Order soon after.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=fAUqAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA159#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Historia del tradicionalismo espa\u00f1ol|date=April 2, 1941|publisher=Ediciones Trajano|via=Google Books}}</ref> By a Royal Decree on 8 December 1923, he granted it to Carlist loyalist youths and [[Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra|Julio de Urquijo e Ibarra, Count of Urquijo]] in Madrid. \n\nSince the death of Jaime, Duke of Madrid, the claimants to the Carlist dynastic legitimacy have acted as Grand Masters of the Order. Prince Jaime was succeeded as Head of the Order by [[Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime]] in 1931. Infante Alfonso was succeeded by [[Prince Xavier of Bourbon-Parma|Prince Xavier, Duke of Parma]].  Prince Xavier was succeeded by his son [[Carlos Hugo, Duke of Parma]] in 1977. \n\nPrince Carlos Hugo embraced [[Titoism|Titoist]] socialism in the 1970s and sought to reform the [[Carlist Party]]. In 1979 he renounced his Carlist claims. In response, his traditionalist brother [[Prince Sixtus Henry of Bourbon-Parma]], established himself as the Grand Master of the Order and Head of the House of Bourbon-Parma.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/faroagencia/documentosdonsixtoenrique.html|title=Agencia FARO - Documentos Don Sixto Enrique de Borbon|website=www.oocities.org}}</ref> In 2003, while in France, Prince Carlos Hugo re-asserted his Carlist claims and assumed the title [[Count of Montemolin]], also bestowing the Carlist titles [[Duke of Madrid]], [[Duke of San Jaime]], and [[Duchess of Guernica]] upon his children. He reestablished himself as the Grand Master of the Order of Prohibited Legitimacy. His brother, Prince Sixtus Henry, and the supporters of his brother did not recognize the claim made by Carlos Hugo. Therefore the order maintains two branches, one headed by Prince Sixtus Henry and the other by Carlos Henry's successor, [[Carlos, Duke of Parma]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.docelinajes.org/2011/02/sobre-la-actualidad-de-la-orden-de-la-legitimidad-proscrita-y-sus-distintas-obediencias/|title=SOBRE LA ACTUALIDAD DE LA ORDEN DE LA LEGITIMIDAD PROSCRITA Y SUS DISTINTAS OBEDIENCIAS.}}</ref>\n\n== Insignia ==\nThe insignia of the Order of Prohibited Legitimacy consist of a Covadonga Cross hanging on a ribbon with vertical black and green bars.
