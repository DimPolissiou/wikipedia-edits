The perpetrator was [[Mark David Chapman]], who was a recently unemployed resident of Hawaii. Chapman stated that he was incensed by Lennon's lifestyle and public statements, especially his much-publicized remark about the Beatles being \"[[more popular than Jesus]]\" and the lyrics of his later songs \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\" and \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\". Chapman also said he was inspired by the fictional character [[Holden Caulfield]] from [[J. D. Salinger]]'s novel ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.\n\nChapman planned the killing over the course of several months and waited for Lennon at the Dakota on the morning of 8 December. During the evening, he met Lennon, who signed his copy of the album ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. Lennon left with his wife, [[Yoko Ono]], for a recording session at [[Record Plant Studios|Record Plant Studio]]. Later that night, Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota. As they walked towards the archway entrance of the building, Chapman fired five [[hollow-point bullet]]s from a [[.38 special]] [[revolver]], four of which hit Lennon in the back. Chapman remained at the scene reading ''The Catcher in the Rye'' until he was arrested by the police. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser to [[Roosevelt Hospital]], where he was pronounced [[dead on arrival]].\n\nA worldwide outpouring of grief ensued on an unprecedented scale. Crowds gathered at Roosevelt Hospital and in front of the Dakota, and at least three Beatles fans committed suicide. Lennon was [[Cremation|cremated]] at the [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Hartsdale, New York]], on 12 December; the ashes were given to Ono, who requested 10 minutes of silence around the world instead of holding a funeral. Chapman pleaded guilty of murdering Lennon and was given a sentence of 20-years-to-life imprisonment. He has been denied parole 10 times after he became eligible in 2000.\n\n==Events preceding the murder==\n\n===8 December 1980===\n[[File:Annie Leibovitz Lennon Ono December 1980.jpg|thumb|[[Annie Leibovitz]]'s portrait of Lennon and Ono, taken on the day of the killing]]\n[[Portrait photography|Portrait photographer]] [[Annie Leibovitz]] went to the Lennons' apartment to do a [[photo shoot]] for [[Rolling Stone magazine|''Rolling Stone'']] magazine.<ref name=\"Badman\">{{citation |last=Badman |first=Keith |title=The Beatles After the Breakup 1970\u20132000: A Day-by-Day Diary |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |year=2001 | pages= 270\u2013272 | isbn=978-0-7119-8307-6}}.</ref> Leibovitz promised them that a photo of the two of them together would make the front cover of the magazine.

One of the exiting bullets from his chest hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart.

Ono said he was probably watching television and did not want him to learn of his father's death from a TV announcement.<ref name=\"itv.com\"/> Meanwhile, news producer Alan J. Weiss of [[WABC-TV]] had been waiting to be treated in the Roosevelt Hospital ER after being injured in a motorcycle accident earlier in the evening. Weiss recalled in a 2013 interview for the [[CNN]] series ''Crimes of the Century'' that he had seen Lennon being wheeled into the room surrounded by several police officers. After he learned what happened, Weiss called back to the station to relay the information. Eventually, word made its way through the chain of command to [[ABC News]] president [[Roone Arledge]], who was tasked with finding a way to bring this major development to the viewing audience.<ref>''Crimes of the Century''. CNN Original Productions, originally aired in 2013.</ref>\n\nWhile all of this was happening, Arledge, who was also the president of the network's sports division, was presiding over [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s telecast of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in his capacity as its executive producer. When Arledge received word of Lennon's death, a game between the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] and the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] was tied with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots were driving toward the potential winning score. As the Patriots tried to put themselves in position for a field goal, Arledge informed [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Howard Cosell]] of the shooting and suggested that they be the ones to report on the murder. Cosell, who had interviewed Lennon during a ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast in [[1974 NFL season|1974]], was chosen to do so but was apprehensive of it at first, as he felt the game should take precedence and that it was not their place to break such a big story. Gifford convinced Cosell otherwise, saying that he should not \"hang on to (the news)\" as the significance of the event was much greater than the finish of the game.\n\nThe following exchange began with thirty seconds left in the fourth quarter, shortly after Gifford and Cosell had been informed of what had transpired:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=5880125|title=Ex-Pats kicker forever linked to Lennon|publisher=[[ESPN]]|first=Jeff|last=Ausiello|date=5 December 2010|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Cosell''':&nbsp;... but [the game]'s suddenly been placed in total perspective for us.

The perpetrator was [[Mark David Chapman]], who was a recently unemployed resident of Hawaii. Chapman stated that he was incensed by Lennon's lifestyle and public statements, especially his much-publicized remark about the Beatles being \"[[more popular than Jesus]]\" and the lyrics of his later songs \"[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]\" and \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\". Chapman also said he was inspired by the fictional character [[Holden Caulfield]] from [[J. D. Salinger]]'s novel ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]''.\n\nChapman planned the killing over the course of several months and waited for Lennon at the Dakota on the morning of 8 December. During the evening, he met Lennon, who signed his copy of the album ''[[Double Fantasy]]''. Lennon left with his wife, [[Yoko Ono]], for a recording session at [[Record Plant Studios|Record Plant Studio]]. Later that night, Lennon and Ono returned to the Dakota. As they walked towards the archway entrance of the building, Chapman fired five [[hollow-point bullet]]s from a [[.38 special]] [[revolver]], four of which hit Lennon in the back. Chapman remained at the scene reading ''The Catcher in the Rye'' until he was arrested by the police. Lennon was rushed in a police cruiser to [[Roosevelt Hospital]], where he was pronounced [[dead on arrival]].\n\nA worldwide outpouring of grief ensued on an unprecedented scale. Crowds gathered at Roosevelt Hospital and in front of the Dakota, and at least three Beatles fans committed suicide. Lennon was [[Cremation|cremated]] at the [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Hartsdale, New York]], on 12 December; the ashes were given to Ono, who requested 10 minutes of silence around the world instead of holding a funeral. Chapman pleaded guilty of murdering Lennon and was given a sentence of 20-years-to-life imprisonment.

Three doctors, a nurse, and two or three other medical attendants worked on Lennon for ten to twenty minutes in an attempt to resuscitate him.

One of the exiting bullets from his chest hit and became lodged in his upper left arm, while the fourth lodged itself in his aorta beside his heart.

In 2005, Lynn recalled being the one massaging Lennon's heart and attempting to resuscitate him for 20 minutes, that two other doctors were present, and that the three of them together declared Lennon's death.<ref name=\"Kilgannon2005\"/> Conversely in 1990, Richard Marks, an emergency room surgeon at Roosevelt Hospital, stated he operated on Lennon, administered a \"massive\" blood transfusion, and provided heart massage to no avail. \"When I realized he wasn't going to make it,\" said Marks, \"I just sewed him back up.

Weiss of [[WABC-TV]] had been waiting to be treated in the Roosevelt Hospital ER after being injured in a motorcycle accident earlier in the evening. Weiss recalled in a 2013 interview for the [[CNN]] series ''Crimes of the Century'' that he had seen Lennon being wheeled into the room surrounded by several police officers. After he learned what happened, Weiss called back to the station to relay the information. Eventually, word made its way through the chain of command to [[ABC News]] president [[Roone Arledge]], who was tasked with finding a way to bring this major development to the viewing audience.<ref>''Crimes of the Century''. CNN Original Productions, originally aired in 2013.</ref>\n\nWhile all of this was happening, Arledge, who was also the president of the network's sports division, was presiding over [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s telecast of ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' in his capacity as its executive producer. When Arledge received word of Lennon's death, a game between the [[1980 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] and the [[1980 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] was tied with less than a minute left in the fourth quarter and the Patriots were driving toward the potential winning score. As the Patriots tried to put themselves in position for a field goal, Arledge informed [[Frank Gifford]] and [[Howard Cosell]] of the shooting and suggested that they be the ones to report on the murder. Cosell, who had interviewed Lennon during a ''Monday Night Football'' broadcast in [[1974 NFL season|1974]], was chosen to do so but was apprehensive of it at first, as he felt the game should take precedence and that it was not their place to break such a big story. Gifford convinced Cosell otherwise, saying that he should not \"hang on to (the news)\" as the significance of the event was much greater than the finish of the game.\n\nThe following exchange began with thirty seconds left in the fourth quarter, shortly after Gifford and Cosell had been informed of what had transpired:<ref>{{cite web| url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=5880125|title=Ex-Pats kicker forever linked to Lennon|publisher=[[ESPN]]|first=Jeff|last=Ausiello|date=5 December 2010|accessdate=6 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|'''Cosell''':&nbsp;... but [the game]'s suddenly been placed in total perspective for us.

The term may refer to acquired conditions such as [[cerebral achromatopsia]], but it typically refers to an [[autosomal recessive]] congenital [[color blindness|color vision condition]], the inability to perceive [[color]] and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels, typically exterior daylight. The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. It is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000&nbsp;live births worldwide.\n\nThere is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'' by [[Oliver Sacks]], some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.\n\nOne common trait is [[hemeralopia]] or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the [[cone cell|cone system]] and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nThe syndrome is frequently noticed first in children around six months of age by their photophobic activity or their [[nystagmus]]. The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life&nbsp;\u2013 but remain near 20/200. The congenital forms of the condition are considered stationary and do not worsen with age.\n\nThe five symptoms associated with achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia are:\n# Achromatopsia\n# [[Amblyopia]] \u2013 reduced visual acuity\n# [[Hemeralopia]] \u2013 with the subject exhibiting photophobia\n# [[Pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]]\n# [[Iris (anatomy)|Iris]] operating abnormalities\n\nThe syndrome of achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is poorly described in current medical and neuro-ophthalmological texts. It became a common term following the release of neuroscientist Oliver Sacks' book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'', in 1997. Up to that time most color blind subjects were described as achromats or achromatopes. Those with a lesser degree of color perception abnormality were described as either protanopes, deuteranopes or tetartanopes&nbsp;\u2013 historically tritanopes.\n\nAchromatopsia has also been called rod [[monochromacy]] and total congenital color blindness. Individuals with the [[congenital]] form of this condition show complete absence of [[cone cell]] activity via [[electroretinography]] at high light levels. There are at least four [[locus (genetics)|genetic causes]] of congenital achromatopsia, two of which involve [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s ([[#ACHM2|ACHM2]], [[#ACHM3|ACHM3]]), a third involves the cone [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.\n\n=== Complete achromatopsia ===\nAside from a complete inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia have a number of other [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] aberrations. Included among these [[optical aberration]]s are greatly decreased [[visual acuity]] (<0.1 or 20 in daylight, [[hemeralopia]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], and severe [[photophobia]]. The [[fundus (eye)|fundus]] of the eye appears completely normal.\n\n=== Incomplete achromatopsia ===\nIn general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia (dyschromatopsia) are similar to those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.\n\n== Cause ==\n\n=== Acquired ===\nAcquired achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is a condition associated with damage to the diencephalon\u2014primarily the [[thalamus]] of the mid brain\u2014or the [[cerebral cortex]]\u2014the new brain\u2014specifically the fourth visual association area, V4 which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in colour processing.\n\nThalamic achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is caused by damage to the thalamus; it is most frequently caused by tumor growth since the thalamus is well protected from external damage.\n\n[[Cerebral achromatopsia]] is a form of acquired [[color blindness]] that is caused by damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's [[retina]]. It is most frequently caused by physical trauma, hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth.\n\n=== Congenital ===\nThe known causes of the congenital forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the [[Photoreceptor cell#Phototransduction|retinal phototransduction pathway]]. Specifically, this form of achromatopsia seems to result from the inability of [[cone cell]]s to properly respond to light input by [[membrane potential|hyperpolarizing]]. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) as well as the cone cell [[transducin]], GNAT2 (ACHM4).\n\nA fourth genetic cause (ACHM5, OMIM 613093) was discovered in 2009.{{sfn|Thiadens|2009|pp=240\u2013247}} It is a mutation of gene PDE6C, located on chromosome locus&nbsp;10, 10q24. It is estimated that less than two percent of achromatopsias are caused by a mutation in this gene.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nThe hemeralopic aspect of achromatopsia can be diagnosed non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent. The mesotopic level is approximately a hundred times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram. When as described, the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.\n\nIn general, the molecular pathomechanism of achromatopsia is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]; particularly important in [[visual perception]] as its level controls the opening of [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting [[membrane potential|hyperpolarization]] and cessation of [[glutamate]] [[Chemical synapse#Signaling across chemical synapses|release]].\n\nNative retinal CNGs are composed of 2&nbsp;\u03b1- and 2&nbsp;\u03b2-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in [[cone cell]]s. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas this is not the case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability ([[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] vs. [[potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] and [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward [[Image rectification|rectification]], current flickering, and sensitivity to block by [[diltiazem|L-cis-diltiazem]].\n\nMutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function\u2014often increased affinity for cGMP\u2014of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the [[cone cell]] [[transducin]], GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by [[photon]]s. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia [[phenotype]].\n\nMolecular diagnosis can be established by identification of biallelic variants in the causative genes. Molecular genetic testing approaches used in achromatopsia can include targeted analysis for the common CNGB3 variant c.1148delC&nbsp;(p.Thr383IlefsTer13), use of a multigenerational panel, or comprehensive genomic testing.\n\n=== ACHM2 ===\nWhile some mutations in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, at least one mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate]]. Others include the introduction of a sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased [[calcium]] permeability.\n\nWhen mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}} While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to achromatopsia, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1&nbsp;region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface.{{sfn|Patel|2005|pp=2282\u20132290}} Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the [[cone cell]]'s ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1&nbsp;region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}}\n\n=== ACHM3 ===\nWhile very few mutations in CNGB3 have been characterized, the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional. This will largely result in [[haploinsufficiency]], though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a [[dominant negative]] fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the [[cell membrane]].{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}}\n\nThe three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q&nbsp;mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity.{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP.{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.\n\n=== ACHM4 ===\nUpon activation by light, [[cone opsin]] causes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein ([[G-protein]]) \u03b1-[[transducin]]g activity polypeptide&nbsp;2 (GNAT2). This causes the release of the activated \u03b1-subunit from the inhibitory \u03b2/\u03b3-subunits. This \u03b1-subunit then activates a [[phosphodiesterase]] that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3&nbsp;channels.\n\nAs this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, cone opsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or [[photoreceptor protein|photoreceptor]] [[membrane potential|membrane hyperpolarization]].\n\n== Management ==\nThere is generally no treatment to cure achromatopsia. However, dark red or plum colored filters are very helpful in controlling light sensitivity.{{sfn|Corn|2010|p=233}}\n\nSince 2003, there is a cybernetic device called [[eyeborg]] that allows people to perceive color through sound waves.{{sfn|Ronchi|2009|p=319}} Achromatopsic artist [[Neil Harbisson]] was the first to use such a device in early 2004, the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound of each color.{{sfn|Pearlman|2015|pp=84\u201390}}\n\nMoreover, there is some research on gene therapy for animals with achromatopsia, with positive results on mice and young dogs, but less effectiveness on older dogs. However, no experiments have been made on humans. There are many challenges to conducting [[gene therapy for color blindness]] on humans.\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAchromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1&nbsp;in 30,000 people.{{sfn|Thiadens|2011|p=59}}\n\nHowever, on the small [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]n atoll of [[Pingelap]], approximately five percent of the atoll's 3,000 inhabitants are afflicted.{{sfn|Brody|1970|pp=1253\u20131257}}{{sfn|Hussels|1972|pp=304\u2013309}} This is the result of a [[population bottleneck]] caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the 1770s, which killed all but about twenty islanders, including one who was heterozygous for achromatopsia.\n\nThe people of this region have termed achromatopsia \"maskun\", which literally means \"not see\" in [[Pingelapese]].{{sfn|Morton|1972|pp=277\u2013289}} This unusual population drew neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]''.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{term|Acquired achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|[[Cerebral achromatopsia]]}}\n{{term|Congenital or inherited achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=1|Complete typical achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=2|Incomplete atypical achromatopsia, or incomplete atypical [[Color blindness|dyschromatopsia]]}}\n\n=== Related ===\n{{term|Achromatopsia}}\n  {{defn|Complete lack of the perception of color in a subject, seeing only in black, white, and shades of grey.

The term may refer to acquired conditions such as [[cerebral achromatopsia]], but it typically refers to an [[autosomal recessive]] congenital [[color blindness|color vision condition]], the inability to perceive [[color]] and to achieve satisfactory visual acuity at high light levels, typically exterior daylight. The syndrome is also present in an incomplete form which is more properly defined as dyschromatopsia. It is estimated to affect 1 in 30,000&nbsp;live births worldwide.\n\nThere is some discussion as to whether achromats can see color or not. As illustrated in ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'' by [[Oliver Sacks]], some achromats cannot see color, only black, white, and shades of grey. With five different genes currently known to cause similar symptoms, it may be that some do see marginal levels of color differentiation due to different gene characteristics. With such small sample sizes and low response rates, it is difficult to accurately diagnose the 'typical achromatic conditions'. If the light level during testing is optimized for them, they may achieve corrected visual acuity of 20/100 to 20/150 at lower light levels, regardless of the absence of color.\n\nOne common trait is [[hemeralopia]] or blindness in full sun. In patients with achromatopsia, the [[cone cell|cone system]] and fibres carrying color information remain intact. This indicates that the mechanism used to construct colors is defective.\n\n== Signs and symptoms ==\nThe syndrome is frequently noticed first in children around six months of age by their photophobic activity or their [[nystagmus]]. The nystagmus becomes less noticeable with age but the other symptoms of the syndrome become more relevant as school age approaches. Visual acuity and stability of the eye motions generally improve during the first six to seven years of life&nbsp;\u2013 but remain near 20/200. The congenital forms of the condition are considered stationary and do not worsen with age.\n\nThe five symptoms associated with achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia are:\n# Achromatopsia\n# [[Amblyopia]] \u2013 reduced visual acuity\n# [[Hemeralopia]] \u2013 with the subject exhibiting photophobia\n# [[Pathologic nystagmus|Nystagmus]]\n# [[Iris (anatomy)|Iris]] operating abnormalities\n\nThe syndrome of achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is poorly described in current medical and neuro-ophthalmological texts. It became a common term following the release of neuroscientist Oliver Sacks' book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]'', in 1997. Up to that time most color blind subjects were described as achromats or achromatopes. Those with a lesser degree of color perception abnormality were described as either protanopes, deuteranopes or tetartanopes&nbsp;\u2013 historically tritanopes.\n\nAchromatopsia has also been called rod [[monochromacy]] and total congenital color blindness. Individuals with the [[congenital]] form of this condition show complete absence of [[cone cell]] activity via [[electroretinography]] at high light levels. There are at least four [[locus (genetics)|genetic causes]] of congenital achromatopsia, two of which involve [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s ([[#ACHM2|ACHM2]], [[#ACHM3|ACHM3]]), a third involves the cone [[photoreceptor cell|photoreceptor]] transducin (GNAT2, ACHM4), and the last remains unknown.\n\n=== Complete achromatopsia ===\nAside from a complete inability to see color, individuals with complete achromatopsia have a number of other [[ophthalmology|ophthalmologic]] aberrations. Included among these [[optical aberration]]s are greatly decreased [[visual acuity]] (<0.1 or 20 in daylight, [[hemeralopia]], [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]], and severe [[photophobia]]. The [[fundus (eye)|fundus]] of the eye appears completely normal.\n\n=== Incomplete achromatopsia ===\nIn general, symptoms of incomplete achromatopsia (dyschromatopsia) are similar to those of complete achromatopsia except in a diminished form. Individuals with incomplete achromatopsia have reduced visual acuity with or without nystagmus or photophobia. Furthermore, these individuals show only partial impairment of cone cell function but again have retained rod cell function.\n\n== Cause ==\n\n=== Acquired ===\nAcquired achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is a condition associated with damage to the diencephalon\u2014primarily the [[thalamus]] of the mid brain\u2014or the [[cerebral cortex]]\u2014the new brain\u2014specifically the fourth visual association area, V4 which receives information from the parvocellular pathway involved in colour processing.\n\nThalamic achromatopsia or dyschromatopsia is caused by damage to the thalamus; it is most frequently caused by tumor growth since the thalamus is well protected from external damage.\n\n[[Cerebral achromatopsia]] is a form of acquired [[color blindness]] that is caused by damage to the [[cerebral cortex]] of the brain, rather than abnormalities in the cells of the eye's [[retina]]. It is most frequently caused by physical trauma, hemorrhage or tumor tissue growth.\n\n=== Congenital ===\nThe known causes of the congenital forms of achromatopsia are all due to malfunction of the [[Photoreceptor cell#Phototransduction|retinal phototransduction pathway]]. Specifically, this form of achromatopsia seems to result from the inability of [[cone cell]]s to properly respond to light input by [[membrane potential|hyperpolarizing]]. Known genetic causes of this are mutations in the cone cell [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s CNGA3 (ACHM2) and CNGB3 (ACHM3) as well as the cone cell [[transducin]], GNAT2 (ACHM4).\n\nA fourth genetic cause (ACHM5, OMIM 613093) was discovered in 2009.{{sfn|Thiadens|2009|pp=240\u2013247}} It is a mutation of gene PDE6C, located on chromosome locus&nbsp;10, 10q24. It is estimated that less than two percent of achromatopsias are caused by a mutation in this gene.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nThe hemeralopic aspect of achromatopsia can be diagnosed non-invasively using electroretinography. The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent. The mesotopic level is approximately a hundred times lower than the clinical level used for the typical high level electroretinogram. When as described, the condition is due to a saturation in the neural portion of the retina and not due to the absence of the photoreceptors per se.\n\nIn general, the molecular pathomechanism of achromatopsia is either the inability to properly control or respond to altered levels of [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]; particularly important in [[visual perception]] as its level controls the opening of [[cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel]]s (CNGs). Decreasing the concentration of cGMP results in closure of CNGs and resulting [[membrane potential|hyperpolarization]] and cessation of [[glutamate]] [[Chemical synapse#Signaling across chemical synapses|release]].\n\nNative retinal CNGs are composed of 2&nbsp;\u03b1- and 2&nbsp;\u03b2-subunits, which are CNGA3 and CNGB3, respectively, in [[cone cell]]s. When expressed alone, CNGB3 cannot produce functional channels, whereas this is not the case for CNGA3. Coassembly of CNGA3 and CNGB3 produces channels with altered membrane expression, ion permeability ([[sodium|Na<sup>+</sup>]] vs. [[potassium|K<sup>+</sup>]] and [[calcium|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]]), relative efficacy of cAMP/cGMP activation, decreased outward [[Image rectification|rectification]], current flickering, and sensitivity to block by [[diltiazem|L-cis-diltiazem]].\n\nMutations tend to result in the loss of CNGB3 function or gain of function\u2014often increased affinity for cGMP\u2014of CNGA3. cGMP levels are controlled by the activity of the [[cone cell]] [[transducin]], GNAT2. Mutations in GNAT2 tend to result in a truncated and, presumably, non-functional protein, thereby preventing alteration of cGMP levels by [[photon]]s. There is a positive correlation between the severity of mutations in these proteins and the completeness of the achromatopsia [[phenotype]].\n\nMolecular diagnosis can be established by identification of biallelic variants in the causative genes. Molecular genetic testing approaches used in achromatopsia can include targeted analysis for the common CNGB3 variant c.1148delC&nbsp;(p.Thr383IlefsTer13), use of a multigenerational panel, or comprehensive genomic testing.\n\n=== ACHM2 ===\nWhile some mutations in CNGA3 result in truncated and, presumably, non-functional channels this is largely not the case. While few mutations have received in-depth study, at least one mutation does result in functional channels. Curiously, this mutation, T369S, produces profound alterations when expressed without CNGB3. One such alteration is decreased affinity for [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate]]. Others include the introduction of a sub-conductance, altered single-channel gating kinetics, and increased [[calcium]] permeability.\n\nWhen mutant T369S channels coassemble with CNGB3, however, the only remaining aberration is increased calcium permeability.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}} While it is not immediately clear how this increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to achromatopsia, one hypothesis is that this increased current decreases the signal-to-noise ratio. Other characterized mutations, such as Y181C and the other S1&nbsp;region mutations, result in decreased current density due to an inability of the channel to traffic to the surface.{{sfn|Patel|2005|pp=2282\u20132290}} Such loss of function will undoubtedly negate the [[cone cell]]'s ability to respond to visual input and produce achromatopsia. At least one other missense mutation outside of the S1&nbsp;region, T224R, also leads to loss of function.{{sfn|Tr\u00e4nkner|2004|pp=138\u2013147}}\n\n=== ACHM3 ===\nWhile very few mutations in CNGB3 have been characterized, the vast majority of them result in truncated channels that are presumably non-functional. This will largely result in [[haploinsufficiency]], though in some cases the truncated proteins may be able to coassemble with wild-type channels in a [[dominant negative]] fashion. The most prevalent ACHM3 mutation, T383IfsX12, results in a non-functional truncated protein that does not properly traffic to the [[cell membrane]].{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}}\n\nThe three missense mutations that have received further study show a number of aberrant properties, with one underlying theme. The R403Q&nbsp;mutation, which lies in the pore region of the channel, results in an increase in outward current rectification, versus the largely linear current-voltage relationship of wild-type channels, concomitant with an increase in cGMP affinity.{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} The other mutations show either increased (S435F) or decreased (F525N) surface expression but also with increased affinity for cAMP and cGMP.{{sfn|Peng|2003|pp=34533\u201334540}}{{sfn|Bright|2005|pp=1141\u20131150}} It is the increased affinity for cGMP and cAMP in these mutants that is likely the disorder-causing change. Such increased affinity will result in channels that are insensitive to the slight concentration changes of cGMP due to light input into the retina.\n\n=== ACHM4 ===\nUpon activation by light, [[cone opsin]] causes the exchange of GDP for GTP in the guanine nucleotide binding protein ([[G-protein]]) \u03b1-[[transducin]]g activity polypeptide&nbsp;2 (GNAT2). This causes the release of the activated \u03b1-subunit from the inhibitory \u03b2/\u03b3-subunits. This \u03b1-subunit then activates a [[phosphodiesterase]] that catalyzes the conversion of cGMP to GMP, thereby reducing current through CNG3&nbsp;channels.\n\nAs this process is absolutely vital for proper color processing it is not surprising that mutations in GNAT2 lead to achromatopsia. The known mutations in this gene, all result in truncated proteins. Presumably, then, these proteins are non-functional and, consequently, cone opsin that has been activated by light does not lead to altered cGMP levels or [[photoreceptor protein|photoreceptor]] [[membrane potential|membrane hyperpolarization]].\n\n== Management ==\nThere is generally no treatment to cure achromatopsia. However, dark red or plum colored filters are very helpful in controlling light sensitivity.{{sfn|Corn|2010|p=233}}\n\nSince 2003, there is a cybernetic device called [[eyeborg]] that allows people to perceive color through sound waves.{{sfn|Ronchi|2009|p=319}} Achromatopsic artist [[Neil Harbisson]] was the first to use such a device in early 2004, the eyeborg allowed him to start painting in color by memorizing the sound of each color.{{sfn|Pearlman|2015|pp=84\u201390}}\n\nMoreover, there is some research on gene therapy for animals with achromatopsia, with positive results on mice and young dogs, but less effectiveness on older dogs. However, no experiments have been made on humans. There are many challenges to conducting [[gene therapy for color blindness]] on humans.\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAchromatopsia is a relatively uncommon disorder, with a prevalence of 1&nbsp;in 30,000 people.{{sfn|Thiadens|2011|p=59}}\n\nHowever, on the small [[Federated States of Micronesia|Micronesia]]n atoll of [[Pingelap]], approximately five percent of the atoll's 3,000 inhabitants are afflicted.{{sfn|Brody|1970|pp=1253\u20131257}}{{sfn|Hussels|1972|pp=304\u2013309}} This is the result of a [[population bottleneck]] caused by a typhoon and ensuing famine in the 1770s, which killed all but about twenty islanders, including one who was heterozygous for achromatopsia.\n\nThe people of this region have termed achromatopsia \"maskun\", which literally means \"not see\" in [[Pingelapese]].{{sfn|Morton|1972|pp=277\u2013289}} This unusual population drew neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] to the island for which he wrote his 1997 book, ''[[The Island of the Colorblind]]''.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{term|Acquired achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|[[Cerebral achromatopsia]]}}\n{{term|Congenital or inherited achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=1|Complete typical achromatopsia}}\n{{defn|no=2|Incomplete atypical achromatopsia, or incomplete atypical [[Color blindness|dyschromatopsia]]}}\n\n=== Related ===\n{{term|Achromatopsia}}\n  {{defn|Complete lack of the perception of color in a subject, seeing only in black, white, and shades of grey.
