Between the years of 1945 -1975 the population of the city quadrupled due to the high rate of population growth achieved at that time (4.8%) and to migratory movements in the interior of the country. In 2015 the estimated population was 152,051. It is the capital of the [[Comayagua department]] of [[Honduras]] and it is noted for its wealth of Spanish Colonial architecture.  The central square has a cathedral with the oldest clock in the Americas. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Elcolegiotridentino.jpg|thumb|Colegio Tridentino de Comayagua|alt=|left|242x242px]]\nDuring the Pre-Columbian era the valley in which the city is located was populated by [[Lenca|Lenca people]]. During the colonization Comayagua was founded with the name ''Santa Mar\u00eda de la Nueva Valladolid'' by [[Conquistador]] [[Alonso de C\u00e1ceres]] under orders from [[Francisco de Montejo]], Governor of [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] on 8 December 1537. The complementary names \u00abValladolid\u00bb or \u00abPais de las Higueras\u00bb were those given to it by the Spaniards but it kept the primitive of the place that is purely indigenous. Some differ in their etymology but most agree that it is composed of \"Coma\" (which in Lenca dialect means paramo) and \"water\" being its true meaning \"p\u00e1ramo abundant with water\".  From 1540 on Comayagua was the capital of the Honduras Province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, on the main square, was begun in 1563 and inaugurated in 1711.<ref>[http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233446/http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 |date=6 May 2012 }}</ref> In 1786, the Spanish Crown created the [[Intendant|''Intendencia'']] of Comayagua, with Comayagua as its capital, which lasted until 1812. From 1812 to 1814 it was the capital of the Province of Comayagua when it again reverted to being the capital of the ''Intendencia'' of Comayagua until 1820.  In 1820, Honduras was again called the Province of Comayagua or Honduras, with Comayagua as its capital.  After independence from the Spanish it was the capital of the state of Honduras in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. After Honduras became an independent republic, the capital alternated between Comayagua and [[Tegucigalpa]] (Comayagua being preferred by Conservative administrations, and Tegucigalpa by Liberal ones) before being permanently established at Tegucigalpa in 1880. \n\nIn February 2012 [[Comayagua prison fire|a fire at Comayagua prison]] killed more than 350 people.\n\n==Places of note==\n[[File:Iglesia de la merced de Comayagua.jpg|left|thumb|Iglesia de la merced in 2018]][[File:PlazaCentralComayagua.jpg|left|thumb|218x218px|Comayagua's Central Plaza.]]Right in front of the plaza is located City Hall, which has been reconstructed a couple of times. The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish colonial architecture from the XVIII century, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, the archeological museum that contains relics of the [[Lenca]] people of the prehispanic era, and the republican museum. Another square in the old town is the Plaza de la Merced, it is known for having a monument known as the obelisk and in front of it is the Iglesia de la Merced. Which was the first cathedral of the city before the current one was completed in 1711. Another atraction is the Caxa real, a colonial house that was built between 1739 and 1741 and developed by the architect Bartolom\u00e9 de Maradiaga as a center where the tributes for the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish crown]] were stored, within it Gold, silver and plaster extracted from the mines of Honduras were processed, to later be shipped to Europe. On the ground floor of the building, introduce some elements that were not in common use in Central American architecture; It makes a very good difference between the purely official area, the Courtroom, the Accounting Office, the Treasury, the Azogues room, the piece of fifth silver; This sector was entered through a large hall called by the men on horseback and which were on the street that the Chiquito River rises to the Plaza Mayor.

Between the years of 1945 -1975 the population of the city quadrupled due to the high rate of population growth achieved at that time (4.8%) and to migratory movements in the interior of the country. In 2015 the estimated population was 152,051. It is the capital of the [[Comayagua department]] of [[Honduras]] and it is noted for its wealth of Spanish Colonial architecture.  The central square has a cathedral with the oldest clock in the Americas. {{citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Elcolegiotridentino.jpg|thumb|Colegio Tridentino de Comayagua|alt=|left|242x242px]]\nDuring the Pre-Columbian era the valley in which the city is located was populated by [[Lenca|Lenca people]]. During the colonization Comayagua was founded with the name ''Santa Mar\u00eda de la Nueva Valladolid'' by [[Conquistador]] [[Alonso de C\u00e1ceres]] under orders from [[Francisco de Montejo]], Governor of [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] on 8 December 1537. The complementary names \u00abValladolid\u00bb or \u00abPais de las Higueras\u00bb were those given to it by the Spaniards but it kept the primitive of the place that is purely indigenous. Some differ in their etymology but most agree that it is composed of \"Coma\" (which in Lenca dialect means paramo) and \"water\" being its true meaning \"p\u00e1ramo abundant with water\".  From 1540 on Comayagua was the capital of the Honduras Province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, on the main square, was begun in 1563 and inaugurated in 1711.<ref>[http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506233446/http://www.municomayagua.com/comayagua/index.php?id=278 |date=6 May 2012 }}</ref> In 1786, the Spanish Crown created the [[Intendant|''Intendencia'']] of Comayagua, with Comayagua as its capital, which lasted until 1812. From 1812 to 1814 it was the capital of the Province of Comayagua when it again reverted to being the capital of the ''Intendencia'' of Comayagua until 1820.  In 1820, Honduras was again called the Province of Comayagua or Honduras, with Comayagua as its capital.  After independence from the Spanish it was the capital of the state of Honduras in the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. After Honduras became an independent republic, the capital alternated between Comayagua and [[Tegucigalpa]] (Comayagua being preferred by Conservative administrations, and Tegucigalpa by Liberal ones) before being permanently established at Tegucigalpa in 1880. \n\nIn February 2012 [[Comayagua prison fire|a fire at Comayagua prison]] killed more than 350 people.\n\n[[File:PlazaCentralComayagua.jpg|left|thumb|229x229px|Comayagua's Central Plaza.]]\n\n==Places of note==\n[[File:Iglesia de la merced de Comayagua.jpg|left|thumb|Iglesia de la merced in 2018]]\nRight in front of the plaza is located City Hall, which has been reconstructed a couple of times. The building is of neoclassic style and was built during the 16th century. [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Comayagua|The Cathedral de la inmaculada concepcion of Comayagua]] was built during the colonial era in Honduras. It was inaugurated on 8 December 1711. In the cathedral there is also the oldest clock in America, built by the Arabs during their occupation in Spain around the year 1100. It was moved in the colonial period as a gift from King Carlos III. Another attraction is the Plaza de San Francisco, which has a park, the colonial church and is located a few meters from the main square. The houses of the city still preserve their original Spanish colonial architecture from the XVIII century, many of them have been turned into museums. The most important examples are the museum of colonial religious art, the archeological museum that contains relics of the [[Lenca]] people of the prehispanic era, and the republican museum. Another square in the old town is the Plaza de la Merced, it is known for having a monument known as the obelisk and in front of it is the Iglesia de la Merced.

{"title_page": "Socket wrench", "text_new": "{{redirect|Socket set|the software program|SOCET SET}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Image:Socket wrench and sockets.JPG|thumb|Socket set with ratchet]]\n\nA '''ratchet''' is a type of [[wrench]]<ref name=mw>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socket%20wrench Socket wrench: A wrench usually in the form of a bar and removable socket made to fit a bolt or nut  Merriam-Webster]</ref> (spanner in British English) that inserts into a ''socket'' to turn a fastener, typically in the form of a nut or bolt.<ref name=oxford>[https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/socket_wrench \u201cSocket wrench: A ratchet tool with a series of detachable sockets for tightening and loosening nuts of different sizes.\u201c Oxford Dictionaries]</ref>\n\nA ratchet incorporates a reversible [[ratchet (device)|ratcheting mechanism]] which allows the user to pivot the tool back and forth to turn its socket instead of removing and repositioning a wrench to do so. \n\nOther common methods of driving sockets include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).\n\nThe basic contemporary form of socket Is hexagonal, referred to as \"6-point\" for the pointed intersections where its six solid sided facets meet. These are  attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the ''square drive''). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|8}}, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|3|4}}, 1, {{frac|1|1|2}}, {{frac|2|1|2}} and {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch square drive sizes (a ''[[de facto]]'' international standard with no metric equivalents{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide references for this statement|date=November 2016}}) along with some lesser used drivers such as {{frac|5|8}}-inch square drive, and both No. 4 and No. 5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides for a wide variety of socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with O-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets. The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the [[mechanical advantage]] needed by the user to provide the [[torque]] needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600&nbsp;ft-lbs of torque will generally involve  some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.\n\nMale drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called ''Allen drivers'' (trademark) or the generic term ''male bit drivers''.\n\nThe principal advantage of interchangeable sockets is that, instead of a separate wrench for each of the many different fastener sizes and types, only separate sockets are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all [[list of screw drives|screw and bolt types]] now have sockets of different types made to fit their bolts or nuts. Sockets often come as a \"socket set\" with many different sizes or types of sockets to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the \"set size\" is often included with the socket set. Sockets are commonly available in [[inch|fractional inch]] and [[International System of Units|metric]] sizes, and in short (shallow) and longer (deep) varieties.\n\n==History==\nWrenches in the form of [[wikt:socket|sockets]]\u2014that is, a female driver to envelop the male head of a fastener\u2014have existed for centuries. Early examples include the keys used to wind clocks since the Middle Ages. The heads and sockets were typically square; hex heads eventually became more common starting in the 20th century. The [[ratchet (device)|ratcheting]] socket wrench, with interchangeable ([[indexing (motion)|indexable]]) sockets, was invented by an American, J.J. Richardson, of [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]], Vermont. The tool was patented (Pat. No. 38,914) through the [[Scientific American]] Patent Agency on June 16, 1863.<ref>{{US patent|38914}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.datamp.org/displayPatent.php?id=13721 |title=U.S. Ratchet patent 38914, 1863 |access-date=2008-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012103609/http://www.datamp.org/displayPatent.php?id=13721 |archive-date=2008-10-12 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> The first illustration of the tool appears on p. 248 of the April 16, 1864 issue of ''Scientific American''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Improved Wrench |magazine= Scientific American |volume= 10 |issue= 16 |page=248 |publisher= Munn & Co. |location= New York |date= April 16, 1864 |url= http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABF2204-1010-18&coll=moa&root=%2Fmoa%2Fscia%2Fscia1010%2F&tif=00252.TIF&view=50  |doi= |id= |accessdate= 2008-07-01 }}</ref> In current English usage, the term \"socket wrench\" describes the wrench, not the socket.<ref name=mw/> <ref name=oxford/>\n\nSquare heads and sockets were the easiest to make in the era when [[file (tool)|hand filing]] was the typical method of manufacture. With the proliferation of modern manufacturing methods it became just as easy to make hex heads and sockets as square ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the ratchet [[pawl]] to catch the next tooth.\n\n==Related tools==\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\n===Fixed socket===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Image !! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Name !!

Description\n|-\n| [[Image:Knarre.jpg|150px]]\n| ratcheting socket wrench\n| The most common type of socket wrench. The [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]]ing mechanism allows the nut to be tightened or loosened with a reciprocating motion, without requiring that the wrench be removed and refitted after each turn. Typically, a small lever on the ratchet head switches the wrench between tightening and loosening mode. These drive fittings come in four common sizes: {{frac|1|4}} [[inch]], {{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch, {{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;inch, and {{frac|3|4}}&nbsp;inch (referred to as \"drives\", as in \"{{frac|3|8}} drive\"). Despite being denominated in inches, these are [[trade names]] ([[common product name]]), and manufacturers construct them to 6.3&nbsp;mm, 9.5&nbsp;mm, 12.5&nbsp;mm and 19&nbsp;mm,  having been rounded to a reasonable, if haphazard, metric value.  Larger drive sizes such as 1&nbsp;inch and above are usually only encountered on [[fastener]]s of larger industrial equipment, such as [[semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailers]] (articulated lorries), large cargo aircraft and passenger [[airliner]]s, and marine work ([[ship transport|merchant fleets]], [[navy|navies]], [[shipyard]]s). The sockets themselves come in a full range of inch and metric sizes. (\"[[SAE International|SAE]]\" is often used as a blanket term for the nonmetric sizes, despite the technical inaccuracy of that usage.)\n\nThe advantages of the system of a ratchet wrench with indexable sockets are speed of wrenching (it is much faster than a conventional wrench, especially in repetitive bolt-on or bolt-off usage) and efficiency of tooling cost and portability (it is much more efficient than a set of non-ratcheting wrenches, with every size head having its own handle).\n\nFine-tooth ratchets have finer teeth on the ratcheting components; these can be useful for tighter locations.

A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches which are used for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels.  Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon.  Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts.  [[Hydraulic motor]] ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry.  The sockets used for impact duty (called \"impact sockets\") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness so as not to shatter under the impacts of the impact tool.  They are typically finished in [[black oxide]] rather than the usual [[chrome plating]] of the hand-tool variety.  Standard sockets (i.e. non-impact sockets) may shatter if used with impact wrenches, presenting a safety risk.\n\n==Socket types==\nThere are two main types of sockets: impact and hand.{{cn|What does the term \u201chand\u201d mean?|date=November 2019}} Sockets are \nreferred by their number of \u201cpoints\u201d for the pointed intersections of their multi-faceted interior sides. Common designs include :\n*6 point, hexagon, for hexagonal fasteners.\n**Variants include designs with curved (splined) faces for off nut corner contact, to reduce chance of stripping\n*12 point (24 facets) for use with hexagonal or 12 point fasteners.\n{{gallery\n|File:FemaleTorxSocket.JPG\n|Torx socket\n|File:Kluc gola.jpg\n|\"6 point\" hexagonal socket\n|File:10 Spline Round.jpg\n|Splined socket\n}}\n\nLess frequently used shapes include the square 4-point, triple square 12-point (not to be confused with 12-point double hexagon), octagonal 8-point (not to be confused with the more common 8-point double square shape). These less common shapes are typically found in special applications or particular industries such as aircraft, PVC plumbing fittings or German and UK made automobiles. With rail cars, valve adjustment screws and pipe plugs, the 4-point square shaped driver can still be found in wide use both male and female configurations. Nuts and bolt heads are also produced in 12-point double hexagon shapes and various types of splines, more common to aircraft and aerospace applications. \n\nWhen working with common 6-point hexagonal fasteners, the 12-point shaped socket offers double the number of starting points or possible positions by which to put the socket on the nut, and so allows alignment every 30 degrees, rather than every 60 degrees of angle. Most manufacturers of sockets for larger hexagonal bolts produce them in 6-point (hexagonal) and limited sizes of 12-point (double-hexagonal) configurations.\n\nSome specialized sockets are made with a specialized \"6 flute\" etc. socket that attaches to damaged bolts of both metric and fractional inch sizes for removal. Some specialized sockets are made to fit specific specialized applications and are designed and sized for that specific application. Spark plug sockets, oxygen sensor sockets, ball joint sockets, axle nut sockets, etc. fit in this category.\n\n===Impact sockets and drivers===\nSockets for use with an [[impact wrench]] or [[impact driver]] are expected to receive higher torques, which is also [[percussive]], and so need to be made of [[toughness|tougher]] materials. They are made from a thicker, tougher and more ductile alloy steel, often using CrMo steel to replace the CrV steel used in non-impact sockets. Most impact sockets made for \"standard\" hexagonal fasteners have a six-point design.\n\nChrome plated sockets are not suitable as the impact wrench may break the chrome plating, which can form razor sharp flakes - consequently impact sockets use different coatings - often a black [[phosphate conversion coating]], or [[black oxide]].\n\n===Standard-length and deep-length sockets===\n[[Image:2008-03-31 Deep metric sockets on rail.jpg|thumb|A set of deep sockets on a rail.]]\nSockets are available in various depths or lengths, often divided by most manufacturers into two categories of \"standard\" and \"deep\" according to the ANSI or DIN standard they are made to and the tolerances allowed by those specifications for each length of socket.  Because the standards allow for some flexibility in tolerances, it is common to see two manufacturers make deep sockets of the same size but with slightly different depths even though both meet the same specification.  Standard length, otherwise known as \"shallow\" sockets, have a lower profile and allow a user to access nuts in narrow spaces.  Deep sockets are useful for turning nuts onto bolts when the bolt extends upwards into the socket (as in the case of many [[bolted joint]]s), a very typical example being exhaust clamp bolts on a car.  Low-profile sockets, shorter even than standard sockets, are available for some applications, typically oil filter removal on engines with limited access.\n\nAlthough most manufacturers offer only those sizes and depths described within the common ANSI or DIN specifications, some exceptions do exist. Specialty manufacturers such as IMPERIAL-Newton Corp offer an expanded range of \"extra deep\" sockets for special industrial applications; and popular brands like [[Snap-on]] or [[Mac Tools]] offer what are called \"semi-deep\" or \"mid-length\" sockets, which provide much of a deep socket's depth, while fitting in tighter locations.\n\n===Pass-through sockets and ratchets===\nSome sockets are designed to have the same outside diameter and shape within a given set size. Each pass-through socket, within a given socket set, is designed to be used with a \"special\" ratchet that fits on the outside of the socket and not to the middle of the socket. By fitting the outside of the socket they allow the bolt or stud to extend through the socket, eliminating the need for a deep socket in some applications.  By attaching to the outside of the socket they also allow the socket to be built up to 50% shorter and with 20% less width which is an advantage in some situations.  Pass-through sockets and ratchets are built for {{frac|1|4}}-inch, {{frac|3|8}}-inch and {{frac|1|2}}-inch sets in both SAE and metric sizes. By using a fine tooth ratchet and socket system that allow a pass-through ratchet to be used as a conventional ratchet handle with interchangeable {{frac|1|4}}-inch and {{frac|3|8}}-inch drives some ratchets can be used with standard sockets.  They are built by a number of manufacturers with a variety of trade names.  Craftsman Tools call theirs ''Max Axess'', and also sells GearWrench's ''Pass-Thru'' brands.  Lowes calls their socket system ''Xtreme Access'', etc.. Ratcheting box end wrenches can often be employed in the same application, but will nearly always be significantly  wider.\n\n===Drivers===\nMale bit drivers are sometimes incorrectly referred to as \"sockets\", but are in fact the opposite of a socket - a socket is a female recess or opening which receives another object. Common male bit drivers of this type include [[Allen (brand)|Allen]] hex wrenches (in both metric and fractional inch sizes), [[Torx]] (T-3 through T-50) spline wrenches, 4-point (square), and 12-point (triple square) male bit drivers. Other specialized screw heads that are often installed or removed with screwdriver type handles and appropriate type tip have socket varieties that fit the various [[List of screw drives|screw head types]] and a can be attached to a socket wrench. Conversely, for low torque situations, a \"socket spinner\" screwdriver handle with a socket wrench type fitting on one end can be attached to many different types of sockets, bit drivers and extensions.\n\n== Accessories ==\n\nThese are some of the common accessories that are used with {{frac|1|4}}-inch, {{frac|3|8}}-inch, {{frac|1|2}}-inch (and so on) socket wrenches:\n\n*''Extensions'', sometimes called \"extender arms\", attach to a socket on one end and a ratchet on the other end of the extension. These \"extend\" the length of the socket and allow access to nuts or bolts that are difficult to reach. Extensions are typically {{convert|1/2|to|20|in|round=5}} in length in roughly {{convert|1|to|3|in|adj=on|round=5}} increments. They are sometimes attached together to get a needed length extension, and often have a knurled section for added grip.\n*''Wobble'' extensions have their socket attachment ends ground to allow the socket-extension interface to bend up to about 15 degrees. This additional flexibility often makes using a socket plus extension  in a cramped location easier. A {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} wobble extension added to the end of any extension will convert it to a slightly longer \"wobble\" extension.\n*''Extension Grip Collars'' are collars with indents that fit on the back of most extensions preventing it from easily rolling away and allow one to easily grip extension and finger tighten or loosen nuts and bolts by turning extension + socket with or without ratchet. \n*''Ratchet spinners'' are short (about {{convert|1+1/2|in}}) extensions that have a knurled attachments on them for easy hand tightening or loosening without the ratchet handle.\n*''Size adapters'' allow sockets of one drive size to be used with ratchets of another drive size.  They consist of a male drive fitting of one size attached to a female drive fitting of another size. They are typically about {{convert|1|in}} long. For example, a {{frac|1|4}}-inch to {{frac|3|8}}-inch adapter allows sockets with {{frac|1|4}}-inch drive holes to attach to a {{frac|3|8}}-inch ratchet, and so on.\n*''[[Universal joint]]s'' are two articulated socket joints (about {{convert|1|in}} long) combined at a right angle, that allow a bend in the turning axis of the wrench and socket.  They are used with extensions and ratchets for turning a bolt or nut at a difficult to access location. Wobble extensions may be substituted for some universal joint applications and have the advantage of not wobbling so much.\n*''Crow's foot adapters'', sometimes called crowfoot adapters, feature an open end similar to a spanner along with a square hole for a ratchet or breaker bar.  They are used to reach otherwise inaccessible fastenings or to hold a tensioning nut at a specific torque whilst allowing access to a locking nut that would be inaccessible with a standard socket.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Torque wrench]]\n* [[Hydraulic torque wrench]]\n* [[Impact wrench]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n[Category:Wrenches]]\nwww.pornhub.com\n[[fr:Cl\u00e9 (outil)#Cl\u00e9 \u00e0 cliquet]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Socket set|the software program|SOCET SET}}\n{{refimprove|date=November 2011}}\n\n[[Image:Socket wrench and sockets.JPG|thumb|Socket set with ratchet]]\n\nA '''ratchet''' is a type of [[wrench]]<ref name=mw>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/socket%20wrench Socket wrench: A wrench usually in the form of a bar and removable socket made to fit a bolt or nut  Merriam-Webster]</ref> (spanner in British English) that inserts into a ''socket'' to turn a fastener, typically in the form of a nut or bolt.<ref name=oxford>[https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/socket_wrench \u201cSocket wrench: A ratchet tool with a series of detachable sockets for tightening and loosening nuts of different sizes.\u201c Oxford Dictionaries]</ref>\n\nA ratchet incorporates a reversible [[ratchet (device)|ratcheting mechanism]] which allows the user to pivot the tool back and forth to turn its socket instead of removing and repositioning a wrench to do so. \n\nOther common methods of driving sockets include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).\n\nThe basic contemporary form of socket Is hexagonal, referred to as \"6-point\" for the pointed intersections where its six solid sided facets meet. These are  attached to the driving tool via a male/female square connection fitting (called the ''square drive''). Standard sizes of square drives around the world include {{frac|1|4}}, {{frac|3|8}}, {{frac|1|2}}, {{frac|3|4}}, 1, {{frac|1|1|2}}, {{frac|2|1|2}} and {{frac|3|1|2}}-inch square drive sizes (a ''[[de facto]]'' international standard with no metric equivalents{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide references for this statement|date=November 2016}}) along with some lesser used drivers such as {{frac|5|8}}-inch square drive, and both No. 4 and No. 5 spline drives specified in ANSI B107 specifications. This wide range of square drive sizes provides for a wide variety of socket types and sizes to suit small to very large nuts and bolts. Some square drivers have a through hole to attach the socket to the driver (using a retaining ring with O-ring and pin type, or single piece molded retaining rings), a locking pin, or friction ball. Some common hand ratchets employ a quick release button on their top for quick socket release of smaller sockets. The tool chosen to drive the socket wrench ultimately supplies the [[mechanical advantage]] needed by the user to provide the [[torque]] needed to loosen or tighten the fastener as may be required. Larger drivers are typically used with higher torque, while smaller drivers are used for convenience in smaller low torque applications. Given the limits of human strength and fatigue, torque above 600&nbsp;ft-lbs of torque will generally involve  some kind of power assist, instead of the user simply pushing on the handle of a wrench. Very large sockets and drivers are typically powered by hydraulics to achieve torque.\n\nMale drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called ''Allen drivers'' (trademark) or the generic term ''male bit drivers''.\n\nThe principal advantage of interchangeable sockets is that, instead of a separate wrench for each of the many different fastener sizes and types, only separate sockets are needed for each size and type. Because of their versatility, nearly all [[list of screw drives|screw and bolt types]] now have sockets of different types made to fit their bolts or nuts. Sockets often come as a \"socket set\" with many different sizes or types of sockets to fit the heads of different-sized fasteners. A ratchet of the \"set size\" is often included with the socket set. Sockets are commonly available in [[inch|fractional inch]] and [[International System of Units|metric]] sizes, and in short (shallow) and longer (deep) varieties.\n\n==History==\nWrenches in the form of [[wikt:socket|sockets]]\u2014that is, a female driver to envelop the male head of a fastener\u2014have existed for centuries. Early examples include the keys used to wind clocks since the Middle Ages. The heads and sockets were typically square; hex heads eventually became more common starting in the 20th century. The [[ratchet (device)|ratcheting]] socket wrench, with interchangeable ([[indexing (motion)|indexable]]) sockets, was invented by an American, J.J. Richardson, of [[Woodstock, Vermont|Woodstock]], Vermont. The tool was patented (Pat. No. 38,914) through the [[Scientific American]] Patent Agency on June 16, 1863.<ref>{{US patent|38914}}</ref><ref>\n{{Cite web |url=http://www.datamp.org/displayPatent.php?id=13721 |title=U.S. Ratchet patent 38914, 1863 |access-date=2008-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012103609/http://www.datamp.org/displayPatent.php?id=13721 |archive-date=2008-10-12 |url-status=live }}\n</ref> The first illustration of the tool appears on p. 248 of the April 16, 1864 issue of ''Scientific American''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Improved Wrench |magazine= Scientific American |volume= 10 |issue= 16 |page=248 |publisher= Munn & Co. |location= New York |date= April 16, 1864 |url= http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/moa/pageviewer?frames=1&cite=http%3A%2F%2Fcdl.library.cornell.edu%2Fcgi-bin%2Fmoa%2Fmoa-cgi%3Fnotisid%3DABF2204-1010-18&coll=moa&root=%2Fmoa%2Fscia%2Fscia1010%2F&tif=00252.TIF&view=50  |doi= |id= |accessdate= 2008-07-01 }}</ref> In current English usage, the term \"socket wrench\" describes the wrench, not the socket.<ref name=mw/> <ref name=oxford/>\n\nSquare heads and sockets were the easiest to make in the era when [[file (tool)|hand filing]] was the typical method of manufacture. With the proliferation of modern manufacturing methods it became just as easy to make hex heads and sockets as square ones. The hex form allows easier wrenching in confined surroundings (where nearby obstacles obstruct the swing of the wrench), because fewer degrees of arc are needed on each swing before it is possible to reposition the wrench onto the next set of flats. Ratchet wrenches further reduce this problem, as the wrench need only swing as many degrees as it takes for the ratchet [[pawl]] to catch the next tooth.\n\n==Related tools==\n{{Dynamic list}}\n\n===Fixed socket===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Image !! style=\"width: 150px;\" | Name !!

Description\n|-\n| [[Image:Knarre.jpg|150px]]\n| ratcheting socket wrench\n| The most common type of socket wrench. The [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]]ing mechanism allows the nut to be tightened or loosened with a reciprocating motion, without requiring that the wrench be removed and refitted after each turn. Typically, a small lever on the ratchet head switches the wrench between tightening and loosening mode. These drive fittings come in four common sizes: {{frac|1|4}} [[inch]], {{frac|3|8}}&nbsp;inch, {{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;inch, and {{frac|3|4}}&nbsp;inch (referred to as \"drives\", as in \"{{frac|3|8}} drive\"). Despite being denominated in inches, these are [[trade names]] ([[common product name]]), and manufacturers construct them to 6.3&nbsp;mm, 9.5&nbsp;mm, 12.5&nbsp;mm and 19&nbsp;mm,  having been rounded to a reasonable, if haphazard, metric value.  Larger drive sizes such as 1&nbsp;inch and above are usually only encountered on [[fastener]]s of larger industrial equipment, such as [[semi-trailer truck|tractor-trailers]] (articulated lorries), large cargo aircraft and passenger [[airliner]]s, and marine work ([[ship transport|merchant fleets]], [[navy|navies]], [[shipyard]]s). The sockets themselves come in a full range of inch and metric sizes. (\"[[SAE International|SAE]]\" is often used as a blanket term for the nonmetric sizes, despite the technical inaccuracy of that usage.)\n\nThe advantages of the system of a ratchet wrench with indexable sockets are speed of wrenching (it is much faster than a conventional wrench, especially in repetitive bolt-on or bolt-off usage) and efficiency of tooling cost and portability (it is much more efficient than a set of non-ratcheting wrenches, with every size head having its own handle).\n\nFine-tooth ratchets have finer teeth on the ratcheting components; these can be useful for tighter locations.

A second major variety of compressed air powered tools are impact wrenches which are used for common tasks such as lug nuts on wheels.  Electric powered impact wrenches for the same tasks are not uncommon.  Small cordless 12 volt and 18 volt impact drivers are often used today as powered ratchets to remove and install nuts and bolts.  [[Hydraulic motor]] ratchets with their characteristic higher torque are rare outside heavy industry.  The sockets used for impact duty (called \"impact sockets\") are made with thicker walls and tempered to a lower hardness so as not to shatter under the impacts of the impact tool.  They are typically finished in [[black oxide]] rather than the usual [[chrome plating]] of the hand-tool variety.

A {{convert|1|to|1+1/2|in|mm|adj=mid|-long}} wobble extension added to the end of any extension will convert it to a slightly longer \"wobble\" extension.\n*''Extension Grip Collars'' are collars with indents that fit on the back of most extensions preventing it from easily rolling away and allow one to easily grip extension and finger tighten or loosen nuts and bolts by turning extension + socket with or without ratchet. \n*''Ratchet spinners'' are short (about {{convert|1+1/2|in}}) extensions that have a knurled attachments on them for easy hand tightening or loosening without the ratchet handle.\n*''Size adapters'' allow sockets of one drive size to be used with ratchets of another drive size.  They consist of a male drive fitting of one size attached to a female drive fitting of another size. They are typically about {{convert|1|in}} long. For example, a {{frac|1|4}}-inch to {{frac|3|8}}-inch adapter allows sockets with {{frac|1|4}}-inch drive holes to attach to a {{frac|3|8}}-inch ratchet, and so on.\n*''[[Universal joint]]s'' are two articulated socket joints (about {{convert|1|in}} long) combined at a right angle, that allow a bend in the turning axis of the wrench and socket.  They are used with extensions and ratchets for turning a bolt or nut at a difficult to access location. Wobble extensions may be substituted for some universal joint applications and have the advantage of not wobbling so much.\n*''Crow's foot adapters'', sometimes called crowfoot adapters, feature an open end similar to a spanner along with a square hole for a ratchet or breaker bar.  They are used to reach otherwise inaccessible fastenings or to hold a tensioning nut at a specific torque whilst allowing access to a locking nut that would be inaccessible with a standard socket.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Torque wrench]]\n* [[Hydraulic torque wrench]]\n* [[Impact wrench]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.sizes.com/tools/socket_wrenches.htm Table of American socket and nut sizes in inches]\n*[https://www.garagetooladvisor.com/hand-tools/socket-sizes-order-smallest-largest/ SAE to Metric socket conversion chart]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_GUDMVWVss Ratchet manufacturing video]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtcYB-mW6i0 Socket manufacturing video]\n*[https://www.asme.org/products/codes-standards/b107110-2012-socket-wrenches-handles-attachments/ ASME B107 \u2013 specification for Socket Wrenches, Handles, and Attachments]\n[[Category:Wrenches]]\n\n[[fr:Cl\u00e9 (outil)#Cl\u00e9 \u00e0 cliquet]]\n", "name_user": "73.92.140.53", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socket_wrench"}
