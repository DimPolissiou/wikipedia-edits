On a strategic level, social media marketing includes the management of a marketing campaign, [[governance]], setting the scope (e.g. more active or passive use) and the establishment of a firm's desired social media \"culture\" and \"tone.\"\n\nWhen using social media marketing, firms can allow customers and Internet users to post [[user-generated content]] (e.g., online comments, product reviews, etc.), also known as \"[[earned media]],\" rather than use marketer-prepared [[advertising]] copy.\n\n==Platforms==\n{{main|Social media}}\n\n===Social networking websites===\n[[Social networking websites]] allow individuals, businesses and other organizations to interact with one another and build relationships and communities online.

Social media marketing then connects these consumers and audiences to businesses that share the same needs, wants, and values. Through social networking sites, companies can keep in touch with individual followers. This personal interaction can instill a feeling of [[loyalty]] into followers and potential customers. Also, by choosing whom to follow on these sites, products can reach a very narrow target audience.<ref name=\"Assaad\"/> Social networking sites also include much information about what products and services prospective clients might be interested in. Through the use of new [[Semantics|semantic]] analysis technologies, marketers can detect buying signals, such as content shared by people and questions posted online.

Over the years, the Internet has continually gained more and more users, jumping from 738 million in 2000 all the way to 3.2 billion in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/3896219/internet-users-worldwide/|title=Here's How Many Internet Users There Are|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> Roughly 81% of the current population in the United States has some type of social media profile that they engage with frequently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/273476/percentage-of-us-population-with-a-social-network-profile/|title=U.S. population with a social media profile 2017 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because of their web browsing capabilities which allow individuals immediate access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have altered the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ryu|first1=Jay Sung|title=Mobile Marketing Communications in the Retail Environment: A comparison of QR code users and non users|journal=International Journal of Mobile Marketing|date=2013}}</ref> They have also allowed companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, and any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, [[Real-time bidding]] use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising due to its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-real-time-bidding-ad-ecosystem-2013-5|title=INFOGRAPHIC: Inside The Mobile Real-Time Bidding Ad Ecosystem|accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nMobile devices have become increasingly popular, where 5.7 billion people are using them worldwide <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/|title=Number of mobile phone users worldwide 2013-2019 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>. This has played a role in the way consumers interact with media and has many further implications for TV ratings, advertising, [[mobile commerce]], and more. Mobile [[media consumption]] such as mobile audio streaming or mobile video are on the rise \u2013 In the United States, more than 100 million users are projected to access online video content via mobile device. Mobile video revenue consists of [[pay-per-view]] downloads, advertising and subscriptions. As of 2013, worldwide mobile phone Internet user penetration was 73.4%. In 2017, figures suggest that more than 90% of Internet users will access online content through their phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/|title=Mobile Internet|work=www.statista.com|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Strategies==\nThere are two basic strategies for using social media as a marketing tool:\n\n===Passive approach===\nSocial media can be a useful source of market information and a way to hear customer perspectives. Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes;<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\">{{cite book|author1=Constantinides E. |author2=Lorenzo C. |author3=G\u00f3mez M.A. |year= 2008|title= Social Media: A New Frontier for Retailers?|journal= European Retail Research|volume= 22|issue= 1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.1007/978-3-8349-8099-1_1|isbn=978-3-8349-8099-1|url=https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/social-media-a-new-frontier-for-retailers(2042de4c-cf4d-4f0f-a9d6-43ae725bf513).html }}</ref> in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of [[market intelligence]] which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 \"bend test\" which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure. The so-called \"bend gate\" controversy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844943/apple-says-iphone-bending-extremely-rare|title=Apple says iPhone 6 Plus bending through normal use is 'extremely rare'|author=Welch, Chris|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=12 September 2015|date=2014-09-25}}</ref> created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or \"[[Real-time computing|real time]]\" information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.\n\n===Active approach===\nSocial media can be used not only as [[public relations]] and [[direct marketing]] tools, but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities as effective [[customer engagement]] tools.<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/>  This tactic is widely known as [[influencer marketing]]. Influencer marketing allows brands the opportunity to reach their target audience in a more genuine, authentic way via a special group of selected [[Internet celebrity|influencers]] advertising their product or service. In fact, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022, per [[Business Insider Intelligence]] estimates, based on Mediakix data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report|title=Influencer Marketing: State of the social media influencer market in 2020|last=Schomer|first=Audrey|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nTechnologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper is likely to be read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target [[niche market]]s even more precisely. Using digital tools such as [[Google Adsense]], advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in [[social entrepreneurship]], [[political activism]] associated with a particular political party, or [[video gaming]]. Google Adsense does this by looking for [[Index term|keywords]] in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with \"special issue\" sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).\n\nSocial networks are, in many cases, viewed as a great tool for avoiding costly market research. They are known for providing a short, fast, and direct way to reach an audience through a person who is widely known. For example, an [[athlete]] who gets endorsed by a sporting goods company also brings their support base of millions of people who are interested in what they do or how they play and now they want to be a part of this athlete through their endorsements with that particular company. At one point consumers would visit stores to view their products with famous athletes, but now you can view a famous athlete's, such as [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], latest apparel online with the click of a button. He advertises them to you directly through his [[Twitter|Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts]].\n\n[[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] are leading social media platforms where users can [[Hypertargeting|hyper-target]] their ads. Hypertargeting not only uses public profile information but also information users submit but hide from others.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Facebook Era: Tapping Online Social Networks to Market, Sell, and Innovate|last = Shih|first = Clara|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-13-708512-5|location = Boston|pages = 111}}</ref> There are several examples of firms initiating some form of online dialog with the public to foster relations with customers. According to Constantinides, Lorenzo and G\u00f3mez Borja (2008) \"Business executives like Jonathan Swartz, President and CEO of Sun Microsystems, Steve Jobs CEO of Apple Computers, and McDonald's Vice President Bob Langert post regularly in their CEO blogs, encouraging customers to interact and freely express their feelings, ideas, suggestions, or remarks about their postings, the company or its products\".<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/> Using customer influencers (for example popular bloggers) can be a very efficient and cost-effective method to launch new products or services<ref>Gillin, P.

An example of these are [[consumer advocacy group]]s and groups that criticize companies (e.g., [[lobby group]]s or [[advocacy organization]]s). [[Social media]] use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services, business practices, or a government's actions. Each participating customer, non-customer, or citizen who is participating online via social media becomes a part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort) as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers, potential consumers or citizens to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evans, Dave |title=Social Media Marketing: The Next Generation of Business Engagement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7l2OR6giC6AC&pg=PT15|accessdate=28 July 2013|date=16 September 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-94421-9|pages=15\u2013}}</ref> With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services. This can eventually be translated into buying behavior, or voting and donating behavior in a political context. New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Social Media Marketing|last=Evans|first=Dave|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Sybex|isbn=9781118194492}}</ref>\n\nEngagement in social media for the purpose of a social media strategy is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content. This can be seen through [[digital photo]]s, [[digital video]]s, text, and conversations. It is also represented through sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging.<ref>Schaffer, Neal.

Traditional media such as physical newspapers, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor. Though, this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open; Participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer or citizen.\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===Local businesses===\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites as a promotional technique. Businesses can follow individuals social networking site uses in the local area and advertise specials and deals. These can be exclusive and in the form of \"get a free drink with a copy of this tweet\". This type of message encourages other locals to follow the business on the sites in order to obtain the promotional deal. In the process, the business is getting seen and promoting itself (brand visibility).\n\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites to develop their own market research on new products and services.  By encouraging their customers to give feedback on new product ideas, businesses can gain valuable insights on whether a product may be accepted by their target market enough to merit full production, or not. In addition, customers will feel the company has engaged them in the process of co-creation\u2014the process in which the business uses customer feedback to create or modify a product or service the filling a need of the target market.  Such feedback can present in various forms, such as surveys, contests, polls, etc.\n\nSocial networking sites such as LinkedIn, also provide an opportunity for small businesses to find candidates to fill staff positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/survey-96-of-recruiters-use-social-media-to-find-high-quality-candidates/627040|title=Survey: 92% of Recruiters Use Social Media to Find High-Quality Candidates|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nOf course, review sites, such as Yelp, also help small businesses to build their reputation beyond just brand visibility.

This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goor|first1=Marion aan 't|title=Instagram: A Content Analysis into Marketing on Instagram.

Many big names have already jumped on board: [[Starbucks]], [[MTV]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Marc Jacobs]], and [[Red Bull]] are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with ''Harper's Bazaar'' to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose \"outfit of the day\" photos on [[Snapchat]] get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture.

The company can present a more personal picture of their brand, and by doing so the company conveys a better and true picture of itself. The idea of Instagram pictures lies on on-the-go, a sense that the event is happening right now, and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company. In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed. \"It's not an editorial photo,\" he explained, \"We're not trying to be a magazine. We're trying to create a moment.\"<ref name=\"Harper's Bazaar\"/> Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect a true picture of the brand from the perspective of the customers, for instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bj\u00f6rkgren|first1=Caroline|title=Guide: Kommunicera r\u00e4tt med Instagram (Communicate Right on Instagram)|url=http://internetworld.idg.se/2.1006/1.455713|website=Internet World|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> Other than the filters and hashtags functions, the Instagram's 15-second videos and the recently added ability to send private messages between users have opened new opportunities for brands to connect with customers in a new extent, further promoting effective marketing on Instagram.\n\n=== Snapchat ===\nSnapchat is a popular messaging and picture exchanging application that was created in 2011 by three students at Stanford University named Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. The application was first developed to allow users to message back and forth and to also send photographs that are only available from 1\u201310 seconds until they are no longer available.

The type of language used in the commercials and the ideas used to promote the product reflect the audience's style and taste. Also, the ads on this platform are usually in sync with the content of the video requested, this is another advantage YouTube brings for advertisers. Certain ads are presented with certain videos since the content is relevant. Promotional opportunities such as sponsoring a video is also possible on YouTube, \"for example, a user who searches for a YouTube video on dog training may be presented with a sponsored video from a dog toy company in results along with other videos.\"<ref name=\"kincy\">{{cite journal|last=Kincy|first=Jason|title=Advertising and social media|journal=ABA Bank Marketing|year=2011|volume=43|issue=7|page=40}}</ref> YouTube also enable publishers to earn money through its [[YouTube Partner Program]].

Businesses and marketers have noticed that, \"a persons behaviour is influenced by many small groups\" (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). These small groups rotate around social networking accounts that are run by influential people (opinion leaders or \"thought leaders\") who have followers of groups. The types of groups (followers) are called:<ref>Kotler, P., Burton, S., Deans, K., Brown, L., & Armstrong, G. (2013). marketing (9th ed.). NSW, Australia: Pearson Australia</ref> reference groups (people who know each other either face-to-face or have an indirect influence on a persons attitude or behaviour); membership groups (a person has a direct influence on a person's attitude or behaviour); and aspirational groups (groups which an individual wishes to belong to).\n\n=== Influencer Marketing ===\n[[Influencer marketing|Marketers target influential people]], referred to as [[Internet celebrity|influencers]], on social media who are recognized as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify the impact of their message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or \"liking\" of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that \"consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals\" who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.&nbsp;216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sepp | first1 = M. | last2 = Liljander | first2 = V. | last3 = Gummerus | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Private bloggers' motivations to produce content \u2013 a gratifications theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Management | volume = 27 | issue = 13/14| pages = 1479\u20131503 | doi = 10.1080/0267257X.2011.624532 }}</ref><ref>Fill, C., Hughes, G., & De Francesco, S.

Brand must seek to create their brand image on each platform, and cater to the type of consumer demographics on each respective platform. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled all aspects of the ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heath | first1 = R. | last2 = Brandt | first2 = D. | last3 = Narin | first3 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Brand relationships: Strengthened by emotion, weakened by attention | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising Research | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 410\u2013419 | doi=10.2501/s002184990606048x}}</ref>\n\nPlanned content begins with the creative/marketing team generating their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they send them off for approval. There is two general ways of doing so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ depending on the size and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) to sign off or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\">Brito, M. (2013). How content governance will facilitate media company transformation. InYour brand (pp. 3-7). Retrieved from http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2143149&seqNum=3</ref> Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department.\n\nUnplanned content is an 'in the moment' idea, \"a spontaneous, tactical reaction.\" (Cramer, 2014, p.&nbsp;6). The content could be trending and not have the time to take the planned content route. The unplanned content is posted sporadically and is not calendar/date/time arranged (Deshpande, 2014).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cramer | first1 = T | year = 2014 | title = The rise of content marketing | url = | journal = EContent | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 6\u201310 }}</ref><ref>Deshpande, P. (2014, August 24). The content marketing pyramid: Create more with less. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://contentmarketinginstitute.com</ref> Issues with unplanned content revolve around legal issues and whether the message being sent out represents the business/brand accordingly. If a company sends out a Tweet or Facebook message too hurriedly, the company may unintentionally use insensitive language or messaging that could alienate some consumers. For example, celebrity chef [[Paula Deen]] was criticized after she made a social media post commenting about [[HIV-AIDS]] and [[South Africa]]; her message was deemed to be offensive by many observers. The main difference between planned and unplanned is the time to approve the content. Unplanned content must still be approved by marketing managers, but in a much more rapid manner e.g. 1\u20132 hours or less. Sectors may miss errors because of being hurried. When using unplanned content Brito (2013) says, \"be prepared to be reactive and respond to issues when they arise.\"<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/> Brito (2013) writes about having a, \"crisis escalation plan\", because, \"It will happen\". The plan involves breaking down the issue into topics and classifying the issue into groups. Colour coding the potential risk \"identify and flag potential risks\" also helps to organise an issue. The problem can then be handled by the correct team and dissolved more effectively rather than any person at hand trying to solve the situation.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/>\n\n==Implications on traditional advertising==\n\n===Minimizing use===\nTraditional advertising techniques include print and [[television]] advertising. The [[Internet]] has already overtaken television as the largest advertising market.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/30/internet-biggest-uk-advertising-sector Internet overtakes television to become biggest advertising sector in the UK]. ''The Guardian'' (2009-09-30)</ref>\n[[Websites|Web sites]] often include the banner or pop-up ads. Social networking sites don't always have ads. In exchange, products have entire pages and are able to interact with users. [[Television commercials]] often end with a [[spokesperson]] asking viewers to check out the product website for more information. While briefly popular, print ads included [[QR code]]s on them. These QR codes can be scanned by cell phones and [[computers]], sending viewers to the product website. Advertising is beginning to move viewers from the traditional outlets to the electronic ones.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.business.com/articles/how-technology-is-changing-online-advertising/ |title = How Technology is Changing Online Advertising}}</ref>\nWhile traditional media, like newspapers and television advertising, are largely overshadowed by the rise of social media marketing, there is still a place for traditional marketing. For example, with newspapers, readership over the years has shown a decline. However, readership with newspapers is still fiercely loyal to print-only media. 51% of newspaper readers only read the newspaper in its print form,<ref>{{cite web|title=Newspapers: Fact Sheet|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> making well-placed ads valuable.\n\n===Leaks===\nThe Internet and social networking leaks are one of the issues facing traditional advertising. Video and print ads are often leaked to the world via the Internet earlier than they are scheduled to [[premiere]]. Social networking sites allow those leaks to go [[viral marketing|viral]], and be seen by many users more quickly.\n[[Time difference|The time difference]] is also a problem facing traditional advertisers. When social events occur and are [[broadcast]] on television, there is often a [[Broadcast delay|time delay]] between airings on the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] of the [[United States]]. Social networking sites have become a hub of comment and interaction concerning the event. This allows individuals watching the event on the west coast (time-delayed) to know the outcome before it airs. The [[2011 Grammy Awards]] highlighted this problem. [[Television viewer|Viewer]]s on the west coast learned who won different awards based on comments made on social networking sites by individuals watching live on the east coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostremote.com/2011/02/13/hey-grammys-you-cant-tape-delay-social-media/ |title=Hey Grammys, you can't tape-delay social media |publisher=Lostremote.com |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref> Since viewers knew who won already, many tuned out and [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were lower. All the advertisement and promotion put into the event was lost because viewers didn't have a reason to watch. {{According to whom|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Mishaps===\nSocial media marketing provides organizations with a way to connect with their customers.  However, organizations must protect their information as well as closely watch comments and concerns on the social media they use. A flash poll done on 1225 [[Information technology|IT]] executives from 33 countries revealed that social media mishaps caused organizations a combined $4.3 million in damages in 2010.<ref name=r1/> The top three social media incidents an organization faced during the previous year included employees sharing too much information in public forums, loss or exposure of confidential information, and increased exposure to litigation.<ref name=r1 /> Due to the viral nature of the Internet, a mistake by a single employee has in some cases shown to result in devastating consequences for organizations. An example of a social media mishap includes designer [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]]'s Twitter mishap in 2011. When Kenneth Cole tweeted, \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor has they heard our new spring collection is now available online at [Kenneth Cole's website]\".<ref name=\"ibtimes\">[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/108811/20110204/kenneth-cole-tweets-egypt-cairo-politically-incorrect-inappropriate-kc-pr-twitter-facebook-apology-h.htm Twitter account dedicated to poke fun at Kenneth Cole for #Cairo tweet].

However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers like to hear from advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Mateo|title=The Ethics of Social Media Marketing|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mateo-gutierrez/social-media-marketing_b_2206357.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=2012-12-03}}</ref> The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Melissa S.

Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.\n\nIn addition, social media platforms have become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their viewers to connect with them in various ways.  Social-networking website Facebook Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Saravanakumar, M.  |author2=SuganthaLakshmi, T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012|title= Social media marketing|journal= Life Science Journal|volume= 9|pages= 4444\u20134451}}</ref>  This may be an unethical or ethical feature to some individuals.  Some people may react negatively because they believe it is an invasion of privacy.

For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites.

Google Analytics<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/|title=Web Analytics Tools, Event Tracking & More \u2013 Google Analytics Features }}</ref> is a free tool that shows the behavior and other information, such as demographics and device type used, of website visitors from social networks.

Although social media is a useful marketing tool, it is often difficult to quantify to what extent it is contributing to profit. ROI can be measured by comparing marketing analytic value to contact database or CRM and connect marketing efforts directly to sales activity.\n\n===Customer response rates===\n\nSeveral customers are turning towards social media to express their appreciation or frustration with brands, product or services.

Social media marketing then connects these consumers and audiences to businesses that share the same needs, wants, and values. Through social networking sites, companies can keep in touch with individual followers. This personal interaction can instill a feeling of [[loyalty]] into followers and potential customers. Also, by choosing whom to follow on these sites, products can reach a very narrow target audience.<ref name=\"Assaad\"/> Social networking sites also include much information about what products and services prospective clients might be interested in. Through the use of new [[Semantics|semantic]] analysis technologies, marketers can detect buying signals, such as content shared by people and questions posted online.

Over the years, the Internet has continually gained more and more users, jumping from 738 million in 2000 all the way to 3.2 billion in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/money/3896219/internet-users-worldwide/|title=Here's How Many Internet Users There Are|website=Money|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> Roughly 81% of the current population in the United States has some type of social media profile that they engage with frequently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/273476/percentage-of-us-population-with-a-social-network-profile/|title=U.S. population with a social media profile 2017 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref> Mobile phone usage is beneficial for social media marketing because of their web browsing capabilities which allow individuals immediate access to social networking sites. Mobile phones have altered the path-to-purchase process by allowing consumers to easily obtain pricing and product information in real time.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ryu|first1=Jay Sung|title=Mobile Marketing Communications in the Retail Environment: A comparison of QR code users and non users|journal=International Journal of Mobile Marketing|date=2013}}</ref> They have also allowed companies to constantly remind and update their followers. Many companies are now putting QR (Quick Response) codes along with products for individuals to access the company website or online services with their smart phones. Retailers use QR codes to facilitate consumer interaction with brands by linking the code to brand websites, promotions, product information, and any other mobile-enabled content. In addition, [[Real-time bidding]] use in the mobile advertising industry is high and rising due to its value for on-the-go web browsing. In 2012, Nexage, a provider of real time bidding in mobile advertising reported a 37% increase in revenue each month. Adfonic, another mobile advertisement publishing platform, reported an increase of 22 billion ad requests that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/mobile-real-time-bidding-ad-ecosystem-2013-5|title=INFOGRAPHIC: Inside The Mobile Real-Time Bidding Ad Ecosystem|accessdate=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nMobile devices have become increasingly popular, where 5.7 billion people are using them worldwide <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/274774/forecast-of-mobile-phone-users-worldwide/|title=Number of mobile phone users worldwide 2013-2019 {{!}} Statista|website=Statista|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}</ref>. This has played a role in the way consumers interact with media and has many further implications for TV ratings, advertising, [[mobile commerce]], and more. Mobile [[media consumption]] such as mobile audio streaming or mobile video are on the rise \u2013 In the United States, more than 100 million users are projected to access online video content via mobile device. Mobile video revenue consists of [[pay-per-view]] downloads, advertising and subscriptions. As of 2013, worldwide mobile phone Internet user penetration was 73.4%. In 2017, figures suggest that more than 90% of Internet users will access online content through their phones.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/|title=Mobile Internet|work=www.statista.com|accessdate=12 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Strategies==\nThere are two basic strategies for using social media as a marketing tool:\n\n===Passive approach===\nSocial media can be a useful source of market information and a way to hear customer perspectives. Blogs, content communities, and forums are platforms where individuals share their reviews and recommendations of brands, products, and services. Businesses are able to tap and analyze the customer voices and feedback generated in social media for marketing purposes;<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\">{{cite book|author1=Constantinides E. |author2=Lorenzo C. |author3=G\u00f3mez M.A. |year= 2008|title= Social Media: A New Frontier for Retailers?|journal= European Retail Research|volume= 22|issue= 1|pages=1\u201328|doi=10.1007/978-3-8349-8099-1_1|isbn=978-3-8349-8099-1|url=https://research.utwente.nl/en/publications/social-media-a-new-frontier-for-retailers(2042de4c-cf4d-4f0f-a9d6-43ae725bf513).html }}</ref> in this sense the social media is a relatively inexpensive source of [[market intelligence]] which can be used by marketers and managers to track and respond to consumer-identified problems and detect market opportunities. For example, the Internet erupted with videos and pictures of iPhone 6 \"bend test\" which showed that the coveted phone could be bent by hand pressure. The so-called \"bend gate\" controversy<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/25/6844943/apple-says-iphone-bending-extremely-rare|title=Apple says iPhone 6 Plus bending through normal use is 'extremely rare'|author=Welch, Chris|publisher=Vox Media|work=The Verge|accessdate=12 September 2015|date=2014-09-25}}</ref> created confusion amongst customers who had waited months for the launch of the latest rendition of the iPhone. However, Apple promptly issued a statement saying that the problem was extremely rare and that the company had taken several steps to make the mobile device's case stronger and robust. Unlike traditional market research methods such as surveys, focus groups, and data mining which are time-consuming and costly, and which take weeks or even months to analyze, marketers can use social media to obtain 'live' or \"[[Real-time computing|real time]]\" information about consumer behavior and viewpoints on a company's brand or products. This can be useful in the highly dynamic, competitive, fast-paced and global marketplace of the 2010s.\n\n===Active approach===\nSocial media can be used not only as [[public relations]] and [[direct marketing]] tools, but also as communication channels targeting very specific audiences with social media influencers and social media personalities as effective [[customer engagement]] tools.<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/>  This tactic is widely known as [[influencer marketing]]. Influencer marketing allows brands the opportunity to reach their target audience in a more genuine, authentic way via a special group of selected [[Internet celebrity|influencers]] advertising their product or service. In fact, brands are set to spend up to $15 billion on influencer marketing by 2022, per [[Business Insider Intelligence]] estimates, based on Mediakix data.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/influencer-marketing-report|title=Influencer Marketing: State of the social media influencer market in 2020|last=Schomer|first=Audrey|website=Business Insider|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\nTechnologies predating social media, such as broadcast TV and newspapers can also provide advertisers with a fairly targeted audience, given that an ad placed during a sports game broadcast or in the sports section of a newspaper is likely to be read by sports fans. However, social media websites can target [[niche market]]s even more precisely. Using digital tools such as [[Google Adsense]], advertisers can target their ads to very specific demographics, such as people who are interested in [[social entrepreneurship]], [[political activism]] associated with a particular political party, or [[video gaming]]. Google Adsense does this by looking for [[Index term|keywords]] in social media user's online posts and comments. It would be hard for a TV station or paper-based newspaper to provide ads that are this targeted (though not impossible, as can be seen with \"special issue\" sections on niche issues, which newspapers can use to sell targeted ads).\n\nSocial networks are, in many cases, viewed as a great tool for avoiding costly market research. They are known for providing a short, fast, and direct way to reach an audience through a person who is widely known. For example, an [[athlete]] who gets endorsed by a sporting goods company also brings their support base of millions of people who are interested in what they do or how they play and now they want to be a part of this athlete through their endorsements with that particular company. At one point consumers would visit stores to view their products with famous athletes, but now you can view a famous athlete's, such as [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], latest apparel online with the click of a button. He advertises them to you directly through his [[Twitter|Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook accounts]].\n\n[[Facebook]] and [[LinkedIn]] are leading social media platforms where users can [[Hypertargeting|hyper-target]] their ads. Hypertargeting not only uses public profile information but also information users submit but hide from others.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Facebook Era: Tapping Online Social Networks to Market, Sell, and Innovate|last = Shih|first = Clara|publisher = Prentice Hall|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-13-708512-5|location = Boston|pages = 111}}</ref> There are several examples of firms initiating some form of online dialog with the public to foster relations with customers. According to Constantinides, Lorenzo and G\u00f3mez Borja (2008) \"Business executives like Jonathan Swartz, President and CEO of Sun Microsystems, Steve Jobs CEO of Apple Computers, and McDonald's Vice President Bob Langert post regularly in their CEO blogs, encouraging customers to interact and freely express their feelings, ideas, suggestions, or remarks about their postings, the company or its products\".<ref name=\"Constantinides E. 2008\"/> Using customer influencers (for example popular bloggers) can be a very efficient and cost-effective method to launch new products or services<ref>Gillin, P.

An example of these are [[consumer advocacy group]]s and groups that criticize companies (e.g., [[lobby group]]s or [[advocacy organization]]s). [[Social media]] use in a business or political context allows all consumers/citizens to express and share an opinion about a company's products, services, business practices, or a government's actions. Each participating customer, non-customer, or citizen who is participating online via social media becomes a part of the marketing department (or a challenge to the marketing effort) as other customers read their positive or negative comments or reviews. Getting consumers, potential consumers or citizens to be engaged online is fundamental to successful social media marketing.<ref>{{cite book|author=Evans, Dave |title=Social Media Marketing: The Next Generation of Business Engagement|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7l2OR6giC6AC&pg=PT15|accessdate=28 July 2013|date=16 September 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-94421-9|pages=15\u2013}}</ref> With the advent of social media marketing, it has become increasingly important to gain customer interest in products and services. This can eventually be translated into buying behavior, or voting and donating behavior in a political context. New online marketing concepts of engagement and loyalty have emerged which aim to build customer participation and brand reputation.<ref>{{cite book|title=Social Media Marketing|last=Evans|first=Dave|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Sybex|isbn=9781118194492}}</ref>\n\nEngagement in social media for the purpose of a social media strategy is divided into two parts. The first is proactive, regular posting of new online content. This can be seen through [[digital photo]]s, [[digital video]]s, text, and conversations. It is also represented through sharing of content and information from others via weblinks. The second part is reactive conversations with social media users responding to those who reach out to your social media profiles through commenting or messaging.<ref>Schaffer, Neal.

Traditional media such as physical newspapers, do give readers the option of sending a letter to the editor. Though, this is a relatively slow process, as the editorial board has to review the letter and decide if it is appropriate for publication. On the other hand, social media is participative and open; Participants are able to instantly share their views on brands, products, and services. Traditional media gave control of message to the marketer, whereas social media shifts the balance to the consumer or citizen.\n\n==Campaigns==\n\n===Local businesses===\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites as a promotional technique. Businesses can follow individuals social networking site uses in the local area and advertise specials and deals. These can be exclusive and in the form of \"get a free drink with a copy of this tweet\". This type of message encourages other locals to follow the business on the sites in order to obtain the promotional deal. In the process, the business is getting seen and promoting itself (brand visibility).\n\n[[Small businesses]] also use social networking sites to develop their own market research on new products and services.  By encouraging their customers to give feedback on new product ideas, businesses can gain valuable insights on whether a product may be accepted by their target market enough to merit full production, or not. In addition, customers will feel the company has engaged them in the process of co-creation\u2014the process in which the business uses customer feedback to create or modify a product or service the filling a need of the target market.  Such feedback can present in various forms, such as surveys, contests, polls, etc.\n\nSocial networking sites such as LinkedIn, also provide an opportunity for small businesses to find candidates to fill staff positions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adweek.com/socialtimes/survey-96-of-recruiters-use-social-media-to-find-high-quality-candidates/627040|title=Survey: 92% of Recruiters Use Social Media to Find High-Quality Candidates|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nOf course, review sites, such as Yelp, also help small businesses to build their reputation beyond just brand visibility.

Moreover, it can be accessed by the Internet as well. Thus, the marketers see it as a potential platform to expand their brands exposure to the public, especially the younger target group. On top of this, marketers do not only use social media for traditional Internet advertising, but they also encourage users to create attention for a certain brand. This generally creates an opportunity for greater brand exposure.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goor|first1=Marion aan 't|title=Instagram: A Content Analysis into Marketing on Instagram.

Many big names have already jumped on board: [[Starbucks]], [[MTV]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Marc Jacobs]], and [[Red Bull]] are a few examples of multinationals that adopted the mobile photo app early. Fashion blogger Danielle Bernstein, who goes by @weworewhat on Instagram, collaborated with ''Harper's Bazaar'' to do a piece on how brands are using Instagram to market their products, and how bloggers make money from it. Bernstein, who currently has one and a half million followers on Instagram, and whose \"outfit of the day\" photos on [[Snapchat]] get tens of thousands of screenshots, explained that for a lot of her sponsored posts, she must feature the brand in a certain number of posts, and often cannot wear a competitor's product in the same picture.

The company can present a more personal picture of their brand, and by doing so the company conveys a better and true picture of itself. The idea of Instagram pictures lies on on-the-go, a sense that the event is happening right now, and that adds another layer to the personal and accurate picture of the company. In fact, Thomas Rankin, co-founder and CEO of the program Dash Hudson, stated that when he approves a blogger's Instagram post before it is posted on the behalf of a brand his company represents, his only negative feedback is if it looks too posed. \"It's not an editorial photo,\" he explained, \"We're not trying to be a magazine. We're trying to create a moment.\"<ref name=\"Harper's Bazaar\"/> Another option Instagram provides the opportunity for companies to reflect a true picture of the brand from the perspective of the customers, for instance, using the user-generated contents thought the hashtags encouragement.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bj\u00f6rkgren|first1=Caroline|title=Guide: Kommunicera r\u00e4tt med Instagram (Communicate Right on Instagram)|url=http://internetworld.idg.se/2.1006/1.455713|website=Internet World|accessdate=11 June 2014}}</ref> Other than the filters and hashtags functions, the Instagram's 15-second videos and the recently added ability to send private messages between users have opened new opportunities for brands to connect with customers in a new extent, further promoting effective marketing on Instagram.\n\n=== Snapchat ===\nSnapchat is a popular messaging and picture exchanging application that was created in 2011 by three students at Stanford University named Evan Spiegel, Bobby Murphy, and Reggie Brown. The application was first developed to allow users to message back and forth and to also send photographs that are only available from 1\u201310 seconds until they are no longer available.

The type of language used in the commercials and the ideas used to promote the product reflect the audience's style and taste. Also, the ads on this platform are usually in sync with the content of the video requested, this is another advantage YouTube brings for advertisers. Certain ads are presented with certain videos since the content is relevant. Promotional opportunities such as sponsoring a video is also possible on YouTube, \"for example, a user who searches for a YouTube video on dog training may be presented with a sponsored video from a dog toy company in results along with other videos.\"<ref name=\"kincy\">{{cite journal|last=Kincy|first=Jason|title=Advertising and social media|journal=ABA Bank Marketing|year=2011|volume=43|issue=7|page=40}}</ref> YouTube also enable publishers to earn money through its [[YouTube Partner Program]].

In 1999, Misner said that word-of mouth marketing is, \"the world's most effective, yet least understood marketing strategy\" (Trusov, Bucklin, & Pauwels, 2009, p.&nbsp;3).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Trusov | first1 = M. | last2 = Bucklin | first2 = R.

Businesses and marketers have noticed that, \"a persons behaviour is influenced by many small groups\" (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). These small groups rotate around social networking accounts that are run by influential people (opinion leaders or \"thought leaders\") who have followers of groups. The types of groups (followers) are called:<ref>Kotler, P., Burton, S., Deans, K., Brown, L., & Armstrong, G. (2013). marketing (9th ed.). NSW, Australia: Pearson Australia</ref> reference groups (people who know each other either face-to-face or have an indirect influence on a persons attitude or behaviour); membership groups (a person has a direct influence on a person's attitude or behaviour); and aspirational groups (groups which an individual wishes to belong to).\n\n=== Influencer Marketing ===\n[[Influencer marketing|Marketers target influential people]], referred to as [[Internet celebrity|influencers]], on social media who are recognized as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their target audiences and amplify the impact of their message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or \"liking\" of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that \"consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals\" who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.&nbsp;216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.&nbsp;189).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sepp | first1 = M. | last2 = Liljander | first2 = V. | last3 = Gummerus | first3 = J. | year = 2011 | title = Private bloggers' motivations to produce content \u2013 a gratifications theory perspective | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing Management | volume = 27 | issue = 13/14| pages = 1479\u20131503 | doi = 10.1080/0267257X.2011.624532 }}</ref><ref>Fill, C., Hughes, G., & De Francesco, S.

The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.)  (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.&nbsp;39).<ref>Dahlen, M., Lange, F., & Smith, T.

Brand must seek to create their brand image on each platform, and cater to the type of consumer demographics on each respective platform. In contrast with pre-Internet marketing, such as TV ads and newspaper ads, in which the marketer controlled all aspects of the ad, with social media, users are free to post comments right below an online ad or an online post by a company about its product. Companies are increasing using their social media strategy as part of their traditional marketing effort using magazines, newspapers, radio advertisements, television advertisements. Since in the 2010s, media consumers are often using multiple platforms at the same time (e.g., surfing the Internet on a tablet while watching a streaming TV show), marketing content needs to be consistent across all platforms, whether traditional or new media. Heath (2006) wrote about the extent of attention businesses should give to their social media sites. It is about finding a balance between frequently posting but not over posting. There is a lot more attention to be paid towards social media sites because people need updates to gain brand recognition. Therefore, a lot more content is need and this can often be unplanned content.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heath | first1 = R. | last2 = Brandt | first2 = D. | last3 = Narin | first3 = A. | year = 2006 | title = Brand relationships: Strengthened by emotion, weakened by attention | url = | journal = Journal of Advertising Research | volume = 46 | issue = 4| pages = 410\u2013419 | doi=10.2501/s002184990606048x}}</ref>\n\nPlanned content begins with the creative/marketing team generating their ideas, once they have completed their ideas they send them off for approval. There is two general ways of doing so. The first is where each sector approves the plan one after another, editor, brand, followed by the legal team (Brito, 2013). Sectors may differ depending on the size and philosophy of the business. The second is where each sector is given 24 hours (or such designated time) to sign off or disapprove. If no action is given within the 24-hour period the original plan is implemented. Planned content is often noticeable to customers and is un-original or lacks excitement but is also a safer option to avoid unnecessary backlash from the public.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\">Brito, M. (2013). How content governance will facilitate media company transformation. InYour brand (pp. 3-7). Retrieved from http://www.quepublishing.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2143149&seqNum=3</ref> Both routes for planned content are time consuming as in the above; the first way to approval takes 72 hours to be approved. Although the second route can be significantly shorter it also holds more risk particularly in the legal department.\n\nUnplanned content is an 'in the moment' idea, \"a spontaneous, tactical reaction.\" (Cramer, 2014, p.&nbsp;6). The content could be trending and not have the time to take the planned content route. The unplanned content is posted sporadically and is not calendar/date/time arranged (Deshpande, 2014).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cramer | first1 = T | year = 2014 | title = The rise of content marketing | url = | journal = EContent | volume = 37 | issue = 3| pages = 6\u201310 }}</ref><ref>Deshpande, P. (2014, August 24). The content marketing pyramid: Create more with less. Retrieved April 1, 2016, from http://contentmarketinginstitute.com</ref> Issues with unplanned content revolve around legal issues and whether the message being sent out represents the business/brand accordingly. If a company sends out a Tweet or Facebook message too hurriedly, the company may unintentionally use insensitive language or messaging that could alienate some consumers. For example, celebrity chef [[Paula Deen]] was criticized after she made a social media post commenting about [[HIV-AIDS]] and [[South Africa]]; her message was deemed to be offensive by many observers. The main difference between planned and unplanned is the time to approve the content. Unplanned content must still be approved by marketing managers, but in a much more rapid manner e.g. 1\u20132 hours or less. Sectors may miss errors because of being hurried. When using unplanned content Brito (2013) says, \"be prepared to be reactive and respond to issues when they arise.\"<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/> Brito (2013) writes about having a, \"crisis escalation plan\", because, \"It will happen\". The plan involves breaking down the issue into topics and classifying the issue into groups. Colour coding the potential risk \"identify and flag potential risks\" also helps to organise an issue. The problem can then be handled by the correct team and dissolved more effectively rather than any person at hand trying to solve the situation.<ref name=\"quepublishing.com\"/>\n\n==Implications on traditional advertising==\n\n===Minimizing use===\nTraditional advertising techniques include print and [[television]] advertising. The [[Internet]] has already overtaken television as the largest advertising market.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/sep/30/internet-biggest-uk-advertising-sector Internet overtakes television to become biggest advertising sector in the UK]. ''The Guardian'' (2009-09-30)</ref>\n[[Websites|Web sites]] often include the banner or pop-up ads. Social networking sites don't always have ads. In exchange, products have entire pages and are able to interact with users. [[Television commercials]] often end with a [[spokesperson]] asking viewers to check out the product website for more information. While briefly popular, print ads included [[QR code]]s on them. These QR codes can be scanned by cell phones and [[computers]], sending viewers to the product website. Advertising is beginning to move viewers from the traditional outlets to the electronic ones.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.business.com/articles/how-technology-is-changing-online-advertising/ |title = How Technology is Changing Online Advertising}}</ref>\nWhile traditional media, like newspapers and television advertising, are largely overshadowed by the rise of social media marketing, there is still a place for traditional marketing. For example, with newspapers, readership over the years has shown a decline. However, readership with newspapers is still fiercely loyal to print-only media. 51% of newspaper readers only read the newspaper in its print form,<ref>{{cite web|title=Newspapers: Fact Sheet|url=http://www.journalism.org/2016/06/15/newspapers-fact-sheet/|website=Pew Research Center}}</ref> making well-placed ads valuable.\n\n===Leaks===\nThe Internet and social networking leaks are one of the issues facing traditional advertising. Video and print ads are often leaked to the world via the Internet earlier than they are scheduled to [[premiere]]. Social networking sites allow those leaks to go [[viral marketing|viral]], and be seen by many users more quickly.\n[[Time difference|The time difference]] is also a problem facing traditional advertisers. When social events occur and are [[broadcast]] on television, there is often a [[Broadcast delay|time delay]] between airings on the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]] and [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] of the [[United States]]. Social networking sites have become a hub of comment and interaction concerning the event. This allows individuals watching the event on the west coast (time-delayed) to know the outcome before it airs. The [[2011 Grammy Awards]] highlighted this problem. [[Television viewer|Viewer]]s on the west coast learned who won different awards based on comments made on social networking sites by individuals watching live on the east coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lostremote.com/2011/02/13/hey-grammys-you-cant-tape-delay-social-media/ |title=Hey Grammys, you can't tape-delay social media |publisher=Lostremote.com |date=2011-02-13 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}</ref> Since viewers knew who won already, many tuned out and [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] were lower. All the advertisement and promotion put into the event was lost because viewers didn't have a reason to watch. {{According to whom|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Mishaps===\nSocial media marketing provides organizations with a way to connect with their customers.  However, organizations must protect their information as well as closely watch comments and concerns on the social media they use. A flash poll done on 1225 [[Information technology|IT]] executives from 33 countries revealed that social media mishaps caused organizations a combined $4.3 million in damages in 2010.<ref name=r1/> The top three social media incidents an organization faced during the previous year included employees sharing too much information in public forums, loss or exposure of confidential information, and increased exposure to litigation.<ref name=r1 /> Due to the viral nature of the Internet, a mistake by a single employee has in some cases shown to result in devastating consequences for organizations. An example of a social media mishap includes designer [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]]'s Twitter mishap in 2011. When Kenneth Cole tweeted, \"Millions are in uproar in #Cairo. Rumor has they heard our new spring collection is now available online at [Kenneth Cole's website]\".<ref name=\"ibtimes\">[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/108811/20110204/kenneth-cole-tweets-egypt-cairo-politically-incorrect-inappropriate-kc-pr-twitter-facebook-apology-h.htm Twitter account dedicated to poke fun at Kenneth Cole for #Cairo tweet].

Retrieved on 2013-01-11.</ref>  This reference to the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] drew an objection from the public; it was widely objected to on the Internet.<ref name=\"ibtimes\" /> Kenneth Cole realized his mistake shortly after and responded with a statement apologizing for the tweet.<ref>[http://www.mediabistro.com/prnewser/kenneth-coles-twitter-fail_b14367 Kenneth Cole's Twitter Fail \u2013 PRNewser].

However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers like to hear from advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gutierrez|first1=Mateo|title=The Ethics of Social Media Marketing|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mateo-gutierrez/social-media-marketing_b_2206357.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=19 November 2014|date=2012-12-03}}</ref> The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neher|first1=Melissa S.

Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.\n\nIn addition, social media platforms have become extremely aware of their users and collect information about their viewers to connect with them in various ways.  Social-networking website Facebook Inc. is quietly working on a new advertising system that would let marketers target users with ads based on the massive amounts of information people reveal on the site about themselves.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Saravanakumar, M.  |author2=SuganthaLakshmi, T.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012|title= Social media marketing|journal= Life Science Journal|volume= 9|pages= 4444\u20134451}}</ref>  This may be an unethical or ethical feature to some individuals.  Some people may react negatively because they believe it is an invasion of privacy.  On the other hand, some individuals may enjoy this feature because their social network recognizes their interests and sends them particular advertisements pertaining to those interests.  Consumers like to network with people who share their interests and desires.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Mangold, W.G.  |author2=Faulds, D.J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2009|title =Social media: The new hybrid element of the promotion mix|journal=Business Horizons |volume= 52|issue=4  |pages= 357\u2013365|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2009.03.002}}</ref>  Individuals who agree to have their social media profile public, should be aware that advertisers have the ability to take information that interests them to be able to send them information and advertisements to boost their sales.

With the presence of data collecting companies, there is no longer a need to target specific audiences. This can be seen as a large ethically gray area. For many users, this is a breach of privacy, but there are no laws that prevent these companies from using the information provided on their websites. Companies like Equifax, Inc., TransUnion Corp, and LexisNexis Group thrive on collecting and sharing personal information of social media users.<ref name=\"jitpl.jmls.edu\">{{cite web|last1=Hochheiser|first1=Megan|title=Summary Of Data Mining Issues and Regulations|url=http://jitpl.jmls.edu/2015/04/02/summary-of-data-mining-issues-and-regulations/#_ftnref3|website=The John Marshall Journal of Information Technology and Privacy Law|accessdate=April 17, 2016}}</ref> In 2012, Facebook purchased information from 70 million households from a third party company called Datalogix.

President Barack Obama tried to work with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to attempt to regulate data mining. He proposed the Privacy Bill of Rights, which would protect the average user from having their private information downloaded and shared with third party companies. The proposed laws would give the consumer more control over what information companies can collect.<ref name=\"jitpl.jmls.edu\"/> President Obama was unable to pass most of these laws through congress, and it is unsure what President Trump will do with regards to social media [[marketing ethics]].\n\n==Metrics==\n\n===Web site reports===\n\nThis involves tracking the volume of visits, leads, and customers to a website from the individual social channel. Google Analytics<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/analytics/features/|title=Web Analytics Tools, Event Tracking & More \u2013 Google Analytics Features }}</ref> is a free tool that shows the behavior and other information, such as demographics and device type used, of website visitors from social networks.

Although social media is a useful marketing tool, it is often difficult to quantify to what extent it is contributing to profit. ROI can be measured by comparing marketing analytic value to contact database or CRM and connect marketing efforts directly to sales activity.\n\n===Customer response rates===\n\nSeveral customers are turning towards social media to express their appreciation or frustration with brands, product or services.  Therefore, marketers can measure the frequency of which customers are discussing their brand and judge how effective their SMM strategies are.

He identified Livingston's account with a tale found in [[Lozi mythology]], wherein the wicked men build a tower of masts to pursue the Creator-God, Nyambe, who has fled to Heaven on a spider-web, but the men perish when the masts collapse. He further relates similar tales of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] that substitute a pile of porridge pestles for the masts. Frazer moreover cites such legends found among the [[Kongo people]], as well as in [[Tanzania]], where the men stack poles or trees in a failed attempt to reach the moon.<ref name=\"Frazer, 1918 p. 5\"/> He further cited the [[Karbi people|Karbi]] and [[Kuki people]] of [[Assam]] as having a similar story. The traditions of the [[Karen people]] of [[Myanmar]], which Frazer considered to show clear 'Abrahamic' influence, also relate that their ancestors migrated there following the abandonment of a great [[pagoda]] in the land of the [[Karenni]] 30 generations from Adam, when the languages were confused and the Karen separated from the Karenni. He notes yet another version current in the [[Admiralty Islands]], where mankind's languages are confused following a failed attempt to build houses reaching to heaven.\n\n== Historical context ==\n[[File:Hanging Gardens of Babylon.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]'' (19th century illustration), depicts the Tower of Babel in the background.]]\nBiblical scholars see the Book of Genesis as [[Mythology|mythological]] and not as a historical account of events.<ref>{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=11}} \"How much history lies behind the story of Genesis?

The first century Roman-Jewish author Flavius Josephus similarly explained that the name was derived from the Hebrew word ''Babel (\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u1f72\u03bb)'', meaning \"confusion\".<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities'', 1.4.3</ref>\n\n== Destruction ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nThe account in Genesis makes no mention of any destruction of the tower. The people whose languages are confounded were simply scattered from there over the face of the Earth and stopped building their city.

He wrote that it was Nimrod who had the tower built and that Nimrod was a tyrant who tried to turn the people away from God. In this account, God confused the people rather than destroying them because annihilation with a Flood had not taught them to be godly.<blockquote>\nNow it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into [[tyranny]], seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power... Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of [[bitumen]], that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners <nowiki>[in the Flood]</nowiki>; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion. The Sibyl also makes mention of this tower, and of the confusion of the language, when she says thus:\u2014\"When all men were of one language, some of them built a high tower, as if they would thereby ascend up to heaven; but the gods sent storms of wind and overthrew the tower, and gave everyone a peculiar language; and for this reason it was that the city was called Babylon.\"</blockquote>\n\n=== Greek Apocalypse of Baruch ===\n[[Third Apocalypse of Baruch]] (or 3 Baruch, c. 2nd century), one of the [[pseudepigrapha]], describes the just rewards of sinners and the righteous in the afterlife.<ref name=\"Harris\" /> Among the sinners are those who instigated the Tower of Babel. In the account, Baruch is first taken (in a vision) to see the resting place of the souls of \"those who built the tower of strife against God, and the Lord banished them.\" Next he is shown another place, and there, occupying the form of dogs,\n<blockquote>\nThose who gave counsel to build the tower, for they whom thou seest drove forth multitudes of both men and women, to make bricks; among whom, a woman making bricks was not allowed to be released in the hour of child-birth, but brought forth while she was making bricks, and carried her child in her apron, and continued to make bricks. And the Lord appeared to them and confused their speech, when they had built the tower to the height of four hundred and sixty-three cubits. And they took a [[Gimlet (tool)|gimlet]], and sought to pierce the heavens, saying, Let us see (whether) the heaven is made of clay, or of brass, or of iron. When God saw this He did not permit them, but smote them with blindness and confusion of speech, and rendered them as thou seest.'' (Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, 3:5\u20138)</blockquote>\n\n=== Midrash ===\n[[Rabbinic literature]] offers many different accounts of other causes for building the Tower of Babel, and of the intentions of its builders. According to one midrash the builders of the Tower, called \"the generation of secession\" in the Jewish sources, said: \"God has no right to choose the upper world for Himself, and to leave the lower world to us; therefore we will build us a tower, with an idol on the top holding a sword, so that it may appear as if it intended to war with God\" ([[Genesis Rabbah|Gen. R.]] [https://archive.org/stream/RabbaGenesis/midrashrabbahgen027557mbp#page/n353/mode/2up xxxviii. 7]; Tan., ed. Buber, Noah, xxvii. et seq.).\n\nThe building of the Tower was meant to bid defiance not only to God, but also to Abraham, who exhorted the builders to reverence. The passage mentions that the builders spoke sharp words against God, saying that once every 1,656 years, heaven tottered so that the water poured down upon the earth, therefore they would support it by columns that there might not be another deluge (Gen. R. l.c.; Tan. l.c.; similarly Josephus, \"Ant.\" i. 4, \u00a7 2).\n\nSome among that generation even wanted to war against God in heaven (Talmud Sanhedrin 109a). They were encouraged in this undertaking by the notion that arrows that they shot into the sky fell back dripping with blood, so that the people really believed that they could wage war against the inhabitants of the heavens ([[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer ha-Yashar]], Chapter 9:12\u201336). According to Josephus and Midrash Pirke R. El. xxiv., it was mainly Nimrod who persuaded his contemporaries to build the Tower, while other rabbinical sources assert, on the contrary, that Nimrod separated from the builders.<ref name=JE />\n\nAccording to another midrashic account, one third of the Tower builders were punished by being transformed into semi-demonic creatures and banished into three parallel dimensions, inhabited now by their descendants.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/lginzberg/bl-lginzberg-legends-1-4l.htm |title=Legends of the Jews, Volume 1 |first=Louis |last=Ginzberg |authorlink=Louis Ginzberg|location=New York |date=1909  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001053501/http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/lginzberg/bl-lginzberg-legends-1-4l.htm|archivedate=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic tradition ===\n[[File:Turris Babel by Athanasius Kircher.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Turris Babel]]'' from [[Athanasius Kircher]]]]\nAlthough not mentioned by name, the [[Quran]] has a story with similarities to the biblical story of the Tower of Babel, although set in the Egypt of Moses: [[Pharaoh]] asks [[Haman (Islam)|Haman]] to build him a stone (or clay) tower so that he can mount up to heaven and confront the [[God]] of Moses.<ref>Pickthal, M. \"Quran\" (in English), Suras 28:36 and 40:36\u201337.

Prior to this event, humanity was stated to speak a single language. The preceding {{bibleverse||Genesis|10:5|HE}} states that the decedents of [[Japheth]], [[Gomer]], and [[Javan]] dispersed \"with their own tongues,\" creating an apparent contradiction.

Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.<ref name=\"Mazzocco\"/>\n\nBefore the acceptance of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]], these languages were considered to be \"[[Japhetic|Japhetite]]\" by some authors (e.g., [[Rasmus Rask]] in 1815; see [[Indo-European studies]]). Beginning in Renaissance Europe, priority over Hebrew was claimed for the alleged Japhetic languages, which were supposedly never corrupted because their speakers had not participated in the construction of the Tower of Babel. Among the candidates for a living descendant of the Adamic language were: [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] (see ''[[Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces]]''); [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] ([[Giovanni Battista Gelli]], 1542, [[Piero Francesco Giambullari]], 1564); [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ([[Goropius Becanus]], 1569, [[Abraham Mylius]], 1612); [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ([[Olaus Rudbeck]], 1675); [[German language|German]] ([[Georg Philipp Harsdorffer|Georg Philipp Harsd\u00f6rffer]], 1641, [[Justus Georg Schottel|Schottel]], 1641). The Swedish physician [[Andreas Kempe]] wrote a satirical tract in 1688, where he made fun of the contest between the European nationalists to claim their native tongue as the Adamic language. Caricaturing the attempts by the Swede Olaus Rudbeck to pronounce Swedish the original language of mankind, Kempe wrote a scathing [[parody]] where Adam spoke [[Danish language|Danish]], God spoke Swedish, and the serpent [[French language|French]].<ref>[[Maurice Olender|Olender, Maurice]] (1992).

Aside from the Ancient Greek myth that [[Hermes]] confused the languages, causing [[Zeus]] to give his throne to [[Phoroneus]], Frazer specifically mentions such accounts among the Wasania of [[Kenya]], the Kacha [[Naga people]] of Assam, the inhabitants of [[Encounter Bay]] in Australia, the [[Maidu]] of California, the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] of Alaska, and the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of Guatemala.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Frazer|first1=James George|authorlink1=James George Frazer|title=Folk-lore in the Old Testament: Studies in Comparative Religion, Legend and Law|date=1919|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|page=384|url=https://archive.org/stream/folkloreinoldte00frazgoog#page/n402/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Estonia]]n myth of \"the Cooking of Languages\"<ref>Kohl, ''Reisen in die 'Ostseeprovinzen'', ii. 251\u2013255</ref> has also been compared.\n\n===Enumeration of scattered languages===\nThere are several mediaeval historiographic accounts that attempt to make an enumeration of the languages scattered at the Tower of Babel. Because a count of all the [[sons of Noah|descendants of Noah]] listed by name in chapter 10 of Genesis ([[Septuagint|LXX]]) provides 15 names for Japheth's descendants, 30 for Ham's, and 27 for Shem's, these figures became established as the 72 languages resulting from the confusion at Babel\u2014although the exact listing of these languages changed over time. (The LXX Bible has two additional names, Elisa and Cainan, not found in the Masoretic text of this chapter, so early rabbinic traditions, such as the ''Mishna'', speak instead of \"70 languages\".) Some of the earliest sources for 72 (sometimes 73) languages are the 2nd-century Christian writers [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''[[Stromata]]'' I, 21) and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (''On the Psalms'' 9); it is repeated in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] book ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (c. 350 CE), [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]' ''[[Panarion]]'' (c. 375) and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' 16.6 (c. 410). The chronicles attributed to Hippolytus (c. 234) contain one of the first attempts to list each of the 72 peoples who were believed to have spoken these languages.\n\n[[Isidore of Seville]] in his ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (c. 600) mentions the number of 72; however, his list of names from the Bible drops the sons of Joktan and substitutes the sons of Abraham and Lot, resulting in only about 56 names total; he then appends a list of some of the nations known in his own day, such as the [[Longobards]] and the [[Franks]]. This listing was to prove quite influential on later accounts that made the Lombards and Franks themselves into descendants of eponymous grandsons of Japheth, e.g. the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' (c. 833), ''[[The Meadows of Gold]]'' by [[Abu al-Hasan 'Al\u012b al-Mas'\u016bd\u012b|al Masudi]] (c. 947) and ''[[Book of Roads and Kingdoms (al-Bakr\u012b)|Book of Roads and Kingdoms]]'' by [[al-Bakri]] (1068), the 11th-century ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', and the midrashic compilations ''[[Yosippon]]'' (c. 950), ''[[Chronicles of Jerahmeel]]'', and ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]''.\n\nOther sources that mention 72 (or 70) languages scattered from Babel are the [[Old Irish]] poem ''Cu cen mathair'' by [[Luccreth moccu Chiara]] (c. 600); the Irish monastic work ''[[Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces]]''; ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by the Persian historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (c. 915); the Anglo-Saxon dialogue ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]''; the Russian ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' (c. 1113); the Jewish [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] work ''[[Bahir]]'' (1174); the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' of [[Snorri Sturluson]] (c. 1200); the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''[[Book of the Bee]]'' (c. 1221); the ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'' (c. 1284; mentions 22 for Shem, 31 for Ham and 17 for Japheth for a total of 70); [[Giovanni Villani|Villani]]'s 1300 account; and the rabbinic ''[[Midrash ha-Gadol]]'' (14th century). Villani adds that it \"was begun 700 years after the Flood, and there were 2,354 years from the beginning of the world to the confusion of the Tower of Babel. And we find that they were 107 years working at it; and men lived long in those times\". According to the ''Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum'', however, the project was begun only 200 years following the Deluge.\n\nThe tradition of 72 languages persisted into later times. Both [[Jos\u00e9 de Acosta]] in his 1576 treatise ''De procuranda indorum salute'', and [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira]] a century later in his ''Serm\u00e3o da Epifania'', expressed amazement at how much this 'number of tongues' could be surpassed, there being hundreds of mutually unintelligible languages indigenous only to Peru and Brazil.\n\n==Height==\nThe Book of Genesis does not mention how tall the tower was. The phrase used to describe the tower, \"its top in the sky\" (v.4), was an idiom for impressive height; rather than implying arrogance this was simply a clich\u00e9 for height.{{r|hiebert|page1=37}}\n\nThe Book of Jubilees mentions the tower's height as being 5,433 cubits and 2 palms, or {{Convert|2484|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, about three times the height of [[Burj Khalifa]], or roughly 1.6 miles high. The Third Apocalypse of Baruch mentions that the 'tower of strife' reached a height of 463 cubits, or {{Convert|211.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, taller than any structure built [[Timeline of three tallest structures in the world|in human history]] until the construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1889, which is {{Convert|324|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height.\n\n[[Gregory of Tours]] writing c. 594, quotes the earlier historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] (c. 417) as saying the tower was \"laid out foursquare on a very level plain. Its wall, made of baked brick cemented with pitch, is fifty [[cubits]] wide, two hundred high, and four hundred and seventy [[stadia (length)|stades]] in [[circumference]]. A stade was an ancient Greek unit of length, based on the circumference of a typical sports stadium of the time which was about {{convert| 176| m|feet}}.<ref name=engels>Donald Engels (1985).

He also quotes unnamed authors who say that the spiral path was so wide that it contained lodgings for workers and animals, and other authors who claim that the path was wide enough to have fields for growing [[grain]] for the animals used in the construction.\n\nIn his book, ''Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down'' (Pelican 1978\u20131984), Professor [[J.E. Gordon]] considers the height of the Tower of Babel. He wrote, \"brick and stone weigh about 120&nbsp;lb per [[cubic foot]] (2,000&nbsp;kg per cubic metre) and the crushing strength of these materials is generally rather better than 6,000&nbsp;lbs per square inch or 40 mega-pascals. Elementary arithmetic shows that a tower with parallel walls could have been built to a height of {{Convert|2.1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} before the bricks at the bottom were crushed. However, by making the walls taper towards the top they ... could well have been built to a height where the men of Shinnar would run short of oxygen and had difficulty in breathing before the brick walls crushed beneath their own dead weight.\"\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]]'s influential portrayal is based on the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, while later conical depictions of the tower (as depicted in Dor\u00e9's illustration) resemble much later Muslim towers observed by 19th-century explorers in the area, notably the [[Great Mosque of Samarra|Minaret of Samarra]]. [[M.C. Escher]] depicts a more stylized geometrical structure in [[Tower of Babel (M. C. Escher)|his woodcut]] representing the story.\n\nThe composer [[Anton Rubinstein]] wrote an opera based on the story ''[[Der Thurm zu Babel]]''.\n\nAmerican choreographer [[Adam Darius]] staged a multilingual theatrical interpretation of ''The Tower of Babel'' in 1993 at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] in London.\n\n[[Fritz Lang]]'s 1927 film ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', in a flashback, plays upon themes of lack of communication between the designers of the tower and the workers who are constructing it. The short scene states how the words used to glorify the tower's construction by its designers took on totally different, oppressive meanings to the workers. This led to its destruction as they rose up against the designers because of the insufferable working conditions. The appearance of the tower was modeled after [[The Tower of Babel (Brueghel)|Brueghel's 1563 painting]].<ref name=\"Bukatman\">{{cite book |last=Bukatman |first=Scott |title=Blade Runner |location=London |publisher=British Film Institute |date=1997 |isbn= 0-85170-623-1 |pages=62\u201363}}</ref>\n\nThe political philosopher [[Michael Oakeshott]] surveyed historic variations of the Tower of Babel in different cultures<ref name=\"Worthington 2016 p. 121\">{{cite book |last=Worthington |first=G. |title=Religious and Poetic Experience in the Thought of Michael Oakeshott |publisher=Andrews UK Limited |series=British Idealist Studies 1: Oakeshott |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-84540-594-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UMk0DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT121 |page=121f}}</ref> and produced a modern retelling of his own in his 1983 book, ''On History''.<ref>Reprinted as {{cite book |last=Oakeshott |first=Michael |chapter=The tower of Babel |editor-last=Clarke |editor-first=S.G. |editor-last2=Simpson |editor-first2=E. |title=Anti-Theory in Ethics and Moral Conservatism |publisher=State University of New York Press |series=SUNY Series in Ethical Theory |year=1989 |isbn=978-0-88706-912-3 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnOMf9Yr0kgC&pg=PA185 |access-date=25 May 2018 |page=[https://archive.org/details/antitheoryinethi0000unse/page/185 185ff] |url=https://archive.org/details/antitheoryinethi0000unse/page/185 }}</ref> In his retelling, Oakeshott expresses disdain for human willingness to sacrifice individuality, culture, and quality of life for grand collective projects.

He wrote that he was told when the light of the sun first appeared upon the land, giants appeared and set off in search of the sun. Not finding it, they built a tower to reach the sky. An angered God of the Heavens called upon the inhabitants of the sky, who destroyed the tower and scattered its inhabitants.

He identified Livingston's account with a tale found in [[Lozi mythology]], wherein the wicked men build a tower of masts to pursue the Creator-God, Nyambe, who has fled to Heaven on a spider-web, but the men perish when the masts collapse. He further relates similar tales of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] that substitute a pile of porridge pestles for the masts. Frazer moreover cites such legends found among the [[Kongo people]], as well as in [[Tanzania]], where the men stack poles or trees in a failed attempt to reach the moon.<ref name=\"Frazer, 1918 p. 5\"/> He further cited the [[Karbi people|Karbi]] and [[Kuki people]] of [[Assam]] as having a similar story. The traditions of the [[Karen people]] of [[Myanmar]], which Frazer considered to show clear 'Abrahamic' influence, also relate that their ancestors migrated there following the abandonment of a great [[pagoda]] in the land of the [[Karenni]] 30 generations from Adam, when the languages were confused and the Karen separated from the Karenni. He notes yet another version current in the [[Admiralty Islands]], where mankind's languages are confused following a failed attempt to build houses reaching to heaven.\n\n== Historical context ==\n[[File:Hanging Gardens of Babylon.jpg|left|thumb|''[[Hanging Gardens of Babylon]]'' (19th century illustration), depicts the Tower of Babel in the background.]]\nBiblical scholars see the Book of Genesis as [[Mythology|mythological]] and not as a historical account of events.<ref>{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=11}} \"How much history lies behind the story of Genesis? Because the action of the primeval story is not represented as taking place on the plane of ordinary human history and has so many affinities with ancient mythology, it is very far-fetched to speak of its narratives as historical at all.\"</ref> Nonetheless, the story of Babel can be interpreted in terms of its context.\n\n{{bibleverse||Genesis|10:10|HE}} states that Babel ([[LXX]]: \u0392\u03b1\u03b2\u03c5\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd) formed part of [[Nimrod (king)|Nimrod]]'s kingdom. The Bible does not specifically mention that Nimrod ordered the building of the tower, but many other sources have associated its construction with Nimrod.<ref name=JE />\n\n{{bibleverse||Genesis|11:9|HE}}attributes the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] version of the name, ''Babel'', to the verb ''balal'', which means ''to confuse or confound'' in Hebrew. The first century Roman-Jewish author Flavius Josephus similarly explained that the name was derived from the Hebrew word ''Babel (\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u1f72\u03bb)'', meaning \"confusion\".<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities'', 1.4.3</ref>\n\n== Destruction ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=October 2019}}\nThe account in Genesis makes no mention of any destruction of the tower. The people whose languages are confounded were simply scattered from there over the face of the Earth and stopped building their city. However, in other sources, such as the [[Book of Jubilees]] (chapter 10 v.18\u201327), [[Cornelius Alexander]] (frag. 10), [[Abydenus]] (frags. 5 and 6), [[Josephus]] (''Antiquities'' 1.4.3), and the [[Sibylline Oracles]] (iii. 117\u2013129), God overturns the tower with a great wind. In the [[Midrash]], it said that the top of the tower was burnt, the bottom was swallowed, and the middle was left standing to erode over time.\n\n== Etemenanki, the ziggurat at Babylon ==\n[[File:Etemenanki drawing.gif|thumb|Reconstruction of the [[Etemenanki]], which was {{Convert|91|m|ft|-1}} in height]]\n{{Main|Etemenanki}}\n'''Etemenanki''' ([[Sumerian language|Sumerian]]: \"temple of the foundation of heaven and earth\") was the name of a ziggurat dedicated to Marduk in the city of Babylon. It was famously rebuilt by the 6th-century BCE Neo-Babylonian dynasty rulers [[Nabopolassar]] and [[Nebuchadnezzar II]]. According to modern scholars, such as [[Stephen L.

He wrote that it was Nimrod who had the tower built and that Nimrod was a tyrant who tried to turn the people away from God. In this account, God confused the people rather than destroying them because annihilation with a Flood had not taught them to be godly.<blockquote>\nNow it was Nimrod who excited them to such an affront and contempt of God. He was the grandson of Ham, the son of Noah, a bold man, and of great strength of hand. He persuaded them not to ascribe it to God as if it were through his means they were happy, but to believe that it was their own courage which procured that happiness. He also gradually changed the government into [[tyranny]], seeing no other way of turning men from the fear of God, but to bring them into a constant dependence on his power... Now the multitude were very ready to follow the determination of Nimrod and to esteem it a piece of cowardice to submit to God; and they built a tower, neither sparing any pains, nor being in any degree negligent about the work: and, by reason of the multitude of hands employed in it, it grew very high, sooner than any one could expect; but the thickness of it was so great, and it was so strongly built, that thereby its great height seemed, upon the view, to be less than it really was. It was built of burnt brick, cemented together with mortar, made of [[bitumen]], that it might not be liable to admit water. When God saw that they acted so madly, he did not resolve to destroy them utterly, since they were not grown wiser by the destruction of the former sinners <nowiki>[in the Flood]</nowiki>; but he caused a tumult among them, by producing in them diverse languages, and causing that, through the multitude of those languages, they should not be able to understand one another. The place wherein they built the tower is now called Babylon, because of the confusion of that language which they readily understood before; for the Hebrews mean by the word Babel, confusion. The Sibyl also makes mention of this tower, and of the confusion of the language, when she says thus:\u2014\"When all men were of one language, some of them built a high tower, as if they would thereby ascend up to heaven; but the gods sent storms of wind and overthrew the tower, and gave everyone a peculiar language; and for this reason it was that the city was called Babylon.\"</blockquote>\n\n=== Greek Apocalypse of Baruch ===\n[[Third Apocalypse of Baruch]] (or 3 Baruch, c. 2nd century), one of the [[pseudepigrapha]], describes the just rewards of sinners and the righteous in the afterlife.<ref name=\"Harris\" /> Among the sinners are those who instigated the Tower of Babel. In the account, Baruch is first taken (in a vision) to see the resting place of the souls of \"those who built the tower of strife against God, and the Lord banished them.\" Next he is shown another place, and there, occupying the form of dogs,\n<blockquote>\nThose who gave counsel to build the tower, for they whom thou seest drove forth multitudes of both men and women, to make bricks; among whom, a woman making bricks was not allowed to be released in the hour of child-birth, but brought forth while she was making bricks, and carried her child in her apron, and continued to make bricks. And the Lord appeared to them and confused their speech, when they had built the tower to the height of four hundred and sixty-three cubits. And they took a [[Gimlet (tool)|gimlet]], and sought to pierce the heavens, saying, Let us see (whether) the heaven is made of clay, or of brass, or of iron. When God saw this He did not permit them, but smote them with blindness and confusion of speech, and rendered them as thou seest.'' (Greek Apocalypse of Baruch, 3:5\u20138)</blockquote>\n\n=== Midrash ===\n[[Rabbinic literature]] offers many different accounts of other causes for building the Tower of Babel, and of the intentions of its builders. According to one midrash the builders of the Tower, called \"the generation of secession\" in the Jewish sources, said: \"God has no right to choose the upper world for Himself, and to leave the lower world to us; therefore we will build us a tower, with an idol on the top holding a sword, so that it may appear as if it intended to war with God\" ([[Genesis Rabbah|Gen. R.]] [https://archive.org/stream/RabbaGenesis/midrashrabbahgen027557mbp#page/n353/mode/2up xxxviii. 7]; Tan., ed. Buber, Noah, xxvii. et seq.).\n\nThe building of the Tower was meant to bid defiance not only to God, but also to Abraham, who exhorted the builders to reverence. The passage mentions that the builders spoke sharp words against God, saying that once every 1,656 years, heaven tottered so that the water poured down upon the earth, therefore they would support it by columns that there might not be another deluge (Gen. R. l.c.; Tan. l.c.; similarly Josephus, \"Ant.\" i. 4, \u00a7 2).\n\nSome among that generation even wanted to war against God in heaven (Talmud Sanhedrin 109a). They were encouraged in this undertaking by the notion that arrows that they shot into the sky fell back dripping with blood, so that the people really believed that they could wage war against the inhabitants of the heavens ([[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer ha-Yashar]], Chapter 9:12\u201336). According to Josephus and Midrash Pirke R. El. xxiv., it was mainly Nimrod who persuaded his contemporaries to build the Tower, while other rabbinical sources assert, on the contrary, that Nimrod separated from the builders.<ref name=JE />\n\nAccording to another midrashic account, one third of the Tower builders were punished by being transformed into semi-demonic creatures and banished into three parallel dimensions, inhabited now by their descendants.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/lginzberg/bl-lginzberg-legends-1-4l.htm |title=Legends of the Jews, Volume 1 |first=Louis |last=Ginzberg |authorlink=Louis Ginzberg|location=New York |date=1909  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001053501/http://classiclit.about.com/library/bl-etexts/lginzberg/bl-lginzberg-legends-1-4l.htm|archivedate=1 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Islamic tradition ===\n[[File:Turris Babel by Athanasius Kircher.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Turris Babel]]'' from [[Athanasius Kircher]]]]\nAlthough not mentioned by name, the [[Quran]] has a story with similarities to the biblical story of the Tower of Babel, although set in the Egypt of Moses: [[Pharaoh]] asks [[Haman (Islam)|Haman]] to build him a stone (or clay) tower so that he can mount up to heaven and confront the [[God]] of Moses.<ref>Pickthal, M. \"Quran\" (in English), Suras 28:36 and 40:36\u201337.

Prior to this event, humanity was stated to speak a single language. The preceding {{bibleverse||Genesis|10:5|HE}} states that the decedents of [[Japheth]], [[Gomer]], and [[Javan]] dispersed \"with their own tongues,\" creating an apparent contradiction.

Dante concludes (''Paradiso'' XXVI) that Hebrew is a derivative of the language of Adam. In particular, the chief Hebrew name for God in scholastic tradition, ''[[El (god)|El]]'', must be derived of a different Adamic name for God, which Dante gives as ''[[Close front unrounded vowel|I]]''.<ref name=\"Mazzocco\"/>\n\nBefore the acceptance of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family]], these languages were considered to be \"[[Japhetic|Japhetite]]\" by some authors (e.g., [[Rasmus Rask]] in 1815; see [[Indo-European studies]]). Beginning in Renaissance Europe, priority over Hebrew was claimed for the alleged Japhetic languages, which were supposedly never corrupted because their speakers had not participated in the construction of the Tower of Babel. Among the candidates for a living descendant of the Adamic language were: [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] (see ''[[Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces]]''); [[Tuscan language|Tuscan]] ([[Giovanni Battista Gelli]], 1542, [[Piero Francesco Giambullari]], 1564); [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ([[Goropius Becanus]], 1569, [[Abraham Mylius]], 1612); [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ([[Olaus Rudbeck]], 1675); [[German language|German]] ([[Georg Philipp Harsdorffer|Georg Philipp Harsd\u00f6rffer]], 1641, [[Justus Georg Schottel|Schottel]], 1641). The Swedish physician [[Andreas Kempe]] wrote a satirical tract in 1688, where he made fun of the contest between the European nationalists to claim their native tongue as the Adamic language. Caricaturing the attempts by the Swede Olaus Rudbeck to pronounce Swedish the original language of mankind, Kempe wrote a scathing [[parody]] where Adam spoke [[Danish language|Danish]], God spoke Swedish, and the serpent [[French language|French]].<ref>[[Maurice Olender|Olender, Maurice]] (1992).

Because a count of all the [[sons of Noah|descendants of Noah]] listed by name in chapter 10 of Genesis ([[Septuagint|LXX]]) provides 15 names for Japheth's descendants, 30 for Ham's, and 27 for Shem's, these figures became established as the 72 languages resulting from the confusion at Babel\u2014although the exact listing of these languages changed over time. (The LXX Bible has two additional names, Elisa and Cainan, not found in the Masoretic text of this chapter, so early rabbinic traditions, such as the ''Mishna'', speak instead of \"70 languages\".) Some of the earliest sources for 72 (sometimes 73) languages are the 2nd-century Christian writers [[Clement of Alexandria]] (''[[Stromata]]'' I, 21) and [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (''On the Psalms'' 9); it is repeated in the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] book ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (c. 350 CE), [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]' ''[[Panarion]]'' (c. 375) and [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]]'s ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' 16.6 (c. 410). The chronicles attributed to Hippolytus (c. 234) contain one of the first attempts to list each of the 72 peoples who were believed to have spoken these languages.\n\n[[Isidore of Seville]] in his ''[[Etymologiae]]'' (c. 600) mentions the number of 72; however, his list of names from the Bible drops the sons of Joktan and substitutes the sons of Abraham and Lot, resulting in only about 56 names total; he then appends a list of some of the nations known in his own day, such as the [[Longobards]] and the [[Franks]]. This listing was to prove quite influential on later accounts that made the Lombards and Franks themselves into descendants of eponymous grandsons of Japheth, e.g. the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'' (c. 833), ''[[The Meadows of Gold]]'' by [[Abu al-Hasan 'Al\u012b al-Mas'\u016bd\u012b|al Masudi]] (c. 947) and ''[[Book of Roads and Kingdoms (al-Bakr\u012b)|Book of Roads and Kingdoms]]'' by [[al-Bakri]] (1068), the 11th-century ''[[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]'', and the midrashic compilations ''[[Yosippon]]'' (c. 950), ''[[Chronicles of Jerahmeel]]'', and ''[[Sefer haYashar (midrash)|Sefer haYashar]]''.\n\nOther sources that mention 72 (or 70) languages scattered from Babel are the [[Old Irish]] poem ''Cu cen mathair'' by [[Luccreth moccu Chiara]] (c. 600); the Irish monastic work ''[[Auraicept na n-\u00c9ces]]''; ''[[History of the Prophets and Kings]]'' by the Persian historian [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (c. 915); the Anglo-Saxon dialogue ''[[Solomon and Saturn]]''; the Russian ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' (c. 1113); the Jewish [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] work ''[[Bahir]]'' (1174); the ''[[Prose Edda]]'' of [[Snorri Sturluson]] (c. 1200); the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ''[[Book of the Bee]]'' (c. 1221); the ''[[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]]'' (c. 1284; mentions 22 for Shem, 31 for Ham and 17 for Japheth for a total of 70); [[Giovanni Villani|Villani]]'s 1300 account; and the rabbinic ''[[Midrash ha-Gadol]]'' (14th century). Villani adds that it \"was begun 700 years after the Flood, and there were 2,354 years from the beginning of the world to the confusion of the Tower of Babel. And we find that they were 107 years working at it; and men lived long in those times\". According to the ''Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum'', however, the project was begun only 200 years following the Deluge.\n\nThe tradition of 72 languages persisted into later times. Both [[Jos\u00e9 de Acosta]] in his 1576 treatise ''De procuranda indorum salute'', and [[Ant\u00f3nio Vieira]] a century later in his ''Serm\u00e3o da Epifania'', expressed amazement at how much this 'number of tongues' could be surpassed, there being hundreds of mutually unintelligible languages indigenous only to Peru and Brazil.\n\n==Height==\nThe Book of Genesis does not mention how tall the tower was. The phrase used to describe the tower, \"its top in the sky\" (v.4), was an idiom for impressive height; rather than implying arrogance this was simply a clich\u00e9 for height.{{r|hiebert|page1=37}}\n\nThe Book of Jubilees mentions the tower's height as being 5,433 cubits and 2 palms, or {{Convert|2484|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, about three times the height of [[Burj Khalifa]], or roughly 1.6 miles high. The Third Apocalypse of Baruch mentions that the 'tower of strife' reached a height of 463 cubits, or {{Convert|211.8|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, taller than any structure built [[Timeline of three tallest structures in the world|in human history]] until the construction of the [[Eiffel Tower]] in 1889, which is {{Convert|324|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in height.\n\n[[Gregory of Tours]] writing c. 594, quotes the earlier historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] (c. 417) as saying the tower was \"laid out foursquare on a very level plain. Its wall, made of baked brick cemented with pitch, is fifty [[cubits]] wide, two hundred high, and four hundred and seventy [[stadia (length)|stades]] in [[circumference]].

Available online in [http://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/gregory-hist.asp#book3 abridged form].</ref>\n\nA typical medieval account is given by [[Giovanni Villani]] (1300): He relates that \"it measured eighty miles [130 km] round, and it was already 4,000 [[paces]] high, or {{Convert|5.92|km|mi|2|abbr=on}} and 1,000 paces thick, and each pace is three of our feet.\"<ref>[http://www.elfinspell.com/VillaniBook1a.html#sect2 Selections from Giovanni's ''Chronicle'' in English].</ref> The 14th-century traveler [[John Mandeville]] also included an account of the tower and reported that its height had been 64 [[furlong]]s, or {{Convert|13|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, according to the local inhabitants.\n\nThe 17th-century historian [[Verstegan]] provides yet another figure \u2013 quoting Isidore, he says that the tower was 5,164 paces high, or {{Convert|7.6|km|mi|1|abbr=on}}, and quoting Josephus that the tower was wider than it was high, more like a mountain than a tower. He also quotes unnamed authors who say that the spiral path was so wide that it contained lodgings for workers and animals, and other authors who claim that the path was wide enough to have fields for growing [[grain]] for the animals used in the construction.\n\nIn his book, ''Structures: Or Why Things Don't Fall Down'' (Pelican 1978\u20131984), Professor [[J.E. Gordon]] considers the height of the Tower of Babel. He wrote, \"brick and stone weigh about 120&nbsp;lb per [[cubic foot]] (2,000&nbsp;kg per cubic metre) and the crushing strength of these materials is generally rather better than 6,000&nbsp;lbs per square inch or 40 mega-pascals. Elementary arithmetic shows that a tower with parallel walls could have been built to a height of {{Convert|2.1|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} before the bricks at the bottom were crushed. However, by making the walls taper towards the top they ... could well have been built to a height where the men of Shinnar would run short of oxygen and had difficulty in breathing before the brick walls crushed beneath their own dead weight.\"\n\n==In popular culture==\n\n[[Pieter Brueghel the Elder|Pieter Brueghel]]'s influential portrayal is based on the [[Colosseum]] in Rome, while later conical depictions of the tower (as depicted in Dor\u00e9's illustration) resemble much later Muslim towers observed by 19th-century explorers in the area, notably the [[Great Mosque of Samarra|Minaret of Samarra]].

The short scene states how the words used to glorify the tower's construction by its designers took on totally different, oppressive meanings to the workers. This led to its destruction as they rose up against the designers because of the insufferable working conditions.

The upper well injects steam, and the lower one collects the heated [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen that flows down due to gravity, plus recovered water from the condensation of the injected steam. The basis of the SAGD process is that thermal communication is established with the reservoir so that the injected steam forms a \"steam chamber\". The heat from the steam reduces the [[viscosity]] of the heavy crude oil or bitumen which allows it to flow down into the lower wellbore. The steam and associated gas rise because of their low density compared to the heavy crude oil below, ensuring that steam is not produced at the lower production well, tend to rise in the steam chamber, filling the void space left by the oil. Associated gas forms, to a certain extent, an insulating heat blanket above (and around) the steam.<ref name=\"Holdaway_2014\">{{citation |title=Harness Oil and Gas Big Data with Analytics: Optimize Exploration and Production with Data Driven Models |first=Keith |last=Holdaway |work=Wiley |date=13 May 2014  |accessdate=3 February 2014 |isbn=1118910958 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXaVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=Oil+and+water+flow+is+by+a+countercurrent,+gravity+driven+drainage+into+the+lower+well+bore.+The+condensed+water+and&source=bl&ots=TE27OxNN7W&sig=AzqWxxf0GAhoRBTj8B99CYBwKhA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JDDSVIycCM7HsQTJv4KADg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ}}</ref> Oil and water flow is by a countercurrent, gravity driven drainage into the lower well bore.

The higher the liquid level above the producer the lower the temperature and higher is the sub-cool. However real life reservoirs are invariably heterogeneous therefore it becomes extremely difficult to achieve a uniform sub-cool along the entire horizontal length of a well. As a consequence many operators, when faced with uneven stunted steam chamber development, allow a small quantity of steam to enter into the producer to keep the bitumen in the entire wellbore hot hence keeping its viscosity low with the added benefit of transferring heat to colder parts of the reservoir along the wellbore. Another variation sometimes called Partial SAGD is used when operators deliberately circulate steam in the producer following a long shut-in period or as a startup procedure. Though a high value of sub-cool is desirable from a thermal efficiency standpoint as it generally includes reduction of steam injection rates but it also results in slightly reduced production due to a corresponding higher viscosity and lower mobility of bitumen caused by lower temperature. Another drawback of very high sub-cool is the possibility of steam pressure eventually not being enough to sustain steam chamber development above the injector, sometimes resulting in collapsed steam chambers where condensed steam floods the injector and precludes further development of the chamber.\n\nContinuous operation of the injection and production wells at approximately reservoir pressure eliminates the instability problems that plague all high-pressure and cyclic steam processes and SAGD produces a smooth, even production that can be as high as 70% to 80% of oil in place in suitable reservoirs. The process is relatively insensitive to shale streaks and other vertical barriers to steam and fluid flow because, as the rock is heated, differential thermal expansion allows steam and fluids to gravity flow through to the production well. This allows recovery rates of 60% to 70% of oil in place, even in formations with many thin shale barriers. Thermally, SAGD is generally twice as efficient as the older cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process, and it results in far fewer wells being damaged by the high pressures associated with CSS. Combined with the higher oil recovery rates achieved, this means that SAGD is much more economic than cyclic steam processes where the reservoir is reasonably thick.<ref>{{cite book | last = Speight | first = James G.  | title = The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum\n | publisher = CRC Press | year = 2007 | pages = 165\u2013167 | url = | isbn = 0-8493-9067-2}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\nThe gravity drainage idea was originally conceived by Dr. Roger Butler, an engineer for [[Imperial Oil]] in the 1970s<ref name=\"butlerhalloffame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/roger-butler.html|title=Dr. Roger M.

With the low cost of drilling horizontal well pairs, and the very high [[peak oil|recovery rates]] of the SAGD process (up to 60% of the oil in place), SAGD is economically attractive to oil companies.\n\nAt Foster Creek Cenovus has employed its patented<ref>http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2591498/summary.html?query=cenovus&start=1&num=50&type=basic_search</ref> 'wedge well' technology to recover residual resources bypassed by regular SAGD operations, this improves the total recovery rate of the operation. The 'wedge well' technology works by accessing the residual bitumen that is bypassed in regular SAGD operations by drilling an infill well between two established operating SAGD well pairs once the SAGD steam chambers have matured to the point where they have merged and are in fluid communication and then what is left to recover in that reservoir area between the operating SAGD well pairs is a 'wedge' of residual, bypassed oil. Wedge well technology has been shown to improve overall recovery rates by 5%-10% at a reduced capital cost as less steam is required once the steam chambers mature to the point where they are in fluid communication and typically at this stage in the recovery process, also commonly known as the 'blow down' phase<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-165481-MS</ref>, the injected steam is replaced with a non-condensable gas such as methane, further reducing production costs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2011AthabascaCenovusFosterCreekSAGD8623.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226022653/http://www.aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2011AthabascaCenovusFosterCreekSAGD8623.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Current applications ==\n\nThis technology is now being exploited due to [[2000s energy crisis|increased oil prices]]. While traditional drilling methods were prevalent up until the 1990s, high crude prices of the 21st Century are encouraging more unconventional methods (such as SAGD) to extract crude oil. The Canadian oil sands have many SAGD projects in progress, since this region is home of one of the largest deposits of bitumen in the world ([[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]] have the world's largest deposits).\n\nThe SAGD process allowed the [[Ministry of Energy (Alberta)|Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)]] to increase its proven [[oil reserves]] to 179 billion barrels, which raised Canada's oil reserves to the third highest in the world after [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and approximately quadrupled North American oil reserves.

Historically, [[natural gas]] has been used as a fuel for Canadian oil sands projects, due to the presence of large [[stranded gas reserve]]s in the oil sands area. However, with the building of natural gas pipelines to outside markets in Canada and the United States, the price of gas has become an important consideration. The fact that natural gas production in Canada has peaked and is now declining is also a problem. Other sources of generating heat are under consideration, notably gasification of the heavy fractions of the produced bitumen to produce [[syngas]], using the nearby (and massive) deposits of [[coal]], or even building [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]] to produce the heat.\n\n=== Use of water for steam generation ===\n\nA source of large amounts of fresh and brackish water and large water re-cycling facilities are required in order to create the steam for the SAGD process. Water is a popular topic for debate in regards to water use and management. As of 2008, American petroleum production (not limited to SAGD) generates over 5 billion gallons of produced water every day.<ref>Ralph M.

Traditionally close to 70 million cubic metres of the water volume that was used in the SAGD process was fresh, surface, water. There has been a significant reduction in fresh water use as of 2010, when approximately 18 million cubic metres were used. Though to offset the drastic reduction in fresh water use, industry has begun to significantly increase the volume of saline [[groundwater]] involved.  This, as well as other, more general water saving techniques have allowed surface water usage by oil sands operations to decrease by more than threefold since production first began.<ref>{{cite web|title=Volume and Quality of Water used in Oil and Gas 1976-2010|url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=4 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209182743/http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|archive-date=2011-12-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nRelying upon gravity drainage, SAGD also requires comparatively thick and homogeneous reservoirs, and so is not suitable for all heavy-oil production areas.\n\n== Alternative methods ==\n\nBy 2009 the two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes, Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS), were used in oil sands production in the [[Clearwater Formation|Clearwater]] and [[Lower Grand Rapids Formation]]s in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta.<ref name=\"OSUM2009Jiang\" />\n\n=== Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) ===\n\n[[Canadian Natural Resources]] employs cyclic steam or \"huff and puff\" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection to fracture and heat the formation prior to the production phases. First steam is injected above the formation fracture point for several weeks or months, mobilizing cold bitumen, the well is then shut in for several weeks or months to allow the steam to soak into the formation. Then the flow on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir.<ref name=\"CNRL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|publisher=CNRL|year=2013|title=Cyclic Steam Stimulation|series=Thermal in situ oil sands|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016105950/http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|archivedate=2015-10-16}}</ref> Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) also has a number of CSS Follow-up or Enhancement Processes, including Pressure Up and Blow Down (PUBD), Mixed Well Steam Drive and Drainage (MWSDD), Vapor Extraction (Vapex), Liquid Addition to Steam for Enhanced Recovery of Bitumen (LASER) and HPCSS Assisted SAGD and Hybrid Process.<ref name=\"OSUM2009Jiang\" />\n\n=== High pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) ===\n\n\"Roughly 35 per cent of all ''in situ'' production in the Alberta oil sands uses a technique called High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS), which cycles between two phases: first, steam is injected into an underground oil sands deposit to fracture and heat the formation to soften the bitumen just like CSS does, excepting at even higher pressures; then, the cycle switches to production where the resulting hot mixture of bitumen and steam (called a \u201cbitumen emulsion\u201d) is pumped up to the surface through the same well, again just like CSS, until the resulting pressure drop slows production to an uneconomical stage. The process is then repeated multiple times. \"<ref name=\"SeversonBaker29Jul2013\">{{cite web|title=Cold Lake bitumen blowout first test for new energy regulator|author=Chris Severson-Baker|date=29 July 2013|url=http://www.pembina.org/blog/741}}</ref> An [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] (AER) news release explained the difference between high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). \"HPCSS has been used in oil recovery in Alberta for more than 30 years.

The upper well injects steam, and the lower one collects the heated [[Petroleum|crude oil]] or bitumen that flows down due to gravity, plus recovered water from the condensation of the injected steam. The basis of the SAGD process is that thermal communication is established with the reservoir so that the injected steam forms a \"steam chamber\". The heat from the steam reduces the [[viscosity]] of the heavy crude oil or bitumen which allows it to flow down into the lower wellbore. The steam and associated gas rise because of their low density compared to the heavy crude oil below, ensuring that steam is not produced at the lower production well, tend to rise in the steam chamber, filling the void space left by the oil. Associated gas forms, to a certain extent, an insulating heat blanket above (and around) the steam.<ref name=\"Holdaway_2014\">{{citation |title=Harness Oil and Gas Big Data with Analytics: Optimize Exploration and Production with Data Driven Models |first=Keith |last=Holdaway |work=Wiley |date=13 May 2014  |accessdate=3 February 2014 |isbn=1118910958 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zXaVAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA155&lpg=PA155&dq=Oil+and+water+flow+is+by+a+countercurrent,+gravity+driven+drainage+into+the+lower+well+bore.+The+condensed+water+and&source=bl&ots=TE27OxNN7W&sig=AzqWxxf0GAhoRBTj8B99CYBwKhA&hl=en&sa=X&ei=JDDSVIycCM7HsQTJv4KADg&ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ}}</ref> Oil and water flow is by a countercurrent, gravity driven drainage into the lower well bore.

The higher the liquid level above the producer the lower the temperature and higher is the sub-cool. However real life reservoirs are invariably heterogeneous therefore it becomes extremely difficult to achieve a uniform sub-cool along the entire horizontal length of a well. As a consequence many operators, when faced with uneven stunted steam chamber development, allow a small quantity of steam to enter into the producer to keep the bitumen in the entire wellbore hot hence keeping its viscosity low with the added benefit of transferring heat to colder parts of the reservoir along the wellbore. Another variation sometimes called Partial SAGD is used when operators deliberately circulate steam in the producer following a long shut-in period or as a startup procedure. Though a high value of sub-cool is desirable from a thermal efficiency standpoint as it generally includes reduction of steam injection rates but it also results in slightly reduced production due to a corresponding higher viscosity and lower mobility of bitumen caused by lower temperature. Another drawback of very high sub-cool is the possibility of steam pressure eventually not being enough to sustain steam chamber development above the injector, sometimes resulting in collapsed steam chambers where condensed steam floods the injector and precludes further development of the chamber.\n\nContinuous operation of the injection and production wells at approximately reservoir pressure eliminates the instability problems that plague all high-pressure and cyclic steam processes and SAGD produces a smooth, even production that can be as high as 70% to 80% of oil in place in suitable reservoirs. The process is relatively insensitive to shale streaks and other vertical barriers to steam and fluid flow because, as the rock is heated, differential thermal expansion allows steam and fluids to gravity flow through to the production well. This allows recovery rates of 60% to 70% of oil in place, even in formations with many thin shale barriers. Thermally, SAGD is generally twice as efficient as the older cyclic steam stimulation (CSS) process, and it results in far fewer wells being damaged by the high pressures associated with CSS.

The concept coincided with development of directional drilling techniques that allowed companies to drill horizontal wells accurately, cheaply and efficiently, to the point that it became hard to justify drilling a conventional vertical well any more. With the low cost of drilling horizontal well pairs, and the very high [[peak oil|recovery rates]] of the SAGD process (up to 60% of the oil in place), SAGD is economically attractive to oil companies.\n\nAt Foster Creek Cenovus has employed its patented<ref>http://www.ic.gc.ca/opic-cipo/cpd/eng/patent/2591498/summary.html?query=cenovus&start=1&num=50&type=basic_search</ref> 'wedge well' technology to recover residual resources bypassed by regular SAGD operations, this improves the total recovery rate of the operation. The 'wedge well' technology works by accessing the residual bitumen that is bypassed in regular SAGD operations by drilling an infill well between two established operating SAGD well pairs once the SAGD steam chambers have matured to the point where they have merged and are in fluid communication and then what is left to recover in that reservoir area between the operating SAGD well pairs is a 'wedge' of residual, bypassed oil. Wedge well technology has been shown to improve overall recovery rates by 5%-10% at a reduced capital cost as less steam is required once the steam chambers mature to the point where they are in fluid communication and typically at this stage in the recovery process, also commonly known as the 'blow down' phase<ref>https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-165481-MS</ref>, the injected steam is replaced with a non-condensable gas such as methane, further reducing production costs.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2011AthabascaCenovusFosterCreekSAGD8623.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140226022653/http://www.aer.ca/documents/oilsands/insitu-presentations/2011AthabascaCenovusFosterCreekSAGD8623.pdf |archive-date=2014-02-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Current applications ==\n\nThis technology is now being exploited due to [[2000s energy crisis|increased oil prices]]. While traditional drilling methods were prevalent up until the 1990s, high crude prices of the 21st Century are encouraging more unconventional methods (such as SAGD) to extract crude oil. The Canadian oil sands have many SAGD projects in progress, since this region is home of one of the largest deposits of bitumen in the world ([[Canada]] and [[Venezuela]] have the world's largest deposits).\n\nThe SAGD process allowed the [[Ministry of Energy (Alberta)|Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (ERCB)]] to increase its proven [[oil reserves]] to 179 billion barrels, which raised Canada's oil reserves to the third highest in the world after [[Venezuela]] and [[Saudi Arabia]] and approximately quadrupled North American oil reserves. As of 2011, the oil sands reserves stand at around 169 billion barrels.\n\n== Disadvantages ==\n\n=== Oil and water nexus ===\n\nSAGD, a thermal recovery process, consumes large quantities of water and natural gas.<ref name=\"GlassmanMar2011\" />{{rp|4}}\n{{quote|\"Petroleum from the Canadian oil sands extracted via surface mining techniques can consume 20 times more water than conventional oil drilling.

Historically, [[natural gas]] has been used as a fuel for Canadian oil sands projects, due to the presence of large [[stranded gas reserve]]s in the oil sands area. However, with the building of natural gas pipelines to outside markets in Canada and the United States, the price of gas has become an important consideration. The fact that natural gas production in Canada has peaked and is now declining is also a problem. Other sources of generating heat are under consideration, notably gasification of the heavy fractions of the produced bitumen to produce [[syngas]], using the nearby (and massive) deposits of [[coal]], or even building [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactors]] to produce the heat.\n\n=== Use of water for steam generation ===\n\nA source of large amounts of fresh and brackish water and large water re-cycling facilities are required in order to create the steam for the SAGD process. Water is a popular topic for debate in regards to water use and management. As of 2008, American petroleum production (not limited to SAGD) generates over 5 billion gallons of produced water every day.<ref>Ralph M.

Traditionally close to 70 million cubic metres of the water volume that was used in the SAGD process was fresh, surface, water. There has been a significant reduction in fresh water use as of 2010, when approximately 18 million cubic metres were used. Though to offset the drastic reduction in fresh water use, industry has begun to significantly increase the volume of saline [[groundwater]] involved.  This, as well as other, more general water saving techniques have allowed surface water usage by oil sands operations to decrease by more than threefold since production first began.<ref>{{cite web|title=Volume and Quality of Water used in Oil and Gas 1976-2010|url=http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=4 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209182743/http://environment.alberta.ca/01729.html|archive-date=2011-12-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nRelying upon gravity drainage, SAGD also requires comparatively thick and homogeneous reservoirs, and so is not suitable for all heavy-oil production areas.\n\n== Alternative methods ==\n\nBy 2009 the two commercially applied primal thermal recovery processes, Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD) and Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS), were used in oil sands production in the [[Clearwater Formation|Clearwater]] and [[Lower Grand Rapids Formation]]s in the Cold Lake Area in Alberta.<ref name=\"OSUM2009Jiang\" />\n\n=== Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) ===\n\n[[Canadian Natural Resources]] employs cyclic steam or \"huff and puff\" technology to develop bitumen resources. This technology requires one well bore and the production consists of the injection to fracture and heat the formation prior to the production phases. First steam is injected above the formation fracture point for several weeks or months, mobilizing cold bitumen, the well is then shut in for several weeks or months to allow the steam to soak into the formation. Then the flow on the injection well is reversed producing oil through the same injection well bore. The injection and production phases together comprise one cycle. Steam is re-injected to begin a new cycle when oil production rates fall below a critical threshold due to the cooling of the reservoir.<ref name=\"CNRL\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|publisher=CNRL|year=2013|title=Cyclic Steam Stimulation|series=Thermal in situ oil sands|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016105950/http://www.cnrl.com/operations/north-america/north-american-crude-oil-and-ngls/thermal-insitu-oilsands/|archivedate=2015-10-16}}</ref> Cyclic Steam Stimulation (CSS) also has a number of CSS Follow-up or Enhancement Processes, including Pressure Up and Blow Down (PUBD), Mixed Well Steam Drive and Drainage (MWSDD), Vapor Extraction (Vapex), Liquid Addition to Steam for Enhanced Recovery of Bitumen (LASER) and HPCSS Assisted SAGD and Hybrid Process.<ref name=\"OSUM2009Jiang\" />\n\n=== High pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) ===\n\n\"Roughly 35 per cent of all ''in situ'' production in the Alberta oil sands uses a technique called High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS), which cycles between two phases: first, steam is injected into an underground oil sands deposit to fracture and heat the formation to soften the bitumen just like CSS does, excepting at even higher pressures; then, the cycle switches to production where the resulting hot mixture of bitumen and steam (called a \u201cbitumen emulsion\u201d) is pumped up to the surface through the same well, again just like CSS, until the resulting pressure drop slows production to an uneconomical stage. The process is then repeated multiple times. \"<ref name=\"SeversonBaker29Jul2013\">{{cite web|title=Cold Lake bitumen blowout first test for new energy regulator|author=Chris Severson-Baker|date=29 July 2013|url=http://www.pembina.org/blog/741}}</ref> An [[Alberta Energy Regulator]] (AER) news release explained the difference between high pressure cyclic steam stimulation (HPCSS) and steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD). \"HPCSS has been used in oil recovery in Alberta for more than 30 years. The method involves injecting high-pressure steam, well above the ambient reservoir pressure, into a reservoir over a prolonged period of time. As heat softens the bitumen and water dilutes and separates the bitumen from the sand, the pressure creates fractures, cracks and openings through which the bitumen can flow back into the steam-injector wells. HPCSS differs from steam assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) operations where steam is continuously injected at lower pressures without fracturing the reservoir and uses gravity drainage as the primary recovery mechanism. \"<ref name=\"AER18jul2013\">{{cite news|url=http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|title=Alberta Energy Regulator orders enhanced monitoring and further steaming restrictions at Primrose and Wolf Lake projects due to bitumen emulsion releases|date=18 July 2013|publisher=AER|access-date=2013-07-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730233259/http://www.aer.ca/about-aer/media-centre/news-releases/3632|archive-date=2013-07-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the Clearwater Formation near Cold Lake, Alberta the High Pressure Cyclic Steam Stimulation (HPCSS) is used.<ref name=\"OSUM2009Jiang\" /> There are both horizontal and vertical wells.

They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare.

Plant matter & Fish Teeth have been found here.]]\nThe Ciechocinek is composed mostly by muds and silts, along with poorly consolidated [[Mudstone]]s and [[Siltstone]]s with lenses and subordinate intercalations of fine-grained sandy lenses, typically from 1 mm to less 20 cm thick, extended a few meters, along also with sandstones. Diagenetic [[Siderite]] intercalations and concretions, ~20 cm thick, as well as [[Pyrite]] concretions are also present.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The mineralization \nof Siderite occurs in all types of Ciechocinek Formation deposits. Include fine crystalline variety, coarse crystalline rhombohedra and fine crystalline aggregates impregnated by mixture of un de termined Fehydroxides.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> The mineralization of the siedrites on certain layers is associated to the abundance of organic matter, with the deacay of it ending on a progressive carbonate supersaturation, with an early precipitation on the nucleous of the siderites. They reflect also the conditions of salinity on the water, showing alternances in short periods, associated with the abundance of organic matter.<ref name=\"Leonowicz0\"/> Muds and mudstones consist mainly of particles with the size of common clay, some with admixture of silt; sandy muds and mudstones are also encountered in counterpart to thepure clays and claystones, without admixtures of other fractions, that are from rare o extremely rare. Mudstones are porrly consolidated, tren to disintegration, swell and become plastic, being the only exceptional ones those the heavy sideritic mudstones, that range froma wide variety of colors, from  brown or cherry-red in colour, with an olive shade often appearing.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> On the other hand, there are abundant poorly consolidated [[Quartz]] sandstones, that are regularly intercalated with [[Silt]] and [[Siltstone]].<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Along the Sandstones, there are [[Chlorite]] and [[Kaolinite]] grains. Plant microremains are common, concentrated with mica flakes on lamination planes, while larger wood fragments, several cm long, are also moderately frequent.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> Heavy minerals are present and include as the most common [[Euhedral]] forms such as [[Zircon]], [[Rutile]] and [[Tourmaline]], along with angular fragments of [[Rutile]], [[Garnet]] and [[Staurolite]], with finally well-rounded oval grains of Zircon, Rutile, Garnet and Tourmaline. Outside the main heavy minerals, it is possible to find well-rounded grains of green [[Hornblende]], [[Apatite]], [[Disthene]], [[Epidote]], and finally on one study one [[Pyroxene]] grain was found.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> The presence of [[Kaolinite]], related to continental formation in tropical climate environments for the chemical weathering of different igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks, along with [[Chlorite]] & [[Biotite]], suggest a deposition linked to fluvial & deltaic forces. The eastern Sudetes and their foreland are the best candidates for be the origin of the transported material, as they have a nearly identical composition, being the Lower Jurassic deposits in the [[Fore-Sudetic Monocline]] linked [[Cracow-Cz\u00eastochowa Monocline]], with the strata of the Formation.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/> \n\n===Stratigraphy===\n[[File:Wapienno - kamienio\u0142omy Cementowni Kujawy - Lafarge Cement 2009.JPG|thumb|250px|left|[[Wapienno]] Cement Quarry, with exposed strata of the Formation.]]\nDeposits of the Ciechocinek Formation are related to a brackish-marine origin, being  deposited in an epicontinental sedimentary basin on Poland, that was the eastern arm of the Mid-European [[Toarcian]] Basin.<ref name=\"Leonowicz\"/>  The main component of the deposits are muds,  intercalate sandstones & silts disposed on a high variety of structures, with at least twelve lithofacies that run from fine-grained sedimentations to wave dominated [[Sandy Shoal]]s. It is believed that the dominat sedimentation was by quiet [[Mud]] and silt sedimentation from suspension, which probably come from near [[River Mouths]].  It was a sedimentary basin with a continuous influx of [[Clay]] and fine [[Silt]], to which sand was brought by events such as river transportation, storms, eustatic effects, and other related.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\">Leonowicz, P.

Acta Geologica Polonica, 61(2), 215-241.</ref> There is a detailed succession of changes in the strata with time, where the location of the river mouths shifted because of effects such as the progradation of deltas, the stop of the flux of river channels and the long-lasting esutatic sea-level changes, all of that can be confirmed by the presence of microstructures as result of erosion and cross lamination in the mud-silt facies.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> A [[Marine Transgression]] correlated to the rise of the sea level on the Lower Toarcian is crearly visible on the [[Silesian-Cracow]] area, where the sea encroached the [[Polish Trough]], which resulted in the end of the [[Pliensbachian]] alluvial sedimentation, that can be observed on the underliying [[Blanowice Formation]]. The presence of alluvial sedimentation still on the nearshore environments, as an effect probably related to Floods.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On some layers \nis observed that the chemistry of the sea water was changing as the deposition continue on the most recent layers of the Ciechocinek Formation, impliying the possible formation of a brackish environment, probably due to the sedimentation of fluvial currents. Mostly of the Invertebrate traces reported from the formation, come from this layers.<ref name=\"Leonowicz1\"/> On the upper levels of the formation there is a clear change in the sedimentation: a sea regression with a paulatine alluvial progradation.
