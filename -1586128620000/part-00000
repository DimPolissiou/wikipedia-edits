Although it did not sell, it caught the attention of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] programming executive. He met with Thomas, and expressed interest in casting her in her own series. With their encouragement, Thomas came up with her own idea for a show about a young woman who leaves home, moves to New York City, and struggles to become an actress. The network was initially hesitant, fearing audiences would find a series centering on a single female uninteresting or unrealistic.\n\nThe concept eventually evolved into the sitcom entitled ''[[That Girl]]'', in which Thomas played Ann Marie, a beautiful, up-and-coming actress with a writer boyfriend, played by [[Ted Bessell]]. The series told the daily struggles of Ann holding different temporary jobs while pursuing her dream of a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. ''That Girl'' was one of the first television shows to focus on a working, single woman who did not live with her parents, and it paved the way for many shows to come. Thomas was only the second woman to produce her own series, following [[Lucille Ball]]. ''That Girl'' aired from 1966 to 1971, producing 136 episodes, and was a solid performer in the [[Nielsen ratings]].\n\nIn 1971, Thomas chose to end the series after five years. Both ABC and the show's sponsor, [[Clairol]], wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters, but Thomas rebuffed them, saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience, because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is [[marriage]].

Although it did not sell, it caught the attention of an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] programming executive. He met with Thomas, and expressed interest in casting her in her own series. With their encouragement, Thomas came up with her own idea for a show about a young woman who leaves home, moves to New York City, and struggles to become an actress. The network was initially hesitant, fearing audiences would find a series centering on a single female uninteresting or unrealistic.\n\nThe concept eventually evolved into the sitcom entitled ''[[That Girl]]'', in which Thomas played Ann Marie, a beautiful, up-and-coming actress with a writer boyfriend, played by [[Ted Bessell]]. The series told the daily struggles of Ann holding different temporary jobs while pursuing her dream of a career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. ''That Girl'' was one of the first television shows to focus on a working, single woman who did not live with her parents, and it paved the way for many shows to come. Thomas was only the second woman to produce her own series, following [[Lucille Ball]]. ''That Girl'' aired from 1966 to 1971, producing 136 episodes, and was a solid performer in the [[Nielsen ratings]].\n\nIn 1971, Thomas chose to end the series after five years. Both ABC and the show's sponsor, [[Clairol]], wanted the series finale to be a wedding between the two central characters, but Thomas rebuffed them, saying that she felt it was the wrong message to send to her female audience, because it would give the impression that the only happy ending is [[marriage]].

Its north side, facing the lane which rises from Flixton village, is the broadest section, between 15 and 20 metres across, and some 110 metres long. At the north-west corner, where there is a short outer spur, it turns firmly to the south for about 30 metres and there ends. From the north-east corner the channel (about 10 metres breadth) turns squarely southwards for about 140 metres, skirted by the farm track leading to Abbey Farm, before swinging round to the south-west (where the path forks) for about 100 metres, and then looping back to the north-west for about 35 metres. It ends with a baulk separating it from a small pond. Between this point and the terminal of the northern arm of the moat is a gap of about 72 metres, leaving the enclosure open on most of its west side. This may have been the priory entrance area. Within the southern arms of the moat is a pond about 35 metres long, with signs of another adjacent, fed by sluice from the moat: these are thought to be the priory fishpools.<ref>'Moated site of Flixton Priory', List entry summary [https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1018268 1018268] (Historic England).</ref>\n\n===The buildings===\n[[File:Flixton Priory, Suffolk, standing wall.jpg|left|thumb|The standing ruin: part of the south wall of the priory south range]]\nThe priory buildings stood centrally within the moated precinct. The present farmhouse, aligned west and east, stands on or near the site of the priory church, and includes some rubble-built masonry with freestone quoins at its south-east corner. The cloister was on its south side, and the footings of the western range can be traced running north and south in line with the western end of the farmhouse. The position of the south range is shown both by its buried footings and from a central section of its outer (south) wall which still stands to full height with a single window opening. Although this window has a late, shallow arch, the surrounding masonry contains traces of arched windows of earlier type with stone tracery. This range was probably the nuns' refectory. The distance from this wall to the south wall of the farmhouse (comprising the width of the south range, the cloister, and possibly part of the church nave) is 37 yards.

There were now eight nuns, of whom only Alicia Laxfield might remember the visitation of 1493. Isabella Asshe stated that for three days a week they were fed only on bread and cheese, and the rule of silence was not observed. The prioress, Margaret Punder, said that some of the sisters were not obedient. Margaret Olton complained of the meagre diet, and said the prioress diverted alms to her own use, did not pay the annual allowances, and did not render accounts, becoming angry if anyone gave them anything. Discipline was not kept, said Elizabeth Wright, and some sisters (especially Elisabeth Asshe and Margaret Rowse) sometimes failed to rise for morning prayer: but the prioress did not support the senior sisters, and was so severe that they scarcely dared to complain. Three said she was keeping frequent company with one John Welles, her kinsman, and one added that she had bought a place in the parish and often met him there. The bishop banished him from the parish completely and forbade him ever to meet her again.<ref>Jessopp, ''Visitations'', [https://archive.org/stream/visitationsofdio00cathrich#page/142/mode/2up pp. 142-44] & xliii-xliv.

The prioress complained that Margaret was disobedient: Margaret replied that her allowance, her provisions and winter fuel were withheld. The sisters, including Alicia Laxfield, all objected that no special consideration was made when they were ill. The Visitor broke off his inspection and a week later the Chancellor of the Diocese returned to continue. Margaret repeated her complaints, adding that the prioress often slept away from the common dormitory in her own bedroom, without the presence of a sister as chaplain; and that as this was against the rule of their religion, she would not obey her. The others kept quiet apart from Isabella Asshe, who mentioned the meagre fare and said the prioress was meeting with a servant Richard Carr at suspicious times. The prioress was told she must keep only one of her dogs, to have a female chaplain with her when sleeping alone, and to present the accounts, on pain of dismissal: Richard Carr was to be sent away.<ref>Jessopp, ''Visitations'', [https://archive.org/stream/visitationsofdio00cathrich#page/184/mode/2up pp. 185-91] (Internet Archive).</ref><ref>E.

Elizabeth Wright, prioress, Margaret Olton, sub-prioress, Alicia Laxfield, [[sacristan]], Agnes Asshe, [[precentor]] and Margaret Rouse, infirmarer, were all present, with two new admissions: Margaret Punder was also still there, and knew of nothing needing reform, but as ex-prioress had drawn herself apart from the obedientiary offices (\"non est de gremio\").<ref>Jessopp, ''Visitations'', [https://archive.org/stream/visitationsofdio00cathrich#page/318/mode/2up pp. 318-19] (Internet Archive).</ref>\n\nIt was therefore under the [[Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535]], enacted in February 1535/36, that the priory, with possessions falling far below the annual value of \u00a3200, was closed.

The Buttery utensils were mainly pewter plates and dishes, basins and ewers, and the furniture was very simple. The livestock included 6 kine, 5 horses, 10 pigs and 10 sheep, and there were 10 loads of hay and 10 acres each of corn and of barley.

Its north side, facing the lane which rises from Flixton village, is the broadest section, between 15 and 20 metres across, and some 110 metres long. At the north-west corner, where there is a short outer spur, it turns firmly to the south for about 30 metres and there ends. From the north-east corner the channel (about 10 metres breadth) turns squarely southwards for about 140 metres, skirted by the farm track leading to Abbey Farm, before swinging round to the south-west (where the path forks) for about 100 metres, and then looping back to the north-west for about 35 metres. It ends with a baulk separating it from a small pond. Between this point and the terminal of the northern arm of the moat is a gap of about 72 metres, leaving the enclosure open on most of its west side. This may have been the priory entrance area. Within the southern arms of the moat is a pond about 35 metres long, with signs of another adjacent, fed by sluice from the moat: these are thought to be the priory fishpools.<ref>'Moated site of Flixton Priory', List entry summary [https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1018268 1018268] (Historic England).</ref>\n\n===The buildings===\n[[File:Flixton Priory, Suffolk, standing wall.jpg|left|thumb|The standing ruin: part of the south wall of the priory south range]]\nThe priory buildings stood centrally within the moated precinct. The present farmhouse, aligned west and east, stands on or near the site of the priory church, and includes some rubble-built masonry with freestone quoins at its south-east corner. The cloister was on its south side, and the footings of the western range can be traced running north and south in line with the western end of the farmhouse. The position of the south range is shown both by its buried footings and from a central section of its outer (south) wall which still stands to full height with a single window opening. Although this window has a late, shallow arch, the surrounding masonry contains traces of arched windows of earlier type with stone tracery. This range was probably the nuns' refectory. The distance from this wall to the south wall of the farmhouse (comprising the width of the south range, the cloister, and possibly part of the church nave) is 37 yards.

There were now eight nuns, of whom only Alicia Laxfield might remember the visitation of 1493. Isabella Asshe stated that for three days a week they were fed only on bread and cheese, and the rule of silence was not observed. The prioress, Margaret Punder, said that some of the sisters were not obedient. Margaret Olton complained of the meagre diet, and said the prioress diverted alms to her own use, did not pay the annual allowances, and did not render accounts, becoming angry if anyone gave them anything. Discipline was not kept, said Elizabeth Wright, and some sisters (especially Elisabeth Asshe and Margaret Rowse) sometimes failed to rise for morning prayer: but the prioress did not support the senior sisters, and was so severe that they scarcely dared to complain. Three said she was keeping frequent company with one John Welles, her kinsman, and one added that she had bought a place in the parish and often met him there. The bishop banished him from the parish completely and forbade him ever to meet her again.<ref>Jessopp, ''Visitations'', [https://archive.org/stream/visitationsofdio00cathrich#page/142/mode/2up pp. 142-44] & xliii-xliv. (Internet Archive).</ref>\n\nBy 1520 Margaret Punder had resigned as prioress, and the community of seven (mostly as before) was now led by Alicia (probably ''Elizabeth'') Wright, who kept a number of dogs. The prioress complained that Margaret was disobedient: Margaret replied that her allowance, her provisions and winter fuel were withheld. The sisters, including Alicia Laxfield, all objected that no special consideration was made when they were ill. The Visitor broke off his inspection and a week later the Chancellor of the Diocese returned to continue. Margaret repeated her complaints, adding that the prioress often slept away from the common dormitory in her own bedroom, without the presence of a sister as chaplain; and that as this was against the rule of their religion, she would not obey her. The others kept quiet apart from Isabella Asshe, who mentioned the meagre fare and said the prioress was meeting with a servant Richard Carr at suspicious times. The prioress was told she must keep only one of her dogs, to have a female chaplain with her when sleeping alone, and to present the accounts, on pain of dismissal: Richard Carr was to be sent away.<ref>Jessopp, ''Visitations'', [https://archive.org/stream/visitationsofdio00cathrich#page/184/mode/2up pp. 185-91] (Internet Archive).</ref><ref>E.

In 1532 Master Miles Spencer, [[Commissary]] of Norwich, found the priory all in order with no complaints. Elizabeth Wright, prioress, Margaret Olton, sub-prioress, Alicia Laxfield, [[sacristan]], Agnes Asshe, [[precentor]] and Margaret Rouse, infirmarer, were all present, with two new admissions: Margaret Punder was also still there, and knew of nothing needing reform, but as ex-prioress had drawn herself apart from the obedientiary offices (\"non est de gremio\").<ref>Jessopp, ''Visitations'', [https://archive.org/stream/visitationsofdio00cathrich#page/318/mode/2up pp. 318-19] (Internet Archive).</ref>\n\nIt was therefore under the [[Suppression of Religious Houses Act 1535]], enacted in February 1535/36, that the priory, with possessions falling far below the annual value of \u00a3200, was closed. The commissioners making the inventory in August 1536 found a great quantity of vestments and altar cloths. \"An old vestement of redde and Green sylke with Swannes of Golde\", and \"an olde vestemente of redde sylke with Cranes of whight\" are evocative. There was a fair amount of plate both for the altar and for the table, including the [[parcel-gilt]] silver altar cross with figures of St Mary and St John, cruets, two chalices, three [[mazer (drinking vessel)|mazers]], eight silver spoons, a salt with cover, and a silver goblet. The Buttery utensils were mainly pewter plates and dishes, basins and ewers, and the furniture was very simple. The livestock included 6 kine, 5 horses, 10 pigs and 10 sheep, and there were 10 loads of hay and 10 acres each of corn and of barley. Most of the bedding was very old and little worth, and the kitchen vessels are described as \"trasshe\".<ref>F.
