After reviewing and discussing the existing data on the disease, the committee stated that universal PCR testing was impossible due to a shortage of testing facilities and providers, and recommended that the government instead limit the application of available test kits to patients that are at a high risk of complications in order to stockpile for a large cluster.&nbsp; Participants also noted that Japan's medical facilities are vulnerable to \"chaos,\" elaborating that several of the hospital beds and resources in the Tokyo area are already preoccupied with caring for the surge of 700 infected patients from the ''Diamond Princess''. They reiterated their warning that a rush of alarmed uninfected outpatients with light symptoms of the disease could overwhelm hospitals and turn waiting rooms into \"breeding grounds\" of COVID-19.<ref name=\"nippon1\">[https://www.nippon.com/en/news/l00269/coronavirus-basic-policy-impacts-japan%e2%80%99s-health-education-systems.html?cx_recs_click=true \"Coronavirus Basic Policy Impacts Japan\u2019s Health, Education Systems\"]. Nippon.com, 2 March 2020</ref>\n\nOn 25 February, the Abe Administration adopted the \"Basic Policies for Novel Coronavirus Disease Control\" based on the advice that it received from the Expert Meeting.\n\nFirst, the new policies advised local medical institutions that it is better for people with lighter, cold-like symptoms to rely on bed rest at home, rather than seeking medical help from clinics or hospitals. The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April. The next day, the Japanese government announced plans to create a fund to help companies subsidize workers who need to take days off to look after their children while schools are closed.<ref>[https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/japan-to-create-fund-to-subsidize-parents-during-school-closure-nikkei \"Japan to create fund to subsidize parents during school closure-Nikkei\"].

Consequently, the participants asked the government to remain vigilant in quickly identifying and containing smaller clusters.

This policy prioritized the creation of a COVID-19 testing and consultation system based on the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID) and the government's existing 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that is separate from the civilian hospital system.  The new system handles the transfer of COVID-19 patients to mainstream medical facilities to facilitate patient flow, triage, and the management of limited testing kits on their behalf to prevent a rush of infected and uninfected patients from overwhelming healthcare providers and transmitting diseases to them.  By regulating COVID-19 testing at the national level, the Abe Administration integrated the activities of the national government, the local governments, medical professionals, business operators, and the public in treating the disease.\n\nOn 1 February, the [[Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare]] instructed the municipal and prefectural governments to establish specialized COVID-19 consultation centres and outpatient wards at their local public health facilities by the first half of the month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/articles/20200203/k00/00m/040/227000c|script-title=ja:\u65b0\u578b\u80ba\u708e\u300c\u5e30\u56fd\u8005\u30fb\u63a5\u89e6\u8005\u76f8\u8ac7\u30bb\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc\u300d\u8a2d\u7f6e\u3078 \u5c02\u9580\u5916\u6765\u3078\u306e\u53d7\u8a3a\u3092\u4fc3\u3059|last=|first=|date=2020-02-03|work=[[Mainichi]] |language=ja|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-09}}</ref>  Such wards would provide medical examinations and testing for suspected carriers of the disease to protect general hospitals from infection.\n\nOn 5 February, PM Abe announced during the Fifth Meeting of the Novel Coronavirus Response Headquarters that the government would begin preparations to strengthen COVID-19 testing capabilities at the NIID and 83 municipal and prefectural public health institutions that are designated by the government as official testing sites.  Without any uniform diagnosis kit for the disease, the government has relied on [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests to check for infections.

The policy also recommends people at a higher risk of infection -including the elderly and patients with pre-existing conditions \u2013 to avoid hospital visits for such non-treatment purposes as completing prescription orders by letting them fill the forms over the telephone instead of in person.<ref name=\"nippon1\" />\n\nSecond, the new policies allow general medical facilities in areas of a rapid COVID-19 outbreak to accept patients suspected of infection. Before this, patients could only get tested at specialized clinics after making an appointment with consultation centres to prevent the transmission of the disease. Government officials revised the previous policy after acknowledging that such specialized institutions would be overwhelmed during a large cluster.\n\nThird, the policy asks those with any cold symptoms to take time off from work and avoid leaving their homes. Government officials urged companies to let employees work from home and commute at off-peak hours. The Japanese government also made an official request to local governments and businesses to cancel large-scale events.\n\nOn 27 February, PM Abe requested the closures of all schools from 2 March to the end of spring vacations, which usually conclude in early April.

In 1545 [[St. Francis Xavier]], sent a letter to [[John III of Portugal]], requesting an [[Goa Inquisition|Inquisition]] to be installed in Goa. The inquisitor's first act was to forbid any open practice of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] faith on pain of death. The Portuguese colonial administration enacted anti-Hindu laws to encourage conversions to [[Christianity]]. Prohibition was laid upon Hindu rituals as well. In all, over 42 Hindu practices were prohibited. All the people above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching or otherwise be punished. Several Hindu temples were destroyed as well. An order was issued for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak the Portuguese language. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the non-Christian cultural symbols and the books written in local languages were sought out to be destroyed. In the first hundred years, the Inquisition burned 57 alive at the stake and 64 in effigy. Others were sentenced to various punishments, totalling 4,046. The Kudumbi were forced to migrate from Goa following religious persecution by the Portuguese during the said infamous [[Goa Inquisition]]. The Kudumbis, along with [[Gouda Saraswat Brahmins]] (Malayalam: \u0d17\u0d4c\u0d21\u0d4d \u0d38\u0d3e\u0d30\u0d38\u0d4d\u0d35\u0d24\u0d4d), [[Daivajna]]s and [[Vaishya Vani]]s who wanted to preserve their religious and cultural identity, migrated from Goa along the west coast of India, primarily through sea voyages.\n\nSome of the groups that fled Goa landed in coastal districts of state of [[Karnataka]], that is, the Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts, and some groups voyaged further to [[Kerala]].<ref>''Tribal Tradition and Change: A study of Kudubis of South India'', by Dr. Y Ravindranath Rao.</ref><ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Tribal Tradition and Change: A Study of Kudubis of South India|author=Rao, Y.R.|date=2003|publisher=Mangala Publications|isbn=9788188685004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a5M4AAAACAAJ|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"anthropologywa\">{{cite web|url=http://www.anthropologywa.org/iuaes_aas_asaanz_conference2011/0040.html#s1p2|title=IUAES AAS ASAANZ Conference 2011|publisher=anthropologywa.org|accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> One of these first exodus groups landed on the island of [[Cherai]], near [[Paravur Taluk]] in the Ernakulam district of Kerala.

The largest Kudumbi settlement is in [[Vypeen]] near Kochi. They were experts in [[Paddy field|paddy cultivation]], especially in the low-lying fields of the [[Kerala Backwaters]], and they pioneered cultivation of the well-known \"Chettiverippu\" strain of paddy rice, brought from Konkan (ref.

In 1545 [[St. Francis Xavier]], sent a letter to [[John III of Portugal]], requesting an [[Goa Inquisition|Inquisition]] to be installed in Goa. The inquisitor's first act was to forbid any open practice of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] faith on pain of death. The Portuguese colonial administration enacted anti-Hindu laws to encourage conversions to [[Christianity]]. Prohibition was laid upon Hindu rituals as well. In all, over 42 Hindu practices were prohibited. All the people above 15 years of age were compelled to listen to Christian preaching or otherwise be punished. Several Hindu temples were destroyed as well. An order was issued for suppressing the Konkani language and making it compulsory to speak the Portuguese language. The law provided for dealing toughly with anyone using the local language. Following that law all the non-Christian cultural symbols and the books written in local languages were sought out to be destroyed. In the first hundred years, the Inquisition burned 57 alive at the stake and 64 in effigy. Others were sentenced to various punishments, totalling 4,046.

The traditional ''haampu''  (multi-stacked portable brass lamp or a similar stone lamp) found in a number of Kudumbi temples is lit on special ''puja'' days. Votive items made from Aval (puffed rice) or [[beaten rice]] and ''jaggery'' are still offered as ''[[prasadam]]'' in many Kudumbi temples. ''Holi'', the festival of colors, is celebrated in many Devi temples by the Kudumbi. During this festival, \"Kamadeva\" (Bodhan) the symbolic entity of \"Kama\" will be burnt to fire, purifying the life of all who participate in the festival. There will be a procession on the streets where all the participants will be applying colour each other, dancing with songs sung in Kudumbi language. Youngsters and children go in a group, pour yellow water from the pot kept in front of every house, and finally gather at their local ''devili'' temple.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/03/07/stories/2004030702870500.htm|title=The Hindu: Holi, Kerala style|work=The Hindu|accessdate=6 May 2015}}</ref> In the night there will be a special group dance by women (''fuguda'') by gathering in a circle and clapping and doing brisk movements.

Harold is the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018, and the strongest to affect Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015. The seventh named storm of the [[2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season]], as well as the eighth named storm, fourth severe tropical cyclone, and the strongest tropical cyclone of the [[2019\u201320 South Pacific cyclone season]], Harold is the most intense tropical cyclone and the second major tropical cyclone [[Tropical cyclones in 2020|worldwide in 2020]]. \n\nOn April 1, a tropical low formed centered between the [[Solomon Islands]] and the eastern coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The BOM later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and named it ''Harold'' on the same day. The system moved into the Fiji Meteorological Service's area of responsibility on 2 April and began to explosively intensify by April 3, reaching Category 4 status by April 4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png|left|300px}}\nDuring March&nbsp;30 the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to publically monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed along a trough of low pressure about {{convert|440|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} to the north-northeast of [[Port Moresby]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name=\"STWA March 31\">{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 00z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> At this stage, the system was poorly defined and located within a favourable environment for further development with dual-channel outflow, low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"STWA March 31\"/><ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 06z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-eastward and slowly developed. On April 2, the system rapidly organised and strengthened. Later, the system strengthened into a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intenisty scale, and was named Harold. The next day, it moved into the South Pacific.\n\nHarold was a Category&nbsp;1 cyclone on the [[tropical cyclone scales|Australian and Fijian scale]] upon crossing the [[160th meridian east]] into the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre|area of responsibility]] of the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS).<ref>{{cite report|title=Storm Warning Number 4 for Tropical Cyclone Harold |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=April 3, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"WMOFiji\">{{cite web |title=Fiji Meteorological Service |url=https://severeweather.wmo.int/TCFW/13WMO_Workshop2019/02_Fiji.pdf |publisher=World Meteorological Organization |accessdate=April 4, 2020}}</ref> The storm's strongest winds were located to the north of the low-level centre of circulation.

Harold is the first Category 5 severe tropical cyclone to occur in the South Pacific basin since [[Cyclone Gita]] in 2018, and the strongest to affect Vanuatu since [[Cyclone Pam]] in 2015. The seventh named storm of the [[2019\u201320 Australian region cyclone season]], as well as the eighth named storm, fourth severe tropical cyclone, and the strongest tropical cyclone of the [[2019\u201320 South Pacific cyclone season]], Harold is the most intense tropical cyclone and the second major tropical cyclone [[Tropical cyclones in 2020|worldwide in 2020]]. \n\nOn April 1, a tropical low formed centered between the [[Solomon Islands]] and the eastern coast of [[Papua New Guinea]]. The tropical low organised rapidly as it tracked towards the east-southeast over the [[Solomon Sea]], developing tightly curved [[Atmospheric convection|convective]] banding. The BOM later upgraded the tropical low into a Category 1 tropical cyclone, and named it ''Harold'' on the same day. The system moved into the Fiji Meteorological Service's area of responsibility on 2 April and began to explosively intensify by April 3, reaching Category 4 status by April 4 on both scales. The next day, it further strengthened into a Category 5 severe tropical cyclone, the highest rating on the Australian scale.\n\n==Meteorological history==\n{{storm path|Harold 2020 track.png|left|300px}}\nDuring March&nbsp;30 the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center started to publically monitor a tropical disturbance that had developed along a trough of low pressure about {{convert|440|km|mi|round=5|abbr=on}} to the north-northeast of [[Port Moresby]] in [[Papua New Guinea]].<ref name=\"STWA March 31\">{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 00z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> At this stage, the system was poorly defined and located within a favourable environment for further development with dual-channel outflow, low vertical wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of {{convert|29|-|30|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"STWA March 31\"/><ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans March 31, 2020 06z|publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center|date=March 31, 2020}}</ref> Over the next couple of days, the system moved south-eastward and slowly developed.

While at Harvard, Dobbs lived in [[Quincy House (Harvard College)|Quincy House]] and was elected to the [[Owl Club (Harvard)|Owl Club]].\n\nAfter graduating, Dobbs worked for federal [[anti-poverty program]]s in [[Boston]] and Washington, D.C., then returned to Idaho. He briefly attended [[law school]] at the [[University of Idaho College of Law|UI College of Law]] in [[Moscow, Idaho]] and then worked as a [[cash-management]] specialist for [[Union Bank of California]] in Los Angeles.

Bert portrayed a CBS usher on an [[Art Linkletter's House Party]] in 1956. He appeared in the 1961 [[Warner Bros.]] [[Drama (modern genre)|drama]] ''[[Susan Slade]]'', playing [[Troy Donahue]]\u2032s rival for the affections of [[Connie Stevens]]. Convy went on to become a Broadway actor, starring as Perchick in the original cast of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' (1964), appearing in ''[[The Impossible Years]]'' (1965) and creating the role of Cliff Bradshaw in ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' (1966). He also appeared in the [[Roger Corman]] film ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]'', playing Lou Raby, and the soap opera ''[[Love of Life]]'', playing Glenn Hamilton, a rapist.

He soon took the podium himself as host of several game shows, including the fourth edition of ''Password'' (called ''[[Password Plus and Super Password|Super Password]]'') (1984\u20131989) and ''[[Tattletales]]'' (1974\u20131978, 1982\u20131984), for which he was awarded an Emmy Award for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Game Show Host|Best Game Show Host]] in 1977.<ref name=NYTimes_Obit/> In 1979, he appeared on ''[[Password Plus]]'' with fellow celebrity contestants such as [[Elizabeth Montgomery]], [[Carol Burnett]], [[Phyllis Diller]], [[Judy Norton Taylor]], [[Marcia Wallace]] and [[Elaine Joyce]].\n\nConvy and [[Burt Reynolds]] formed their own production company, Burt and Bert Productions, during the 1980s. Their first production was a game show based on ''[[Pictionary]]'' titled ''[[Win, Lose or Draw]]'', which made its debut in 1987 as part of the NBC daytime lineup and in nightly syndication. Convy hosted the syndicated edition of ''Win, Lose or Draw'' for its first two seasons, then left the show to host another of his company's productions, the syndicated ''[[3rd Degree (game show)|3rd Degree]]''.\n\nWhen ''3rd Degree'' went to pilot, [[Peter Marshall (U.S. entertainer)|Peter Marshall]] was brought in to be the host. When the series was picked up for syndication, however, Convy decided to leave his position as the host of the syndicated edition of ''Win, Lose or Draw'' and take Marshall's place on ''3rd Degree''. Marshall filed a lawsuit against Convy for the action, but later dropped it after Convy's cancer diagnosis was made public.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Marshall, Convy in Angry Dispute|journal=[[TV Guide]]|volume=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iEfvAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Peter+marshall%22+%223rd+degree%22&dq=%22Peter+marshall%22+%223rd+degree%22&hl=en&ei=tw9DTvWXF6Hn0QHiiOzQCQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA}}</ref>\n\nAround the time that ''3rd Degree'' was cancelled, Convy was called upon by [[Mark Goodson Productions]] again to host a week's worth of pilot episodes for a revival of ''[[Match Game]]'' that Goodson was attempting to sell to ABC.\n\n===Acting===\nHe turned to acting full-time in 1956 and was in the musical ''[[The Billy Barnes Revue]]'' in Los Angeles before moving to New York City. He appeared in 10 Broadway shows, including \"Nowhere to Go but Up\", ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]'' (originator of the role of Cliff, a fictionalized [[Christopher Isherwood]]), and ''[[The Impossible Years]]''.

Steve Ostrowski, the police officer nephew of elderly amateur sleuths on the short-lived series ''[[The Snoop Sisters]]''.\n\nConvy attempted a short-lived variety series called ''The Late Summer Early Fall Bert Convy Show'' in 1976. In 1979, he appeared with the [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] in their eponymous television movie.

In 1983, Convy was cast as Neil Townsend on the sitcom ''[[It's Not Easy]]'', playing opposite [[Ken Howard]].

In 1980, Convy produced and directed the [[Goodspeed Opera House]] premiere of the musical ''Zapata'', with music and lyrics by [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Perry Botkin, Jr.]], and libretto by [[Allan Katz]].\n\n==Personal life==\nConvy was married twice. He married Anne Anderson in 1959 with whom he had three children: Jennifer, Joshua, and Jonah. Convy and Anderson divorced in 1991. Convy married his second wife, Catherine Hills,<ref name=\"CAdc\"/> five months before his death.<ref name=latimes/>\n\n==Death==\nIn April 1990, Convy was admitted to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] after collapsing while visiting his mother, who had been hospitalized for a stroke. He was diagnosed with a [[Glioblastoma|glioblastoma multiforme]].

He played the reporter Hildy Johnson in a 1969 Broadway revival of ''[[The Front Page]]'', which starred [[Robert Ryan]].<ref name=NYTimes_Obit/> In the original Broadway cast of ''[[Fiddler on the Roof]]'' with [[Zero Mostel]], Convy played Perchik the Student and sang \"Now I Have Everything\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=3213 |title= Fiddler on the Roof |publisher=[[Internet Broadway Database]] |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}</ref> He filled in for [[Raul Julia]] in the lead role of Guido Contini in the Broadway musical [[Nine (musical)|Nine]] when [[Raul Julia]] went on vacation.\n\nIn the 1960\u20131961 season, Convy guest starred on [[Pat O'Brien (actor)|Pat O'Brien]]'s short-lived sitcom ''[[Harrigan and Son]]'' as well as the series ''[[77 Sunset Strip]]'' in the role of David. He was also cast on an episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' as Mary's friend Jack Foster, alongside future ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' star [[Beth Howland]]. In 1973, Convy was a guest star in two episodes of ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''. Convy also guest starred in an episode of ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'' titled \"The Case of the Nimble Nephew\". He played Harry Thompson, the defendant.\n\nIn 1974, Convy portrayed Lt. Steve Ostrowski, the police officer nephew of elderly amateur sleuths on the short-lived series ''[[The Snoop Sisters]]''.\n\nConvy attempted a short-lived variety series called ''The Late Summer Early Fall Bert Convy Show'' in 1976. In 1979, he appeared with the [[Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders]] in their eponymous television movie. Throughout his career, Convy was a frequent guest star on series such as ''[[Bewitched]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', ''[[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission: Impossible]]'', ''[[The Silent Force (TV series)|The Silent Force]]'', ''[[The New Phil Silvers Show]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' and ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' (including the pilot episode). In 1983, Convy was cast as Neil Townsend on the sitcom ''[[It's Not Easy]]'', playing opposite [[Ken Howard]]. Convy had joined the project when it was recast after its intended premiere in the 1982\u201383 season was delayed; he earned the role originally given to Larry Breeding, who was killed in a car accident in September 1982 after the first pilot was shot.\n\nConvy also starred in several movies, perhaps most memorably ''[[Semi-Tough]]'' (1977), in which he played a caricature of [[Werner Erhard]] named Friedrich Bismark. Other film credits included ''[[A Bucket of Blood]]'' (1959), ''[[Susan Slade]]'' (1961), [[Philippe de Broca]]'s ''Les Caprices de Marie'' (1970), ''[[SST: Death Flight]]'' (1977), the [[horror film]] ''[[Jennifer (1978 film)|Jennifer]]'' (1978), ''[[Hanging by a Thread (1979 film)|Hanging by a Thread]]'' (1979), ''[[Racquet (film)|Racquet]]'' (1979), ''[[The Man in the Santa Claus Suit]]'' (1979), ''[[Hero at Large]]'' (1980), ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' (1981), and the television movie ''Help Wanted: Male'' (1982). Convy tried his hand at directing with the comedy ''[[Weekend Warriors (film)|Weekend Warriors]]'' (1986). In 1980, Convy produced and directed the [[Goodspeed Opera House]] premiere of the musical ''Zapata'', with music and lyrics by [[Harry Nilsson]] and [[Perry Botkin, Jr.]], and libretto by [[Allan Katz]].\n\n==Personal life==\nConvy was married twice. He married Anne Anderson in 1959 with whom he had three children: Jennifer, Joshua, and Jonah. Convy and Anderson divorced in 1991. Convy married his second wife, Catherine Hills,<ref name=\"CAdc\"/> five months before his death.<ref name=latimes/>\n\n==Death==\nIn April 1990, Convy was admitted to [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] after collapsing while visiting his mother, who had been hospitalized for a stroke.

Protein production in ''E. coli'' is usually faster than in ''P. pastoris'' for several reasons: [[competent cell|Competent]] ''E. coli'' cells can be stored frozen, and thawed immediately before use, whereas ''Pichia'' cells have to be produced immediately before use.Expression yields in Pichia vary between different [[Cloning|clones]], usually a large number of clones have to be screened for protein production before a good producer is found. Optimal induction times of ''Pichia'' are usually on the order of days, whereas ''E. coli'' usually reaches optimal yields within hours of induction. The major advantage of ''Pichia'' over ''E. coli'' is that ''Pichia'' is capable of producing [[disulfide]] bonds and [[glycosylation]]s in proteins.<ref name=\"pmid19892173\">{{Cite book |vauthors=Cregg JM, Tolstorukov I, Kusari A, Sunga J, Madden K, Chappell T |title=Expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris |journal=Meth.

However ''Pichia'' has two main advantages over ''S. cerevisiae'' in laboratory and industrial settings:\n\n#''Pichia'', as mentioned above, is a [[methylotroph]], meaning it can grow with the simple [[alcohol]] methanol as its only source of energy \u2014 ''Pichia'' can easily be grown in [[cell suspension]] in reasonably strong methanol solutions that would kill most other micro-organisms, a system that is cheap to set up and maintain.\n#''Pichia'' can grow to very high cell densities, and under ideal conditions can multiply to the point where the cell suspension is practically a paste. As the protein yield from expression in a microbe is roughly equal to the product of the protein produced per cell and the number of cells, this makes ''Pichia'' of great use when trying to produce large quantities of protein without expensive equipment.<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\nCompared to other expression systems such as S2-cells from ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' or [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s, ''Pichia'' usually gives much better yields. Cell lines from multicellular organisms usually require complex rich media, including [[amino acids]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[growth factor]]s. These media significantly increase the cost of producing recombinant proteins. Additionally, since ''Pichia'' can grow in media containing only one carbon source and one [[nitrogen]] source, it is suitable for isotopic labelling applications in e.g. [[protein NMR]].<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\n==''P. pastoris'' as a model organism==\n\nAnother advantage of ''P. pastoris'' is its similarity to the well-studied ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''. As a [[model organism]] for biology, and having been used by man for various purposes throughout history, ''S. cerevisiae'' is well studied, to say the least. The two yeast geni; ''[[Pichia]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', have similar growth conditions and tolerances; thus, the culture of ''P. pastoris'' can be readily adopted by labs without specialist equipment.\n\nThe ''P. pastoris'' GS115 genome has been sequenced by the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology and Ghent University, and published in ''Nature Biotechnology''.<ref name = \"De Schutter\">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Schutter K, Lin YC, Tiels P, Van Hecke A, Glinka S, Weber-Lehmann J, Rouz\u00e9 P, Van de Peer Y, Callewaert N | title = Genome sequence of the recombinant protein production host Pichia pastoris | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 561\u20136 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19465926 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1544 }}</ref> The genome sequence and gene annotation can be browsed through the [http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/Picpa ORCAE] system.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q148697}}\n\n[[Category:Saccharomycetaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungal models]]\n[[Category:Yeasts]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1956]]\n", "text_old": "{{Italic title}}\n{{Taxobox \n| name = ''Pichia pastoris''\n| regnum = [[fungus|Fungi]]\n| phylum = [[Ascomycota]]\n| classis = [[Saccharomycetes]]\n| ordo = [[Saccharomycetales]]\n| familia = [[Saccharomycetaceae]]\n| genus = ''[[Pichia]]''\n| species = '''''pastoris'''''\n| binomial = ''Pichia pastoris''\n| binomial_authority = ([[Marie Antoine Alexandre Guilliermond|Guillierm.]]) Phaff 1956\n}}\n\n'''''Pichia pastoris''''' is a species of [[methylotroph]]ic [[yeast]].

Protein production in ''E. coli'' is usually faster than in ''P. pastoris'' for several reasons: [[competent cell|Competent]] ''E. coli'' cells can be stored frozen, and thawed immediately before use, whereas ''Pichia'' cells have to be produced immediately before use.Expression yields in Pichia vary between different [[Cloning|clones]], usually a large number of clones have to be screened for protein production before a good producer is found. Optimal induction times of ''Pichia'' are usually on the order of days, whereas ''E. coli'' usually reaches optimal yields within hours of induction. The major advantage of ''Pichia'' over ''E. coli'' is that ''Pichia'' is capable of producing [[disulfide]] bonds and [[glycosylation]]s in proteins.<ref name=\"pmid19892173\">{{Cite book |vauthors=Cregg JM, Tolstorukov I, Kusari A, Sunga J, Madden K, Chappell T |title=Expression in the yeast Pichia pastoris |journal=Meth.

However ''Pichia'' has two main advantages over ''S. cerevisiae'' in laboratory and industrial settings:\n\n#''Pichia'', as mentioned above, is a [[methylotroph]], meaning it can grow with the simple [[alcohol]] methanol as its only source of energy \u2014 ''Pichia'' can easily be grown in [[cell suspension]] in reasonably strong methanol solutions that would kill most other micro-organisms, a system that is cheap to set up and maintain.\n#''Pichia'' can grow to very high cell densities, and under ideal conditions can multiply to the point where the cell suspension is practically a paste. As the protein yield from expression in a microbe is roughly equal to the product of the protein produced per cell and the number of cells, this makes ''Pichia'' of great use when trying to produce large quantities of protein without expensive equipment.<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\nCompared to other expression systems such as S2-cells from ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' or [[Chinese hamster ovary cell]]s, ''Pichia'' usually gives much better yields. Cell lines from multicellular organisms usually require complex rich media, including [[amino acids]], [[vitamin]]s, and [[growth factor]]s. These media significantly increase the cost of producing recombinant proteins. Additionally, since ''Pichia'' can grow in media containing only one carbon source and one [[nitrogen]] source, it is suitable for isotopic labelling applications in e.g. [[protein NMR]].<ref name=\"pmid19892173\"/>\n\n==''P. pastoris'' as a model organism==\n\nAnother advantage of ''P. pastoris'' is its similarity to the well-studied ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae''. As a [[model organism]] for biology, and having been used by man for various purposes throughout history, ''S. cerevisiae'' is well studied, to say the least. The two yeast geni; ''[[Pichia]]'' and ''[[Saccharomyces]]'', have similar growth conditions and tolerances; thus, the culture of ''P. pastoris'' can be readily adopted by labs without specialist equipment.\n\nThe ''P. pastoris'' GS115 genome has been sequenced by the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology and Ghent University, and published in ''Nature Biotechnology''.<ref name = \"De Schutter\">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Schutter K, Lin YC, Tiels P, Van Hecke A, Glinka S, Weber-Lehmann J, Rouz\u00e9 P, Van de Peer Y, Callewaert N | title = Genome sequence of the recombinant protein production host Pichia pastoris | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 561\u20136 | date = June 2009 | pmid = 19465926 | doi = 10.1038/nbt.1544 }}</ref> The genome sequence and gene annotation can be browsed through the [http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/Picpa ORCAE] system.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q148697}}\n\n[[Category:Saccharomycetaceae]]\n[[Category:Fungal models]]\n[[Category:Yeasts]]\n[[Category:Fungi described in 1956]]\n", "name_user": "Bri", "label": "safe", "comment": "ce punct.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pichia_pastoris"}

{"title_page": "War of the currents", "text_new": "{{for|the 2017 film|The Current War}}\n[[File:Thomas Edison c1882.jpg|thumb|right|American inventor and businessman [[Thomas Edison]] established the first investor-owned electric utility in 1882, basing its infrastructure on DC power.]]\n[[File:George Westinghouse 1884.png|thumb|right|American entrepreneur and engineer [[George Westinghouse]] introduced a rival AC-based power distribution network in 1886.]]\nThe '''war of the currents''', sometimes called '''battle of the currents''', was a series of events surrounding the introduction of competing electric power transmission systems in the late 1880s and early 1890s. It grew out of two lighting systems developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s; [[arc lamp]] street lighting running on high-voltage [[alternating current]] (AC), and large-scale low-voltage [[direct current]] (DC) indoor [[incandescent lamp|incandescent lighting]] being marketed by [[Thomas Edison]]'s company.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2012|p=86}} In 1886, the Edison system was faced with new competition: an alternating current system developed by [[George Westinghouse]]'s company that used [[transformer]]s to step down from a high voltage so AC could be used for indoor lighting. Using high voltage allowed an AC system to transmit power over longer distances from more efficient large central generating stations. As the use of AC spread rapidly, the [[Edison Electric Light Company]] claimed in early 1888 that high voltages used in an alternating current system were hazardous, and that the design was inferior to, and infringed on the patents behind, their direct current system.\n\nIn the spring of 1888, a media furor arose over electrical fatalities caused by pole-mounted high-voltage AC lines, attributed to the greed and callousness of the arc lighting companies that used them. In June of that year [[Harold P. Brown]], a New York electrical engineer, claimed the AC-based lighting companies were putting the public at risk using high-voltage systems installed in a slipshod manner. Brown also claimed that alternating current was more dangerous than direct current and tried to prove this by publicly killing animals with both currents, with technical assistance from Edison Electric. The Edison company and Brown colluded further in their parallel goals to limit the use of AC with attempts to push through legislation to severely limit AC installations and voltages. Both also colluded with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], to make sure the first [[electric chair]] was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\n\nBy the early 1890s the war was winding down. Further deaths caused by AC lines in New York City forced electric companies to fix safety problems. Mergers reduced competition between companies, including the merger of Edison Electric with their chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston, forming [[General Electric]] in 1892. The new company now controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} Westinghouse won the bid to supply electrical power for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893 and won the major part of the contract to build [[Niagara_Falls#Hydroelectric_power|Niagara Falls hydroelectric project]] later that year (partially splitting the contract with General Electric). DC commercial power distribution systems declined rapidly in numbers throughout the 20th century, but the last DC system in New York City was shut down in 2007. \n \n==Background==\n{{further information|History of electric power transmission}}\n[[File:Brush Company arc light madison square new york 1882.png|thumbnail|right|Very bright arc lighting (such as this one in 1882 New York) could only be used outdoors or in large indoor spaces where they could be mounted high out of people's sight line.]]\n\nThe war of the currents grew out of the development of two lighting systems; [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] running on alternating current and [[incandescent lamp|incandescent lighting]] running on direct current.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2012|p=86}} Both were supplanting [[gas lighting]] systems, with arc lighting taking over large area/street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential indoor lighting.\n\n===Arc lighting===\nBy the late 1870s, [[arc lamp]] systems were beginning to be installed in cities, powered by central generating plants.

Edison designed his utility to compete with the then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110 volt direct current supply to power a high resistance incandescent lamp he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=80}} Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. Direct current also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC held throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers less than a mile from the plant.\n\n===AC transformer development in Europe===\n{{further information|Transformer#History}}\n[[File:ZBD team.jpg|thumb|right|The Hungarian \"ZBD\" Team ([[K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky]], [[Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy]], [[Miksa D\u00e9ri]]).

The three also invented the modern [[electric distribution systems|power distribution system]]: Instead of former series connection they connect transformers that supply the appliances in parallel to the main line.]]\n\nAlternating current had been under development with contributions by [[Guillaume Duchenne]] (1850s), the dynamo work of [[Z\u00e9nobe Gramme]], [[Ganz Works]] (1870s), [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]] (1880s), [[Lucien Gaulard]], and [[Galileo Ferraris]]. Starting in the 1880s alternating current gained its key advantage over direct current with the development of functional [[transformer]]s that allowed the voltage to be \"stepped up\" to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage for business and residential use.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=81}} The high voltages allowed a central generating station to supply a large area, up to {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} long circuits.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers |publisher=[[Society of Telegraph Engineers]] |volume=IX |date=March 24, 1880 |title=Notes on the Jablochkoff System of Electric Lighting |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lww4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA143 |issue=32 |page=143 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> \n\nUsing [[induction coil]]s to transfer power between electrical circuits had been around for 40 years with [[Pavel Yablochkov]] using them in his lighting system in 1876 and [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] using the principle to create a \"step down\" transformer in 1882, but the design was not very efficient.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/Transformers.html |title=History of Transformers |year=2014 |website=Edison Tech Center}}</ref> A prototype of the high efficiency, closed core shunt connection [[transformer]] was made by the Hungarian \"Z.B.D.\" team (composed of [[K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky]], [[Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy]] and [[Miksa D\u00e9ri]]) at [[Ganz Works]] in 1884.<ref name=\"Halacsy (1961)\">{{cite journal |last1=Halacsy |first1=A.

Westinghouse became aware of the new European transformer based AC systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal ''Engineering''.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=42}} He grasped that AC combined with transformers meant greater [[economies of scale]] could be achieved with large centralized power plants transmitting stepped up voltage very long distances to be used in arc lighting as well as lower voltage home and commercial incandescent lighting supplied via a \"step down\" transformer at the other end. Westinghouse saw a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

William Stanley used the Gaulard-Gibbs design and designs from the ZBD Transformer to develop the first practical transformer. The [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] was formed at the beginning of 1886. In March 1886 Stanley, with Westinghouse's backing, installed the first multiple-voltage AC power system, a demonstration incandescent lighting system, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.<ref>''Great Barrington Historical Society'', Great Barrington, Massachusetts.</ref> Expanded to the point where it could light 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet, the system used transformers to step 500 AC volts at the street down to 100 volts to power incandescent lamps at each location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html |title=The Great Barrington Electrification, 1886 |year=2014 |website=Edison Tech Center}}</ref> By fall of 1886 Westinghouse, Stanley, and [[Oliver B. Shallenberger]] had built the first commercial AC power system in the US in [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\n===The spread of AC===\nBy the end of 1887 Westinghouse had 68 alternating current power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] (another competitor offering AC- and DC-based systems) had built 22 power stations.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011}} Thomson-Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley AC transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their [[William E. Sawyer|Sawyer-Man]] incandescent bulb patent. Besides Thomson-Houston and Brush there were other competitors at the time included the [[United States Illuminating Company]] and the [[Waterhouse Electric Light Company]]. All of the companies had their own electric power systems, arc lighting systems, and even incandescent lamp designs for domestic lighting, leading to constant lawsuits and patent battles between themselves and with Edison.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2007|p=97}}\n\n===Safety concerns===\n[[File:Blizzard 1888 01.jpg|thumb|right|The myriad of telephone, telegraph, and power lines over the streets of New York City in a photo of the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]. An AC charged broken wire from the storm led to the electrocution of a boy that spring.]]\n[[Elihu Thomson]] of Thomson-Houston was concerned about AC safety and put a great deal of effort into developing a lightning arrestor for high-tension power lines as well as a magnetic blowout switch that could shut the system down in a power surge, a safety feature the Westinghouse system did not have.<ref>{{cite book |first=L. J. |last=Davis |title=Fleet Fire: Thomas Edison and the Pioneers of the Electric Revolution |location=New York |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-61145-659-2}}</ref> Thomson also worried about what would happen with the equipment after they sold it, assuming customers would follow a risky practice of installing as many lights and generators as they could get away with. He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installation until a safer transformer could be developed.{{sfnp|Higonnet|Landes|Rosovsky|1991|p=89}}\n\nDue to the hazards presented by high voltage electrical lines most European cities and the city of Chicago in the US required them to be buried underground.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=137}} The City of New York did not require burying and had little in the way of regulation so by the end of 1887 the mishmash of overhead wires for telephone, telegraph, fire and burglar alarm systems in Manhattan were now mixed with haphazardly strung AC lighting system wires carrying up to 6000 volts.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}} [[Insulator (electricity)|Insulation]] on power lines was rudimentary, with one electrician referring to it as having as much value \"as a molasses covered rag\", and exposure to the elements was eroding it over time.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=137}} A third of the wires were simply abandoned by defunct companies and slowly deteriorating, causing damage to, and shorting out the other lines. Besides being an [[eyesore]], New Yorkers were annoyed when a large March 1888 snowstorm (the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]) tore down a large number of the lines, cutting off utilities in the city. This spurred on the idea of having these lines moved underground but it was stopped by a court injunction obtained by Western Union. Legislation to give all the utilities 90 days to move their lines into underground conduits supplied by the city was slowly making its way through the government but that was also being fought in court by the United States Illuminating Company, who claimed their AC lines were perfectly safe.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}}{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=139}}\n\n===Edison's anti-AC stance===\nAs AC systems continued to spread into territories covered by DC systems, with the companies seeming to impinge on Edison patents including incandescent lighting, things got worse for the company. The price of copper was rising, adding to the expense of Edison's low voltage DC system, which required much heavier copper wires than higher voltage AC systems. Thomas Edison's own colleagues and engineers were trying to get him to consider AC. Edison's sales force was continually losing bids in municipalities that opted for cheaper AC systems{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=171}} and Edison Electric Illuminating Company president [[Edward Hibberd Johnson]] pointed out that if the company stuck with an all DC system it would not be able to do business in small towns and even mid-sized cities.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=144\u2013145}} Edison Electric had a patent option on the ZBD transformer, and a confidential in house report recommended that the company go AC, but Thomas Edison was against the idea.\n\nAfter Westinghouse installed his first large scale system, Edison wrote in a November 1886 private letter to Edward Johnson, \"''Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size, He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''\"{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=257}} Edison seemed to hold a view that the very high voltage used in AC systems was too dangerous and that it would take many years to develop a safe and workable system.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=146}} Safety and avoiding the bad press of killing a customer had been one of the goals in designing his DC system{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=174}} and he worried that a death caused by a mis-installed AC system could hold back the use of electricity in general,{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=146}} Edison's understanding of how AC systems worked seemed to be extensive. He noted what he saw as inefficiencies and that, combined with the capital costs in trying to finance very large generating plants, led him to believe there would be very little cost savings in an AC venture.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/0/0e/Carlson,_Competition_and_Consolidationin_the_Electrical_Manufacturing_Industry.pdf |first=W.

The pamphlet also emphasized the safety and efficiency of direct current, with the claim DC had not caused a single death, and included newspaper stories of accidental electrocutions caused by alternating current.\n\n===Execution by electricity===\n{{Further information|Electric chair}}\n[[File:EXECUTION BY ELECTRICITY electric chair illustration Scientific American Volumes 58-59 June 30 1888.png|thumbnail|A June 30, 1888 [[Scientific American]] illustration of what the new [[electric chair]] might look like.]]\n\nAs arc lighting systems spread so did stories of how the high voltages involved were killing people, usually unwary linemen, a strange new phenomenon that seemed to instantaneously strike a victim dead.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|pp=171-173}} One such story in 1881 of drunken dock worker dying after he grabbed a large electric dynamo led Buffalo, New York dentist [[Alfred P.

An 1886 commission appointed by New York governor [[David B. Hill]], which including Southwick, recommended in 1888 that executions be carried out by electricity using the electric chair.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anb.org/articles/20/20-01919.html |title=Southwick, Alfred Porter |website=American National Biography Online}}</ref>\n\nThere were early indications that this new form of execution would become mixed up with the war of currents. As part of their [[fact-finding]], the commission sent out surveys to hundreds of experts on law and medicine, seeking their opinions, as well as contacting electrical experts, including Elihu Thomson and Thomas Edison.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|pp=54 & 57\u201358}} In late 1887, when death penalty commission member Southwick contacted Edison, the inventor stated he was against capital punishment and wanted nothing to do with the matter. After further prompting, Edison hit out at his chief electric power competitor, George Westinghouse, in what may have been the opening salvo in the war of currents, stating in a December 1887 letter to Southwick that it would be best to use current generated by \"'alternating machines,' manufactured principally in this country by Geo. Westinghouse\".{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=420}} Soon after the execution by electricity bill passed in June 1888, Edison was asked by a New York government official what means would be the best way to implement the state's new form of execution. \"Hire out your criminals as linemen to the New York electric lighting companies\" was Edison's [[tongue in cheek]] answer.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\">{{cite magazine |url=http://simson.net/ref/1989/Edison_and_The_Chairt.pdf |last1=Reynolds |first1=Terry S. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Theodore |title=Edison and \"The Chair\" |magazine=Technology and Society |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=March 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Thomas Alva Edison |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=87 |number=26 |date=December 27, 1902 |page=463|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican12271902-463 }}</ref>\n\n==Anti-AC backlash==\nAs the number of deaths attributed to high voltage lighting around the country continued to mount, a cluster of deaths in New York City in the spring of 1888 related to AC arc lighting set off a media frenzy against the \"deadly arc-lighting current\"{{sfnp|Stross|2007|pp=172}} and the seemingly callous lighting companies that used it.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=143}}{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=139\u2013140}} These deaths included a 15-year-old boy killed on April 15 by a broken telegraph line that had been energized with alternating current from a United States Illuminating Company line, a clerk killed two weeks later by an AC line, and a Brush Electric Company lineman killed in May by the AC line he was cutting. The press in New York seemed to switch overnight from stories about electric lights vs gas lighting to \"death by wire\" incidents, with each new report seeming to fan public resentment against high voltage AC and the dangerously tangled overhead electrical wires in the city.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}}{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=143}}\n\n===Harold Brown's crusade===\n[[File:Harold Pitney Brown engineer 1857 1932.png|thumbnail|Electrical engineer Harold Pitney Brown emerged in June 1888 as an anti-AC crusader.]]\nAt this point an electrical engineer named [[Harold P. Brown]], who at that time seemed to have no connection to the Edison company,{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=166}} sent a June 5, 1888 letter to the editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'' claiming the root of the problem was the alternating current (AC) system being used.  Brown argued that the AC system was inherently dangerous and \"damnable\" and asked why the \"public must submit to constant danger from sudden death\" just so utilities could use a cheaper AC system.\n\nAt the beginning of attacks on AC, Westinghouse, in a June 7, 1888 letter, tried to defuse the situation.  He invited Edison to visit him in Pittsburgh and said \"I believe there has been a systemic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs\". Edison thanked him but said \"My laboratory work consumes the whole of my time\".{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=167}}\n\nOn June 8, Brown was lobbying in person before the New York Board of Electrical Control, asking that his letter to the paper be read into the meeting's record and demanding severe regulations on AC including limiting power to 300 volts, a level that would make AC next to useless for transmission. There were many rebuttals to Brown's claims in the newspapers and letters to the board, with people pointing out he was showing no scientific evidence that AC was more dangerous than DC. Westinghouse pointed out in letters to various newspapers the number of fires caused by DC equipment and suggested that Brown was obviously being controlled by Edison, something Brown continually denied.\n\nA July edition of ''[[The Electrical Journal]]'' covered Brown's appearance before the New York Board of Electrical Control and the debate in technical societies over the merits of DC and AC and noted that:{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=135}}<ref>''The Electrical Journal'', Volume 21, July 21, 1888, p.415.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''<big>The battle of the currents is being fought this week in New York.</big>''}}\n\nAt a July meeting Board of Electrical Control, Brown's criticisms of AC and even his knowledge of electricity was challenged by other electrical engineers, some of whom worked for Westinghouse. At this meeting, supporters of AC provided anecdotal stories from electricians on how they had survived shocks from AC at voltages up to 1000 volts and argued that DC was the more dangerous of the two.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=141}}\n\n====Brown's demonstrations====\nBrown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments. Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies.  Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant [[Arthur Kennelly]].\n\nBrown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=173}} After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]].{{sfnp|Rockman|2004|p=469}} With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=174}} Brown wrote to a college that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts. Brown's campaign to restrict AC to 300 volts went nowhere but legislation did come close to passing in Ohio and Virginia.<ref name=\"Carlson2003,285\">{{cite book |first=W.

To gain control of the Sawyer-Man lamp patents he bought [[Consolidated Electric Light]] in 1887. He bought the Waterhouse Electric Light Company in 1888 and the United States Illuminating Company in 1890, giving Westinghouse their own arc lighting systems as well as control over all the major incandescent lamp patents not controlled by Edison.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=281}} In April 1888 Westinghouse engineer [[Oliver B.

In November George Westinghouse challenged Brown's assertion in the pages of the ''Electrical Engineer'' that the Westinghouse AC systems had caused 30 deaths. The magazine investigated the claim and found at most only two of the deaths could be attributed to Westinghouse installations.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=118}}\n\n===Associating AC and Westinghouse with the electric chair===\nAlthough New York had a criminal procedure code that specified electrocution via an electric chair, it did not spell out the type of electricity, the amount of current, or its method of supply, since these were still relative unknowns.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=102\u2013104}} The New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details and in late 1888 through early 1889 conducted a series of animal experiments on voltage amounts, electrode design and placement, and skin conductivity. During this time they sought the advice of Harold Brown as a consultant. This ended up expanding the war of currents into the development of the chair and the general debate over capital punishment in the US.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/>\n\nAfter the Medico-Legal Society formed their committee in September 1888 chairman [[Frederick Peterson]], who had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College,{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=102}} had the results of those experiments submitted to the committee. The claims that AC was more deadly than DC and was the best current to use was questioned with some committee members, pointing out that Brown's experiments were not scientifically carried out and were on animals smaller than a human being. At their November meeting the committee recommended 3000 volts although the type of electricity, [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]], was not determined.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=102}} \n[[File:Harold Pitney Brown edison electrocute horse 1888 New York Medico-Legal Journal vol 6 issue 4.png|thumbnail|Harold Brown demonstrating the killing power of AC to the New York Medico-Legal Society by electrocuting a horse at Thomas Edison's West Orange laboratory.]]\nIn order to more conclusively prove to the committee that AC was more deadly than DC, Brown contacted Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings to arrange the use of the West Orange laboratory.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/> There on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=152\u2013155}} Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society's December meeting recommended the use of 1000\u20131500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.\n\nWestinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=82}} On December 13 in a letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Westinghouse spelled out where Brown's experiments were wrong and claimed again that Brown was being employed by the Edison company. Brown's December 18 letter refuted the claims and Brown even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical duel, with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever-increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse submitted himself to the same amount of increasing AC power, first to quit loses.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=82}} Westinghouse declined the offer.\n\nIn March 1889 when members of the Medico-Legal Society embarked on another series of tests to work out the details of electrode composition and placement they turned to Brown for technical assistance.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/>{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=225}} Edison treasurer Hastings tried unsuccessfully to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/> They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests.\n\nAlso in March, Superintendent of Prisons [[Austin Lathrop (New York)|Austin Lathrop]] asked Brown if he could supply the equipment needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/> The state refused to pay up front, and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson-Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind-the-scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse AC generators to supply the current, apparently with the help of the Edison company and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/>{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190\u2013195}} Thomson-Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse AC generators by replacing them with new Thomson-Houston AC generators. Thomson-Houston president [[Charles A. Coffin|Charles Coffin]] had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his company's equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public efficiency test to show that Westinghouse's sales claim of manufacturing 50% more efficient generators was false.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=193}}\n\nThat spring Brown published \"The Comparative Danger to Life of the Alternating and Continuous Electrical Current\" detailing the animal experiments done at Edison's lab and claiming they showed AC was far deadlier than DC.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=106}} This 61-page professionally printed booklet (probably paid for by the Edison company) was sent to government officials, newspapers, and businessmen in towns with populations greater than 5000 inhabitants.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=157}}\n\nIn May 1889 when New York had its first criminal sentenced to be executed in the electric chair, a street merchant named [[William Kemmler]], there was a great deal of discussion in the editorial column of the ''New York Times'' as to what to call the then-new form of execution. The term \"''Westinghouse''d\" was put forward as well as \"''Gerry''cide\" (after death penalty commission head [[Elbridge Thomas Gerry|Elbridge Gerry]]), and \"''Brown''ed\".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}} ''The Times'' hated the word that was eventually adopted, [[electrocution]], describing it as being pushed forward by \"pretentious ignoramuses\".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=xxii}} One of Edison's lawyers wrote to his colleague expressing an opinion that Edison's preference for ''dynamort'', ''ampermort'' and ''electromort'' were not good terms but thought ''Westinghouse''d was the best choice.''{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}}\n\n====The Kemmler appeal====\n[[File:William Kemmler.jpg|thumbnail|After William Kemmler was sentenced to death in the electric chair his appeal was financed by Westinghouse, an attempt to prevent Westinghouse AC generators from being used in an execution, by repealing the electrocution law.]]\nWilliam Kemmler was sentenced to die in the electric chair around June 24, 1889, but before the sentence could be carried out an appeal was filed on the grounds that it constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]] under the US Constitution. It became obvious to the press and everyone involved that the politically connected (and expensive) lawyer who filed the appeal, [[William Bourke Cockran]], had no connection to the case but did have connection to the Westinghouse company, obviously paying for his services.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=101}}\n\nDuring [[fact-finding]] hearings held around the state beginning on July 9 in New York City, Cockran used his considerable skills as a cross-examiner and [[orator]] to attack Brown, Edison, and their supporters. His strategy was to show that Brown had falsified his test on the killing power of AC and to prove that electricity would not cause certain death and simply lead to torturing the condemned. In cross examination he questioned Brown's lack of credentials in the electrical field and brought up possible collusion between Brown and Edison, which Brown again denied. Many witnesses were called by both sides to give firsthand anecdotal accounts about encounters with electricity and evidence was given by medical professionals on the human body's nervous system and the electrical conductivity of skin. Brown was accused of fudging his tests on animals, hiding the fact that he was using lower [[electric current|current]] DC and high-current AC.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=119}} When the hearing convened for a day at Edison's West Orange lab to witness demonstrations of skin resistance to electricity, Brown almost got in a fight with a Westinghouse representative, accusing him of being in the Edison laboratory to conduct [[industrial espionage]].{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=115}} Newspapers noted the often contradictory testimony was raising public doubts about the electrocution law but after Edison took the stand many accepted assurances from the \"wizard of Menlo Park\" that 1000 volts of AC would easily kill any man.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=125}}\n\nAfter the gathered testimony was submitted and the two sides presented their case, Judge Edwin Day ruled against Kemmler's appeal on October 9 and US Supreme Court denied Kemmler's appeal on May 23, 1890.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=120}}\n\nWhen the chair was first used, on August 6, 1890, the technicians on hand misjudged the voltage needed to kill William Kemmler. After the first jolt of electricity Kemmler was found to be still breathing. The procedure had to be repeated and a reporter on hand described it as \"an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging.\" George Westinghouse commented: \"They would have done better using an axe.\"{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=125}}\n\n===Brown's collusion exposed===\nOn August 25, 1889 the [[New York Sun]] ran a story headlined:\n{{cquote|\"''For Shame, Brown! \u2013 Disgraceful Facts About the Electric Killing Scheme; Queer Work for a State's Expert; Paid by One Electric Company to Injure Another''\"}}\n\nThe story was based on 45 letters stolen from Brown's office that spelled out Brown's collusion with Thomson-Houston and Edison Electric. The majority of the letters were correspondence between Brown and Thomson-Houston on the topic of acquiring the three Westinghouse generators for the state of New York as well as using one of them in an efficiency test. They also showed that Brown had received $5,000 from Edison Electric to purchase the surplus Westinghouse generators from Thomson-Houston. Further Edison involvement was contained in letters from Edison treasurer Hastings asking Brown to send anti-AC pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of [[Missouri]] (at the company's expense), Brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison be sent to Scranton, PA, as well as Edison and Arthur Kennelly coaching Brown in his upcoming testimony in the Kemmler appeal trial.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190\u2013195}}<ref name=\"inventionandtech.com\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/inventing-electrocution-1?page=show |first=James F. |last=Penrose |title=Inventing Electrocution |year=1994 |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention & Technology]] |volume=9 |number=4 |pages=34\u201344 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225124748/http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/inventing-electrocution-1 |archivedate=February 25, 2015}}</ref>{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=191\u2013198}}\n\nBrown was not slowed down by this revelation and characterized his efforts to expose Westinghouse as the same as going after a grocer who sells poison and calls it sugar.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190\u2013195}}<ref name=\"inventionandtech.com\"/>{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=191\u2013198}}\n\n===The \"Electric Wire Panic\"===\n[[File:John Feeks Western Union lineman killed by AC October 11 1889.png|thumb|The death of Western Union Lineman John Feeks led to laws finally being passed to move AC lines underground in New York City.]]\n\n1889 saw another round of deaths attributed to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using came in contact with an overhead line. NYC Mayor [[Hugh J. Grant]], in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying \"we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office\".{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}} On October 11, 1889, John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. The source of the power that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran nearby.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}\n\nFeeks' public death sparked a new round of people fearing the electric lines over their heads in what has been called the \"Electric Wire Panic\".{{sfnp|Klein|2010}} The blame seemed to settle on Westinghouse since, Westinghouse having bought many of the lighting companies involved, people assumed Feeks' death was the fault of a Westinghouse subsidiary.{{sfnp|Klein|2010}} Newspapers joined into the public outcry following Feeks' death, pointing out men's lives \"were cheaper to this monopoly than insulated wires\" and calling for the executives of AC companies to be charged with [[manslaughter]]. The October 13, 1889, New Orleans ''[[Times-Picayune]]'' noted \"Death does not stop at the door, but comes right into the house, and perhaps as you are closing a door or turning on the gas you are killed.\"{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=217}} Harold Brown's reputation was rehabilitated almost overnight with newspapers and magazines seeking his opinion and reporters following him around New York City where he measured how much current was leaking from AC power lines.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=218}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Edison 1.png|thumbnail|left|The death of Feeks marked the first time Edison publicly denounced alternating current.]]\nAt the peak of the war of currents, Edison himself joined the public debate for the first time, denounced AC current in a November 1889 article in the ''[[North American Review]]'' titled \"The Dangers of Electric Lighting\". Edison put forward the view that burying the high-voltage lines was not a solution, and would simply move the deaths underground and be a \"constant menace\" that could short with other lines threatening people's homes and lives.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=200}} He stated the only way to make AC safe was to limit its voltage and vowed Edison Electric would never adopt AC as long as he was in charge.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}\n\nGeorge Westinghouse was suddenly put in the role of a villain trying to defend pole-mounted AC installations that he knew were unsafe and fumbled at reporters' questions trying to point out all the other things in a large city that were more dangerous.{{sfnp|Klein|2010}}{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}} The next month he did better in his response printed in the ''North American Review'', pointing out that his AC/transformer system actually used lower household voltages than the Edison DC system. He also pointed out 87 deaths in one year caused by street cars and gas lighting versus only 5 accidental electrocutions and no in-home deaths attributed to AC current.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}\n\nThe crowd that watched Feeks contained many New York [[aldermen]] due to the site of the accident being near the New York government offices and the horrifying affair galvanized them into the action of passing the law on moving utilities underground.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=178}} The electric companies involved obtained an injunction preventing their lines from being cut down immediately but shut down most of their lighting until the situation was settled, plunging many New York streets into darkness.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=292}} The legislation ordering the cutting down of all of the utility lines was finally upheld by the [[New York Supreme Court]]{{which|date=July 2019}} in December. The AC lines were cut down keeping many New York City streets in darkness for the rest of the winter since little had been done by the overpaid [[Tammany Hall]] city supervisors who were supposed to see to building the underground \"subways\" to house them.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=200}}\n\n==The current war ends==\nEven with the Westinghouse propaganda losses, the war of currents itself was winding down with direct current on the losing side. This was due in part to Thomas Edison himself leaving the electric power business.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=125\u2013126}} Edison was becoming marginalized in his own company having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric.<ref name=\"Sloat1979,316\">{{cite book |first=Warren |last=Sloat |title=1929: America Before the Crash |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1979 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1929americabefor00sloa/page/316 316] |isbn=978-0-02611-800-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/1929americabefor00sloa/page/316 }}</ref> In 1890 he told president [[Henry Villard]] he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} Edison's dogmatic anti-AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889 Edison's Electric's own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems and in October 1890 [[Edison Machine Works]] began developing AC-based equipment.\n\nWith Thomas Edison no longer involved with Edison General Electric, the war of currents came to a close with a financial merger.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120-121}} Edison president Henry Villard, who had engineered the merger that formed Edison General Electric, was continually working on the idea of merging that company with Thomson-Houston or Westinghouse. He saw a real opportunity in 1891. The market was in a general downturn causing cash shortages for all the companies concerned and Villard was in talks with Thomson-Houston, which was now Edison General Electric's biggest competitor. Thomson-Houston had a habit of saving money on development by buying, or sometimes stealing, patents. Patent conflicts were stymieing the growth of both companies and the idea of saving on some 60 ongoing lawsuits as well as saving on profit losses of trying to undercut each other by selling generating plants below cost pushed forward the idea of this merger in financial circles.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}}<ref name=\"Sloat1979,316\"/> Edison hated the idea and tried to hold it off but Villard thought his company, now winning its incandescent light patent lawsuits in the courts, was in a position to dictate the terms of any merger.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} As a committee of financiers, which included [[J.P. Morgan]], worked on the deal in early 1892 things went against Villard. In Morgan's view Thomson-Houston looked on the books to be the stronger of the two companies and engineered a behind the scenes deal announced on April 15, 1892, that put the management of Thomson-Houston in control of the new company, now called [[General Electric]] (dropping Edison's name). Thomas Edison was not aware of the deal until the day before it happened.\n\nThe fifteen electric companies that existed five years before had merged down to two; General Electric and Westinghouse. The war of currents came to an end and this merger of the Edison company, along with its lighting patents, and the Thomson-Houston, with its AC patents, created a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} From this point on General Electric and Westinghouse were both marketing alternating current systems.<ref name=\"Garud2009,249\">{{cite book |first1=Raghu |last1=Garud |first2=Arun |last2=Kumaraswamy |first3=Richard |last3=Langlois |title=Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |page=249 |isbn=978-1-40514-194-9}}</ref> Edison put on a brave face noting to the media how his stock had gained value in the deal but privately he was bitter that his company and all of his patents had been turned over to the competition.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nEven though the institutional war of currents had ended in a financial merger the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems followed a much longer technical merger.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120\u2013121}} Due to innovation in the US and Europe, alternating current's economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied. These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In the engineered ''universal system'' these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of [[rotary converter]]s and [[motor\u2013generator]]s that allowed the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid.<ref name=\"Garud2009,249\"/>{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120\u2013121}} These stopgaps were slowly replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded.\n\nIn May 1892 Westinghouse Electric managed to underbid General Electric on the contract to electrify the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago and, although they made no profit, their demonstration of a safe and effective highly flexible universal alternating current system powering all of the disparate electrical systems at the Exposition led to them winning the bid at the end of that year to build an AC power station at [[Niagara Falls]]. General Electric was awarded contracts to build AC transmission lines and transformers in that project and further bids at Niagara were split with GE who were quickly catching up in the AC field{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}} due partly to [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]], a Prussian mathematician who was the first person to fully understand AC power from a solid mathematical standpoint. General Electric hired many talented new engineers to improve its design of transformers, generators, motors and other apparatus.<ref>''The General Electric Story'', The Hall of History.</ref>\n\nPatent lawsuits were still hampering both companies and bleeding off cash, so in 1896, J.

For example, central [[Helsinki]] had a DC network until the late 1940s, and Stockholm lost its dwindling DC network as late as the 1970s. A [[mercury-arc valve]] rectifier station could convert AC to DC where networks were still used. Parts of Boston, Massachusetts, along Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue still used 110 volts DC in the 1960s, causing the destruction of many small appliances (typically hair dryers and phonographs) used by [[Boston University]] students, who ignored warnings about the electricity supply. New York City's electric utility company, [[Consolidated Edison]], continued to supply direct current to customers who had adopted it early in the twentieth century, mainly for elevators. The [[New Yorker Hotel]], constructed in 1929, had a large direct-current power plant and did not convert fully to alternating-current service until well into the 1960s.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Tom |last=Blalock |title=Powering the New Yorker: A Hotel's Unique Direct Current System |magazine=Power and Energy |publisher=IEEE |volume=4 |issue=1 |date=23 January 2006 |doi=10.1109/MPAE.2006.1578536}}</ref> This was the building in which AC pioneer [[Nikola Tesla]] spent his last years, and where he died in 1943.

It grew out of two lighting systems developed in the late 1870s and early 1880s; [[arc lamp]] street lighting running on high-voltage [[alternating current]] (AC), and large-scale low-voltage [[direct current]] (DC) indoor [[incandescent lamp|incandescent lighting]] being marketed by [[Thomas Edison]]'s company.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2012|p=86}} In 1886, the Edison system was faced with new competition: an alternating current system developed by [[George Westinghouse]]'s company that used [[transformer]]s to step down from a high voltage so AC could be used for indoor lighting. Using high voltage allowed an AC system to transmit power over longer distances from more efficient large central generating stations. As the use of AC spread rapidly, the [[Edison Electric Light Company]] claimed in early 1888 that high voltages used in an alternating current system were hazardous, and that the design was inferior to, and infringed on the patents behind, their direct current system.\n\nIn the spring of 1888, a media furor arose over electrical fatalities caused by pole-mounted high-voltage AC lines, attributed to the greed and callousness of the arc lighting companies that used them. In June of that year [[Harold P. Brown]], a New York electrical engineer, claimed the AC-based lighting companies were putting the public at risk using high-voltage systems installed in a slipshod manner. Brown also claimed that alternating current was more dangerous than direct current and tried to prove this by publicly killing animals with both currents, with technical assistance from Edison Electric. The Edison company and Brown colluded further in their parallel goals to limit the use of AC with attempts to push through legislation to severely limit AC installations and voltages. Both also colluded with Westinghouse's chief AC rival, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]], to make sure the first [[electric chair]] was powered by a Westinghouse AC generator.\n\nBy the early 1890s the war was winding down. Further deaths caused by AC lines in New York City forced electric companies to fix safety problems. Mergers reduced competition between companies, including the merger of Edison Electric with their chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston, forming [[General Electric]] in 1892. The new company now controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} Westinghouse won the bid to supply electrical power for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893 and won the major part of the contract to build [[Niagara_Falls#Hydroelectric_power|Niagara Falls hydroelectric project]] later that year (partially splitting the contract with General Electric). DC commercial power distribution systems declined rapidly in numbers throughout the 20th century, but the last DC system in New York City was shut down in 2007. \n \n==Background==\n{{further information|History of electric power transmission}}\n[[File:Brush Company arc light madison square new york 1882.png|thumbnail|right|Very bright arc lighting (such as this one in 1882 New York) could only be used outdoors or in large indoor spaces where they could be mounted high out of people's sight line.]]\n\nThe war of the currents grew out of the development of two lighting systems; [[arc lamp|arc lighting]] running on alternating current and [[incandescent lamp|incandescent lighting]] running on direct current.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2012|p=86}} Both were supplanting [[gas lighting]] systems, with arc lighting taking over large area/street lighting, and incandescent lighting replacing gas for business and residential indoor lighting.\n\n===Arc lighting===\nBy the late 1870s, [[arc lamp]] systems were beginning to be installed in cities, powered by central generating plants.

Edison designed his utility to compete with the then established gas lighting utilities, basing it on a relatively low 110 volt direct current supply to power a high resistance incandescent lamp he had invented for the system. Edison direct current systems would be sold to cities throughout the United States, making it a standard with Edison controlling all technical development and holding all the key patents.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=80}} Direct current worked well with incandescent lamps, which were the principal load of the day. Direct-current systems could be directly used with storage batteries, providing valuable load-leveling and backup power during interruptions of generator operation. Direct-current generators could be easily paralleled, allowing economical operation by using smaller machines during periods of light load and improving reliability. Edison had invented a meter to allow customers to be billed for energy proportional to consumption, but this meter worked only with direct current. Direct current also worked well with electric motors, an advantage DC held throughout the 1880s. The primary drawback with the Edison direct current system was that it ran at 110 volts from generation to its final destination giving it a relatively short useful transmission range: to keep the size of the expensive copper conductors down generating plants had to be situated in the middle of population centers and could only supply customers less than a mile from the plant.\n\n===AC transformer development in Europe===\n{{further information|Transformer#History}}\n[[File:ZBD team.jpg|thumb|right|The Hungarian \"ZBD\" Team ([[K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky]], [[Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy]], [[Miksa D\u00e9ri]]).

The three also invented the modern [[electric distribution systems|power distribution system]]: Instead of former series connection they connect transformers that supply the appliances in parallel to the main line.]]\n\nAlternating current had been under development with contributions by [[Guillaume Duchenne]] (1850s), the dynamo work of [[Z\u00e9nobe Gramme]], [[Ganz Works]] (1870s), [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti]] (1880s), [[Lucien Gaulard]], and [[Galileo Ferraris]]. Starting in the 1880s alternating current gained its key advantage over direct current with the development of functional [[transformer]]s that allowed the voltage to be \"stepped up\" to much higher transmission voltages and then dropped down to a lower end user voltage for business and residential use.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=81}} The high voltages allowed a central generating station to supply a large area, up to {{convert|7|mi|km|adj=on}} long circuits.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Journal of the Society of Telegraph Engineers |publisher=[[Society of Telegraph Engineers]] |volume=IX |date=March 24, 1880 |title=Notes on the Jablochkoff System of Electric Lighting |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lww4AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA143 |issue=32 |page=143 |accessdate=January 7, 2009}}</ref> \n\nUsing [[induction coil]]s to transfer power between electrical circuits had been around for 40 years with [[Pavel Yablochkov]] using them in his lighting system in 1876 and [[Lucien Gaulard]] and [[John Dixon Gibbs]] using the principle to create a \"step down\" transformer in 1882, but the design was not very efficient.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/Transformers.html |title=History of Transformers |year=2014 |website=Edison Tech Center}}</ref> A prototype of the high efficiency, closed core shunt connection [[transformer]] was made by the Hungarian \"Z.B.D.\" team (composed of [[K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky]], [[Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy]] and [[Miksa D\u00e9ri]]) at [[Ganz Works]] in 1884.<ref name=\"Halacsy (1961)\">{{cite journal |last1=Halacsy |first1=A.

Westinghouse became aware of the new European transformer based AC systems in 1885 when he read about them in the UK technical journal ''Engineering''.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=42}} He grasped that AC combined with transformers meant greater [[economies of scale]] could be achieved with large centralized power plants transmitting stepped up voltage very long distances to be used in arc lighting as well as lower voltage home and commercial incandescent lighting supplied via a \"step down\" transformer at the other end. Westinghouse saw a way to build a truly competitive system instead of simply building another barely competitive DC lighting system using patents just different enough to get around the Edison patents.<ref>{{cite book |first=W.

William Stanley used the Gaulard-Gibbs design and designs from the ZBD Transformer to develop the first practical transformer. The [[Westinghouse Electric Company]] was formed at the beginning of 1886. In March 1886 Stanley, with Westinghouse's backing, installed the first multiple-voltage AC power system, a demonstration incandescent lighting system, in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.<ref>''Great Barrington Historical Society'', Great Barrington, Massachusetts.</ref> Expanded to the point where it could light 23 businesses along main street with very little power loss over 4000 feet, the system used transformers to step 500 AC volts at the street down to 100 volts to power incandescent lamps at each location.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edisontechcenter.org/GreatBarrington.html |title=The Great Barrington Electrification, 1886 |year=2014 |website=Edison Tech Center}}</ref> By fall of 1886 Westinghouse, Stanley, and [[Oliver B. Shallenberger]] had built the first commercial AC power system in the US in [[Buffalo, New York]].\n\n===The spread of AC===\nBy the end of 1887 Westinghouse had 68 alternating current power stations to Edison's 121 DC-based stations. To make matters worse for Edison, the [[Thomson-Houston Electric Company]] of [[Lynn, Massachusetts]] (another competitor offering AC- and DC-based systems) had built 22 power stations.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011}} Thomson-Houston was expanding their business while trying to avoid patent conflicts with Westinghouse, arranging deals such as coming to agreements over lighting company territory, paying a royalty to use the Stanley AC transformer patent, and allowing Westinghouse to use their [[William E.

Besides Thomson-Houston and Brush there were other competitors at the time included the [[United States Illuminating Company]] and the [[Waterhouse Electric Light Company]]. All of the companies had their own electric power systems, arc lighting systems, and even incandescent lamp designs for domestic lighting, leading to constant lawsuits and patent battles between themselves and with Edison.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2007|p=97}}\n\n===Safety concerns===\n[[File:Blizzard 1888 01.jpg|thumb|right|The myriad of telephone, telegraph, and power lines over the streets of New York City in a photo of the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]].

He also thought the idea of using AC lighting in residential homes was too dangerous and had the company hold back on that type of installation until a safer transformer could be developed.{{sfnp|Higonnet|Landes|Rosovsky|1991|p=89}}\n\nDue to the hazards presented by high voltage electrical lines most European cities and the city of Chicago in the US required them to be buried underground.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=137}} The City of New York did not require burying and had little in the way of regulation so by the end of 1887 the mishmash of overhead wires for telephone, telegraph, fire and burglar alarm systems in Manhattan were now mixed with haphazardly strung AC lighting system wires carrying up to 6000 volts.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}} [[Insulator (electricity)|Insulation]] on power lines was rudimentary, with one electrician referring to it as having as much value \"as a molasses covered rag\", and exposure to the elements was eroding it over time.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=137}} A third of the wires were simply abandoned by defunct companies and slowly deteriorating, causing damage to, and shorting out the other lines. Besides being an [[eyesore]], New Yorkers were annoyed when a large March 1888 snowstorm (the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]) tore down a large number of the lines, cutting off utilities in the city. This spurred on the idea of having these lines moved underground but it was stopped by a court injunction obtained by Western Union. Legislation to give all the utilities 90 days to move their lines into underground conduits supplied by the city was slowly making its way through the government but that was also being fought in court by the United States Illuminating Company, who claimed their AC lines were perfectly safe.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}}{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=139}}\n\n===Edison's anti-AC stance===\nAs AC systems continued to spread into territories covered by DC systems, with the companies seeming to impinge on Edison patents including incandescent lighting, things got worse for the company. The price of copper was rising, adding to the expense of Edison's low voltage DC system, which required much heavier copper wires than higher voltage AC systems. Thomas Edison's own colleagues and engineers were trying to get him to consider AC. Edison's sales force was continually losing bids in municipalities that opted for cheaper AC systems{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=171}} and Edison Electric Illuminating Company president [[Edward Hibberd Johnson]] pointed out that if the company stuck with an all DC system it would not be able to do business in small towns and even mid-sized cities.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=144\u2013145}} Edison Electric had a patent option on the ZBD transformer, and a confidential in house report recommended that the company go AC, but Thomas Edison was against the idea.\n\nAfter Westinghouse installed his first large scale system, Edison wrote in a November 1886 private letter to Edward Johnson, \"''Just as certain as death Westinghouse will kill a customer within six months after he puts in a system of any size, He has got a new thing and it will require a great deal of experimenting to get it working practically.''\"{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=257}} Edison seemed to hold a view that the very high voltage used in AC systems was too dangerous and that it would take many years to develop a safe and workable system.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=146}} Safety and avoiding the bad press of killing a customer had been one of the goals in designing his DC system{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=174}} and he worried that a death caused by a mis-installed AC system could hold back the use of electricity in general,{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=146}} Edison's understanding of how AC systems worked seemed to be extensive. He noted what he saw as inefficiencies and that, combined with the capital costs in trying to finance very large generating plants, led him to believe there would be very little cost savings in an AC venture.<ref>{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/images/0/0e/Carlson,_Competition_and_Consolidationin_the_Electrical_Manufacturing_Industry.pdf |first=W.

After further prompting, Edison hit out at his chief electric power competitor, George Westinghouse, in what may have been the opening salvo in the war of currents, stating in a December 1887 letter to Southwick that it would be best to use current generated by \"'alternating machines,' manufactured principally in this country by Geo. Westinghouse\".{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=420}} Soon after the execution by electricity bill passed in June 1888, Edison was asked by a New York government official what means would be the best way to implement the state's new form of execution. \"Hire out your criminals as linemen to the New York electric lighting companies\" was Edison's [[tongue in cheek]] answer.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\">{{cite magazine |url=http://simson.net/ref/1989/Edison_and_The_Chairt.pdf |last1=Reynolds |first1=Terry S. |last2=Bernstein |first2=Theodore |title=Edison and \"The Chair\" |magazine=Technology and Society |publisher=[[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] |volume=8 |issue=1 |date=March 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Thomas Alva Edison |journal=[[Scientific American]] |volume=87 |number=26 |date=December 27, 1902 |page=463|doi=10.1038/scientificamerican12271902-463 }}</ref>\n\n==Anti-AC backlash==\nAs the number of deaths attributed to high voltage lighting around the country continued to mount, a cluster of deaths in New York City in the spring of 1888 related to AC arc lighting set off a media frenzy against the \"deadly arc-lighting current\"{{sfnp|Stross|2007|pp=172}} and the seemingly callous lighting companies that used it.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=143}}{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=139\u2013140}} These deaths included a 15-year-old boy killed on April 15 by a broken telegraph line that had been energized with alternating current from a United States Illuminating Company line, a clerk killed two weeks later by an AC line, and a Brush Electric Company lineman killed in May by the AC line he was cutting. The press in New York seemed to switch overnight from stories about electric lights vs gas lighting to \"death by wire\" incidents, with each new report seeming to fan public resentment against high voltage AC and the dangerously tangled overhead electrical wires in the city.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}}{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=143}}\n\n===Harold Brown's crusade===\n[[File:Harold Pitney Brown engineer 1857 1932.png|thumbnail|Electrical engineer Harold Pitney Brown emerged in June 1888 as an anti-AC crusader.]]\nAt this point an electrical engineer named [[Harold P. Brown]], who at that time seemed to have no connection to the Edison company,{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=166}} sent a June 5, 1888 letter to the editor of the ''[[New York Post]]'' claiming the root of the problem was the alternating current (AC) system being used.  Brown argued that the AC system was inherently dangerous and \"damnable\" and asked why the \"public must submit to constant danger from sudden death\" just so utilities could use a cheaper AC system.\n\nAt the beginning of attacks on AC, Westinghouse, in a June 7, 1888 letter, tried to defuse the situation.  He invited Edison to visit him in Pittsburgh and said \"I believe there has been a systemic attempt on the part of some people to do a great deal of mischief and create as great a difference as possible between the Edison Company and The Westinghouse Electric Co., when there ought to be an entirely different condition of affairs\". Edison thanked him but said \"My laboratory work consumes the whole of my time\".{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=167}}\n\nOn June 8, Brown was lobbying in person before the New York Board of Electrical Control, asking that his letter to the paper be read into the meeting's record and demanding severe regulations on AC including limiting power to 300 volts, a level that would make AC next to useless for transmission. There were many rebuttals to Brown's claims in the newspapers and letters to the board, with people pointing out he was showing no scientific evidence that AC was more dangerous than DC. Westinghouse pointed out in letters to various newspapers the number of fires caused by DC equipment and suggested that Brown was obviously being controlled by Edison, something Brown continually denied.\n\nA July edition of ''[[The Electrical Journal]]'' covered Brown's appearance before the New York Board of Electrical Control and the debate in technical societies over the merits of DC and AC and noted that:{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=135}}<ref>''The Electrical Journal'', Volume 21, July 21, 1888, p.415.</ref>\n\n{{cquote|''<big>The battle of the currents is being fought this week in New York.</big>''}}\n\nAt a July meeting Board of Electrical Control, Brown's criticisms of AC and even his knowledge of electricity was challenged by other electrical engineers, some of whom worked for Westinghouse. At this meeting, supporters of AC provided anecdotal stories from electricians on how they had survived shocks from AC at voltages up to 1000 volts and argued that DC was the more dangerous of the two.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=141}}\n\n====Brown's demonstrations====\nBrown, determined to prove alternating current was more dangerous than direct current, at some point contacted Thomas Edison to see if he could make use of equipment to conduct experiments. Edison immediately offered to assist Brown in his crusade against AC companies.  Before long, Brown was loaned space and equipment at Edison's West Orange, New Jersey laboratory, as well as laboratory assistant [[Arthur Kennelly]].\n\nBrown paid local children to collect stray dogs off the street for his experiments with direct and alternating current.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=173}} After much experimentation killing a series of dogs, Brown held a public demonstration on July 30 in a lecture room at [[Columbia University|Columbia College]].{{sfnp|Rockman|2004|p=469}} With many participants shouting for the demonstration to stop and others walking out, Brown subjected a caged dog to several shocks with increasing levels of direct current up to 1000 volts, which the dog survived. Brown then applied 330 volts of alternating current which killed the dog. Four days later he held a second demonstration to answer critics' claims that the DC probably weakened the dog before it died. In this second demonstration, three dogs were killed in quick succession with 300 volts of AC.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=174}} Brown wrote to a college that he was sure this demonstration would get the New York Board of Electrical Control to limit AC installations to 300 volts.

In November George Westinghouse challenged Brown's assertion in the pages of the ''Electrical Engineer'' that the Westinghouse AC systems had caused 30 deaths. The magazine investigated the claim and found at most only two of the deaths could be attributed to Westinghouse installations.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=118}}\n\n===Associating AC and Westinghouse with the electric chair===\nAlthough New York had a criminal procedure code that specified electrocution via an electric chair, it did not spell out the type of electricity, the amount of current, or its method of supply, since these were still relative unknowns.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=102\u2013104}} The New York Medico-Legal Society, an informal society composed of doctors and lawyers, was given the task of working out the details and in late 1888 through early 1889 conducted a series of animal experiments on voltage amounts, electrode design and placement, and skin conductivity. During this time they sought the advice of Harold Brown as a consultant. This ended up expanding the war of currents into the development of the chair and the general debate over capital punishment in the US.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/>\n\nAfter the Medico-Legal Society formed their committee in September 1888 chairman [[Frederick Peterson]], who had been an assistant at Brown's July 1888 public electrocution of dogs with AC at Columbia College,{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=102}} had the results of those experiments submitted to the committee. The claims that AC was more deadly than DC and was the best current to use was questioned with some committee members, pointing out that Brown's experiments were not scientifically carried out and were on animals smaller than a human being. At their November meeting the committee recommended 3000 volts although the type of electricity, [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]], was not determined.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=102}} \n[[File:Harold Pitney Brown edison electrocute horse 1888 New York Medico-Legal Journal vol 6 issue 4.png|thumbnail|Harold Brown demonstrating the killing power of AC to the New York Medico-Legal Society by electrocuting a horse at Thomas Edison's West Orange laboratory.]]\nIn order to more conclusively prove to the committee that AC was more deadly than DC, Brown contacted Edison Electric Light treasurer Francis S. Hastings to arrange the use of the West Orange laboratory.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/> There on December 5, 1888 Brown set up an experiment with members of the press, members of the Medico-Legal Society, the chairman of the death penalty commission, and Thomas Edison looking on. Brown used alternating current for all of his tests on animals larger than a human, including 4 calves and a lame horse, all dispatched with 750 volts of AC.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=152\u2013155}} Based on these results the Medico-Legal Society's December meeting recommended the use of 1000\u20131500 volts of alternating current for executions and newspapers noted the AC used was half the voltage used in the power lines over the streets of American cities.\n\nWestinghouse criticized these tests as a skewed self-serving demonstration designed to be a direct attack on alternating current.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=82}} On December 13 in a letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Westinghouse spelled out where Brown's experiments were wrong and claimed again that Brown was being employed by the Edison company. Brown's December 18 letter refuted the claims and Brown even challenged Westinghouse to an electrical duel, with Brown agreeing to be shocked by ever-increasing amounts of DC power if Westinghouse submitted himself to the same amount of increasing AC power, first to quit loses.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=82}} Westinghouse declined the offer.\n\nIn March 1889 when members of the Medico-Legal Society embarked on another series of tests to work out the details of electrode composition and placement they turned to Brown for technical assistance.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/>{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=225}} Edison treasurer Hastings tried unsuccessfully to obtain a Westinghouse AC generator for the test.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/> They ended up using Edison's West Orange laboratory for the animal tests.\n\nAlso in March, Superintendent of Prisons [[Austin Lathrop (New York)|Austin Lathrop]] asked Brown if he could supply the equipment needed for the executions as well as design the electric chair. Brown turned down the job of designing the chair but did agree to fulfill the contract to supply the necessary electrical equipment.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/> The state refused to pay up front, and Brown apparently turned to Edison Electric as well as Thomson-Houston Electric Company to help obtaining the equipment. This became another behind-the-scenes maneuver to acquire Westinghouse AC generators to supply the current, apparently with the help of the Edison company and Westinghouse's chief AC rival, Thomson-Houston.<ref name=\"ReynoldsBernstein\"/>{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190\u2013195}} Thomson-Houston arranged to acquire three Westinghouse AC generators by replacing them with new Thomson-Houston AC generators. Thomson-Houston president [[Charles A. Coffin|Charles Coffin]] had at least two reasons for obtaining the Westinghouse generators; he did not want his company's equipment to be associated with the death penalty and he wanted to use one to prove a point, paying Brown to set up a public efficiency test to show that Westinghouse's sales claim of manufacturing 50% more efficient generators was false.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=193}}\n\nThat spring Brown published \"The Comparative Danger to Life of the Alternating and Continuous Electrical Current\" detailing the animal experiments done at Edison's lab and claiming they showed AC was far deadlier than DC.{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=106}} This 61-page professionally printed booklet (probably paid for by the Edison company) was sent to government officials, newspapers, and businessmen in towns with populations greater than 5000 inhabitants.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=157}}\n\nIn May 1889 when New York had its first criminal sentenced to be executed in the electric chair, a street merchant named [[William Kemmler]], there was a great deal of discussion in the editorial column of the ''New York Times'' as to what to call the then-new form of execution. The term \"''Westinghouse''d\" was put forward as well as \"''Gerry''cide\" (after death penalty commission head [[Elbridge Thomas Gerry|Elbridge Gerry]]), and \"''Brown''ed\".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}} ''The Times'' hated the word that was eventually adopted, [[electrocution]], describing it as being pushed forward by \"pretentious ignoramuses\".{{sfnp|Moran|2007|p=xxii}} One of Edison's lawyers wrote to his colleague expressing an opinion that Edison's preference for ''dynamort'', ''ampermort'' and ''electromort'' were not good terms but thought ''Westinghouse''d was the best choice.''{{sfnp|Moran|2007|pp=xxi-xxii}}\n\n====The Kemmler appeal====\n[[File:William Kemmler.jpg|thumbnail|After William Kemmler was sentenced to death in the electric chair his appeal was financed by Westinghouse, an attempt to prevent Westinghouse AC generators from being used in an execution, by repealing the electrocution law.]]\nWilliam Kemmler was sentenced to die in the electric chair around June 24, 1889, but before the sentence could be carried out an appeal was filed on the grounds that it constituted [[cruel and unusual punishment]] under the US Constitution. It became obvious to the press and everyone involved that the politically connected (and expensive) lawyer who filed the appeal, [[William Bourke Cockran]], had no connection to the case but did have connection to the Westinghouse company, obviously paying for his services.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=101}}\n\nDuring [[fact-finding]] hearings held around the state beginning on July 9 in New York City, Cockran used his considerable skills as a cross-examiner and [[orator]] to attack Brown, Edison, and their supporters. His strategy was to show that Brown had falsified his test on the killing power of AC and to prove that electricity would not cause certain death and simply lead to torturing the condemned. In cross examination he questioned Brown's lack of credentials in the electrical field and brought up possible collusion between Brown and Edison, which Brown again denied. Many witnesses were called by both sides to give firsthand anecdotal accounts about encounters with electricity and evidence was given by medical professionals on the human body's nervous system and the electrical conductivity of skin. Brown was accused of fudging his tests on animals, hiding the fact that he was using lower [[electric current|current]] DC and high-current AC.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=119}} When the hearing convened for a day at Edison's West Orange lab to witness demonstrations of skin resistance to electricity, Brown almost got in a fight with a Westinghouse representative, accusing him of being in the Edison laboratory to conduct [[industrial espionage]].{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=115}} Newspapers noted the often contradictory testimony was raising public doubts about the electrocution law but after Edison took the stand many accepted assurances from the \"wizard of Menlo Park\" that 1000 volts of AC would easily kill any man.{{sfnp|Brandon|1999|p=125}}\n\nAfter the gathered testimony was submitted and the two sides presented their case, Judge Edwin Day ruled against Kemmler's appeal on October 9 and US Supreme Court denied Kemmler's appeal on May 23, 1890.{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=120}}\n\nWhen the chair was first used, on August 6, 1890, the technicians on hand misjudged the voltage needed to kill William Kemmler. After the first jolt of electricity Kemmler was found to be still breathing. The procedure had to be repeated and a reporter on hand described it as \"an awful spectacle, far worse than hanging.\" George Westinghouse commented: \"They would have done better using an axe.\"{{sfnp|McNichol|2006|p=125}}\n\n===Brown's collusion exposed===\nOn August 25, 1889 the [[New York Sun]] ran a story headlined:\n{{cquote|\"''For Shame, Brown! \u2013 Disgraceful Facts About the Electric Killing Scheme; Queer Work for a State's Expert; Paid by One Electric Company to Injure Another''\"}}\n\nThe story was based on 45 letters stolen from Brown's office that spelled out Brown's collusion with Thomson-Houston and Edison Electric. The majority of the letters were correspondence between Brown and Thomson-Houston on the topic of acquiring the three Westinghouse generators for the state of New York as well as using one of them in an efficiency test. They also showed that Brown had received $5,000 from Edison Electric to purchase the surplus Westinghouse generators from Thomson-Houston. Further Edison involvement was contained in letters from Edison treasurer Hastings asking Brown to send anti-AC pamphlets to all the legislators in the state of [[Missouri]] (at the company's expense), Brown requesting that a letter of recommendation from Thomas Edison be sent to Scranton, PA, as well as Edison and Arthur Kennelly coaching Brown in his upcoming testimony in the Kemmler appeal trial.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190\u2013195}}<ref name=\"inventionandtech.com\">{{cite journal |url=http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/inventing-electrocution-1?page=show |first=James F. |last=Penrose |title=Inventing Electrocution |year=1994 |journal=[[American Heritage of Invention & Technology]] |volume=9 |number=4 |pages=34\u201344 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225124748/http://www.inventionandtech.com/content/inventing-electrocution-1 |archivedate=February 25, 2015}}</ref>{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=191\u2013198}}\n\nBrown was not slowed down by this revelation and characterized his efforts to expose Westinghouse as the same as going after a grocer who sells poison and calls it sugar.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=190\u2013195}}<ref name=\"inventionandtech.com\"/>{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|pp=191\u2013198}}\n\n===The \"Electric Wire Panic\"===\n[[File:John Feeks Western Union lineman killed by AC October 11 1889.png|thumb|The death of Western Union Lineman John Feeks led to laws finally being passed to move AC lines underground in New York City.]]\n\n1889 saw another round of deaths attributed to alternating current including a lineman in Buffalo, New York, four linemen in New York City, and a New York fruit merchant who was killed when the display he was using came in contact with an overhead line. NYC Mayor [[Hugh J. Grant]], in a meeting with the Board of Electrical Control and the AC electric companies, rejected the claims that the AC lines were perfectly safe saying \"we get news of all who touch them through the coroners office\".{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=263}} On October 11, 1889, John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below. The source of the power that killed Feeks was not determined although United States Illuminating Company lines ran nearby.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}\n\nFeeks' public death sparked a new round of people fearing the electric lines over their heads in what has been called the \"Electric Wire Panic\".{{sfnp|Klein|2010}} The blame seemed to settle on Westinghouse since, Westinghouse having bought many of the lighting companies involved, people assumed Feeks' death was the fault of a Westinghouse subsidiary.{{sfnp|Klein|2010}} Newspapers joined into the public outcry following Feeks' death, pointing out men's lives \"were cheaper to this monopoly than insulated wires\" and calling for the executives of AC companies to be charged with [[manslaughter]]. The October 13, 1889, New Orleans ''[[Times-Picayune]]'' noted \"Death does not stop at the door, but comes right into the house, and perhaps as you are closing a door or turning on the gas you are killed.\"{{sfnp|Essig|2009|pp=217}} Harold Brown's reputation was rehabilitated almost overnight with newspapers and magazines seeking his opinion and reporters following him around New York City where he measured how much current was leaking from AC power lines.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=218}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Edison 1.png|thumbnail|left|The death of Feeks marked the first time Edison publicly denounced alternating current.]]\nAt the peak of the war of currents, Edison himself joined the public debate for the first time, denounced AC current in a November 1889 article in the ''[[North American Review]]'' titled \"The Dangers of Electric Lighting\". Edison put forward the view that burying the high-voltage lines was not a solution, and would simply move the deaths underground and be a \"constant menace\" that could short with other lines threatening people's homes and lives.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=200}} He stated the only way to make AC safe was to limit its voltage and vowed Edison Electric would never adopt AC as long as he was in charge.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}\n\nGeorge Westinghouse was suddenly put in the role of a villain trying to defend pole-mounted AC installations that he knew were unsafe and fumbled at reporters' questions trying to point out all the other things in a large city that were more dangerous.{{sfnp|Klein|2010}}{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}} The next month he did better in his response printed in the ''North American Review'', pointing out that his AC/transformer system actually used lower household voltages than the Edison DC system. He also pointed out 87 deaths in one year caused by street cars and gas lighting versus only 5 accidental electrocutions and no in-home deaths attributed to AC current.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=179}}\n\nThe crowd that watched Feeks contained many New York [[aldermen]] due to the site of the accident being near the New York government offices and the horrifying affair galvanized them into the action of passing the law on moving utilities underground.{{sfnp|Stross|2007|p=178}} The electric companies involved obtained an injunction preventing their lines from being cut down immediately but shut down most of their lighting until the situation was settled, plunging many New York streets into darkness.{{sfnp|Klein|2010|p=292}} The legislation ordering the cutting down of all of the utility lines was finally upheld by the [[New York Supreme Court]]{{which|date=July 2019}} in December. The AC lines were cut down keeping many New York City streets in darkness for the rest of the winter since little had been done by the overpaid [[Tammany Hall]] city supervisors who were supposed to see to building the underground \"subways\" to house them.{{sfnp|Jonnes|2003|p=200}}\n\n==The current war ends==\nEven with the Westinghouse propaganda losses, the war of currents itself was winding down with direct current on the losing side. This was due in part to Thomas Edison himself leaving the electric power business.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=125\u2013126}} Edison was becoming marginalized in his own company having lost majority control in the 1889 merger that formed Edison General Electric.<ref name=\"Sloat1979,316\">{{cite book |first=Warren |last=Sloat |title=1929: America Before the Crash |location=New York |publisher=Macmillan |year=1979 |page=[https://archive.org/details/1929americabefor00sloa/page/316 316] |isbn=978-0-02611-800-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/1929americabefor00sloa/page/316 }}</ref> In 1890 he told president [[Henry Villard]] he thought it was time to retire from the lighting business and moved on to an iron ore refining project that preoccupied his time.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} Edison's dogmatic anti-AC values were no longer controlling the company. By 1889 Edison's Electric's own subsidiaries were lobbying to add AC power transmission to their systems and in October 1890 [[Edison Machine Works]] began developing AC-based equipment.\n\nWith Thomas Edison no longer involved with Edison General Electric, the war of currents came to a close with a financial merger.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120-121}} Edison president Henry Villard, who had engineered the merger that formed Edison General Electric, was continually working on the idea of merging that company with Thomson-Houston or Westinghouse. He saw a real opportunity in 1891. The market was in a general downturn causing cash shortages for all the companies concerned and Villard was in talks with Thomson-Houston, which was now Edison General Electric's biggest competitor. Thomson-Houston had a habit of saving money on development by buying, or sometimes stealing, patents. Patent conflicts were stymieing the growth of both companies and the idea of saving on some 60 ongoing lawsuits as well as saving on profit losses of trying to undercut each other by selling generating plants below cost pushed forward the idea of this merger in financial circles.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}}<ref name=\"Sloat1979,316\"/> Edison hated the idea and tried to hold it off but Villard thought his company, now winning its incandescent light patent lawsuits in the courts, was in a position to dictate the terms of any merger.{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} As a committee of financiers, which included [[J.P. Morgan]], worked on the deal in early 1892 things went against Villard. In Morgan's view Thomson-Houston looked on the books to be the stronger of the two companies and engineered a behind the scenes deal announced on April 15, 1892, that put the management of Thomson-Houston in control of the new company, now called [[General Electric]] (dropping Edison's name). Thomas Edison was not aware of the deal until the day before it happened.\n\nThe fifteen electric companies that existed 5 years before had merged down to two; General Electric and Westinghouse. The war of currents came to an end and this merger of the Edison company, along with its lighting patents, and the Thomson-Houston, with its AC patents, created a company that controlled three quarters of the US electrical business.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}{{sfnp|Bradley|2011|pp=28\u201329}} From this point on General Electric and Westinghouse were both marketing alternating current systems.<ref name=\"Garud2009,249\">{{cite book |first1=Raghu |last1=Garud |first2=Arun |last2=Kumaraswamy |first3=Richard |last3=Langlois |title=Managing in the Modular Age: Architectures, Networks, and Organizations |location=New York |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |year=2009 |page=249 |isbn=978-1-40514-194-9}}</ref> Edison put on a brave face noting to the media how his stock had gained value in the deal but privately he was bitter that his company and all of his patents had been turned over to the competition.{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nEven though the institutional war of currents had ended in a financial merger the technical difference between direct and alternating current systems followed a much longer technical merger.{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120\u2013121}} Due to innovation in the US and Europe, alternating current's economy of scale with very large generating plants linked to loads via long distance transmission was slowly being combined with the ability to link it up with all of the existing systems that needed to be supplied. These included single phase AC systems, poly-phase AC systems, low voltage incandescent lighting, high voltage arc lighting, and existing DC motors in factories and street cars. In the engineered ''universal system'' these technological differences were temporarily being bridged via the development of [[rotary converter]]s and [[motor\u2013generator]]s that allowed the large number of legacy systems to be connected to the AC grid.<ref name=\"Garud2009,249\"/>{{sfnp|Hughes|1993|pp=120\u2013121}} These stopgaps were slowly replaced as older systems were retired or upgraded.\n\nIn May 1892 Westinghouse Electric managed to underbid General Electric on the contract to electrify the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago and, although they made no profit, their demonstration of a safe and effective highly flexible universal alternating current system powering all of the disparate electrical systems at the Exposition led to them winning the bid at the end of that year to build an AC power station at [[Niagara Falls]]. General Electric was awarded contracts to build AC transmission lines and transformers in that project and further bids at Niagara were split with GE who were quickly catching up in the AC field{{sfnp|Essig|2009|p=268}} due partly to [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]], a Prussian mathematician who was the first person to fully understand AC power from a solid mathematical standpoint. General Electric hired many talented new engineers to improve its design of transformers, generators, motors and other apparatus.<ref>''The General Electric Story'', The Hall of History.</ref>\n\nPatent lawsuits were still hampering both companies and bleeding off cash, so in 1896, J. P. Morgan engineered a patent sharing agreement between the two companies that remained in force for 11 years.{{sfnp|Skrabec|2007|p=190}}\n\nIn 1897 Edison sold his remaining stock in Edison Electric Illuminating of New York to finance his iron ore refining prototype plant.<ref>{{cite book |first=Ernest |last=Freeberg |title=The Age of Edison: Electric Light and the Invention of Modern America |location=New York |publisher=The Penguin Press |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-59420-426-5 |url=https://archive.org/details/ageofedison00erne }}</ref> In 1908 Edison said to George Stanley, son of AC transformer inventor [[William Stanley, Jr.]], \"Tell your father I was wrong\", probably admitting he had underestimated the developmental potential of alternating current.{{sfnp|Higonnet|Landes|Rosovsky|1991|p=113}}\n\n===Remnant and existent DC systems===\nSome cities continued to use DC well into the 20th century. For example, central [[Helsinki]] had a DC network until the late 1940s, and Stockholm lost its dwindling DC network as late as the 1970s. A [[mercury-arc valve]] rectifier station could convert AC to DC where networks were still used. Parts of Boston, Massachusetts, along Beacon Street and Commonwealth Avenue still used 110 volts DC in the 1960s, causing the destruction of many small appliances (typically hair dryers and phonographs) used by [[Boston University]] students, who ignored warnings about the electricity supply. New York City's electric utility company, [[Consolidated Edison]], continued to supply direct current to customers who had adopted it early in the twentieth century, mainly for elevators. The [[New Yorker Hotel]], constructed in 1929, had a large direct-current power plant and did not convert fully to alternating-current service until well into the 1960s.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Tom |last=Blalock |title=Powering the New Yorker: A Hotel's Unique Direct Current System |magazine=Power and Energy |publisher=IEEE |volume=4 |issue=1 |date=23 January 2006 |doi=10.1109/MPAE.2006.1578536}}</ref> This was the building in which AC pioneer [[Nikola Tesla]] spent his last years, and where he died in 1943. New York City's Broadway theaters continued to use DC services until 1975, requiring the use of outmoded manual resistance dimmer boards operated by several stagehands. This practice ended when the musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' introduced computerized lighting control and thyristor (SCR) dimmers to Broadway, and New York theaters were finally converted to AC.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Tom |last=Blalock |title=History and reflections on the way things were: Edison's Direct Current Influenced \"Broadway\" Show Lighting |magazine=Power and Engineering Review |publisher=IEEE |volume=22 |issue=10 |date=October 2002 |issn=0272-1724}}</ref> \n\nIn January 1998, Consolidated Edison started to eliminate DC service.

It was the last group to be selected during the [[Project Apollo]] era, and the first since the [[Mercury Seven]] in which all members were active-duty military personnel, and all made flights into space. After the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) project was cancelled, NASA accepted the seven youngest MOL astronauts. By the time they joined NASA, all Apollo flight assignments had been lined up, but they were given non-flying support assignments for [[Project Apollo]], [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. Group 7 went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] pilots, upgrading to commander after their first flight, and flying 17 missions between them.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Manned Orbiting Laboratory}}\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was already working on a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} In response to a January 1958 request from the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]], the USAF put forward a proposal for a manned space program called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS) that would use [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor rockets]] to lift a simple ballistic capsule into orbit.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=77, 91}} But on August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). NASA's [[Project Mercury]] replaced Man in Space Soonest, and [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest (but not Dyna-Soar) to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}}\n\nThis did not end the USAF's interest in space. NASA was a civilian program, but there were military aspects of space exploration as well. In particular, the USAF was interested in reconnaissance from space. This was the time of the [[Cold War]], and there was intense interest in the Soviet Union's military and industrial capabilities. The [[1960 U-2 incident|downing]] of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960 left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill. The original intention was that Dyna-Soar would be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket and perform these missions. On 1961 the new [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], ordered that Dyna-Soar be launched into orbit. On 25 August 1962, the [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]] ordered the Commander of the [[Air Force Systems Command]], [[General (United States)|Bernard A. Schriever]], to prepare studies of a manned spy satellite, which became the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL). A Dyna-Soar pilot, Albert H. Crews, was transferred to the MOL program. {{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} Shriever became MOL's project director, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=14}}  Initially, it was proposed that MOL would be serviced by Dyna-Soar, but McNamara cancelled Dyna-Soar on December 10, 1963, and decided that MOL would use a modified [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft instead.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} MOL was a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]] spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n== Selection ==\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS)on October 12, 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11-13}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi-xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Shriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ATPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] on [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronauts groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2-3}}\n\nThe MOL Program was publicly approved by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] on August 15, 1965.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=13}} For the selection of first three NASA astronaut groups in [[Mercury Seven|1959]], [[NASA Astronaut Group 2|1962]] and [[NASA Astronaut Group 3|1963]], the USAF had established a selection board to review candidates before forwarding their names to NASA. The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Shriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On September 15, the selection criteria for was MOL astronauts was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL astronauts were publicly announced on November 12, 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J. Adams]], USAF;\n* Major [[Albert H. Crews|Albert H. Crews Jr.]], USAF;\n* [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] [[John L. Finley]], USN;\n* [[Captain (United States O-3)|Captain]] [[Richard E. Lawyer]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Lachlan Macleay]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Francis G. Neubeck]], USAF;\n* Major [[James M. Taylor]], USAF; and\n* Lieutenant [[Richard H. Truly]], USN.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nAround this time, the USAF began selecting a second group of MOL astronauts. This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL Program Office selected 25 of these, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected.The names of the second group of MOL astronauts were publicly announced on June 17, 1966:\n* Captain [[Karol J. Bobko]], USAF;\n* Lieutenant [[Robert L. Crippen]], USN;\n* Captain [[C. Gordon Fullerton]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Henry W. Hartsfield]], USAF; and\n* Captain [[Robert F. Overmyer]], USMC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=23-25}}\nBobko became the first graduate of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] to be selected as an astronaut.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|p=26}}\n\nEight other finalists had not yet completed the ARPS course. One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on May 11, 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on June 30, 1967, at a press conference in Los Angeles:\n* Major [[James A. Abrahamson]], USAF;\n* [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Robert T. Herres]], USAF;\n* Major [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.|Robert H. Lawrence Jr]]., USAF; and \n* Major [[Donald H. Peterson]], USAF.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=26-28}}\nLawrence was the first [[African-American]] to be selected as an astronaut. He might have become the first one to become a NASA astronaut, but was killed in an [[F-104]] crash at Edwards Air Force Base on December 8,1967.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=40-41}}\n\n== Transfer to NASA ==\nThroughout the MOL Program there was debate over the necessity of a manned spy satellite as opposed to an unmanned one, given the difficulty, danger and expense involved. The technologies required for both were still immature, and In many ways, the two benefited from each other, so the USAF continued to pursue both.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=69-72}} The rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]] affected both military and civil space programs, and in November 1965 the MOL Program's funding for [[fiscal year]] 1967 was cut by 60 percent, delaying the first flight until April 1969. At the same time, the cost of the MOL Program had blown out significantly. Originally costed at $1.5 billion, the cost had more than doubled, and by 1968 it was consuming about 17% of the Air Force Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget. Budget cuts only delayed the program further, and the first manned flight had been pushed back to December 1971. In turn, each slip made the project harder to justify. Seeing little hope of flying in space, Adams left the program in July 1966, and Finley in April 1968.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=76-79}} The axe finally fell on June 10, 1969, when the MOL Project was cancelled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} \n\nAt this point, fourteen MOL astronauts remained in the program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} All but Herres wanted to transfer to NASA. They flew to Houston to meet with NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]]. Slayton told them that he did not need more astronauts; he already had more than he needed for a diminishing number of [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Apollo Applications Program]] flights. [[Robert R. Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], agreed with him. But [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] NASA's Deputy Administrator, saw things differently: sooner or later NASA would need help from the USAF, and maintaining good relations with it was good policy. A compromise was agreed upon; Slayton and Gilruth agreed to take those who met its age limit of 36. Seven of the thirteen were 36 or younger, and were accepted into the NASA Astronaut Corps. NASA also took Crews, although not as an astronaut, and he would continue flying aircraft for NASA until 1994. NASA's acceptance of the seven MOL astronauts was announced on August 14, 1969.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=91-92}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=249-251}}<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Years Ago: NASA Group 7 Astronaut Selection  |publisher= NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-nasa-group-7-astronaut-selection |access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Group members ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" | Career\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | ref\n|-\n|[[File:Bobko.jpg|200px|alt=Portrait]]\n|data-sort-value=Bobko|[[Karol J.

The first rung on the ladder was selection to a mission support crew. Fullerton served on the support crews for the Apollo 14 and 17 lunar landing missions, and was CAPCOM for Apollo 14, 15, 16 and 17.  Hartsfield and Peterson were part of the support crew of Apollo 16, and Overmyer of Apollo 17, and they shared CAPCOM duties on those missions.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=270-271}} Crippen, Hartsfield and Truly served on the support crews for the Skylab missions,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=304-305}}  and Bobko, Crippen, Overmyer and Truly served on the support crew for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=308-309}}\n\nOn February 24, 1976, NASA announced the two crews of two astronauts to fly the Approach and Landing Tests in the {{OV|101|full=nolink}}. In each case, one of the MOL astronauts was paired with one of the members of [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] who had already flown in space. The commander of the first crew was [[Fred Haise]], with Fullerton as pilot, and the second was commanded by [[Joe Engle]], with Truly as pilot. By this time, only 31 of the 73 pilot and scientist astronauts selected between 1959 and 1969 remained with NASA; they would soon be outnumbered by the [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|35 newcomers]] selected in 1978.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=314-315}}\n\nThe pattern of a senior astronaut flying as command with a member of the seven MOL astronauts as pilot was followed for the first six Space Shuttle missions, after which all had flown. Ironically, given that they had trained for Gemini spacecraft in which they would work in pairs, the April 1983 [[STS-6]] mission was the only one in which two of them flew on the same mission. Peterson's extravehicular activity on that mission, the first in the Space Shuttle program, would be the only one conducted by a member of the group, all the other members of which would go on to fly at least one more mission, but as commander before they retired.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=324-331}}  \n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Eppley |first=Charles V. |title=History of the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School 4 February 1951 \u2013 12 October 1961 |location=Edwards Air Force Base |publisher=United States Air Force |date=March 1963 |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/400112.pdf |access-date=5 February 2019 |oclc=831992420 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Homer |first=Courtney V.

It was the last group to be selected during the [[Project Apollo]] era, and the first since the [[Mercury Seven]] in which all members were active-duty military personnel, and all made flights into space. After the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL) project was cancelled, NASA accepted the seven youngest MOL astronauts. By the time they joined NASA, all Apollo flight assignments had been lined up, but they were given non-flying support assignments for [[Project Apollo]], [[Skylab]] and the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. Group 7 went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] pilots, upgrading to commander after their first flight, and flying 17 missions between them.\n\n== Background ==\n{{main|Manned Orbiting Laboratory}}\nThe launch of the [[Sputnik 1]] satellite by the [[Soviet Union]] on October 4, 1957, started a [[Cold War]] technological and ideological competition with the United States known as the [[Space Race]]. The demonstration of American technological inferiority came as a profound shock to the American public.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=28\u201329, 37}}{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=1}} The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) was already working on a delta-wing, rocket-propelled glider that came to be called the [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar]].{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|p=71}} In response to a January 1958 request from the [[Office of the Secretary of Defense]], the USAF put forward a proposal for a manned space program called [[Man in Space Soonest]] (MISS) that would use [[Thor (rocket family)|Thor rockets]] to lift a simple ballistic capsule into orbit.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=77, 91}} But on August 18, 1958, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to transfer responsibility for manned space flight to the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA). NASA's [[Project Mercury]] replaced Man in Space Soonest, and [[Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald A. Quarles]] transferred $53.8 million that that had been set aside for USAF space projects, including Man in Space Soonest (but not Dyna-Soar) to NASA.{{sfn|Swenson|Grimwood|Alexander|1966|pp=101-102}}\n\nThis did not end the USAF's interest in space. NASA was a civilian program, but there were military aspects of space exploration as well. In particular, the USAF was interested in reconnaissance from space. This was the time of the [[Cold War]], and there was intense interest in the Soviet Union's military and industrial capabilities. The [[1960 U-2 incident|downing]] of a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] spy plane in 1960 left a gap in American espionage capabilities that it was hoped that spy satellites would be able to fill. The original intention was that Dyna-Soar would be launched into space on a suborbital ballistic trajectory by a [[Titan (rocket family)|Titan]] rocket and perform these missions. On 1961 the new [[Secretary of Defense]], [[Robert McNamara]], ordered that Dyna-Soar be launched into orbit. On 25 August 1962, the [[Secretary of the Air Force]], [[Eugene Zuckert]] ordered the Commander of the [[Air Force Systems Command]], [[General (United States)|Bernard A. Schriever]], to prepare studies of a manned spy satellite, which became the [[Manned Orbiting Laboratory]] (MOL). A Dyna-Soar pilot, Albert H. Crews, was transferred to the MOL program. {{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} Shriever became MOL's project director, reporting directly to the Secretary of the Air Force.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=14}}  Initially, it was proposed that MOL would be serviced by Dyna-Soar, but McNamara cancelled Dyna-Soar on December 10, 1963, and decided that MOL would use a modified [[Project Gemini]] spacecraft instead.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=2-3}} MOL was a semi-secret project, with a public face but a covert reconnaissance mission, similar to that of the [[Corona (satellite)|Discoverer]] spy satellite program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=8}}\n\n== Selection ==\n[[File:Manned Orbiting Laboratory Astronaut Group 1.jpg|thumb|right|First MOL astronaut group.

Four classes were conducted between June 1961, and May 1963. The third class received instruction on Dyna-Soar as part of the course. The USAF Experimental Test Pilot School was renamed the Aerospace Research Pilot School (ARPS)on October 12, 1961.{{sfn|Eppley|1963|pp=11-13}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=xxvi-xxvii}} When it came to selecting astronauts for MOL, the commandant of the ARPS, Shriever took the advice of [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Chuck Yeager|Charles E. \"Chuck\" Yeager]], the commandant of the ARPS, and restricted selection to ATPS graduates. No call for volunteers was issued; fifteen candidates were selected and ordered to report to [[Brooks Air Force Base]] on [[San Antonio, Texas]], for a week of medical evaluation in October 1964. The evaluations were similar to those conducted for the NASA astronauts groups.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=2-3}}\n\nThe MOL Program was publicly approved by President [[Lyndon B.

The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|Chief of Staff of the USAF]], General [[John P. McConnell]], told Shriever he expected the selection of MOL astronauts to follow the same procedure. Accordingly, a selection board was convened in September 1965, chaired by [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Jerry D. Page]]. On September 15, the selection criteria for was MOL astronauts was announced.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}} Candidates had to be:\n* Qualified military pilots;\n* Graduates of the ARPS;\n* Serving officers, recommended by their commanding officers; and\n* Holding US citizenship from birth.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nThe names of the first group of eight MOL astronauts were publicly announced on November 12, 1965:\n* [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Michael J.

Truly]], USN.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=5-6}}\n\nAround this time, the USAF began selecting a second group of MO:L astronauts. This time applications were called for, and the process was run concurrently with selection for [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]]. Over 500 applications were received, from which the names of 100 candidates were forwarded to USAF headquarters. The MOL Program Office selected 25 of these, who were sent to Brooks Air Force Base for physical evaluation in January and February 1966. Five were selected.The names of the second group of MOL astronauts were publicly announced on June 17, 1966:\n* Captain [[Karol J. Bobko]], USAF;\n* Lieutenant [[Robert L. Crippen]], USN;\n* Captain [[C. Gordon Fullerton]], USAF;\n* Captain [[Henry W. Hartsfield]], USAF; and\n* Captain [[Robert F. Overmyer]], USMC.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=23-25}}\nBobko became the first graduate of the [[United States Air Force Academy]] to be selected as an astronaut.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|p=26}}\n\nEight other finalists had not yet completed the ARPS course. One was already attending; the other seven were sent to Edwards Air Force Base to join Class 66B. They would be considered for the next MOL astronaut intake. The MOL Astronaut Selection Board met again on May 11, 1967, and recommended that four of the eight be appointed. The MOL Program Office announced names of those selected for the third group of MOL astronauts on June 30, 1967, at a press conference in Los Angeles:\n* Major [[James A. Abrahamson]], USAF;\n* [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Robert T. Herres]], USAF;\n* Major [[Robert Henry Lawrence Jr.|Robert H. Lawrence Jr]]., USAF; and \n* Major [[Donald H. Peterson]], USAF.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=29}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=26-28}}\nLawrence was the first [[African-American]] to be selected as an astronaut. He might have become the first one to become a NASA astronaut, but was killed in an [[F-104]] crash at Edwards Air Force Base on December 8,1967.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=40-41}}\n\n== Transfer to NASA ==\nThroughout the MOL Program there was debate over the necessity of a manned spy satellite as opposed to an unmanned one, given the difficulty, danger and expense involved. The technologies required for both were still immature, and In many ways, the two benefited from each other, so the USAF continued to pursue both.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=69-72}} The rising cost of the [[Vietnam War]] affected both military and civil space programs, and in November 1965 the MOL Program's funding for [[fiscal year]] 1967 was cut by 60 percent, delaying the first flight until April 1969. At the same time, the cost of the MOL Program had blown out significantly. Originally costed at $1.5 billion, the cost had more than doubled, and by 1968 it was consuming about 17% of the Air Force Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation budget. Budget cuts only delayed the program further, and the first manned flight had been pushed back to December 1971. In turn, each slip made the project harder to justify. Seeing little hope of flying in space, Adams left the program in July 1966, and Finley in April 1968.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=76-79}} The axe finally fell on June 10, 1969, when the MOL Project was cancelled.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} \n\nAt this point, fourteen MOL astronauts remained in the program.{{sfn|Homer|2019|p=87}} All but Herres wanted to transfer to NASA. They flew to Houston to meet with NASA's Director of Flight Crew Operations, [[Deke Slayton]]. Slayton told them that he did not need more astronauts; he already had more than he needed for a diminishing number of [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] and [[Apollo Applications Program]] flights. [[Robert R. Gilruth]], the director of the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], agreed with him. But [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]] NASA's Deputy Administrator, saw things differently: sooner or later NASA would need help from the USAF, and maintaining good relations with it was good policy. A compromise was agreed upon; Slayton and Gilruth agreed to take those who met its age limit of 36. Seven of the thirteen were 36 or younger, and were accepted into the NASA Astronaut Corps. NASA also took Crews, although not as an astronaut, and he would continue flying aircraft for NASA until 1994. NASA's acceptance of the seven MOL astronauts was announced on August 14, 1969.{{sfn|Homer|2019|pp=91-92}}{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=249-251}}<ref>{{cite web |title=50 Years Ago: NASA Group 7 Astronaut Selection  |publisher= NASA |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/50-years-ago-nasa-group-7-astronaut-selection |access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Group members ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Image\n! scope=\"col\" | Name\n! scope=\"col\" | Born\n! scope=\"col\" | Died\n! scope=\"col\" | Career\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | ref\n|-\n|[[File:Bobko.jpg|200px|alt=Portrait]]\n|data-sort-value=Bobko|[[Karol J.

The first rung on the ladder was selection to a mission support crew. Fullerton served on the support crews for the Apollo 14 and 17 lunar landing missions, and was CAPCOM for Apollo 14, 15, 16 and 17.  Hartsfield and Peterson were part of the support crew of Apollo 16, and Overmyer of Apollo 17, and they shared CAPCOM duties on those missions.{{sfn|Orloff|2000|pp=270-271}} Crippen, Hartsfield and Truly served on the support crews for the Skylab missions,{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=304-305}}  and Bobko, Crippen, Overmyer and Truly served on the support crew for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=308-309}}\n\nOn February 24, 1976, NASA announced the two crews of two astronauts to fly the Approach and Landing Tests in the {{OV|101|full=nolink}}. In each case, one of the MOL astronauts was paired with one of the members of [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] who had already flown in space. The commander of the first crew was [[Fred Haise]], with Fullerton as pilot, and the second was commanded by [[Joe Engle]], with Truly as pilot. By this time, only 31 of the 73 pilot and scientist astronauts selected between 1959 and 1969 remained with NASA; they would soon be outnumbered by the [[NASA Astronaut Group 8|35 newcomers]] selected in 1978.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=314-315}}\n\nThe pattern of a senior astronaut flying as command with a member of the seven MOL astronauts as pilot was followed for the first six Space Shuttle missions, after which all had flown. Ironically, given that they had trained for Gemini spacecraft in which they would work in pairs, the April 1983 [[STS-6]] mission was the only one in which two of them flew on the same mission. Peterson's extravehicular activity on that mission, the first in the Space Shuttle program, would be the only one conducted by a member of the group, all the other members of which would go on to fly at least one more mission, but as commander before they retired.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2017|pp=324-331}}  \n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |last=Eppley |first=Charles V. |title=History of the USAF Experimental Test Pilot School 4 February 1951 \u2013 12 October 1961 |location=Edwards Air Force Base |publisher=United States Air Force |date=March 1963 |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/400112.pdf |access-date=5 February 2019 |oclc=831992420 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Homer |first=Courtney V.
