They were the almost universal introductory literary texts for students, almost exclusively boys, from elite backgrounds and even for a number of ordinary villagers.  Each was available in many versions, printed cheaply, and available to all since they did not become superseded. When a student had memorized all three, he had a knowledge of roughly 2,000 characters.

classic [[Chinese language|Chinese]] text composed of common [[Chinese surname]]s. The book was composed in the early [[Song dynasty]].<ref name=\"KS\">K. S. Tom. [1989] (1989). Echoes from Old China: Life, Legends and Lore of the Middle Kingdom.

Tuttle Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8048-1877-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the dynasties following the Song, the ''[[Three Character Classic]]'', the ''Hundred Family Surnames'', and ''[[Thousand Character Classic]]'' came to be known as ''San Bai Qian'' (Three, Hundred, Thousand), from the first character in their titles.  They were the almost universal introductory literary texts for students, almost exclusively boys, from elite backgrounds and even for a number of ordinary villagers.  Each was available in many versions, printed cheaply, and available to all since they did not become superseded. When a student had memorized all three, he had a knowledge of roughly 2,000 characters. Since Chinese did not use an alphabet, this was an effective, though time-consuming, way of giving a \"crash course\" in character recognition before going on to understanding texts and writing characters.{{sfnp|Rawski|1979|pp=46\u201348}}\n\nThe ''Hundred Family Surnames'' was translated into [[Manchu language|Manchu]] as {{MongolUnicode|\u182a\u185d \u1864\u1873\u1836\u1820 \u1830\u1873\u1829}} (Wylie: Pe giya sing, [[Transliterations of Manchu|M\u00f6llendorff]]: Be giya sing).\n\n==Form==\nThe work is a rhyming poem in lines of eight characters.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so.

[[Emperor Yao]] conferred on Hui Lian the title of Viscount \u5b50 (but the nobility system of ancient China is still not clear) and the state of Can'hu \u53c3\u80e1 (in present-day region of [[Fenyang]], [[Shanxi]] province). [[Emperor Yao]] renamed Can'hu as [[State of Huang]], and bestowed on Hui Lian the surname Huang \u9ec3 and the name \"Yun\" \u96f2. Hence, Hui Lian was also known as Huang Yun \u9ec3\u96f2 or Nan Lu \u5357\u9646. Hui Lian became the Progenitor of the Huang surname clan. During Western Zhou dynasty, the rulers of the Huang State was given the title of Duke \u516c. The descendants of Huang Yun (Hui Lian) ruled the Huang State of Shanxi until the early [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722 BC-481 BC) when it was conquered by the State of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]].\n\nAnother lineage of Huang Clan from the Yellow Emperor is as follows:\n1) [[Yellow Emperor]] \u9ec3\u5e1d -> 2) [[Shaohao|Shao Hao]] \u5c11\u660a -> 3) Jiao Ji \u5b0c\u6975 -> 4) Hui Gong \u63ee\u516c -> 5) Mei \u6627 -> 6) Tai Tai \u81fa\u99d8. Tai Tai helped [[Zhuanxu| Zhuan Xu Emperor]] \u9853\u980a, and he and his descendants (Jin Tian Clan \u91d1\u5929\u6c0f) were enfeoffed with Fen Zhou \u6c7e\u5dde at Fen River \u6c7e\u6cb3 which was further divided into four kingdoms - [[Huang (state)|Huang Kingdom]] \u9ec3\u570b, [[Sh\u011bn (state)|Shen Kingdom]] \u6c88\u570b, Ru Kingdom \u84d0\u570b and Si Kingdom \u59d2\u570b.\n\n===Development and emigration===\nIn 891 BC [[King Xiao of Zhou]] conferred on the 53rd generation descendant of Hui Lian, Huang Xi \u9ec3\u7199 (aka Huang Shi \u9ec3\u77f3) the nobility of 'Hou' \u4faf (marquis) and a fiefdom in the region east of the Han river \u6f22\u6c34 (in present-day region of [[Yicheng, Hubei|Yicheng]], [[Hubei]] province) called 'Huang' \u9ec3 (Not to be confused with the Huang State of Fenyang, Shanxi) with the four states Jiang \u6c5f, Huang \u9ec3 (founded by \u4f2f\u76ca Bo Yi's descendants), [[Dao (state)|Dao]] \u9053, and Bo \u67cf in the Huang river \u6f62\u6c34 valley as vassals. The Huang State of [[Yicheng, Hubei|Yicheng]], [[Hubei]] was known as the Western [[Huang (state)|Huang]] (Xi Huang \u897f\u9ec3) in history.\n\nDuring the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] (265-420), when northern China was invaded by the barbarian tribes, many northerners (especially the aristocratic clans) moved to south China with the Jin court. It was during this period that the Huang clansmen migrated to [[Fujian]].\n\nAccording to Min Shu \u95a9\u66f8 (Book of Min) (Quoted from Chung Yoon-Ngan):\n\"During the second year (of the reign) of Yongjia (308AD) the Central Plain was in chaos and the eight clans:- [[Lin (surname)|Lin]] \u6797, Huang \u9ec3, [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] \u9673, [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] \u912d, [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan]] \u8a79, [[Qi\u016b (surname)|Qiu]] \u90b1, [[He (surname)|He]] \u4f55, and [[Hu (surname)|Hu]] \u80e1, entered Min \u95a9 (present day Fujian province, China).\"\n\nFrom the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907) onwards, many Han Chinese migrated from [[Fujian]] to [[Guangdong]] and the other southern provinces. Huang grew into a big clan in south China and it is the 3rd biggest surname in Southern China today.\n\nMigration to [[Taiwan]] began during the transition period from the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) to [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912), when many Han Chinese followed the Anti-Manchu Ming loyalist forces under [[Zheng Chenggong]], and crossed the [[Taiwan Strait]] to Taiwan island.\n\nHuang migration overseas began as early as the 14th century during the Ming dynasty to destinations in [[Southeast Asia]]. Migration to Americas began only in the mid-19th century following the forced opening of China's doors to the West. Huang is one of the largest Chinese surname clans in Americas today. The population of overseas Huang Clansmen was estimated at 2 million in 2000.\n\nThe another surname '''\u7687''' has several origins:\n1. The descendants of the Three Emperors of ancient China. \n2. The descendants of Duke Dai of Song's prince named Huangfu Chongshi \u7687\u7236\u5145\u77f3. \n3.An ancient book Xing Kao \u59d3\u8003 says Zheng Kingdom has a royal clan named Huang clan \u7687\u6c0f.\n\n==Huang==\nHuang is the 7th most common surname in China, and the 3rd most common surname in [[Taiwan]]. It is also one of the common surnames among [[Zhuang People]], one of the ethnic minorities in China. 19% of People from China with Surname Huang live in [[Guangdong| Guangdong Province]]. The population of people named Huang in China was approximately 29 million and in [[Taiwan]] about 1.4 million.\nIn 2019 Huang was again the seventh most common surname in Mainland China.<ref>http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/20/676822.html</ref>\n\n\n===Historical figures with Huang \u9ec3 surname===\n[[Image:\u6247\u6795\u6e29\u887e.JPG|thumb|[[Eastern Han dynasty]] Filial Son and Prime Minister Huang Xiang]]\n\n[[File:Huang Zhong Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Shu Han|Shu Han Kingdom]] General [[Huang Zhong]]]]\n\n[[Image:Huang Tingjian.jpg|thumb|[[Song dynasty]] Calligrapher and Filial Son [[Huang Tingjian]]]]\n\n[[Image:Huang Zong-Xi.jpg|thumb|Late [[Ming dynasty]] Philosopher [[Huang Zongxi]]]]\n\n*[[Huang Chao]] \u9ec3\u5de2 (820\u2013884), leader of the Huang Chao rebellion against the [[Tang dynasty]]\n*[[Huang Chengyan]] \u9ec3\u627f\u5f65, [[Eastern Han dynasty]] scholar\n*[[Huang Daopo]] \u9ec3\u9053\u5a46 (1245\u20131330), [[Yuan dynasty]] Weaver and innovator\n*[[Huang Daozhou]] \u9ec3\u9053\u9031 (1585\u20131646), [[Ming dynasty]] calligrapher and politician named as one of the Four Lords of the Yellow Gate (\u9ec3\u9580\u56db\u541b\u5b50)\n*[[Huang Ding]] \u9ec3\u9f0e (1650\u20131730), [[Qing dynasty]] landscape painter and poet\n*[[Huang Feihong]] \u9ec3\u98db\u9d3b Wong Fei-hung (1847\u20131924), Martial artist, physician, acupuncturist, revolutionary, and folk hero during late [[Qing dynasty]]\n*[[Huang Gai]] \u9ec3\u84cb, [[Eastern Wu]] general and one of the \"Twelve Tiger Generals of Jiangdong\" (\u6c5f\u6771\u5341\u4e8c\u864e\u81e3) during the [[Three Kingdoms Period|Three Kingdoms period]]\n*[[Huang Gongwang]] \u9ec3\u516c\u671b (1269\u20131345), painter and one of the \"[[Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty]]\"\n*[[Huang Ji]] \u9ec3\u6fdf, [[Ming dynasty]] imperial painter\n*[[Huang Quan (general)|Huang Quan]] \u9ec3\u6b0a (?\u2013240), general of [[Shu Han]] and later of [[Cao Wei]] during the Three Kingdoms period\n*[[Huang Ruheng]] \u9ec3\u6c5d\u4ea8 (1558\u20131626), calligrapher during late [[Ming dynasty]]\n*[[Ong Sum Ping]] \u9ec3\u68ee\u5c4f [[Huang Senping]], Noble of [[Brunei]].

Lu Zhong had six sons: \n* Eldest Son Fan \u6a0a (also known as Fan Ren \u6a0a\u4eba or Kun Wu \u6606\u543e) - Legendary Pottery Inventor and Founder of Kunwu Kingdom \u6606\u543e\u570b, \n* Second Son Ding \u5b9a (also known as Hui Lian \u60e0\u8fde or Can Hu \u53c3\u80e1) - Founder of [[Huang (state)|Huang Kingdom]] \u9ec3\u570b, \n* Third Son Qian (also known as [[Peng Zu|Qian Keng]] \u94b1\u94ff) - Legendary God of Longevity and Founder of [[Dapeng (state)|Da Peng Kingdom]] \u5927\u5f6d\u570b, \n* Fourth Son Qiu \u6c42 (also known as Qiu Yan \u6c42\u8a00 or Kuai Ren \u9136\u4eba)- Founder of Kuai Kingdom \u9136\u570b, \n* Fifth Son Yan An \u664f\u5b89 (also known as Cao An \u66f9\u5b89 or Zao An \u906d\u5b89) - Founder of [[Zou (state)|Zhu Kingdom]] \u90be\u570b, and \n* Sixth Son Ji \u5b63 (also known as [[Ji Lian]] \u5b63\u8fde) - Founder of [[Chu (state)|Chu Kingdom]] \u695a\u570b.\n\nIn 2220 BC during the reign of [[Emperor Yao]] \u5e1d\u582f, Hui Lian \u60e0\u9023 scored merits in harnessing river floods. [[Emperor Yao]] conferred on Hui Lian the title of Viscount \u5b50 (but the nobility system of ancient China is still not clear) and the state of Can'hu \u53c3\u80e1 (in present-day region of [[Fenyang]], [[Shanxi]] province). [[Emperor Yao]] renamed Can'hu as [[State of Huang]], and bestowed on Hui Lian the surname Huang \u9ec3 and the name \"Yun\" \u96f2. Hence, Hui Lian was also known as Huang Yun \u9ec3\u96f2 or Nan Lu \u5357\u9646. Hui Lian became the Progenitor of the Huang surname clan. During Western Zhou dynasty, the rulers of the Huang State was given the title of Duke \u516c. The descendants of Huang Yun (Hui Lian) ruled the Huang State of Shanxi until the early [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722 BC-481 BC) when it was conquered by the State of [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]].\n\nAnother lineage of Huang Clan from the Yellow Emperor is as follows:\n1) [[Yellow Emperor]] \u9ec3\u5e1d -> 2) [[Shaohao|Shao Hao]] \u5c11\u660a -> 3) Jiao Ji \u5b0c\u6975 -> 4) Hui Gong \u63ee\u516c -> 5) Mei \u6627 -> 6) Tai Tai \u81fa\u99d8. Tai Tai helped [[Zhuanxu| Zhuan Xu Emperor]] \u9853\u980a, and he and his descendants (Jin Tian Clan \u91d1\u5929\u6c0f) were enfeoffed with Fen Zhou \u6c7e\u5dde at Fen River \u6c7e\u6cb3 which was further divided into four kingdoms - [[Huang (state)|Huang Kingdom]] \u9ec3\u570b, [[Sh\u011bn (state)|Shen Kingdom]] \u6c88\u570b, Ru Kingdom \u84d0\u570b and Si Kingdom \u59d2\u570b.\n\n===Development and emigration===\nIn 891 BC [[King Xiao of Zhou]] conferred on the 53rd generation descendant of Hui Lian, Huang Xi \u9ec3\u7199 (aka Huang Shi \u9ec3\u77f3) the nobility of 'Hou' \u4faf (marquis) and a fiefdom in the region east of the Han river \u6f22\u6c34 (in present-day region of [[Yicheng, Hubei|Yicheng]], [[Hubei]] province) called 'Huang' \u9ec3 (Not to be confused with the Huang State of Fenyang, Shanxi) with the four states Jiang \u6c5f, Huang \u9ec3 (founded by \u4f2f\u76ca Bo Yi's descendants), [[Dao (state)|Dao]] \u9053, and Bo \u67cf in the Huang river \u6f62\u6c34 valley as vassals. The Huang State of [[Yicheng, Hubei|Yicheng]], [[Hubei]] was known as the Western [[Huang (state)|Huang]] (Xi Huang \u897f\u9ec3) in history.\n\nDuring the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] (265-420), when northern China was invaded by the barbarian tribes, many northerners (especially the aristocratic clans) moved to south China with the Jin court. It was during this period that the Huang clansmen migrated to [[Fujian]].\n\nAccording to Min Shu \u95a9\u66f8 (Book of Min) (Quoted from Chung Yoon-Ngan):\n\"During the second year (of the reign) of Yongjia (308AD) the Central Plain was in chaos and the eight clans:- [[Lin (surname)|Lin]] \u6797, Huang \u9ec3, [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] \u9673, [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] \u912d, [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan]] \u8a79, [[Qi\u016b (surname)|Qiu]] \u90b1, [[He (surname)|He]] \u4f55, and [[Hu (surname)|Hu]] \u80e1, entered Min \u95a9 (present day Fujian province, China).\"\n\nFrom the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907) onwards, many Han Chinese migrated from [[Fujian]] to [[Guangdong]] and the other southern provinces. Huang grew into a big clan in south China and it is the 3rd biggest surname in Southern China today.\n\nMigration to [[Taiwan]] began during the transition period from the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644) to [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131912), when many Han Chinese followed the Anti-Manchu Ming loyalist forces under [[Zheng Chenggong]], and crossed the [[Taiwan Strait]] to Taiwan island.\n\nHuang migration overseas began as early as the 14th century during the Ming dynasty to destinations in [[Southeast Asia]]. Migration to Americas began only in the mid-19th century following the forced opening of China's doors to the West. Huang is one of the largest Chinese surname clans in Americas today. The population of overseas Huang Clansmen was estimated at 2 million in 2000.\n\nThe another surname '''\u7687''' has several origins:\n1. The descendants of the Three Emperors of ancient China. \n2. The descendants of Duke Dai of Song's prince named Huangfu Chongshi \u7687\u7236\u5145\u77f3. \n3.An ancient book Xing Kao \u59d3\u8003 says Zheng Kingdom has a royal clan named Huang clan \u7687\u6c0f.\n\n==Huang==\nHuang is the 7th most common surname in China, and the 3rd most common surname in [[Taiwan]]. It is also one of the common surnames among [[Zhuang People]], one of the ethnic minorities in China. 19% of People from China with Surname Huang live in [[Guangdong| Guangdong Province]]. The population of people named Huang in China was approximately 29 million and in [[Taiwan]] about 1.4 million.\nIn 2019 Huang was again the seventh most common surname in Mainland China.<ref>http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/20/676822.html</ref>\n\n\n===Historical figures with Huang \u9ec3 surname===\n[[Image:\u6247\u6795\u6e29\u887e.JPG|thumb|[[Eastern Han dynasty]] Filial Son and Prime Minister Huang Xiang]]\n\n[[File:Huang Zhong Portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Shu Han|Shu Han Kingdom]] General [[Huang Zhong]]]]\n\n[[Image:Huang Tingjian.jpg|thumb|[[Song dynasty]] Calligrapher and Filial Son [[Huang Tingjian]]]]\n\n[[Image:Huang Zong-Xi.jpg|thumb|Late [[Ming dynasty]] Philosopher [[Huang Zongxi]]]]\n\n*[[Huang Chao]] \u9ec3\u5de2 (820\u2013884), leader of the Huang Chao rebellion against the [[Tang dynasty]]\n*[[Huang Chengyan]] \u9ec3\u627f\u5f65, [[Eastern Han dynasty]] scholar\n*[[Huang Daopo]] \u9ec3\u9053\u5a46 (1245\u20131330), [[Yuan dynasty]] Weaver and innovator\n*[[Huang Daozhou]] \u9ec3\u9053\u9031 (1585\u20131646), [[Ming dynasty]] calligrapher and politician named as one of the Four Lords of the Yellow Gate (\u9ec3\u9580\u56db\u541b\u5b50)\n*[[Huang Ding]] \u9ec3\u9f0e (1650\u20131730), [[Qing dynasty]] landscape painter and poet\n*[[Huang Feihong]] \u9ec3\u98db\u9d3b Wong Fei-hung (1847\u20131924), Martial artist, physician, acupuncturist, revolutionary, and folk hero during late [[Qing dynasty]]\n*[[Huang Gai]] \u9ec3\u84cb, [[Eastern Wu]] general and one of the \"Twelve Tiger Generals of Jiangdong\" (\u6c5f\u6771\u5341\u4e8c\u864e\u81e3) during the [[Three Kingdoms Period|Three Kingdoms period]]\n*[[Huang Gongwang]] \u9ec3\u516c\u671b (1269\u20131345), painter and one of the \"[[Four Masters of the Yuan dynasty]]\"\n*[[Huang Ji]] \u9ec3\u6fdf, [[Ming dynasty]] imperial painter\n*[[Huang Quan (general)|Huang Quan]] \u9ec3\u6b0a (?\u2013240), general of [[Shu Han]] and later of [[Cao Wei]] during the Three Kingdoms period\n*[[Huang Ruheng]] \u9ec3\u6c5d\u4ea8 (1558\u20131626), calligrapher during late [[Ming dynasty]]\n*[[Ong Sum Ping]] \u9ec3\u68ee\u5c4f [[Huang Senping]], Noble of [[Brunei]].
