Outside Birmingham, in [[Solihull]], is {{rws|Birmingham International}}, which serves [[Birmingham Airport]] and the [[National Exhibition Centre]].\n===Railway operations===\nNew Street is the hub of the West Midlands rail network, as well as being a major national hub. The station is one of seventeen operated and managed by Network Rail.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |title=Commercial information |date=May 2013 |work=Complete National Rail Timetable |publisher=Network Rail |location=London |page=43 |accessdate=5 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130904231906/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/eNRT/May13/Commercial_Information.pdf |archive-date=4 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Network Rail also provides operational staff for the station.\n\nStation staff are provided on all platforms to assist with the safe 'dispatch' of trains. For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street. The station is allocated the [[IATA location identifier]] [http://www.theairdb.com/airport/QQN.html QQN].\n\n====Approach tunnels====\nAll trains arriving and departing must use one of the several tunnels around the station.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/><ref>{{cite book |title=Railway Track Diagrams 4: Midlands & North West |editor-last=Bridge |editor-first=Mike |isbn=978-0-9549866-7-4 |oclc=880581044 |last1=Yonge |first1=John |last2=Padgett |first2=David |last3=Szwenk |first3=John |edition=3rd |date=August 2013 |origyear=1990 |publisher=Trackmaps |location=Bradford on Avon |at=map 16 |ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n*Stour Valley Line Tunnel \u2013 heads westwards towards Soho Junction & Wolverhampton, and passes under the [[National Indoor Arena]]. This tunnel is {{convert|927|yard|m}} long in total, comprising the original New Street North Tunnel, {{convert|751|yard|m}} and extension: 'Arena' Tunnel, {{convert|176|yard|m}}. The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

However, in 1885 the Midland Railway opened its own extension alongside the original station for the exclusive use of its trains, effectively creating two stations side-by-side. The two companies stations were separated by a central roadway; Queens Drive.<ref name=\"Nstr18541967\"/> Traffic grew steadily, and by 1900 New Street had an average of 40 trains an hour departing and arriving, rising to 53 trains in the peak hours.<ref>{{cite web|title=www.warwickshirerailways.com - lnwrbns_str1295c|url=http://www.warwickshirerailways.com/lms/lnwrbns_str1295c.htm|publisher=www.warwickshirerailways.com|accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Original-new-street.jpg|thumb|left|Early 20th century photo taken from the west, showing the LNWR station (left) and the Midland station (right) with the Queens Drive between them]]\n\n==== Original LNWR station====\n[[File:Birmingham New Street station in 1854.jpg|thumb|Birmingham New Street station as pictured in the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'' on 3 June 1854]]\nThe LNWR had obtained an Act of Parliament in 1846, to extend their line into the centre of Birmingham, which involved the acquisition of some {{convert|1.2|ha|0}} of land, and the demolition of around 70 houses in Peck Lane, The Froggery, Queen Street, and Colmore Street.<ref>''Aris's Birmingham Gazette'', 16 February 1850.</ref>  The [[Countess of Huntingdon's Connexion]] chapel, on the corner of Peck Lane and Dudley Street, which had only been built six years before,<ref>It had been opened Tuesday 16 May 1843.

For operational reasons all trains departing New Street much be dispatched via the use of [[UK railway signalling|Right Away (RA)]] indicators. RA indicators display a signal informing the train driver it is safe to start the train, instead of using more traditional bell or hand signals.\n\nThe 12 through platforms are divided into ''a'' and ''b'' ends, with an extra bay platform called 4c between 4b and 5b, with the ''b'' end of the station towards Wolverhampton, this in effect allows twice the platforms. Longer trains that are too long for one section of the platform occupy the entire length of the platform, such as [[British Rail Class 390|Class 390]] or [[InterCity 125|HSTs]].\n\nTrains departing towards Proof House Junction (''a'' end) can depart from any platform, but there are restrictions on trains departing from the ''b'' end. All platforms can accommodate trains heading towards Wolverhampton, however due the platform layout and road bridge supports, only 5\u201312 can accommodate trains heading towards Five Ways. There are a number of sidings on the station for the stabling of trains; between platforms 5/6, 7/8, 9/10. The bay platforms at either end of platform 12 have been removed during the current{{when|date=June 2016}} rebuild. The sidings in front of New Street signal box have also been removed.\n\nAll signalling is controlled by New Street power signal box at the Wolverhampton or ''b'' end of the station; it can be seen at street level on Navigation Street.

The former was opened in 1852 as part of the [[Stour Valley Line]], and holds two tracks.\n*New Street South Tunnel \u2013 {{convert|254|yard|m}} long, heading eastbound, passing under the [[Bull Ring Shopping Centre|Bullring]], and {{rws|Birmingham Moor Street}} station, heading towards [[Duddeston railway station|Duddeston]], [[Adderley Park railway station|Adderley Park]], the [[Camp Hill Line]] and the [[Cross Country Route|Derby lines]] towards [[Tamworth railway station|Tamworth]]. This tunnel opened in 1854, originally holding two tracks; it was widened in 1896 to hold four tracks, with two double-track parallel bores.\n*Gloucester Line Tunnels \u2013 are four separate tunnels heading south-west towards [[Five Ways railway station|Five Ways]]. Heading from New Street in sequence the tunnels are named Holliday Street Tunnel, {{convert|307|yard|m}} long; Canal Tunnel, {{convert|225|yard|m}} long, passing under the [[Birmingham Canal Navigations]]; Granville Street Tunnel, {{convert|81|yard|m}} long; and Bath Row Tunnel, {{convert|210|yard|m}} long. These tunnels opened in 1885 as part of the [[Birmingham West Suburban Railway]] and hold two tracks.\n\n===Customer service and ticketing===\nNetwork Rail, as well as operating the station, operate a customer reception located on the main concourse, and provide mobility assistance and train dispatch. The booking office and barriers are operated by [[Avanti West Coast]], with customer service or floor walker staff provided by CrossCountry and Network Rail. Avanti West Coast operates a first class lounge and [[Transport for West Midlands|Network West Midlands]] also provides a public transport information point for the station.\n\nThe station is a [[penalty fare]] station for [[West Midlands Railway]] and [[London Northwestern Railway]] (West Midlands Trains' [[brand|brands]]). This scheme is operated both onboard trains and at the automatic ticket barriers at the station. The other train operating companies that use the station do not operate penalty fare schemes.\n\n===Pollution and air quality concerns===\nThe station is designated as underground. There are fans that remove fumes but there are still a large number of services operated by diesel trains despite the whole station being electrified in the 1960s. There have been environmental concerns about the level of pollution in the station in particular NOx.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/uk-england-birmingham-45061470?ns_mchannel=social&ns_source=twitter&ns_campaign=bbc_live&ns_linkname=5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c%26%27More%20improvements%27%20needed%20to%20cut%20station%20air%20pollution%26&ns_fee=0#post_5b6b2a13a081040678934c1c|title=BBC item regarding New Street Pollution|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Train operating companies===\nSince the [[privatisation of British Rail]] there have been thirteen [[train operating company|train companies]] that have regularly called at New Street: \n[[Arriva Trains Wales]], [[Avanti West Coast]], [[Central Trains]], [[CrossCountry]], [[First North Western]], [[London Midland]], [[Silverlink]], [[Virgin CrossCountry]], [[Virgin Trains West Coast]], [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]], [[Wales & Borders]], [[Wales & West]] and [[West Midlands Trains]].\n\nCurrently Avanti West Coast, CrossCountry, Transport for Wales and West Midlands Trains provide services from New Street. [[Chiltern Railways]] have occasionally used New Street during engineering works.\n\nWest Midlands Trains operates a traincrew depot at the station and stables some trains overnight around the station. For the most part, they use [[Soho TMD]] for electric traction units, with its non-electric units kept at [[Tyseley TMD]] to the southeast of Birmingham.\n\nCrossCountry also operates a traincrew depot at the station; it uses Tyseley TMD for the [[British Rail Class 170|Class 170]] units, and its Voyagers are based at [[Central Rivers TMD]].\n\n==Train services==\n[[File:Birmingham & West Mids Passenger Railway Map.JPG|thumb|Map of passenger railways in the Birmingham & West Midlands area]]\nThe basic Monday to Saturday off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is as follows:\n\n[[Avanti West Coast]]\n* 3tph to [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] (1 via Rugby, 1 via Watford Junction and 1 via Milton Keynes Central).

The collision caused the guards van of the Derby train to [[telescoping (railway)|telescope]] with the rear coach. Three people were killed, and twenty four injured. The later inquest ruled that the express had overrun the danger signal due to driver error, and the misty conditions had made the rails moist, leading to wheelslip when the train tried to brake.<ref>{{cite web|title=1921 accident report|url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_BirminghamNewStreet1921.pdf|publisher=Railways Archive|accessdate=10 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gateway Plus]]\n* [[Birmingham Snow Hill railway station]]\n* [[Birmingham Moor Street railway station]]\n* [[Transport in Birmingham]]\n* [[Transport for West Midlands]]\n* [[Commuter rail in the United Kingdom]]\n*[[Grand Central, Birmingham]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Foster, Richard, ''Birmingham New Street.
