There, the [[Indian Imperial Police]] attempted an arrest of the group leaders, a riot ensued and they were fired upon by the police, resulting in the deaths of 20 [[Sikhs]].\n\n''Komagata Maru'' sailed from [[British Hong Kong]], via [[Shanghai]], [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]], and [[Yokohama]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, in 1914, carrying 376 passengers from [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], British India. Of them, 24 were admitted to Canada, but the other 352 passengers were not allowed to disembark in Canada, and the ship was forced to return to India.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh challenge to Canada's colour bar |year=1989 |publisher=University of British Columbia Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-0340-3 |pages=81, 83}}</ref> The passengers comprised 337 [[Sikhs]], 27 [[Punjabi Muslims|Muslims]] and 12 [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]], all [[Punjabis]] and [[British subject]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Komagata Maru|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/komagata-maru}}</ref> This was one of several incidents in the early 20th century in which exclusion laws in Canada and the United States were used to exclude immigrants of Asian origin.\n\n==Gurdit Singh's initial idea==\n{{cquote|The visions of men are widened by travel and contacts with citizens of a free country will infuse a spirit of independence and foster yearnings for freedom in the minds of the emasculated subjects of alien rule.|x|x|Gurdit Singh}}\n\n[[File:Baba Gurdit Singh.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Portrait of Baba Gurdit Singh, Komagata Maru Memorial, [[Budge Budge]]]]\n[[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh Sandhu]], from [[Sarhali]] (not to be confused with Gurdit Singh Jawanda from [[Haripur Khalsa]], a 1906 Indo-Canadian immigration pioneer), was a [[British Singapore|Singaporean]] businessman who was aware that Canadian exclusion laws were preventing Punjabis from immigrating there. He wanted to circumvent these laws by hiring a boat to sail from [[Calcutta]] to Vancouver. His aim was to help his compatriots whose previous journeys to Canada had been blocked.\n\nThough Gurdit Singh was apparently aware of regulations when he chartered the ship ''Komagata Maru'' in January 1914,<ref>Johnston, H., op. cit., p. 26.</ref> he continued with his enterprise in order to challenge the continuous journey regulation, in the hope of opening the door for immigration from India to Canada.\n\nAt the same time, in January 1914, he publicly espoused the [[Ghadar Party|Ghadarite]] cause while in Hong Kong.<ref>Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 24 and 25.</ref> The Ghadar Party was an organization founded by Indian residents of the United States and Canada in June 1913 with the aim of liberating India from British rule. It was also known as the Hindi Association of the Pacific Coast.\n\n===Passengers===\nThe passengers consisted of 337 [[Sikh]]s, 27 Muslims, and 12 Hindus, all [[British subject]]s. One of the Sikh passengers, Jagat Singh Thind, was the youngest brother of [[Bhagat Singh Thind]], an Indian-American Sikh writer and lecturer on \"spiritual science\" who was involved in an important legal battle over the rights of Indians to obtain U.S. citizenship ([[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bhagatsinghthind.com/Komagata_maru.php |title=Komagata Maru |work=www.bhagatsinghthind.com |accessdate=November 21, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820022452/http://www.bhagatsinghthind.com/Komagata_maru.php |archive-date=August 20, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe Canadian Government made claims that amongst the passengers were a number of Indian nationalists intent on creating disorder (see [[Ghadar conspiracy]], [[Annie Larsen arms plot]], and [[Christmas Day Plot]].)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000272/19140721/056/0004; |title=Register \u2013 British Newspaper Archive |first=The British Newspaper |last=Archive |website=www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk |accessdate=June 18, 2018}}</ref>  However this was a public relations cover for its real motive for turning back the ship \u2013 a desire to prevent Indian nationals from immigrating to Canada.<ref>Johnston, Hugh J.

The ship was scheduled to leave in March, but Singh was arrested for selling tickets for an illegal voyage. After several months he was released on bail and given permission by [[Francis Henry May]], the Governor of Hong Kong, to set sail. The ship departed on April 4 with 165 passengers. More passengers joined at Shanghai on April 8, and the ship arrived at Yokohama on April 14. It left Yokohama on May 3 with its complement of 376 passengers and sailed into [[Burrard Inlet]], near Vancouver, on May 23. The [[Indian nationalism|Indian Nationalist]] revolutionaries [[Maulavi Barkatullah|Barkatullah]] and [[Bhagwaan Singh Giani (priest)|Bhagwaan Singh Giani]] met with the ship en route. Bhagwaan Singh Giani was head priest of the [[Gurdwara]] in Vancouver and had been one of three delegates sent to London and India to represent the case of [[Indo-Canadians|Indians in Canada]]. [[Ghadar Party|Ghadarite]] literature was disseminated on board and political meetings took place on board. A passenger told a British officer: {{where|date=May 2016}}\"This ship belongs to the whole of India, this is a symbol of the honour of India and if this was detained, there would be [[Indian Mutiny|mutiny]] in the armies\".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Arrival in Vancouver===\n[[File:Komagata Maru and Rainbow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Komagata Maru'' (furthest ship on the left) being escorted by {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}} and a swarm of small boats]]\n\nWhen ''Komagata Maru'' arrived in Canadian waters, first at Coal Harbour in Burrard Inlet some 200 meters off CPR Pier A, it was not allowed to dock. The first immigration officer to meet the ship in Vancouver was [[Cyclone Taylor|Fred \"Cyclone\" Taylor]].<ref>Whitehead, E., ''Cyclone Taylor: A Hockey Legend'', p. 159</ref> While [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Robert Borden]] decided what to do with the ship, the [[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative]] [[Premier of British Columbia]], [[Richard McBride]], gave a categorical statement that the passengers would not be allowed to disembark. Conservative MP [[H. H. Stevens]] organized a public meeting against allowing the ship's passengers to disembark and urged the government to refuse to allow the ship to remain. Stevens worked with immigration official Malcolm R.J. Reid to keep the passengers off shore. Reid's intransigence, supported by Stevens, led to mistreatment of the passengers on the ship and prolonged its departure date, which was not resolved until the intervention of the federal Minister of Agriculture, [[Martin Burrell]], MP for [[Yale\u2014Cariboo]].{{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nMeanwhile, a \"shore committee\" had been formed with [[Husain Rahim]] and [[Sohan Lal Pathak]]. Protest meetings were held in Canada and the United States. At one, held in [[Dominion Hall]], Vancouver, the assembly resolved that if the passengers were not allowed off, Indo-Canadians should follow them back to India to start a rebellion or ''[[Ghadar Mutiny|Ghadar]]''. A British government agent who infiltrated the meeting wired government officials in London and Ottawa to tell them that supporters of the [[Ghadar Party]] were on the ship.\n\nThe shore committee raised $22,000 as an installment for chartering the ship. They also launched a lawsuit under [[J. Edward Bird]]'s legal counsel on behalf of Munshi Singh, one of the passengers. On July 6, the full bench of the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] delivered a unanimous judgement that under new orders-in-council it had no authority to interfere with the decisions of the Department of Immigration and Colonization.<ref>Re Munshi Singh (1914), 20 B.C.R. 243 (B.C.C.A.)</ref> Angry passengers relieved the Japanese captain of control of the ship, but the Canadian government ordered the harbour tug ''Sea Lion'' to push the ship out to sea. On July 19, the angry passengers mounted an attack. The next day the Vancouver newspaper ''[[The Vancouver Sun|The Sun]]'' reported: \"Howling masses of Hindus showered policemen with lumps of coal and bricks&nbsp;... it was like standing underneath a coal chute\".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Departure from Vancouver===\n[[File:Inspector Reid, H.H. Stevens and Capt. Walter J. Hose on board the \"Komagata Maru\".jpg|left|thumb|Inspector Reid, [[H. H. Stevens]] and [[Walter Hose]] on board ''Komagata Maru''.]]\nThe government also mobilized {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ship <!--standing idle in [[Esquimalt]].!--> under the command of Commander Hose, with troops from the [[The Irish Fusiliers of Canada (The Vancouver Regiment)|11th Regiment \"Irish Fusiliers of Canada\"]], [[72nd Regiment \"Seaforth Highlanders of Canada\"]], and the [[6th Regiment \"The Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles\"]]. In the end, only twenty passengers were admitted to Canada, since the ship had violated the exclusion laws, the passengers did not have the required funds, and they had not sailed directly from India. The ship was turned around and forced to depart for Asia on July 23.\n\nDuring the controversy, Punjabi residents of Canada had supplied information to [[W. C. Hopkinson]], a British immigration official. Two of these informants were murdered in August 1914. Hopkinson was gunned down at the Vancouver courthouse while attending the Punjabi trials in October 1914.\n\n===Firing at harbour on return to India===\n''Komagata Maru'' arrived in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] on September 27. Upon entry into the harbour, the ship was stopped by a British gunboat, and the passengers were placed under guard. The government of the British Raj saw the men on ''Komagata Maru'' not only as self-confessed lawbreakers, but also as dangerous political agitators. The British government suspected that white and South Asian radicals were using the incident to create rebellion among South Asians in the Pacific Northwest. When the ship docked at [[Budge Budge]], the police went to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and the twenty or so other men that they viewed as leaders. He resisted arrest, a friend of his assaulted a policeman, and a general riot ensued. Shots were fired and nineteen of the passengers were killed. Some escaped, but the remainder were arrested and imprisoned or sent to their villages and kept under village arrest for the duration of the First World War. This incident became known as the [[Budge Budge riot]].\n\nRingleader Gurdit Singh Sandhu managed to escape and lived in hiding until 1922. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] urged him to give himself up as a \"true patriot\". Upon his doing so he was imprisoned for five years.\n<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chang |first1=Kornel |title=Pacific Connections |date=2012 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520271692 |page=147}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\nThe ''Komagata Maru'' incident was widely cited at the time by Indian groups to highlight discrepancies in Canadian immigration laws. Further, the inflamed passions in the wake of the incident were widely cultivated by the Indian revolutionary organisation, the [[Ghadar Party]], to rally support for its aims. In a number of meetings ranging from California in 1914 to the Indian diaspora, prominent Ghadarites including [[Maulavi Barkatullah|Barkatullah]], [[Tarak Nath Das]], and [[Sohan Singh Bhakna|Sohan Singh]] used the incident as a rallying point to recruit members for the Ghadar movement, most notably in support of [[Hindu\u2013German Conspiracy|promulgating plans]] to coordinate a massive uprising in India. Their efforts failed due to lack of support from the general population.\n\n==Legacy==\n===India===\n[[File:Komagata.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Komagata Maru Memorial'' at [[Budge Budge]]]]\nIn 1952 the Indian government set up a memorial to the ''Komagata Maru'' martyrs near the [[Budge Budge]].

There, the [[Indian Imperial Police]] attempted an arrest of the group leaders, a riot ensued and they were fired upon by the police, resulting in the deaths of 20 [[Sikhs]].\n\n''Komagata Maru'' sailed from [[British Hong Kong]], via [[Shanghai]], [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|China]], and [[Yokohama]], [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, in 1914, carrying 376 passengers from [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab]], British India. Of them, 24 were admitted to Canada, but the other 352 passengers were not allowed to disembark in Canada, and the ship was forced to return to India.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Voyage of the Komagata Maru: the Sikh challenge to Canada's colour bar |year=1989 |publisher=University of British Columbia Press |location=Vancouver |isbn=978-0-7748-0340-3 |pages=81, 83}}</ref> The passengers comprised 337 [[Sikhs]], 27 [[Punjabi Muslims|Muslims]] and 12 [[Punjabi Hindus|Hindus]], all [[Punjabis]] and [[British subject]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Komagata Maru|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/komagata-maru}}</ref> This was one of several incidents in the early 20th century in which exclusion laws in Canada and the United States were used to exclude immigrants of Asian origin.\n\n==Immigration controls in Canada==\n{{main|Continuous journey regulation}}\n\nThe Canadian government's first attempt to restrict immigration from British India was an [[Order in Council]] passed on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who \"in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior\" did not \"come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a continuous journey and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality\". In practice this [[continuous journey regulation]] applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in Japan or Hawaii. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting huge numbers of immigrants, almost all of whom came from Europe. More than 400,000 arrived in 1913, an annual figure that has not been equaled since.\n\n==Gurdit Singh's initial idea==\n{{cquote|The visions of men are widened by travel and contacts with citizens of a free country will infuse a spirit of independence and foster yearnings for freedom in the minds of the emasculated subjects of alien rule.|x|x|Gurdit Singh}}\n\n[[File:Baba Gurdit Singh.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Portrait of Baba Gurdit Singh, Komagata Maru Memorial, [[Budge Budge]]]]\n[[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh Sandhu]], from [[Sarhali]] (not to be confused with Gurdit Singh Jawanda from [[Haripur Khalsa]], a 1906 Indo-Canadian immigration pioneer), was a [[British Singapore|Singaporean]] businessman who was aware that Canadian exclusion laws were preventing Punjabis from immigrating there. He wanted to circumvent these laws by hiring a boat to sail from [[Calcutta]] to Vancouver. His aim was to help his compatriots whose previous journeys to Canada had been blocked.\n\nThough Gurdit Singh was apparently aware of regulations when he chartered the ship ''Komagata Maru'' in January 1914,<ref>Johnston, H., op. cit., p. 26.</ref> he continued with his enterprise in order to challenge the continuous journey regulation, in the hope of opening the door for immigration from India to Canada.\n\nAt the same time, in January 1914, he publicly espoused the [[Ghadar Party|Ghadarite]] cause while in Hong Kong.<ref>Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 24 and 25.</ref> The Ghadar Party was an organization founded by Indian residents of the United States and Canada in June 1913 with the aim of liberating India from British rule. It was also known as the Hindi Association of the Pacific Coast.\n\n===Passengers===\nThe passengers consisted of 337 [[Sikh]]s, 27 Muslims, and 12 Hindus, all [[British subject]]s. One of the Sikh passengers, Jagat Singh Thind, was the youngest brother of [[Bhagat Singh Thind]], an Indian-American Sikh writer and lecturer on \"spiritual science\" who was involved in an important legal battle over the rights of Indians to obtain U.S. citizenship ([[United States v.

The ship was scheduled to leave in March, but Singh was arrested for selling tickets for an illegal voyage. After several months he was released on bail and given permission by [[Francis Henry May]], the Governor of Hong Kong, to set sail. The ship departed on April 4 with 165 passengers. More passengers joined at Shanghai on April 8, and the ship arrived at Yokohama on April 14. It left Yokohama on May 3 with its complement of 376 passengers and sailed into [[Burrard Inlet]], near Vancouver, on May 23. The [[Indian nationalism|Indian Nationalist]] revolutionaries [[Maulavi Barkatullah|Barkatullah]] and [[Bhagwaan Singh Giani (priest)|Bhagwaan Singh Giani]] met with the ship en route. Bhagwaan Singh Giani was head priest of the [[Gurdwara]] in Vancouver and had been one of three delegates sent to London and India to represent the case of [[Indo-Canadians|Indians in Canada]]. [[Ghadar Party|Ghadarite]] literature was disseminated on board and political meetings took place on board. A passenger told a British officer: {{where|date=May 2016}}\"This ship belongs to the whole of India, this is a symbol of the honour of India and if this was detained, there would be [[Indian Mutiny|mutiny]] in the armies\".{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}\n\n===Arrival in Vancouver===\n[[File:Komagata Maru and Rainbow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Komagata Maru'' (furthest ship on the left) being escorted by {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}} and a swarm of small boats]]\n\nWhen ''Komagata Maru'' arrived in Canadian waters, first at Coal Harbour in Burrard Inlet some 200 meters off CPR Pier A, it was not allowed to dock. The first immigration officer to meet the ship in Vancouver was [[Cyclone Taylor|Fred \"Cyclone\" Taylor]].<ref>Whitehead, E., ''Cyclone Taylor: A Hockey Legend'', p. 159</ref> While [[Prime Minister of Canada]] [[Robert Borden]] decided what to do with the ship, the [[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative]] [[Premier of British Columbia]], [[Richard McBride]], gave a categorical statement that the passengers would not be allowed to disembark. Conservative MP [[H. H. Stevens]] organized a public meeting against allowing the ship's passengers to disembark and urged the government to refuse to allow the ship to remain. Stevens worked with immigration official Malcolm R.J. Reid to keep the passengers off shore. Reid's intransigence, supported by Stevens, led to mistreatment of the passengers on the ship and prolonged its departure date, which was not resolved until the intervention of the federal Minister of Agriculture, [[Martin Burrell]], MP for [[Yale\u2014Cariboo]].{{when|date=May 2016}}\n\nMeanwhile, a \"shore committee\" had been formed with [[Husain Rahim]] and [[Sohan Lal Pathak]]. Protest meetings were held in Canada and the United States. At one, held in [[Dominion Hall]], Vancouver, the assembly resolved that if the passengers were not allowed off, Indo-Canadians should follow them back to India to start a rebellion or ''[[Ghadar Mutiny|Ghadar]]''. A British government agent who infiltrated the meeting wired government officials in London and Ottawa to tell them that supporters of the [[Ghadar Party]] were on the ship.\n\nThe shore committee raised $22,000 as an installment for chartering the ship. They also launched a lawsuit under [[J. Edward Bird]]'s legal counsel on behalf of Munshi Singh, one of the passengers. On July 6, the full bench of the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] delivered a unanimous judgement that under new orders-in-council it had no authority to interfere with the decisions of the Department of Immigration and Colonization.<ref>Re Munshi Singh (1914), 20 B.C.R. 243 (B.C.C.A.)</ref> Angry passengers relieved the Japanese captain of control of the ship, but the Canadian government ordered the harbour tug ''Sea Lion'' to push the ship out to sea. On July 19, the angry passengers mounted an attack. The next day the Vancouver newspaper ''[[The Vancouver Sun|The Sun]]'' reported: \"Howling masses of Hindus showered policemen with lumps of coal and bricks&nbsp;... it was like standing underneath a coal chute\".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Departure from Vancouver===\n[[File:Inspector Reid, H.H. Stevens and Capt. Walter J. Hose on board the \"Komagata Maru\".jpg|left|thumb|Inspector Reid, [[H. H. Stevens]] and [[Walter Hose]] on board ''Komagata Maru''.]]\nThe government also mobilized {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}}, a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] ship <!--standing idle in [[Esquimalt]].!--> under the command of Commander Hose, with troops from the [[The Irish Fusiliers of Canada (The Vancouver Regiment)|11th Regiment \"Irish Fusiliers of Canada\"]], [[72nd Regiment \"Seaforth Highlanders of Canada\"]], and the [[6th Regiment \"The Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles\"]]. In the end, only twenty passengers were admitted to Canada, since the ship had violated the exclusion laws, the passengers did not have the required funds, and they had not sailed directly from India. The ship was turned around and forced to depart for Asia on July 23.\n\nDuring the controversy, Punjabi residents of Canada had supplied information to [[W. C. Hopkinson]], a British immigration official. Two of these informants were murdered in August 1914. Hopkinson was gunned down at the Vancouver courthouse while attending the Punjabi trials in October 1914.\n\n===Firing at harbour on return to India===\n''Komagata Maru'' arrived in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] on September 27. Upon entry into the harbour, the ship was stopped by a British gunboat, and the passengers were placed under guard. The government of the British Raj saw the men on ''Komagata Maru'' not only as self-confessed lawbreakers, but also as dangerous political agitators. The British government suspected that white and South Asian radicals were using the incident to create rebellion among South Asians in the Pacific Northwest. When the ship docked at [[Budge Budge]], the police went to arrest Baba Gurdit Singh and the twenty or so other men that they viewed as leaders. He resisted arrest, a friend of his assaulted a policeman, and a general riot ensued. Shots were fired and nineteen of the passengers were killed. Some escaped, but the remainder were arrested and imprisoned or sent to their villages and kept under village arrest for the duration of the First World War. This incident became known as the [[Budge Budge riot]].\n\nRingleader Gurdit Singh Sandhu managed to escape and lived in hiding until 1922. [[Mahatma Gandhi]] urged him to give himself up as a \"true patriot\". Upon his doing so he was imprisoned for five years.\n<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chang |first1=Kornel |title=Pacific Connections |date=2012 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520271692 |page=147}}</ref>\n\n==Significance==\nThe ''Komagata Maru'' incident was widely cited at the time by Indian groups to highlight discrepancies in Canadian immigration laws. Further, the inflamed passions in the wake of the incident were widely cultivated by the Indian revolutionary organisation, the [[Ghadar Party]], to rally support for its aims. In a number of meetings ranging from California in 1914 to the Indian diaspora, prominent Ghadarites including [[Maulavi Barkatullah|Barkatullah]], [[Tarak Nath Das]], and [[Sohan Singh Bhakna|Sohan Singh]] used the incident as a rallying point to recruit members for the Ghadar movement, most notably in support of [[Hindu\u2013German Conspiracy|promulgating plans]] to coordinate a massive uprising in India. Their efforts failed due to lack of support from the general population.\n\n==Legacy==\n===India===\n[[File:Komagata.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Komagata Maru Memorial'' at [[Budge Budge]]]]\nIn 1952 the Indian government set up a memorial to the ''Komagata Maru'' martyrs near the [[Budge Budge]].

As a combatant, he participated in battles against the [[Military of Indonesia|Indonesian military]] in [[Dili]], [[Aileu]], [[Maubisse]], [[Ossu (East Timor)|Ossu]], [[Venilale]], [[Uatulari]] and finally in [[Laga (East Timor)|Laga]] on the northeastern coast, where he eventually stayed. Major-General Ruak\u2019s first official FALINTIL appointment was at the end of 1976. From 1976 to 1979, he rose through the FALINTIL ranks in the two eastern military sectors, the Central East Sector and the Eastern Point, or the Ponta Leste Sector.  Then he became a company commander.\n\nTaur Matan Ruak and others regrouped the following day at the base of Monte Legumau (''Monte Apara'') and recommenced guerrilla operations after the collapse of the last Timorese resistance base at Matebian Mountain on 22 November 1978. He was ordered to carry out guerrilla activities in the east after the death of Commander Nicolau Lobato in December 1978. During a mission to locate survivors of the annihilation campaign, Taur Matan Ruak was captured in the Viqueque area by [[Indonesian Army]] forces on 31 March 1979. After 23 days he managed to escape and rejoin other FALINTIL forces in the mountains.\n\nIn March 1981 he was appointed Assistant Chief-of-Staff of FALINTIL, responsible for the operational command of the Eastern Sectors and later the Central Sector.  Taur Matan Ruak was promoted and made responsible for strategic planning of commando operations in the Eastern sector in March 1983.  Between 1984 and 1986 Brigadier Ruak was transferred and served as military adviser for commando operations in the Western Sector. After nearly 10 years of operational experience he was promoted to Deputy Chief-of-Staff.  After 1986, he was responsible for all commando operations throughout East Timor.\n\nIn November 1992, Commander-in-Chief [[Xanana Gusm\u00e3o]] was captured in [[Dili]]. Taur Matan Ruak was promoted to Chief-of-Staff. Ruak became the Commander of FALINTIL after the death of Commander Konis Santana on 11 March 1998. Xanana Gusm\u00e3o resigned from FALINTIL and Taur Matan Ruak was appointed the Commander-in-Chief of FALINTIL. With the restoration of Independence on 20 May 2002 he became the Chief of the Armed Forces (''Chefe Estado Maior General For\u00e7as Armadas'', CEMGFA) and was promoted to Major General in 2009.\n\nGeneral Ruak is married to [[Isabel da Costa Ferreira]].\n\n==Events since restoration of independence==\nTaur Matan Ruak played a role in the [[2006 East Timorese crisis]].

Also, scholars and researchers can now easily collate and generate comprehensive records with in-depth analytic reports and auxiliary graphics of their publications, citations, academic rankings, prizes or awards, and other relevant data.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Impactio Offers Streamlined and Intuitive Digital Tools for Creating Effective Academic Resumes and CVs in Just Minutes - Platform Helps PhDs Simplify and Modernize|url = https://www.morningstar.com/news/pr-newswire/20200413ph77105/impactio-offers-streamlined-and-intuitive-digital-tools-for-creating-effective-academic-resumes-and-cvs-in-just-minutes-platform-helps-phds-simplify-and-modernize|source = Morningstars|accessdate = 2020-04-21|language = en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Innovative Impact Analytics Allows Researchers to View Their Global Impact at a Single Glance - Latest Digital Edge From Impactio to Help Ph.D.s, Scientists, and Established Engineers|url = https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/innovative-impact-analytics-allows-researchers-to-view-their-global-impact-at-a-single-glance-latest-digital-edge-from-impactio-to-help-ph-d-s-scientists-and-established-engineers-1029090771|source = Markets Insiders|accessdate = 2020-04-21|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\n==Benefits==\nA fast-growing discipline and corporate necessity, reputation management is widely acknowledged as a valuable [[intangible asset]] which can be one of the most important sources of competitive edge in a fiercely competitive market,<ref>Weigelt, K., and C.

Good reputation management practices are also important in helping any entity manage staff confidence as a control tool on public perceptions which if undermined and ignored can be costly, which in the long run may cripple employee confidence, a risk no employer would dare explore as staff morale is one of the most important drivers of company performance.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Employees: The key link to corporate reputation management|first1=Karen S.|last1=Cravens|first2=Elizabeth Goad|last2=Oliver|date=1 July 2006|journal=Business Horizons|volume=49|issue=4|pages=293\u2013302|doi=10.1016/j.bushor.2005.10.006}}</ref>\n\n==Reputation management campaigns in popular media==\nIn 2011, controversy around the [[Taco Bell]] restaurant chain arose when public accusations were made that their \"seasoned beef\" product was only made up of only 35% real beef.
