{"title_page": "Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy", "text_new": "{{short description|Indian music director duo}}\n{{EngvarB|date=August 2014}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2014}}\n'''Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy''' were an Indian music-director duo composed of [[M. S. Viswanathan]] and [[T. K. Ramamoorthy]]. They worked together on over 100 films, from 1952's ''[[Panam (film)|Panam]]'' to 1965's ''[[Aayirathil Oruvan (1965 film)|Aayirathil Oruvan]]''. After their split, Ramamoorthy worked on 16 films between 1966 and 1986. He and Viswanathan reunited in 1995 for ''[[Engirundho Vandhan]]''.\n\n=={{anchor|Early life}}Early lives==\n===Ramamoorthy===\nRamamoorthy, born into a well-known musical family in [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichy]], was a capable violinist at an early age. His father (Krishnaswamy Pillai) and grandfather, Malaikottai Govindasamy Pillai, were noted violinists in Trichy.<ref name=\"sp\" /> As a child, Ramamoorthy performed several times with his father. During the early 1940s he worked for Saraswathi Stores (in which [[AVM Productions]] owner [[Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar]] was a partner), and played violin for AVM composer R. Sudharsanam in several films. Ramamoorthy became friendly with P. S. Diwakar, the pianist-composer of [[Malayalam cinema]], and roomed with P. S. Diwakar. [[C. R. Subburaman]] hired him as a violinist for HMV. By the late 1940s, Ramamoorthy joined [[C. R. Subburaman]]'s South Indian film-music ensemble and met fellow violinist [[T. G. Lingappa]].\n\n===Viswanathan===\nViswanathan, who had acting and singing ambitions, had a few minor stage roles during the 1940s. The famous music composer in the 1950s [[T. R. Pappa]] who was a violinist for the doyen of the Tamil film music [[S. V. Venkatraman]], met him and obtained him a job as an errand boy. Viswanathan developed an interest in composition, and joined [[S. M. Subbaiah Naidu]].<ref name=\"sp\" /> He played [[harmonium]] for C. R. Subburaman and met Ramamoorthy and T. G. Lingappa, another leading violinist. In addition to the harmonium, Viswanathan began playing piano at an early age.\n\n=={{anchor|With C. R. Subburaman}}With Subburaman==\nWith [[C. R. Subburaman]], Viswanathan played the harmonium and Ramamoorthy the violin. Although both considered Subburaman their mentor, Viswanathan was also inspired by the music of [[S. V. Venkatraman]] and [[T. R. Pappa]].\n\nIn 1952 Subburaman died unexpectedly, leaving the music for several films unfinished.  Ramamoorthy and Viswanathan completed the background music for ''[[Devdas (1953 Telugu film)|Devadas]]'', ''[[Chandirani]]'', ''[[Marumagal (1953 film)|Marumagal]]'' and ''[[Kaadhal (1952 film)|Kaadhal]]''. Viswanathan then suggested a south-Indian partnership to Ramamoorthy, similar to [[Shankar Jaikishan]] in the north. Initially reluctant, Ramamoorthy agreed.<ref name=\"sp\">{{Cite magazine |last=Ramachandran |first=T.

L. Seenivasan and directed by [[N. S. Krishnan]] (who supported their partnership).<ref name=\"sp\" /> Their musical training and personalities differed; the shy Ramamoorthy had a [[Carnatic music]]al background and Viswanathan, lacking Carnatic training, was a dynamic individual.\n\n''Panam'' was [[Sivaji Ganesan]]'s second film and his first appearance with [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]]. Although the duo were initially supposed to be billed as Ramamoorthy-Viswanathan, N. S. Krishnan felt having Viswanathan's name first sounded better and told Ramamoorthy, \"You are senior to him so you can be behind him, supporting him\" and Ramamoorthy assented.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/ninety-and-bowing-away/article4077596.ece |title=Ninety, and bowing away! |last=Rangarajan |first=Malathi |date=November 8, 2012 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nComposer and singer [[C. S. Jayaraman]] commissioned Viswanathan Ramamoorthy for ''[[Ratha Kanneer]]''{{'s}} background music, writing the songs himself.\n\n=={{anchor|Rising}}Success==\nSuccess was slow in coming during a period which featured composers such as [[G. Ramanathan]], [[S. V. Venkatraman]], [[K. V. Mahadevan]], [[S. Rajeswara Rao]], [[Susarla Dakshinamurthi|S. Dakshinamurthi]] and [[Pendyala Nageswara Rao]]. In the wake of ''Panam''{{'s}} success, however, Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy wrote music for over 100 films from 1952 to 1965 and were the most successful composers from 1957 to 1965.\n\nThey had a flair for light, sweet melodies, and 1950s films such as ''Porter Kanthan'', ''[[Paasavalai]]'', ''[[Tenali Ramakrishna (film)|Thenali Raman]]'', ''[[Gulebakavali (1955 film)|Gulebakavali]]'', ''[[Sugam Enge]]'' and ''[[Sorgavasal]]'' attracted attention. In 1956  Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy composed music for ''Santhosham'', the Telugu adaptation of the Tamil film ''[[Velaikaari]]'' with [[N. T. Rama Rao]] and [[Anjali Devi]], which was a musical hit. It was reprised in Hindi as ''Naya Aadmi'' with music by [[Madan Mohan (music director)|Madan Mohan]], who wanted to keep some of the original songs in the Hindi version. The Hindi song ''\"Laut gaya gam ka zamana\"'', sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Hemanta Kumar Mukhopadhyay]], copies the duo's Telugu song ''Teeyani Eenati Reyi'' (sung by [[P. Suseela]] and [[G. K. Venkatesh]]) and was a hit in the north.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy composed for musical hits such as ''[[Pudhaiyal]]'', ''[[Nichaya Thaamboolam]]'', ''[[Padhi Bhakti]]'' and ''[[Bhaaga Pirivinai]]''. They enjoyed continued success into the early 1960s with directors [[T. R. Ramanna]] and [[A. Bhimsingh]]. After a 1961 disagreement with his  composer, [[A. M. Rajah]], [[C. V. Sridhar]] commissioned Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy for his films and [[Gemini Studios]] and [[AVM Productions]] later engaged the duo. At this time, they were assisted by R. Govardhanam, [[G. K. Venkatesh]], [[Shankar Ganesh]] and Henry Daniel and used Sathan for vocal and sound effects.\n\n==Other collaborations==\nViswanathan and Ramamoorthy, particularly Viswanathan, are credited with moulding the careers of their regular singers [[T. M. Soundararajan]], [[P. Susheela]], [[P. B. Sreenivas]], [[Seerkazhi Govindarajan]] and [[L. R. Eswari]]. [[A. L. Raghavan]] and [[S. Janaki]] sang less often for them.\n\n[[K. J. Yesudas]] had his only collaboration with the duo in two songs from ''[[Kadhalikka Neramillai]]'' (1964): ''\"Nenjathai Alli Alli\"'' with L. R. Eswari and [[P. Suseela]] and ''\"Enna Paarvai Undhan Paarvai\"'' with P. Suseela. After the partnership dissolved, K. J. Yesudas sang with Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy separately.\n\nDuring their early years, they worked with established male singers such as [[Thiruchi Loganathan]], [[C. S. Jayaraman]], [[S. C. Krishnan]], [[Ghantasala (singer)|Ghantasala]] and [[V. N. Sundharam]]. The female singers were [[P. A. Periyanayaki]], [[M. L. Vasanthakumari]], [[Raavu Balasaraswathi|R. Balasaraswathi Devi]], [[P. Leela]], [[Jikki]], [[T. V. Rathinam]], [[T. S. Bagavathi]], [[M. S. Rajeswari]], [[K. Jamuna Rani]], [[K. Rani (singer)|K. Rani]], [[A. P. Komala]] and [[A. G. Rathnamala]].\n\nThe singing actors [[N. S. Krishnan]], [[T. A. Madhuram]], [[Chittor V. Nagaiah]], [[T. R. Mahalingam (actor)|T. R. Mahalingam]], [[K. R. Ramaswamy (actor)|K. R. Ramaswamy]], [[J. P. Chandrababu]], [[P. Bhanumathi]] and [[S. Varalakshmi]] also sang for the duo. [[G. K. Venkatesh]], M. S. Viswanathan's friend and assistant, sang a few songs as well.\n\nT. M. Soundararajan was Viswanathan's favourite singer and [[Jikki]], followed by P. Susheela, were the duo's primary female singers. They were divided on [[A. M. Rajah]]; although Ramamoorthy favoured him, Viswanathan had a personality conflict dating back to ''[[Genova (1953 film)|Genova]]''. Rajah sang only five Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy songs, at the height of his career during the 1950s. He voiced [[Gemini Ganesan]], the actor for whom he was the primary voice, only in ''[[Padhi Bhakti]]''.\n\n[[P. Leela]], [[Seerkazhi Govindarajan]], Sarojini, [[K. Jamuna Rani]], [[M. S. Rajeswari]] and [[A. L. Raghavan]] owe their 1950s and 1960s vocal success primarily to the duo, particularly to Viswanathan. Directors such as [[B. R. Panthulu]], [[B. S. Ranga]], [[Krishnan-Panju]], [[A. Bhimsingh]], P. Madhavan, [[C. V. Sridhar]], [[T. R. Ramanna]] and [[A. C. Tirulokchandar]] worked with  Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy frequently until 1965. [[K. Balachander]] never worked with the duo, preferring to work with Viswanathan alone even before the split.\n\n==''Mellisai Mannargal''==\nOn 16 June 1963, Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy were given the title of ''Mellisai Mannargal'' ({{lang-ta|\u0bae\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd}}, Kings of Light Music) by [[Sivaji Ganesan]] at a Madras Triplicane Cultural Academy ceremony sponsored by T. M. Ramachandran, director [[C. V. Sridhar]] and Chitralaya Gobu of the Hindu Group of Publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tfmpage.com/forum/10086.768.4.html |title=Why did Viswanathan and Ramamurthy break-up their |publisher=Tfmpage.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|The Split}}Split==\nViswanathan and Ramamoorthy split up after the release of ''Aayirathil Oruvan'' on 9 July 1965. They composed for films separately, with the assistants remaining with Viswanathan. Although producer-directors [[T. R. Ramanna]] and [[A. Bhimsingh]] were saddened by the development, they worked with both men individually.\n\nThe split was the result of interpersonal issues. In 1964, [[C. V. Sridhar]] directed ''[[Kalai Kovil]]'', starring [[S. V. Subbaiah]], [[R. Muthuraman]], [[Chandrakantha]], [[Nagesh]], [[V. Gopalakrishnan (actor)|V. Gopalakrishnan]] and [[V. S. Raghavan]]; Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy produced the film and composed its music. The film and its songs were unsuccessful, and a ''[[Kalki (magazine)|Kalki]]'' article was critical. Disagreement between the composers worsened by ''[[Server Sundaram]]'', starring [[Nagesh]], [[R. Muthuraman]] and [[K. R. Vijaya]], which was released at the end of 1964. Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy were scheduled to shoot a scene suggested by Bollywood music director [[Naushad Ali]] to producer [[Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar|A. V. Meiyappa Chettiar]]; Ramamoorthy could not appear, and after completing ''Aayirathil Oruvan'' the duo announced their split.\n\nIn his solo career, Viswanathan composed music for over 1,100 films from 1965 to 2013. Ramamoorthy was less successful, composing for 19 films from 1966 to 1986. Viswanathan, the highest-paid music director from 1965 to 1985,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} continued to compose until 1995; after a period composing devotional songs, he resumed until 2013.\n\n=={{anchor|The Rejoice}}Reunion==\nViswanathan and Ramamoorthy briefly reunited in 1995 for the unsuccessful Tamil film ''[[Engirundho Vandhan]]'', starring [[Sathyaraj]] and [[Roja (film)|Roja]]. It was the remake of the megahit Malayalam film ''[[Chithram]]''. The film was a box office disaster and the songs went unnoticed. It was also their last film together. They received [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] from [[Sathyabama University]] in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/04/stories/2006090414590500.htm |title=Tamil Nadu / Chennai News : Honorary doctorates for seven eminent personalities |publisher=The Hindu |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n==Thirai Isai Chakravarthy==\n[[Tamil Nadu]] [[List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu|Chief Minister]] [[J.Jayalalithaa]] gave Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy the title of ''Thirai Isai Chakravarthy'' ({{lang-ta|\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8 \u0b87\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0b9a\u0b95\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf}}, Emperors of Cine Music) in August 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chennaionline.com/movies/cine-buzz/20124830094809/Amma-confers-title-of-Thiraiyisai-Chakravarthy-on-legendary-MSV.col |title=Amma confers title of Thiraiyisai Chakravarthy on legendary MSV |publisher=ChennaiOnline |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927230705/http://chennaionline.com/movies/cine-buzz/20124830094809/Amma-confers-title-of-Thiraiyisai-Chakravarthy-on-legendary-MSV.col |archive-date=27 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=News |first=Express |url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article597851.ece |title=CM confers Thirai Isai Chakravarthy on MSV |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-padma-snub-jaya-says-one-day-centre-will-listen/995707/ |title=After Padma snub, Jaya says one day Centre will listen |publisher=Indian Express |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Deaths==\nRamamoorthy died in a [[Chennai]] hospital after a brief illness on 17 April 2013 at age 91.<ref name=death>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-17/chennai/38615223_1_j-jayalalithaa-jaya-tv-composer TK Ramamurthy, noted music composer, passes away]</ref>\n\nOn 27 June 2015, Viswanathan was admitted to Fortis Malar Hospital in Chennai with respiratory difficulty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telangananewspaper.com/m-s-viswanathan-death/ |title=M S Viswanathan Death|work=Telangana News Paper}}</ref> and died there at 4:15&nbsp;a.m. on 14 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/King-of-Light-Music-MS-Viswanathan-Passes-Away/2015/07/14/article2919555.ece|title=King of Film Music MS Viswanathan Passes Away|work=The New Indian Express}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

S. Viswanathan]] and [[T. K. Ramamoorthy]]. They worked together on over 100 films, from 1952's ''[[Panam (film)|Panam]]'' to 1965's ''[[Aayirathil Oruvan (1965 film)|Aayirathil Oruvan]]''. After their split, Ramamoorthy worked on 16 films between 1966 and 1986. He and Viswanathan reunited in 1995 for ''[[Engirundho Vandhan]]''.\n\n=={{anchor|Early life}}Early lives==\n===Ramamoorthy===\nRamamoorthy, born into a well-known musical family in [[Tiruchirappalli|Trichy]], was a capable violinist at an early age. His father (Krishnaswamy Pillai) and grandfather, Malaikottai Govindasamy Pillai, were noted violinists in Trichy.<ref name=\"sp\" /> As a child, Ramamoorthy performed several times with his father. During the early 1940s he worked for Saraswathi Stores (in which [[AVM Productions]] owner [[Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar]] was a partner), and played violin for AVM composer R. Sudharsanam in several films. Ramamoorthy became friendly with P. S. Diwakar, the pianist-composer of [[Malayalam cinema]], and roomed with P. S. Diwakar. [[C. R. Subburaman]] hired him as a violinist for HMV. By the late 1940s, Ramamoorthy joined [[C. R. Subburaman]]'s South Indian film-music ensemble and met fellow violinist [[T. G. Lingappa]].\n\n===Viswanathan===\nViswanathan, who had acting and singing ambitions, had a few minor stage roles during the 1940s. The famous music composer in the 1950s [[T. R. Pappa]] who was a violinist for the doyen of the Tamil film music [[S. V. Venkatraman]], met him and obtained him a job as an errand boy. Viswanathan developed an interest in composition, and joined [[S. M. Subbaiah Naidu]].<ref name=\"sp\" /> He played [[harmonium]] for C. R. Subburaman and met Ramamoorthy and T. G. Lingappa, another leading violinist. In addition to the harmonium, Viswanathan began playing piano at an early age.\n\n=={{anchor|With C. R. Subburaman}}With Subburaman==\nWith [[C. R. Subburaman]], Viswanathan played the harmonium and Ramamoorthy the violin. Although both considered Subburaman their mentor, Viswanathan was also inspired by the music of [[S. V. Venkatraman]] and [[T. R. Pappa]].\n\nIn 1952 Subburaman died unexpectedly, leaving the music for several films unfinished.  Ramamoorthy and Viswanathan completed the background music for ''[[Devdas (1953 Telugu film)|Devadas]]'', ''[[Chandirani]]'', ''[[Marumagal (1953 film)|Marumagal]]'' and ''[[Kaadhal (1952 film)|Kaadhal]]''. Viswanathan then suggested a south-Indian partnership to Ramamoorthy, similar to [[Shankar Jaikishan]] in the north. Initially reluctant, Ramamoorthy agreed.<ref name=\"sp\">{{Cite magazine |last=Ramachandran |first=T.

L. Seenivasan and directed by [[N. S. Krishnan]] (who supported their partnership).<ref name=\"sp\" /> Their musical training and personalities differed; the shy Ramamoorthy had a [[Carnatic music]]al background and Viswanathan, lacking Carnatic training, was a dynamic individual.\n\n''Panam'' was [[Sivaji Ganesan]]'s second film and his first appearance with [[Padmini (actress)|Padmini]]. Although the duo were initially supposed to be billed as Ramamoorthy-Viswanathan, N. S. Krishnan felt having Viswanathan's name first sounded better and told Ramamoorthy, \"You are senior to him so you can be behind him, supporting him\" and Ramamoorthy assented.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/music/ninety-and-bowing-away/article4077596.ece |title=Ninety, and bowing away! |last=Rangarajan |first=Malathi |date=November 8, 2012 |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=26 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nComposer and singer [[C. S. Jayaraman]] commissioned Viswanathan Ramamoorthy for ''[[Ratha Kanneer]]''{{'s}} background music, writing the songs himself.\n\n=={{anchor|Rising}}Success==\nSuccess was slow in coming during a period which featured composers such as [[G. Ramanathan]], [[S. V. Venkatraman]], [[K. V. Mahadevan]], [[S. Rajeswara Rao]], [[Susarla Dakshinamurthi|S. Dakshinamurthi]] and [[Pendyala Nageswara Rao]]. In the wake of ''Panam''{{'s}} success, however, Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy wrote music for over 100 films from 1952 to 1965 and were the most successful composers from 1957 to 1965.\n\nThey had a flair for light, sweet melodies, and 1950s films such as ''Porter Kanthan'', ''[[Paasavalai]]'', ''[[Tenali Ramakrishna (film)|Thenali Raman]]'', ''[[Gulebakavali (1955 film)|Gulebakavali]]'', ''[[Sugam Enge]]'' and ''[[Sorgavasal]]'' attracted attention. In 1956  Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy composed music for ''Santhosham'', the Telugu adaptation of the Tamil film ''[[Velaikaari]]'' with [[N. T. Rama Rao]] and [[Anjali Devi]], which was a musical hit. It was reprised in Hindi as ''Naya Aadmi'' with music by [[Madan Mohan (music director)|Madan Mohan]], who wanted to keep some of the original songs in the Hindi version. The Hindi song ''\"Laut gaya gam ka zamana\"'', sung by [[Lata Mangeshkar]] and [[Hemanta Kumar Mukhopadhyay]], copies the duo's Telugu song ''Teeyani Eenati Reyi'' (sung by [[P. Suseela]] and [[G. K. Venkatesh]]) and was a hit in the north.\n\nDuring the late 1950s, Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy composed for musical hits such as ''[[Pudhaiyal]]'', ''[[Nichaya Thaamboolam]]'', ''[[Padhi Bhakti]]'' and ''[[Bhaaga Pirivinai]]''. They enjoyed continued success into the early 1960s with directors [[T. R. Ramanna]] and [[A. Bhimsingh]]. After a 1961 disagreement with his  composer, [[A. M. Rajah]], [[C. V. Sridhar]] commissioned Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy for his films and [[Gemini Studios]] and [[AVM Productions]] later engaged the duo. At this time, they were assisted by R. Govardhanam, [[G. K. Venkatesh]], [[Shankar Ganesh]] and Henry Daniel and used Sathan for vocal and sound effects.\n\n==Other collaborations==\nViswanathan and Ramamoorthy, particularly Viswanathan, are credited with moulding the careers of their regular singers [[T. M. Soundararajan]], [[P. Susheela]], [[P. B. Sreenivas]], [[Seerkazhi Govindarajan]] and [[L. R. Eswari]]. [[A. L. Raghavan]] and [[S. Janaki]] sang less often for them.\n\n[[K. J. Yesudas]] had his only collaboration with the duo in two songs from ''[[Kadhalikka Neramillai]]'' (1964): ''\"Nenjathai Alli Alli\"'' with L. R. Eswari and [[P. Suseela]] and ''\"Enna Paarvai Undhan Paarvai\"'' with P. Suseela. After the partnership dissolved, K. J. Yesudas sang with Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy separately.\n\nDuring their early years, they worked with established male singers such as [[Thiruchi Loganathan]], [[C. S. Jayaraman]], [[S. C. Krishnan]], [[Ghantasala (singer)|Ghantasala]] and [[V. N. Sundharam]]. The female singers were [[P. A. Periyanayaki]], [[M. L. Vasanthakumari]], [[Raavu Balasaraswathi|R. Balasaraswathi Devi]], [[P. Leela]], [[Jikki]], [[T. V. Rathinam]], [[T. S. Bagavathi]], [[M. S. Rajeswari]], [[K. Jamuna Rani]], [[K. Rani (singer)|K. Rani]], [[A. P. Komala]] and [[A. G. Rathnamala]].\n\nThe singing actors [[N. S. Krishnan]], [[T. A. Madhuram]], [[Chittor V. Nagaiah]], [[T. R. Mahalingam (actor)|T. R. Mahalingam]], [[K. R. Ramaswamy (actor)|K. R. Ramaswamy]], [[J. P. Chandrababu]], [[P. Bhanumathi]] and [[S. Varalakshmi]] also sang for the duo. [[G. K. Venkatesh]], M. S. Viswanathan's friend and assistant, sang a few songs as well.\n\nT. M. Soundararajan was Viswanathan's favourite singer and [[Jikki]], followed by P. Susheela, were the duo's primary female singers. They were divided on [[A. M. Rajah]]; although Ramamoorthy favoured him, Viswanathan had a personality conflict dating back to ''[[Genova (1953 film)|Genova]]''. Rajah sang only five Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy songs, at the height of his career during the 1950s. He voiced [[Gemini Ganesan]], the actor for whom he was the primary voice, only in ''[[Padhi Bhakti]]''.\n\n[[P. Leela]], [[Seerkazhi Govindarajan]], Sarojini, [[K. Jamuna Rani]], [[M. S. Rajeswari]] and [[A. L. Raghavan]] owe their 1950s and 1960s vocal success primarily to the duo, particularly to Viswanathan. Directors such as [[B. R. Panthulu]], [[B. S. Ranga]], [[Krishnan-Panju]], [[A. Bhimsingh]], P. Madhavan, [[C. V. Sridhar]], [[T. R. Ramanna]] and [[A. C. Tirulokchandar]] worked with  Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy frequently until 1965. [[K. Balachander]] never worked with the duo, preferring to work with Viswanathan alone even before the split.\n\n==''Mellisai Mannargal''==\nOn 16 June 1963, Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy were given the title of ''Mellisai Mannargal'' ({{lang-ta|\u0bae\u0bc6\u0bb2\u0bcd\u0bb2\u0bbf\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0bae\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd}}, Kings of Light Music) by [[Sivaji Ganesan]] at a Madras Triplicane Cultural Academy ceremony sponsored by T. M. Ramachandran, director [[C. V. Sridhar]] and Chitralaya Gobu of the Hindu Group of Publications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tfmpage.com/forum/10086.768.4.html |title=Why did Viswanathan and Ramamurthy break-up their |publisher=Tfmpage.com |date= |accessdate=27 February 2012}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|The Split}}Split==\nViswanathan and Ramamoorthy split up after the release of ''Aayirathil Oruvan'' on 9 July 1965. They composed for films separately, with the assistants remaining with Viswanathan. Although producer-directors [[T. R. Ramanna]] and [[A. Bhimsingh]] were saddened by the development, they worked with both men individually.\n\nThe split was the result of interpersonal issues. In 1964, [[C. V. Sridhar]] directed ''[[Kalai Kovil]]'', starring [[S. V. Subbaiah]], [[R. Muthuraman]], [[Chandrakantha]], [[Nagesh]], [[V. Gopalakrishnan (actor)|V. Gopalakrishnan]] and [[V. S. Raghavan]]; Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy produced the film and composed its music. The film and its songs were unsuccessful, and a ''[[Kalki (magazine)|Kalki]]'' article was critical. Disagreement between the composers worsened by ''[[Server Sundaram]]'', starring [[Nagesh]], [[R. Muthuraman]] and [[K. R. Vijaya]], which was released at the end of 1964. Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy were scheduled to shoot a scene suggested by Bollywood music director [[Naushad Ali]] to producer [[Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar|A. V. Meiyappa Chettiar]]; Ramamoorthy could not appear, and after completing ''Aayirathil Oruvan'' the duo announced their split.\n\nIn his solo career, Viswanathan composed music for over 1,100 films from 1965 to 2013. Ramamoorthy was less successful, composing for 19 films from 1966 to 1986. Viswanathan, the highest-paid music director from 1965 to 1985,{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} continued to compose until 1995; after a period composing devotional songs, he resumed until 2013.\n\n=={{anchor|The Rejoice}}Reunion==\nViswanathan and Ramamoorthy briefly reunited in 1995 for the unsuccessful Tamil film ''[[Engirundho Vandhan]]'', starring [[Sathyaraj]] and [[Roja (film)|Roja]]. It was the remake of the megahit Malayalam film ''[[Chithram]]''. The film was a box office disaster and the songs went unnoticed. It was also their last film together. They received [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] from [[Sathyabama University]] in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/04/stories/2006090414590500.htm |title=Tamil Nadu / Chennai News : Honorary doctorates for seven eminent personalities |publisher=The Hindu |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=6 March 2012 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\n==Thirai Isai Chakravarthy==\n[[Tamil Nadu]] [[List of Chief Ministers of Tamil Nadu|Chief Minister]] [[J.Jayalalithaa]] gave Viswanathan and Ramamoorthy the title of ''Thirai Isai Chakravarthy'' ({{lang-ta|\u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc8 \u0b87\u0b9a\u0bc8 \u0b9a\u0b95\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bb5\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bbf}}, Emperors of Cine Music) in August 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chennaionline.com/movies/cine-buzz/20124830094809/Amma-confers-title-of-Thiraiyisai-Chakravarthy-on-legendary-MSV.col |title=Amma confers title of Thiraiyisai Chakravarthy on legendary MSV |publisher=ChennaiOnline |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927230705/http://chennaionline.com/movies/cine-buzz/20124830094809/Amma-confers-title-of-Thiraiyisai-Chakravarthy-on-legendary-MSV.col |archive-date=27 September 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=News |first=Express |url=http://newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/article597851.ece |title=CM confers Thirai Isai Chakravarthy on MSV |publisher=The New Indian Express |date=30 August 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-padma-snub-jaya-says-one-day-centre-will-listen/995707/ |title=After Padma snub, Jaya says one day Centre will listen |publisher=Indian Express |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Deaths==\nRamamoorthy died in a [[Chennai]] hospital after a brief illness on 17 April 2013 at age 91.<ref name=death>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-17/chennai/38615223_1_j-jayalalithaa-jaya-tv-composer TK Ramamurthy, noted music composer, passes away]</ref>\n\nOn 27 June 2015, Viswanathan was admitted to Fortis Malar Hospital in Chennai with respiratory difficulty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telangananewspaper.com/m-s-viswanathan-death/ |title=M S Viswanathan Death|work=Telangana News Paper}}</ref> and died there at 4:15&nbsp;a.m. on 14 July.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/King-of-Light-Music-MS-Viswanathan-Passes-Away/2015/07/14/article2919555.ece|title=King of Film Music MS Viswanathan Passes Away|work=The New Indian Express}}</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

He was a central figure in the establishment of [[Midland, Ontario]], Canada. The son of John Speirs Playfair (26 June 1826, Glasgow \u2013 2 June 1913, Toronto) and Georgina Hall of Montreal, in 1889 Playfair married Sarah Charlotte Ogilvie (1858-1945), youngest daughter of Senator [[Alexander Walker Ogilvie|A.W. Ogilvie]] of Montreal, former president of Ogilvie Flour Mills.\n\n==Lumbering==\nAt the age of 19, James Playfair was hired by the Toronto Lumber Company which had timber holdings in Simcoe County and mills at Collingwood.<ref>Toronto Marine Historical Society, Scanner, February 1979</ref> The lumbering firm of James Playfair & Company was started in 1884.<ref>The Canada Lumberman magazine, November 1896</ref> Playfair's first mill was located at Sturgeon Bay, (between Waubaushene and Victoria Harbour).<ref>The Canada Lumberman magazine June 15, 1885</ref> In 1894 he formed a lumber partnership with Douglas Leyland White, Jr. and together they purchased the mill formerly known as the [[Andrew Miscampbell|Miscampbell]] mill, at Midland.<ref>The Canada Lumberman magazine, November 1894</ref> D. L. White Jr. of Saginaw, Michigan, was the former treasurer of the Emery Lumber Co. of Saginaw and East Tawas, MI. incorporated in 1885. They were involved in the export of logs from the Sudbury region, to supply their Michigan mills. When the export duty on logs was increased in 1886, the vice president of the Emery Lumber Co. [[Ralph A. Loveland|R. A. Loveland]] arranged to have that firm's Georgian Bay logs manufactured into lumber at Miscampbell's mill.<ref>The Canada Lumberman magazine, October 1887</ref> By the 1890's Andrew Miscampbell desired to devote more of his time to politics. He sold his mill to the Emery Lumber Co. in 1891, but with the reduction of the duty on logs exported to the United States, operations of the Midland mill were abandoned and Emery's lumber production was resumed on the American side.<ref>The Canada Lumberman magazine, May 1891</ref> D. L. White Jr. continued his involvement with the Saginaw Lumber And Salt Company (incorporated in 1881), with the same officers as the Emery Lumber Co.<ref>The Canada Lumberman magazine, February 1893</ref> With their acquisition of the former Emery Lumber Co. mill, James Playfair and D. L. White formed the Playfair-White Company. They contracted to supply the lumber requirements of Saginaw lumberman Arthur Hill, with logs from timber limits the French and Spanish rivers. The mill operated at full capacity until 1916, when the Midland Shipbuilding Company was established on the same site.<ref>Midland on Georgian Bay, (an Illustrated History of Midland, Ontario) by William Northcott and William Smith, published by Huronia Museum, Midland. 2008</ref>\n\n==Shipping Interests==\nIn 1895, Playfair purchased from Burton Bros., of Collingwood, the tug [[Metamora (tug)|METAMORA]], three barges and a large quantity of boom logs, which he planned to use in connection with the lumbering business.<ref>The Canada Lumberman magazine February 1895</ref> In partnership with [[John Waldie]] and Capt. W. H. Featherstonhaugh, Playfair purchased an 11 year old steamer, the W. B. HALL in 1896. The ship was lengthened at the [[Polson Iron Works Limited|Polson Shipyard]] at [[Owen Sound]], renamed ST. ANDREW, and placed in the grain trade between  [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]].<ref>The Midland Navigation Company Limited A Short Corporate History and Vessel Listing, Scanner, v. 11, n. 5, February 1979</ref> The tug, METAMORA and barge ST. ANDREW, were operated by Playfair's Barge And Tug Line.<ref>Official Directory and Atlas of Grand Trunk Railway System 1897-1898</ref> The ST. ANDREW served Playfair for five seasons but, on September 20, 1900, she stranded on an island on [[Lake Superior]] and became a total loss.<ref>Scanner, v. 11, n. 5, February 1979</ref> The METAMORA along with other ships MAGNOLIA, RELIANCE and TRAVELER became part of the Midland Towing And Wrecking Co. Ltd.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, May 1907</ref> The METAMORA struck a shoal at Shawanaga Bay, near Parry Sound in 1907. It subsequently caught fire and was completely destroyed.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, November 1907</ref> \n\nPlayfair incorporated the Midland Navigation Company, in 1901. The Steel bulk carrier MIDLAND QUEEN was built in 1901 at Dundee, Scotland. A second vessel, the MIDLAND KING, was a steel bulk carrier built 1903 at Collingwood by Collingwood Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. The steel bulk carrier MIDLAND PRINCE, was built 1906-07 by Collingwood Shipbuilding Co. EMPRESS OF MIDLAND built in 1907 and the EMPRESS OF FORT WILLIAM built 1908, were steel bulk carriers, both built at Wallsend-on-Tyne by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson Ltd. the latter two vessels built for the Midland Navigation Co., but soon became part of the Empress Navigation Co. of Midland.<ref>Scanner, v. 11, n. 5, February 1979</ref>\n\nIn March, 1910, Playfair and Company gained control of the Inland Navigation Company Ltd. from the Mackay brothers, of Hamilton.<ref>Ship of the Month No. 96 WAHCONDAH, Scanner, v. 13, n. 2 November 1980.</ref> A plan was devised to merge the company with the Midland Navigation Co. and the Empress Navigation Co. The ships of the Hamilton firm were: NEEPAWAH, WAHCONDAH, ROSEDALE, GLENELLAH, DUNDEE, DUNELM, WINONA, STRATHCONA, DONNACONA, DUNDURN and STADACONA. The new company was incorporated as Inland Lines Ltd.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, June 1910</ref> \n\nIn mid-January 1911, James Playfair made a bid to purchase the Northern Navigation Co. on behalf of himself and his associates. The offer to purchase the company was subject to approval by the Grand Trunk Railway, concerning a previous arrangement that its president C. M. Hays had made with the company for the construction of a new steamship of the HAMONIC type. The conditions were met and James Playfair became the new president of Northern Navigation Co.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, March 1911</ref> While a merger between the Northern Navigation Co. and Inland Lines Ltd. had been discussed, it was thought that a holding company to control them, was more probable. At that time, there was talk of an even larger merger between the Northern Navigation Co. and the Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, April 1911.</ref> In 1911 the  Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. were allowed to increase their capital stock. At a special meeting of shareholders held on June 26, it was decided to increase the stock from $ 5,000,0000 to $ 10,000,000, with the distribution of new shares to be issued by the directors. The shares of the Northern Navigation Co. Ltd. and of the Inland Lines Ltd. were purchased and paid for with fully paid up stock of the R. And O Navigation Co. Five additional directors were added to the reorganized Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. James Playfair became the vice president and managing director.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, July 1911</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 1913, James Playfair was on his way to [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Port Arthur]], for the launching of the [[SS Noronic|NORONIC]]. He was a passenger on the [[Hamonic (steamship)|HAMONIC]] somewhere on Lake Superior, when the [[wireless]] operator received word that James' father, had passed away in [[Toronto]]. 87 year old John S. Playfair, came to Canada as an employee of dry goods merchant [[John McMurrich]]. For some time John Playfair had managed the firm's Kingston store and may have been involved with shipping on Lake Ontario. He first became involved with [[Alexander Peter Cockburn|A. P. Cockburn]]'s Muskoka Lakes Navigation Co. in 1879 and served as president of that line for more than 25 years. James Playfair transferred to one of the R And O Nav. Co. freighters mid-lake, about 80 miles from [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] and made his way to Toronto by special train.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, July 1913</ref> <ref>Dictionary of Canadian Biography/McMURRICH, JOHN</ref>\n\nA special meeting of the shareholders of Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. was held in the company's office in Montreal, on June 19, to ratify an agreement of sale of the company's assets to a new company formed for that purpose. The new company was to be called Canada Transportation Lines Limited.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, July July 1913</ref> In the early part of December it was announced that Canada Transportation Lines would be renamed [[Canada Steamship Lines|Canada Steamship Lines Limited]].<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, December 1913</ref> With the acquisition of Inland Lines Ltd. by Canada Transportation Lines, Playfair relinquished personal control of his ships, although he was still a director of the company. James Playfair retired as managing director early in 1914. At Toronto, Playfair was presented with a solid silver center table piece and rose bowl with the following inscription: \"Presented to James Playfair by the officials, staff, captains and engineers of the Inland Lines, Ltd., and Northern Navigation Co., Ltd., as a token of the high esteem in which he is held by one and all.\" An old English chime clock was also presented to Mrs. Playfair.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, March 1914</ref>\n\n==A New Beginning==\nAll aforementioned ships of Inland Lines Ltd. were taken over by the R And O Navigation Co. and absorbed into the new Canada Steamship Lines in 1913. \nIn 1914, Playfair and Company, incorporated the Great Lakes Transportation Company Ltd., to carry on a general navigation business.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, May 1914</ref>  Two of the first ships operated by this firm were the GLENMAVIS and the GLENFOYLE reported to have been built for Playfair interests at [[Derry|Londonderry]], Ireland,<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, September and October 1913</ref> Both were owned by James Richardson and Sons, of Kingston Ont. and later operated by Great Lakes Transportation Co. along with the CALGARY built at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1912.<ref>Maritime History of the Great Lakes website</ref> Playfair soon began to rebuild his own fleet of steamships, from the Pittsburgh Steamship Co. he purchased the WAWATAM, renamed GLENLIVET and from the Chicago and Duluth Transportation Co., came the MINNEKAHTA and MINNETONKA, renamed GLENLYON and GLENFINNAN. The motor vessel TOILER was also acquired, but soon resold.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, April 1914</ref> \n\nThe Glen Transportation Co. Ltd. was incorporated in 1920, the purpose of the company was to own and operate canal sized ships on the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence River and coastal waters. The first three ships of this company were the GLENCADAM and the GLENCLOVA, formerly operated by the Great Lakes Transportation Co. and the 259 foot GLENAFTON built at the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. in 1921.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, May 1921</ref> In 1922 Playfair and his associates bought six ships from the French government. All of which had been requisitioned for service overseas during the Great War and all had been built in 1903 at American cities on the Great Lakes and were originally owned owned by the Great Lakes And St. Lawrence Transportation Co. of Chicago. The George C. Howe and John Crerar, built at Chicago, became the GLENEALY and the GLENARNOCH. The H. G. Dalton, built at Superior, Wis., became the GLENDOCHART, J. S. Keefe and Robert Wallace, built at Buffalo, became the GLENFARN and the GLENDOWAN, and the S. N. Parent, built in Detroit, became the GLENARM.<ref>Canadian Railway and Marine World magazine, March 1922</ref> \n\nIn 1926 the 633\u2019 foot GLENMOHR, launched at Midland, was the largest bulk carrier on the Great Lakes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.woodyboater.com/blog/2015/05/26/argosy-on-the-rocks/ | title=Argosy On the Rocks | accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Other Business interests==\nPlayfair was involved in numerous other activities, among them: \nMidland Towing And Wrecking Co.

ANDREW, and placed in the grain trade between  [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] and [[Goderich, Ontario|Goderich]].<ref>The Midland Navigation Company Limited A Short Corporate History and Vessel Listing, Scanner, v. 11, n. 5, February 1979</ref> The tug, METAMORA and barge ST.

The Steel bulk carrier MIDLAND QUEEN was built in 1901 at Dundee, Scotland. A second vessel, the MIDLAND KING, was a steel bulk carrier built 1903 at Collingwood by Collingwood Shipbuilding Co. Ltd. The steel bulk carrier MIDLAND PRINCE, was built 1906-07 by Collingwood Shipbuilding Co. EMPRESS OF MIDLAND built in 1907 and the EMPRESS OF FORT WILLIAM built 1908, were steel bulk carriers, both built at Wallsend-on-Tyne by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson Ltd. the latter two vessels built for the Midland Navigation Co., but soon became part of the Empress Navigation Co. of Midland.<ref>Scanner, v. 11, n. 5, February 1979</ref>\n\nIn March, 1910, Playfair and Company gained control of the Inland Navigation Company Ltd. from the Mackay brothers, of Hamilton.<ref>Ship of the Month No. 96 WAHCONDAH, Scanner, v. 13, n. 2 November 1980.</ref> A plan was devised to merge the company with the Midland Navigation Co. and the Empress Navigation Co. The ships of the Hamilton firm were: NEEPAWAH, WAHCONDAH, ROSEDALE, GLENELLAH, DUNDEE, DUNELM, WINONA, STRATHCONA, DONNACONA, DUNDURN and STADACONA. The new company was incorporated as Inland Lines Ltd.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, June 1910</ref> \n\nIn mid-January 1911, James Playfair made a bid to purchase the Northern Navigation Co. on behalf of himself and his associates. The offer to purchase the company was subject to approval by the Grand Trunk Railway, concerning a previous arrangement that its president C. M. Hays had made with the company for the construction of a new steamship of the HAMONIC type. The conditions were met and James Playfair became the new president of Northern Navigation Co.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, March 1911</ref> While a merger between the Northern Navigation Co. and Inland Lines Ltd. had been discussed, it was thought that a holding company to control them, was more probable. At that time, there was talk of an even larger merger between the Northern Navigation Co. and the Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, April 1911.</ref> In 1911 the  Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. were allowed to increase their capital stock. At a special meeting of shareholders held on June 26, it was decided to increase the stock from $ 5,000,0000 to $ 10,000,000, with the distribution of new shares to be issued by the directors. The shares of the Northern Navigation Co. Ltd. and of the Inland Lines Ltd. were purchased and paid for with fully paid up stock of the R. And O Navigation Co. Five additional directors were added to the reorganized Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. James Playfair became the vice president and managing director.<ref>The Railway And Marine World magazine, July 1911</ref>\n\nOn June 2, 1913, James Playfair was on his way to [[Thunder Bay, Ontario|Port Arthur]], for the launching of the [[SS Noronic|NORONIC]]. He was a passenger on the [[Hamonic (steamship)|HAMONIC]] somewhere on Lake Superior, when the [[wireless]] operator received word that James' father, had passed away in [[Toronto]]. 87 year old John S. Playfair, came to Canada as an employee of dry goods merchant [[John McMurrich]]. For some time John Playfair had managed the firm's Kingston store and may have been involved with shipping on Lake Ontario. He first became involved with [[Alexander Peter Cockburn|A. P. Cockburn]]'s Muskoka Lakes Navigation Co. in 1879 and served as president of that line for more than 25 years. James Playfair transferred to one of the R And O Nav. Co. freighters mid-lake, about 80 miles from [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] and made his way to Toronto by special train.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, July 1913</ref> <ref>Dictionary of Canadian Biography/McMURRICH, JOHN</ref>\n\nA special meeting of the shareholders of Richelieu And Ontario Navigation Co. was held in the company's office in Montreal, on June 19, to ratify an agreement of sale of the company's assets to a new company formed for that purpose. The new company was to be called Canada Transportation Lines Limited.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, July July 1913</ref> In the early part of December it was announced that Canada Transportation Lines would be renamed [[Canada Steamship Lines|Canada Steamship Lines Limited]].<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, December 1913</ref> With the acquisition of Inland Lines Ltd. by Canada Transportation Lines, Playfair relinquished personal control of his ships, although he was still a director of the company. James Playfair retired as managing director early in 1914. At Toronto, Playfair was presented with a solid silver center table piece and rose bowl with the following inscription: \"Presented to James Playfair by the officials, staff, captains and engineers of the Inland Lines, Ltd., and Northern Navigation Co., Ltd., as a token of the high esteem in which he is held by one and all.\" An old English chime clock was also presented to Mrs. Playfair.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, March 1914</ref>\n\n==A New Beginning==\nAll aforementioned ships of Inland Lines Ltd. were taken over by the R And O Navigation Co. and absorbed into the new Canada Steamship Lines in 1913. \nIn 1914, Playfair and Company, incorporated the Great Lakes Transportation Company Ltd., to carry on a general navigation business.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, May 1914</ref>  Two of the first ships operated by this firm were the GLENMAVIS and the GLENFOYLE reported to have been built for Playfair interests at [[Derry|Londonderry]], Ireland,<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, September and October 1913</ref> Both were owned by James Richardson and Sons, of Kingston Ont. and later operated by Great Lakes Transportation Co. along with the CALGARY built at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]] in 1912.<ref>Maritime History of the Great Lakes website</ref> Playfair soon began to rebuild his own fleet of steamships, from the Pittsburgh Steamship Co. he purchased the WAWATAM, renamed GLENLIVET and from the Chicago and Duluth Transportation Co., came the MINNEKAHTA and MINNETONKA, renamed GLENLYON and GLENFINNAN. The motor vessel TOILER was also acquired, but soon resold.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, April 1914</ref> \n\nThe Glen Transportation Co. Ltd. was incorporated in 1920, the purpose of the company was to own and operate canal sized ships on the Great Lakes, St. Lawrence River and coastal waters. The first three ships of this company were the GLENCADAM and the GLENCLOVA, formerly operated by the Great Lakes Transportation Co. and the 259 foot GLENAFTON built at the Port Arthur Shipbuilding Co. in 1921.<ref>Canadian Railway And Marine World magazine, May 1921</ref> In 1922 Playfair and his associates bought six ships from the French government. All of which had been requisitioned for service overseas during the Great War and all had been built in 1903 at American cities on the Great Lakes and were originally owned owned by the Great Lakes And St. Lawrence Transportation Co. of Chicago. The George C. Howe and John Crerar, built at Chicago, became the GLENEALY and the GLENARNOCH. The H. G. Dalton, built at Superior, Wis., became the GLENDOCHART, J. S. Keefe and Robert Wallace, built at Buffalo, became the GLENFARN and the GLENDOWAN, and the S. N. Parent, built in Detroit, became the GLENARM.<ref>Canadian Railway and Marine World magazine, March 1922</ref> \n\nIn 1926 the 633\u2019 foot GLENMOHR, launched at Midland, was the largest bulk carrier on the Great Lakes.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.woodyboater.com/blog/2015/05/26/argosy-on-the-rocks/ | title=Argosy On the Rocks | accessdate=17 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Other Business interests==\nPlayfair was involved in numerous other activities, among them: \nMidland Towing And Wrecking Co.

R. Panthulu]]. It features [[Sivaji Ganesan]] leading an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[N. T. Rama Rao]], [[S. A. Ashokan]], [[R. Muthuraman]], [[Devika]], [[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]] and [[M. V. Rajamma]]. The film is based on the story of [[Karna]], a character from the [[Indian epic poetry|Hindu epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n\n''Karnan'', which was officially launched in 1963, was shot in palaces at [[Jaipur]] and the war sequences were filmed in [[Kurukshetra]], which featured several soldiers from the [[Indian Army]]. The film's original soundtrack was composed by the duo [[Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy]], while the lyrics were written by [[Kannadasan]]. The screenplay was written by A. S. Nagarajan and the dialogues by [[Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy]].\n\n''Karnan'' was released on 14 January 1964, during the festival occasion of [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]]. The film ran for over 100 days in theatres, and later won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film]] at the [[11th National Film Awards]]. It was considered a milestone in Tamil cinema as it brought together the then leading actors of [[Cinema of South India|South Indian cinema]], Ganesan and Rama Rao. The film was also partly responsible for a resurgence in Hindu purana films in the industry. A digitised version of ''Karnan'' was released in March 2012 to critical and commercial success.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Find more plot details in these sites: https://jstlikethat.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/karnan/ and http://madhulikaliddle.com/2015/09/05/karnan-1964/-->\nThe unmarried princess [[Kunti]] is seen taking away a small coffin with a baby boy; she earlier got a boon from [[Durvasa]] for her pious service to him. Kunti could invoke a [[mantra]] and be blessed with a child from any male god of her choice. When she tested it playfully, she was blessed by [[Surya|the Sun]] with the baby, which she abandons in the [[Ganges]] to avoid embarrassment. The baby is rescued and adopted by royal charioteer [[Adhiratha]]n, and later named [[Karna]]n.\n\nYears later, Karnan feels heartbroken upon realising that Adhirathan is only his adoptive father. Not wanting to become a charioteer like him, he instead chooses to become a warrior, travels to another kingdom and trains there. Four years later, having mastered archery, Karnan returns home. At the same time, the royal exhibition is held to portray the valour of royal princes, who have just completed education from [[Drona]]chariar. Once there, Karnan challenges the [[Pandava]] prince [[Arjuna]]n in an archery contest, as everyone there hails Arjuna as the best archer ever. Karnan is insulted and refused a chance because of his lowly birth, but the [[Kaurava]] crown prince and cousin of the Pandavas, [[Duryodhana]]n, saves his pride, and crowns Karnan as the king of [[Anga]]. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhanan and his wife [[Bhanumati (Mahabharata)|Bhanumati]].\n\nOne day, [[Indra]]n, disguised as a [[Brahmin]], approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear ornaments as alms to weaken and prevent him from overpowering Arjuna. Although aware of Indra's intention, Karnan still gives both of the articles that he was born with and which made him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, the ''Nagastra''. Disguised as a Brahmin, Karnan becomes the student of [[Parashurama]]r to acquire the ''[[Brahmastra]]''; Parashuramar eventually realises that Karnan is a [[Kshatriya]], a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the ''Brahmastra'' when most needed, and banishes him.\n\nKarnan later saves princess Subhangi from an uncontrolled chariot; they fall in love and eventually marry. A few years later, [[Krishna]]n, a supporter of the Pandavas, learns about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first-born son. Karnan also learns about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack any of her sons (the Pandavas) except Arjunan during the impending [[Kurukshetra War]], and that he will attack Arjunan with the ''Nagastra'' only once. Karnan refuses to join the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhanan.\n\nBefore the war begins, Duryodhanan's ministers assemble to appoint the commanders of the army divisions. [[Bhishma]]r is appointed the Commander and he starts nominating generals for different battalions. Karnan is insulted because of his lowly birth and given the command of a low rank infantry. The war begins and in the early days, Bhishma retires and Karnan replaces him. The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son [[Vrishasena]]n who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjunan.\n\nThe next day, Karnan tries to kill Arjunan with the ''Nagastra'', but Krishnan prevents the weapon from hurting him. Since Karnan cannot use the ''Nagastra'' more than once, he is unable to kill Arjunan. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a hole, and he steps down to relieve it. Under Krishnan's direction, Arjunan shoots multiple arrows at Karnan that severely wound him, but Karnan still stays alive. Krishnan tells a shocked Arjunan that the ''[[Dharma]]'' that Karnan performed during his lifetime was protecting his life. Krishnan disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Karnan generously donates all his virtues to the \"Brahmin\". Arjunan then shoots a few more arrows at Karnan that kill him.\n\nThe Pandavas, who realise that Karnan was their eldest brother, mourn his death. Kunti does the same, while Subhangi dies, traumatised by her husband's death. Arjunan remorses killing Karnan, until Krishnan reveals that the curses by Indran and Parashuramar were also responsible for his death. The film ends with Karnan meeting his father {{mdash}} the Sun {{mdash}} in the [[afterlife]].\n\n== Cast ==\n''Cast according to the opening credits of the film''<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=Karnan |last=Panthulu, B.

R. Panthulu]]. It features [[Sivaji Ganesan]] leading an [[ensemble cast]] consisting of [[N. T. Rama Rao]], [[S. A. Ashokan]], [[R. Muthuraman]], [[Devika]], [[Savitri (actress)|Savitri]] and [[M. V. Rajamma]]. The film is based on the story of [[Karna]], a character from the [[Indian epic poetry|Hindu epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]''.\n\n''Karnan'', which was officially launched in 1963, was shot in palaces at [[Jaipur]] and the war sequences were filmed in [[Kurukshetra]], which featured several soldiers from the [[Indian Army]]. The film's original soundtrack was composed by the duo [[Viswanathan\u2013Ramamoorthy]], while the lyrics were written by [[Kannadasan]]. The screenplay was written by A. S. Nagarajan and the dialogues by [[Sakthi T. K. Krishnasamy]].\n\n''Karnan'' was released on 14 January 1964, during the festival occasion of [[Pongal (festival)|Pongal]]. The film ran for over 100 days in theatres, and later won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil|Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film]] at the [[11th National Film Awards]]. It was considered a milestone in Tamil cinema as it brought together the then leading actors of [[Cinema of South India|South Indian cinema]], Ganesan and Rama Rao. The film was also partly responsible for a resurgence in Hindu purana films in the industry. A digitised version of ''Karnan'' was released in March 2012 to critical and commercial success.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--Find more plot details in these sites: https://jstlikethat.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/karnan/ and http://madhulikaliddle.com/2015/09/05/karnan-1964/-->\nThe unmarried princess [[Kunti]] is seen taking away a small coffin with a baby boy; she earlier got a boon from [[Durvasa]] for her pious service to him. Kunti could invoke a [[mantra]] and be blessed with a child from any male god of her choice. When she tested it playfully, she was blessed by [[Surya|the Sun]] with the baby, which she abandons in the [[Ganges]] to avoid embarrassment. The baby is rescued and adopted by royal charioteer [[Adhiratha]]n, and later named [[Karna]]n.\n\nYears later, Karnan feels heartbroken upon realising that Adhirathan is only his adoptive father. Not wanting to become a charioteer like him, he instead chooses to become a warrior, travels to another kingdom and trains there. Four years later, having mastered archery, Karnan returns home. At the same time, the royal exhibition is held to portray the valour of royal princes, who have just completed education from [[Drona]]chariar. Once there, Karnan challenges the [[Pandava]] prince [[Arjuna]]n in an archery contest, as everyone there hails Arjuna as the best archer ever. Karnan is insulted and refused a chance because of his lowly birth, but the [[Kaurava]] crown prince and cousin of the Pandavas, [[Duryodhana]]n, saves his pride, and crowns Karnan as the king of [[Anga]]. Karnan thus becomes the close friend of Duryodhanan and his wife [[Bhanumati (Mahabharata)|Bhanumati]].\n\nOne day, [[Indra]]n, disguised as a [[Brahmin]], approaches Karnan and asks for his armour and ear ornaments as alms to weaken and prevent him from overpowering Arjuna. Although aware of Indra's intention, Karnan still gives both of the articles that he was born with and which made him invincible. Pleased with Karnan's generosity, Indra gives him a powerful weapon, the ''Nagastra''. Disguised as a Brahmin, Karnan becomes the student of [[Parashurama]]r to acquire the ''[[Brahmastra]]''; Parashuramar eventually realises that Karnan is a [[Kshatriya]], a tribe he opposes. Enraged, he renders Karnan incapable of using the ''Brahmastra'' when most needed, and banishes him.\n\nKarnan later saves princess Subhangi from an uncontrolled chariot; they fall in love and eventually marry. A few years later, [[Krishna]]n, a supporter of the Pandavas, learns about Karnan's true background. He tells Kunti that Karnan is her first-born son. Karnan also learns about his birth later. Kunti meets Karnan and gets two wishes from him, one that he will not attack any of her sons (the Pandavas) except Arjunan during the impending [[Kurukshetra War]], and that he will attack Arjunan with the ''Nagastra'' only once. Karnan refuses to join the Pandavas and remains the friend of their enemy Duryodhanan.\n\nBefore the war begins, Duryodhanan's ministers assemble to appoint the commanders of the army divisions. [[Bhishma]]r is appointed the Commander and he starts nominating generals for different battalions. Karnan is insulted because of his lowly birth and given the command of a low rank infantry. The war begins and in the early days, Bhishma retires and Karnan replaces him. The following day, Karnan goes to war accompanied by his son [[Vrishasena]]n who fights bravely, but is killed by Arjunan.\n\nThe next day, Karnan tries to kill Arjunan with the ''Nagastra'', but Krishnan prevents the weapon from hurting him. Since Karnan cannot use the ''Nagastra'' more than once, he is unable to kill Arjunan. A wheel of his chariot gets stuck in a hole, and he steps down to relieve it. Under Krishnan's direction, Arjunan shoots multiple arrows at Karnan that severely wound him, but Karnan still stays alive. Krishnan tells a shocked Arjunan that the ''[[Dharma]]'' that Karnan performed during his lifetime was protecting his life. Krishnan disguises as a Brahmin, goes to Karnan and asks him his virtues as donation. Karnan generously donates all his virtues to the \"Brahmin\". Arjunan then shoots a few more arrows at Karnan that kill him.\n\nThe Pandavas, who realise that Karnan was their eldest brother, mourn his death. Kunti does the same, while Subhangi dies, traumatised by her husband's death. Arjunan remorses killing Karnan, until Krishnan reveals that the curses by Indran and Parashuramar were also responsible for his death. The film ends with Karnan meeting his father {{mdash}} the Sun {{mdash}} in the [[afterlife]].\n\n== Cast ==\n''Cast according to the opening credits of the film''<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=Karnan |last=Panthulu, B.

She was also a writer and, beginning in 1987, was an associate editor for the magazine ''[[Art Papers]]'' in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref>Perry, Pam (1987), \"The ear and the eye meet in the work of Mildred Thompson\", ''Creative Loafing'', Section 6B, October 3, 1987.</ref> Critics have related her art to [[West Africa]]n textiles and [[Islamic architecture]];<ref>Jennings, C.

Her formal art training began in 1953 when she entered [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] There she found a mentor in [[James A. Porter]] (1905\u20131970), who was head of the school's art department. He arranged for Thompson to receive a scholarship at the end of her junior year for summer study at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] in [[Maine]]. After Thompson received the Bachelor of Arts from Howard, Porter assisted her in entering the Brooklyn Museum of Art School on a [[Max Beckmann]] Scholarship. She began to exhibit, and her work was accepted for the ''Art U.S.A. \u201958'' exhibition in [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref>Thompson, M. (1977), \"Mildred Thompson, Sculptor: Experiences of a Black Artist in Europe and the United States\", p. 20, James A. Porter Gallery of Art, Howard University, Washington, DC.</ref>\n\nDuring that time Thompson applied and was turned down for a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]. Feeling herself ready for study in Europe, Thompson decided to go there on her own. She worked to save money during the rest of the school year and, through the auspices of [[Samella Lewis]] (1924\u2013), got a summer job teaching ceramics at [[Florida A&M University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]. In this way she earned enough for steamship passage to Europe.<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 24.</ref>\n\n== Study in Europe ==\nHer trip to [[Germany]] was attended by good fortune. She had decided to study at the Art Academy of [[Hamburg]] ([[Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg]]) even though, at the time she arrived, she had not yet applied or been accepted there. Nor did she have any plans as to where she would live. A few private lessons were all she had to prepare herself for the German language. Nevertheless, armed with pluck, a strong portfolio and the help of some brand-new German friends, she found a room and was immediately accepted into the Academy. There her painting teachers were Walter Arno (1930\u2013) and [[Emil Schumacher]] (1912\u20131999). She learned [[etching]], [[lithography]] and other [[printmaking]] media from Willem Grimm (1904\u20131986) and [[Paul Wunderlich]] (1927\u20132010). She also met at this time the printmaker [[Horst Janssen]] (1929\u20131995), who introduced her to Galerie Sander in Hamburg, where Thompson had her first solo exhibition. At the end of her first year she received a scholarship, the Reemtsma Stipendium, that paid for her living and school expenses.<ref>Thompson (1977) pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n== An American expatriate ==\nAfter three years at the Academy, Thompson was ready to begin her professional career in the United States. In early 1961 she returned to [[New York City]]. The social and artistic acceptance Thompson had enjoyed in Germany, however, was not to be found even in that most cosmopolitan of American cities. She soon realized that because she was a black woman, she was refused the shows and gallery representation that she felt her work deserved. In an autobiographical essay, Thompson recounted that \"One woman dealer... said that it would be impossible for me to have a show in New York as an artist. [Another gallery owner said] ...that it would be better if I had a white friend to take my work around, someone to pass as Mildred Thompson.\"<ref name=\"Thompson 1977 page 28\">Thompson (1977), p. 28.</ref> She did, however, gain an audience with William Lieberman<ref>The son of German Expressionist artist Max Liebermann, William Lieberman (1923\u20132005) was an influential curator at the Museum of Modern Art from 1945 to 1979 and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1979 to 2004.</ref> at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; two of her prints were purchased for the collection on his recommendation.<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 28. One of the prints, \"Love for Sale\" (1959), was reproduced in the book ''Fille de Joie'', Grove Press, 1967.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1961 and again in 1962 Thompson received fellowships to the [[MacDowell Colony]] in [[New Hampshire]], where she worked on drawings and paintings. In 1963 she returned to Germany to live, partly because she could find no sales outlet for her work, and partly because of growing racial tension in the United States.<ref name=\"Thompson 1977 page 28\"/> She was not alone. Other young black artists who chose to leave the U.S. during the 1950s and 1960s include [[Harvey Cropper]], [[Herbert Gentry]], Arthur Hardie, Clifford Jackson, Sam Middleton, Earl Miller, Norman Morgan, Larry Potter and Walter Williams. In the words of artist [[David C. Driskell]], \"They chose a form of cultural exile over expatriation, hoping for a better day to come about in the land of their birth.\"<ref>Driskell, David C. (1978), \"Bibliographies in Afro-American Art\", ''American Art Quarterly'', Vol. 30, No. 3, 1978, p. 385.</ref> All settled in Europe. Thompson established herself in the [[Rhineland]] town of [[D\u00fcren]] and once again began exhibiting and selling her work there and in the German cities of Bensberg, [[Aachen]], and [[Cologne]].\n\nThompson's work in the 1960s was figurative, but in the early 1970s she moved toward total abstraction. In Europe her works reflected the formal ideas of art for art's sake, and did not respond to the politicized art of the Black and Women's movements in the United States. According to writer [[Alexis De Veaux]], \"Thompson thought of herself as an expatriate and did not separate her identity as black from her identity as American...\" although she eventually disavowed \"...any claim to being American.\"<ref>De Veaux, Alexis (2006), ''Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde'', W.W. Norton & Co., p. 175. {{ISBN|0-393-01954-3}}</ref> Years later Thompson defended herself against the charge that because of her years spent in Europe, she was not a \"Black\" artist. In a 1987 essay for ''[[SAGE (journal)|SAGE]]'' magazine she wrote: <blockquote> \"On certain levels, perhaps we [black Americans] might be able to identify with certain parts of certain African cultures. To copy symbols that one does not understand, to deliberately make use of a form that one does not know how to analyze or appreciate was for me the height of prostitution. I had spent long years trying to find out who I am and what my influences were and where they came from. It was perhaps because I had lived and studied with \"whitey\" that I had learned to appreciate my Blackness as well as how American I truly am. My experiences throughout Africa had made my knowledge of being an American more than clear. There are recordings in our genes that remember Africa. If they are strong enough and we are free of false denials, they will surface and appear without deliberation no matter what we do.\"<ref>Thompson, Mildred, \"Memoirs of an Artist\", ''SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women'', Vol. IV, No.1 (Spring 1987), pp. 42\u201343.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nAfter ten years in Germany (during which she traveled to southern Europe and Africa) Thompson returned to the U.S. in 1975. She found that the social climate had changed somewhat for the better, and she was able to overcome many of the obstacles she encountered. She lived at first in [[Florida]], where she was named Artist-in-Residence of the City of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 31.</ref> In 1977 she moved to Washington, D.C., where she was Artist-in-Residence at Howard University for the 1977\u201378 academic year. She returned to Europe in 1981, this time to [[Paris]], where she opened a studio in the Rue de Parme. Thompson moved to Atlanta in 1986, which was \"home base\" for the remainder of her life. There she taught art and art history in several area colleges, including the [[Atlanta College of Art]].<ref>Irlbeck, A. (2001), [http://lubbockonline.com/stories/011701/upd_warhol.shtml \"Artist, teacher, musician to speak on Warhol exhibit\"], Lubbock Online.com, Wednesday, January 17, 2001. Accessed May 23, 2008.</ref> A talented writer and interviewer, she joined the staff of the periodical ''Art Papers'' in 1987.\n\n== Influences in Thompson\u2019s mature work ==\nIn 1987 Thompson's show ''In and Out of Germany'', at the [[Goethe Institute]] in Atlanta, contained 42 artworks executed in Germany, France and the United States. The Atlanta newsweekly ''[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)|Creative Loafing]]'' mentioned that Thompson's most recent series of colored pencil drawings, \"Objective Music\", were based on her correlation of art with music. It also made reference to her sense of color and rhythmic line-making as \"[[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]-influenced.\"<ref>Perry, 1987.</ref> A contemporary review of the exhibition in ''Art Papers'' also mentioned Kandinsky as an influence for Thompson, as well as the artist's interest in the fiction of [[Hermann Hesse]] and the [[Jung]]ian concept of the [[collective unconscious]]. But Thompson's feeling for music seemed to have the strongest effect on the work in the exhibition. The reviewer, Leslie Schworm, wrote that Thompson's \"\u2026approach is to draw music or sound. She believes that patterns in music are among the purest natural recurrences, providing direct access to something basic.\"<ref>.Schworm, L. (1988), \"Mildred Thompson, Goethe Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, September 11\u2013October 17\", p. 59, ''Art Papers'', January/February 1988.</ref>\n\nIn the following year the visual description of music was still on Thompson's mind. A solo exhibition titled ''Concatenation'' at [[Agnes Scott College]] contained the wooden sculpture ''Mass'', whose six parts were named \"Kyrie\", \"Gloria\", \"Credo\", \"Sanctus\", \"Benedictus\", and \"Gloria Dei\".<ref>Gay-Griffin, L. (1989), \"Exhibit explores depth of spirit\", p. 16D, ''Daily News'', Lawrenceville, Georgia, Saturday, November 25, 1989.</ref> But other influences, including [[astronomy]], [[spiritualism]] and [[metaphysics]] were starting to appear in her work.  Included in ''Concatenations'' was a series of prints titled ''Five Mysteries''. Their abstract compositions, printed in black ink on white paper, were schematic representations of earth, atmosphere and sun, the latter a flat disc set in a sky filled with energetic marks and scratches. Thompson's series of watercolors, titled ''Lemurian Wanderings'', were described by critic Lorena Gay-Griffin as \u201c\u2026the time at the dawn of the world before the first ray of sun shone through the atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\">Gay-Griffin (1989).</ref> A series of colored pencil drawings, ''The Phases of Cynthia'', was reported by the same writer to refer to [[Galileo]]\u2019s study of the phases of the moon. The drawings featured \"...the same sun/moon image as the prints. The circles are layered with other geometric shapes and surrounded by fragments and rays emitting from the center.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\"/> In 1990 Thompson told ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine: \"My work has to do with the cosmos and how it affects us.\"<ref>''Essence'' (1990).</ref> Such references continued in her printmaking. In 1993, as an artist-in-residence at Littleton Studios in [[North Carolina]], Thompson created prints in [[vitreography]] titled ''Helio Centric'', ''Particles'' and ''Wave Function''.\n\nA 1992 group exhibition entitled ''A/Cross Currents: Synthesis in African American Abstract Painting'' featured a catalog that cited the jazz of [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] and the German baroque of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] as influences on Thomspon's art. The catalog's essayist, Corrine Jennings, wrote: \"The idea that man and certain animals can hear the sounds of eleven or twelve octaves, but can only see one octave of seven colors, has led to [Thompson\u2019s] interest in exploring the unseen and making it visible.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\">Jennings (1992).</ref> The ''Magnetic Fields'' series of paintings that Thompson exhibited in the show, Jennings wrote, \"\u2026appear to visualize the force of unseen energy. They are intensely painted, tersely defined geometric structures with a direct physical application loosened by\u2026improvisation.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\"/>\n\n== Teaching ==\nThompson had a long and varied teaching career. From 1961 to 1964, when she was trying to make her way as an artist in New York City, she taught elementary school as an employee of the New York Board of Education. In [[D\u00fcren]], Germany, she taught art and art history at the Eschweiler Volchoch Schule from 1965 to 1974. On being named Artist-in Residence for the City of Tampa<ref>The residency was awarded by the Florida State Arts Council with funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].</ref> Thompson taught classes and workshops in painting, drawing, sculpture, and mural painting to adults and children at the Tampa Bay Art Center and other local venues. She also had an \"open door\" policy at her studio on 7th Avenue in [[Ybor City, Tampa|Ybor City]]. There, she wrote: \"...anyone who wanted to come in and see could walk in. I felt it somehow served the community.\"<ref>Thompson, M. (1987), \"Memoirs of an Artist, p. 42, ''SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women'', 10/1:42.</ref> As an Artist-in-Residence at Howard University she taught etching. When she lived in Paris, Thompson gave private lessons at her studio at 4 Rue de Parme from 1981 until her return to the States in 1985. From 1986 to 1989 she taught studio classes, art history and art theory at [[Agnes Scott College]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]], and in Atlanta she taught at [[Morehouse College]] and [[Spelman College]].

She was also a writer and, beginning in 1987, was an associate editor for the magazine ''[[Art Papers]]'' in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref>Perry, Pam (1987), \"The ear and the eye meet in the work of Mildred Thompson\", ''Creative Loafing'', Section 6B, October 3, 1987.</ref> Critics have related her art to [[West Africa]]n textiles and [[Islamic architecture]];<ref>Jennings, C.

Her formal art training began in 1953 when she entered [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] There she found a mentor in [[James A. Porter]] (1905\u20131970), who was head of the school's art department. He arranged for Thompson to receive a scholarship at the end of her junior year for summer study at the [[Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture]] in [[Maine]]. After Thompson received the Bachelor of Arts from Howard, Porter assisted her in entering the Brooklyn Museum of Art School on a [[Max Beckmann]] Scholarship. She began to exhibit, and her work was accepted for the ''Art U.S.A. \u201958'' exhibition in [[Madison Square Garden]].<ref>Thompson, M. (1977), \"Mildred Thompson, Sculptor: Experiences of a Black Artist in Europe and the United States\", p. 20, James A. Porter Gallery of Art, Howard University, Washington, DC.</ref>\n\nDuring that time Thompson applied and was turned down for a [[Fulbright Scholarship]]. Feeling herself ready for study in Europe, Thompson decided to go there on her own. She worked to save money during the rest of the school year and, through the auspices of [[Samella Lewis]] (1924\u2013), got a summer job teaching ceramics at [[Florida A&M University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]]. In this way she earned enough for steamship passage to Europe.<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 24.</ref>\n\n== Study in Europe ==\nHer trip to [[Germany]] was attended by good fortune. She had decided to study at the Art Academy of [[Hamburg]] ([[Hochschule f\u00fcr bildende K\u00fcnste Hamburg]]) even though, at the time she arrived, she had not yet applied or been accepted there. Nor did she have any plans as to where she would live. A few private lessons were all she had to prepare herself for the German language. Nevertheless, armed with pluck, a strong portfolio and the help of some brand-new German friends, she found a room and was immediately accepted into the Academy. There her painting teachers were Walter Arno (1930\u2013) and [[Emil Schumacher]] (1912\u20131999). She learned [[etching]], [[lithography]] and other [[printmaking]] media from Willem Grimm (1904\u20131986) and [[Paul Wunderlich]] (1927\u20132010). She also met at this time the printmaker [[Horst Janssen]] (1929\u20131995), who introduced her to Galerie Sander in Hamburg, where Thompson had her first solo exhibition. At the end of her first year she received a scholarship, the Reemtsma Stipendium, that paid for her living and school expenses.<ref>Thompson (1977) pp. 24\u201325.</ref>\n\n== An American expatriate ==\nAfter three years at the Academy, Thompson was ready to begin her professional career in the United States. In early 1961 she returned to [[New York City]]. The social and artistic acceptance Thompson had enjoyed in Germany, however, was not to be found even in that most cosmopolitan of American cities. She soon realized that because she was a black woman, she was refused the shows and gallery representation that she felt her work deserved. In an autobiographical essay, Thompson recounted that \"One woman dealer... said that it would be impossible for me to have a show in New York as an artist. [Another gallery owner said] ...that it would be better if I had a white friend to take my work around, someone to pass as Mildred Thompson.\"<ref name=\"Thompson 1977 page 28\">Thompson (1977), p. 28.</ref> She did, however, gain an audience with William Lieberman<ref>The son of German Expressionist artist Max Liebermann, William Lieberman (1923\u20132005) was an influential curator at the Museum of Modern Art from 1945 to 1979 and at the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1979 to 2004.</ref> at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]; two of her prints were purchased for the collection on his recommendation.<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 28. One of the prints, \"Love for Sale\" (1959), was reproduced in the book ''Fille de Joie'', Grove Press, 1967.</ref>\n\nIn the fall of 1961 and again in 1962 Thompson received fellowships to the [[MacDowell Colony]] in [[New Hampshire]], where she worked on drawings and paintings. In 1963 she returned to Germany to live, partly because she could find no sales outlet for her work, and partly because of growing racial tension in the United States.<ref name=\"Thompson 1977 page 28\"/> She was not alone. Other young black artists who chose to leave the U.S. during the 1950s and 1960s include [[Harvey Cropper]], [[Herbert Gentry]], Arthur Hardie, Clifford Jackson, Sam Middleton, Earl Miller, Norman Morgan, Larry Potter and Walter Williams. In the words of artist [[David C. Driskell]], \"They chose a form of cultural exile over expatriation, hoping for a better day to come about in the land of their birth.\"<ref>Driskell, David C. (1978), \"Bibliographies in Afro-American Art\", ''American Art Quarterly'', Vol. 30, No. 3, 1978, p. 385.</ref> All settled in Europe. Thompson established herself in the [[Rhineland]] town of [[D\u00fcren]] and once again began exhibiting and selling her work there and in the German cities of Bensberg, [[Aachen]], and [[Cologne]].\n\nThompson's work in the 1960s was figurative, but in the early 1970s she moved toward total abstraction. In Europe her works reflected the formal ideas of art for art's sake, and did not respond to the politicized art of the Black and Women's movements in the United States. According to writer [[Alexis De Veaux]], \"Thompson thought of herself as an expatriate and did not separate her identity as black from her identity as American...\" although she eventually disavowed \"...any claim to being American.\"<ref>De Veaux, Alexis (2006), ''Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde'', W.W. Norton & Co., p. 175. {{ISBN|0-393-01954-3}}</ref> Years later Thompson defended herself against the charge that because of her years spent in Europe, she was not a \"Black\" artist. In a 1987 essay for ''[[SAGE (journal)|SAGE]]'' magazine she wrote: <blockquote> \"On certain levels, perhaps we [black Americans] might be able to identify with certain parts of certain African cultures. To copy symbols that one does not understand, to deliberately make use of a form that one does not know how to analyze or appreciate was for me the height of prostitution. I had spent long years trying to find out who I am and what my influences were and where they came from. It was perhaps because I had lived and studied with \"whitey\" that I had learned to appreciate my Blackness as well as how American I truly am. My experiences throughout Africa had made my knowledge of being an American more than clear. There are recordings in our genes that remember Africa. If they are strong enough and we are free of false denials, they will surface and appear without deliberation no matter what we do.\"<ref>Thompson, Mildred, \"Memoirs of an Artist\", ''SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women'', Vol. IV, No.1 (Spring 1987), pp. 42\u201343.</ref> </blockquote>\n\nAfter ten years in Germany (during which she traveled to southern Europe and Africa) Thompson returned to the U.S. in 1975. She found that the social climate had changed somewhat for the better, and she was able to overcome many of the obstacles she encountered. She lived at first in [[Florida]], where she was named Artist-in-Residence of the City of [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]].<ref>Thompson (1977), p. 31.</ref> In 1977 she moved to Washington, D.C., where she was Artist-in-Residence at Howard University for the 1977\u201378 academic year. She returned to Europe in 1981, this time to [[Paris]], where she opened a studio in the Rue de Parme. Thompson moved to Atlanta in 1986, which was \"home base\" for the remainder of her life. There she taught art and art history in several area colleges, including the [[Atlanta College of Art]].<ref>Irlbeck, A. (2001), [http://lubbockonline.com/stories/011701/upd_warhol.shtml \"Artist, teacher, musician to speak on Warhol exhibit\"], Lubbock Online.com, Wednesday, January 17, 2001. Accessed May 23, 2008.</ref> A talented writer and interviewer, she joined the staff of the periodical ''Art Papers'' in 1987.\n\n== Influences in Thompson\u2019s mature work ==\nIn 1987 Thompson's show ''In and Out of Germany'', at the [[Goethe Institute]] in Atlanta, contained 42 artworks executed in Germany, France and the United States. The Atlanta newsweekly ''[[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)|Creative Loafing]]'' mentioned that Thompson's most recent series of colored pencil drawings, \"Objective Music\", were based on her correlation of art with music. It also made reference to her sense of color and rhythmic line-making as \"[[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]-influenced.\"<ref>Perry, 1987.</ref> A contemporary review of the exhibition in ''Art Papers'' also mentioned Kandinsky as an influence for Thompson, as well as the artist's interest in the fiction of [[Hermann Hesse]] and the [[Jung]]ian concept of the [[collective unconscious]]. But Thompson's feeling for music seemed to have the strongest effect on the work in the exhibition. The reviewer, Leslie Schworm, wrote that Thompson's \"\u2026approach is to draw music or sound. She believes that patterns in music are among the purest natural recurrences, providing direct access to something basic.\"<ref>.Schworm, L. (1988), \"Mildred Thompson, Goethe Institute, Atlanta, Georgia, September 11\u2013October 17\", p. 59, ''Art Papers'', January/February 1988.</ref>\n\nIn the following year the visual description of music was still on Thompson's mind. A solo exhibition titled ''Concatenation'' at [[Agnes Scott College]] contained the wooden sculpture ''Mass'', whose six parts were named \"Kyrie\", \"Gloria\", \"Credo\", \"Sanctus\", \"Benedictus\", and \"Gloria Dei\".<ref>Gay-Griffin, L. (1989), \"Exhibit explores depth of spirit\", p. 16D, ''Daily News'', Lawrenceville, Georgia, Saturday, November 25, 1989.</ref> But other influences, including [[astronomy]], [[spiritualism]] and [[metaphysics]] were starting to appear in her work.  Included in ''Concatenations'' was a series of prints titled ''Five Mysteries''. Their abstract compositions, printed in black ink on white paper, were schematic representations of earth, atmosphere and sun, the latter a flat disc set in a sky filled with energetic marks and scratches. Thompson's series of watercolors, titled ''Lemurian Wanderings'', were described by critic Lorena Gay-Griffin as \u201c\u2026the time at the dawn of the world before the first ray of sun shone through the atmosphere.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\">Gay-Griffin (1989).</ref> A series of colored pencil drawings, ''The Phases of Cynthia'', was reported by the same writer to refer to [[Galileo]]\u2019s study of the phases of the moon. The drawings featured \"...the same sun/moon image as the prints. The circles are layered with other geometric shapes and surrounded by fragments and rays emitting from the center.\"<ref name=\"Gay-Griffin 1989\"/> In 1990 Thompson told ''[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]'' magazine: \"My work has to do with the cosmos and how it affects us.\"<ref>''Essence'' (1990).</ref> Such references continued in her printmaking. In 1993, as an artist-in-residence at Littleton Studios in [[North Carolina]], Thompson created prints in [[vitreography]] titled ''Helio Centric'', ''Particles'' and ''Wave Function''.\n\nA 1992 group exhibition entitled ''A/Cross Currents: Synthesis in African American Abstract Painting'' featured a catalog that cited the jazz of [[Eric Dolphy]], [[Charles Mingus]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] and the German baroque of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] as influences on Thomspon's art. The catalog's essayist, Corrine Jennings, wrote: \"The idea that man and certain animals can hear the sounds of eleven or twelve octaves, but can only see one octave of seven colors, has led to [Thompson\u2019s] interest in exploring the unseen and making it visible.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\">Jennings (1992).</ref> The ''Magnetic Fields'' series of paintings that Thompson exhibited in the show, Jennings wrote, \"\u2026appear to visualize the force of unseen energy. They are intensely painted, tersely defined geometric structures with a direct physical application loosened by\u2026improvisation.\"<ref name=\"Jennings 1992\"/>\n\n== Teaching ==\nThompson had a long and varied teaching career. From 1961 to 1964, when she was trying to make her way as an artist in New York City, she taught elementary school as an employee of the New York Board of Education. In [[D\u00fcren]], Germany, she taught art and art history at the Eschweiler Volchoch Schule from 1965 to 1974. On being named Artist-in Residence for the City of Tampa<ref>The residency was awarded by the Florida State Arts Council with funding from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].</ref> Thompson taught classes and workshops in painting, drawing, sculpture, and mural painting to adults and children at the Tampa Bay Art Center and other local venues. She also had an \"open door\" policy at her studio on 7th Avenue in [[Ybor City, Tampa|Ybor City]]. There, she wrote: \"...anyone who wanted to come in and see could walk in. I felt it somehow served the community.\"<ref>Thompson, M. (1987), \"Memoirs of an Artist, p. 42, ''SAGE: A Scholarly Journal on Black Women'', 10/1:42.</ref> As an Artist-in-Residence at Howard University she taught etching. When she lived in Paris, Thompson gave private lessons at her studio at 4 Rue de Parme from 1981 until her return to the States in 1985. From 1986 to 1989 she taught studio classes, art history and art theory at [[Agnes Scott College]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]], and in Atlanta she taught at [[Morehouse College]] and [[Spelman College]].
