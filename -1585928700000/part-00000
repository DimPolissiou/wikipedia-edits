Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-40|C|0}}, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately {{convert|-68|C|0}}. Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current [[global warming]], leading to [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic sea ice shrinkage]], diminished ice in the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and [[Arctic methane release]] as the [[permafrost]] thaws.\n\nDue to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on||order=flip}} per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by [[tree line]] and temperature) is currently shrinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |last=Hansen |first=Jim |title=The Planet in Peril \u2013 Part I |publisher=Yale Center for the Study of Globalization |date=19 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015173024/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}</ref> Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage.

An example of a dwarf shrub is the [[bearberry]]. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height; [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; [[non-vascular plant]]s such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and [[forb]]s (like the [[Papaver radicatum|Arctic poppy]]).\n\n=== Animals ===\n{{see also|List of Arctic cetaceans}}{{Category see also|Fauna of the Arctic|Mammals of the Arctic}}\n[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]]]\n[[File:Snowy Owl Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[snowy owl]]]]\nHerbivores on the tundra include the [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer|caribou]]. They are preyed on by the [[snowy owl]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Grizzly bear]], and [[Arctic wolf]]. The [[polar bear]] is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [[:Category:Birds of the Arctic|birds]] and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other terrestrial animals include [[wolverine]]s, [[moose]], [[Dall sheep]], [[Stoat|ermines]], and [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s. Marine mammals include [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and several species of [[cetacea]]n\u2014[[baleen whale]]s and also [[narwhal]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and [[Beluga whale|belugas]]. An excellent and famous example of a [[ring species]] exists and has been described around the Arctic Circle in the form of the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.\n\n== Natural resources ==\n{{See also|Natural resources of the Arctic|Petroleum exploration in the Arctic}}\n\nThe Arctic includes copious [[natural resource]]s (oil, gas, minerals, fresh water, fish and, if the subarctic is included, forest) to which modern technology and the [[Arctic resources race|economic opening up of Russia]] have given significant new opportunities. The interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase.\n\nThe Arctic contains some of the last and most extensive continuous [[wilderness]] areas in the world, and its significance in preserving [[biodiversity]] and [[genotype]]s is considerable. The increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats. The Arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of [[groundcover]] and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region. The Arctic also holds 1/5 of the Earth's water supply.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Paleontology==\n[[File:Arctic fossils.jpg|Marine [[fossils]] in [[Canadian Arctic]]|thumb]]\nDuring the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous time period]], the Arctic still had seasonal snows, though only a light dusting and not enough to permanently hinder plant growth.

Due to the prevailing worldwide sea and air currents, the Arctic area is the fallout region for long-range transport [[pollutant]]s, and in some places the concentrations exceed the levels of densely populated urban areas. An example of this is the phenomenon of [[Arctic haze]], which is commonly blamed on long-range pollutants.

Its precipitation mostly comes in the form of snow and is low, with most of the area receiving less than {{convert|50|cm|abbr=on}}. High winds often stir up snow, creating the illusion of continuous snowfall. Average winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-40|C|0}}, and the coldest recorded temperature is approximately {{convert|-68|C|0}}. Coastal Arctic climates are moderated by oceanic influences, having generally warmer temperatures and heavier snowfalls than the colder and drier interior areas. The Arctic is affected by current [[global warming]], leading to [[Climate change in the Arctic|Arctic sea ice shrinkage]], diminished ice in the [[Greenland ice sheet]], and [[Arctic methane release]] as the [[permafrost]] thaws.\n\nDue to the poleward migration of the planet's isotherms (about {{Convert|35|mi|abbr=on||order=flip}} per decade during the past 30 years as a consequence of global warming), the Arctic region (as defined by [[tree line]] and temperature) is currently shrinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |last=Hansen |first=Jim |title=The Planet in Peril \u2013 Part I |publisher=Yale Center for the Study of Globalization |date=19 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015173024/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/content/planet-peril-%E2%80%93-part-i |archivedate=15 October 2009 }}</ref> Perhaps the most alarming result of this is Arctic sea ice shrinkage. There is a large variance in predictions of Arctic sea ice loss, with models showing near-complete to complete loss in September from 2040 to some time well beyond 2100.

An example of a dwarf shrub is the [[bearberry]]. As one moves northward, the amount of warmth available for plant growth decreases considerably. In the northernmost areas, plants are at their metabolic limits, and small differences in the total amount of summer warmth make large differences in the amount of energy available for maintenance, growth and reproduction. Colder summer temperatures cause the size, abundance, productivity and variety of plants to decrease. Trees cannot grow in the Arctic, but in its warmest parts, shrubs are common and can reach {{convert|2|m|ftin|abbr=on}} in height; [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], mosses and lichens can form thick layers. In the coldest parts of the Arctic, much of the ground is bare; [[non-vascular plant]]s such as lichens and mosses predominate, along with a few scattered grasses and [[forb]]s (like the [[Papaver radicatum|Arctic poppy]]).\n\n=== Animals ===\n{{see also|List of Arctic cetaceans}}{{Category see also|Fauna of the Arctic|Mammals of the Arctic}}\n[[File:Muskus.jpg|thumb|[[Muskox]]]]\n[[File:Snowy Owl Portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[snowy owl]]]]\nHerbivores on the tundra include the [[Arctic hare]], [[lemming]], [[muskox]], and [[reindeer|caribou]]. They are preyed on by the [[snowy owl]], [[Arctic fox]], [[Grizzly bear]], and [[Arctic wolf]]. The [[polar bear]] is also a predator, though it prefers to hunt for marine life from the ice. There are also many [[:Category:Birds of the Arctic|birds]] and marine species endemic to the colder regions. Other terrestrial animals include [[wolverine]]s, [[moose]], [[Dall sheep]], [[Stoat|ermines]], and [[Arctic ground squirrel]]s. Marine mammals include [[Pinniped|seals]], [[walrus]], and several species of [[cetacea]]n\u2014[[baleen whale]]s and also [[narwhal]]s, [[killer whale]]s, and [[Beluga whale|belugas]]. An excellent and famous example of a [[ring species]] exists and has been described around the Arctic Circle in the form of the ''[[Larus]]'' gulls.\n\n== Natural resources ==\n{{See also|Natural resources of the Arctic|Petroleum exploration in the Arctic}}\n\nThe Arctic includes copious [[natural resource]]s (oil, gas, minerals, fresh water, fish and, if the subarctic is included, forest) to which modern technology and the [[Arctic resources race|economic opening up of Russia]] have given significant new opportunities. The interest of the tourism industry is also on the increase.\n\nThe Arctic contains some of the last and most extensive continuous [[wilderness]] areas in the world, and its significance in preserving [[biodiversity]] and [[genotype]]s is considerable. The increasing presence of humans fragments vital habitats. The Arctic is particularly susceptible to the abrasion of [[groundcover]] and to the disturbance of the rare breeding grounds of the animals that are characteristic to the region. The Arctic also holds 1/5 of the Earth's water supply.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}\n\n==Paleontology==\n[[File:Arctic fossils.jpg|Marine [[fossils]] in [[Canadian Arctic]]|thumb]]\nDuring the [[Cretaceous|Cretaceous time period]], the Arctic still had seasonal snows, though only a light dusting and not enough to permanently hinder plant growth.

Apart from a brush with English material in the early 1990s they perform in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Their biggest hits are \"Daar gaat ze\" (\"There she goes\", a #1 hit in the Netherlands in 1990, and rerecorded in English as \"Close Encounters\") and \"Passie\" (\"Passion\", a #1 hit in the Netherlands in 1995).\n\n==History==\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nClouseau was set up by [[Bob Savenberg]], who named the band after [[Inspector Clouseau]], a character he enjoyed imitating and after whom he had named his [[radio station]].\n\nInitially, Clouseau only performed at local venues. Singer [[Koen Wauters]] soon left the group to sing for another local band, but in 1987 he was persuaded to return.\n\nThe same year they were discovered at the [[Marktrock]] festival in [[Leuven]], Belgium. Their first single \"Brandweer\" (\"Firemen\", also a pun that can be interpreted as \"Burning again\") sold 427 copies. Their [[television]] debut followed in November of that year.\n\nIn 1989 Clouseau participated in the Belgian tryouts for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song \"Anne\". Clouseau came in second, but \"Anne\" became an enormous hit in Belgium and a (minor) hit in the Netherlands. The popularity of Clouseau in Belgium skyrocketed, and that year Clouseau produced its first album, \"Hoezo?\" (\"Whaddayamean?\").\n\nIn 1990 \"Daar gaat ze\" topped the singles charts in both Belgium and the Netherlands; several more hits followed. On September 30, [[Tjen Berghmans]] left the group after a dispute.\n\nIn October 1990 Clouseau released their second album, ''Of zo...'' (''Or so...''). In March 1991, [[Karel Theys]] departed, leaving Clouseau as a three-piece. A month later Clouseau came in 16th in the Eurovision Song Contest with \"[[Geef het op]]\", but their participation resulted in a European breakthrough.\n\n===1991\u20131999===\nAfterwards it was announced that Koen Wauters was called up for the army; because of his Clouseau-commitments he only had to serve four weeks and didn't need to shave his head. Fall 1991, Clouseau released their first [[English language]] album; ''Close Encounters'' (of which the title track is a translation of \"Daar gaat ze\") was a huge success in Germany. The Dutch fans were less keen on the idea of Koen Wauters singing in another language and rather bought the live-album that was released during this period.\n\nIn 1992 Clouseau released a [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] album, ''Doorgaan'' (''Keep on going''). At the same time, they supported Swedish group [[Roxette]] on their European tour performing the ''Close Encounters''-material.\n\nThe second English-language album, 1993's ''In every small town'' was recorded in [[Los Angeles]]. However, the album failed critically, receiving little attention outside the [[Benelux]] countries. Since then, Clouseau has refrained from producing English-language music (except for occasional singles, e.g. \"[[Weather With You]]\" (Crowded House cover) in 2000).\n\nIn 1995 they released the ''Oker'' album, which featured the single \"Passie\". In 1996, founder Bob Savenberg left the group. At the time he hosted the television format of the [[Ultratop 50]]. Bob Savenberg now works with upcoming artists as a manager.\n\nIn September 1996 Clouseau released the ''Adrenaline'' album, which was promoted with a large tour.\n\nOn December 22, 1998 singer Koen Wauters married the Dutch television journalist and one-time MTV-presenter [[Carolyn Lilipaly]] (they divorced in 2002). 1999 saw the release of ''In Stereo''. Clouseau were heading for a new direction. A live album was released in 2000, and Clouseau were touring Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\nIn 2001, Clouseau released the disco oriented CD ''En Dans'' (''And Dance''); the artwork was designed by [[Marcel Vanthilt]] and the title track became a huge hit. Whilst the fans were waiting for new material, the two remaining bandmembers presented the 2003 and 2004 editions of ''Idool'' (the Belgian version of ''Idols'') on [[Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij|VTM]]. In October 2004 they released the ''Vanbinnen'' (''Inside'') album.\n[[Image:Clouseau live.jpg|thumb|right|Clouseau performing in December 2009]]\nSince 2002 Clouseau are playing multiple Christmas shows at the [[Sportpaleis Antwerp]]. These concerts are a huge success with tickets selling out well in advance and each year's series surpassing the previous. In 2005, 13 shows attracted over 200,000 visitors in total. Due to Koen's [[Dakar Rally|Dakar]]-participation they couldn't add any further dates.\n\nIn 2006 Clouseau performed in Antwerp at the [[0110 concerts]] for tolerance, organised by [[Tom Barman]], singer/guitarist with dEUS. At that moment seven shows were added for that year's Christmas stint (Clouseau Speciale Editie).\n\nThe band released their latest CD ''Vonken & Vuur'' (''Sparks & Flames'') in March 2007 with \"De Tegenpartij\" (\"The Opposition Party\") being the first single. The Dutch release followed a month later.\n\nTheir 20th anniversary was celebrated with the tribute album ''Braveau Clouseau''.\n\nOn December 5, 2008 Clouseau played the first of their Crescendo Christmas-shows.\n\nIn 2009 they expressed their tiredness of Belgian communal tensions in a pro-Belgium song, a novelty in Flemish commercial popular culture. They toured across railway-stations and festivals which included their first show in the Netherlands in nine years.\n\nIn 2017 a documentary was aired in honour of their 30th anniversary.\n\n==Members==\n* [[Tjen Berghmans]] (up to September 1990)\n* [[Karel Theys]] (up to March 1991)\n* [[Bob Savenberg]] (up to 1996)\n* [[Kris Wauters]]\n* [[Koen Wauters]]\n\n==Band==\n* [[Frank Michiels]] (Percussion)\n* [[Hans Francken]] (Keyboards)\n* [[Herman Cambr\u00e9]] (Drums)\n* [[Eric Melaerts]] (Guitar)\n* [[Tom Lodewyckx]] (Guitar)\n* [[Vincent Pierens]] (Bass Guitar)\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Hoezo?]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Of zo...]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Close Encounters (Clouseau album)|Close Encounters]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Live '91 (Clouseau album)|Live '91]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Doorgaan]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[In Every Small Town]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Het Beste van]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Oker (album)|Oker]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Adrenaline (Clouseau album)|Adrenaline]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[87- 97]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[In Stereo (Clouseau album)|In Stereo]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Live (Clouseau album)|Live]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Ballades (album)|Ballades]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[En Dans]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Live in het Sportpaleis]]'' DVD (\"Live at the Sport Palace, Antwerp\") (2003)\n* ''[[Vanbinnen]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Clouseau in 't lang]] DVD (\"Live at the Sport Palace, Antwerp\") (2006)\n* ''[[Vonken en Vuur]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Zij Aan Zij]]'' (2009)\n* ''Clouseau'' (2013)\n* ''Clouseau Danst'' (2016)\n* ''Tweesprong'' (2019)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/zw/album/tweesprong/1481510628|title=Tweesprong by Clouseau|website=Apple Music|accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Single\n!colspan=\"3\"|Peak chart positions\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller\"\n!width=\"35\"|<small>[[Ultratop|BEL<br>(FLA)]]</small><br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultratop.be/nl/search.asp?lang=nl&cat=s&artist=Clouseau&artist_search=starts&title=&title_search=starts |title=Clouseau - Flemish Chart |publisher=ultratop.be |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n!width=\"35\"|<small>[[Single Top 100|NED]]</small><br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?cat=s&artist=Clouseau&artist_search=starts&title=&title_search=starts |title=Clouseau - Dutch Chart |publisher=dutchcharts.nl |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n!width=\"35\"|<small>[[Media Control Charts|GER]]</small><br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://germancharts.de/search.asp?cat=s&artist=Clouseau&artist_search=starts&title=&title_search=starts |title=Clouseau - German Chart|publisher=germancharts.de |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|1987\n!

Apart from a brush with English material in the early 1990s they perform in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Their biggest hits are \"Daar gaat ze\" (\"There she goes\", a #1 hit in the Netherlands in 1990, and rerecorded in English as \"Close Encounters\") and \"Passie\" (\"Passion\", a #1 hit in the Netherlands in 1995).\n\n==History==\n\n===1987\u20131990===\nClouseau was set up by [[Bob Savenberg]], who named the band after [[Inspector Clouseau]], a character he enjoyed imitating and after whom he had named his [[radio station]].\n\nInitially, Clouseau only performed at local venues. Singer [[Koen Wauters]] soon left the group to sing for another local band, but in 1987 he was persuaded to return.\n\nThe same year they were discovered at the [[Marktrock]] festival in [[Leuven]], Belgium. Their first single \"Brandweer\" (\"Firemen\", also a pun that can be interpreted as \"Burning again\") sold 427 copies. Their [[television]] debut followed in November of that year.\n\nIn 1989 Clouseau participated in the Belgian tryouts for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song \"Anne\". Clouseau came in second, but \"Anne\" became an enormous hit in Belgium and a (minor) hit in the Netherlands. The popularity of Clouseau in Belgium skyrocketed, and that year Clouseau produced its first album, \"Hoezo?\" (\"Whaddayamean?\").\n\nIn 1990 \"Daar gaat ze\" topped the singles charts in both Belgium and the Netherlands; several more hits followed. On September 30, [[Tjen Berghmans]] left the group after a dispute.\n\nIn October 1990 Clouseau released their second album, ''Of zo...'' (''Or so...''). In March 1991, [[Karel Theys]] departed, leaving Clouseau as a three-piece. A month later Clouseau came in 16th in the Eurovision Song Contest with \"[[Geef het op]]\", but their participation resulted in a European breakthrough.\n\n===1991\u20131999===\nAfterwards it was announced that Koen Wauters was called up for the army; because of his Clouseau-commitments he only had to serve four weeks and didn't need to shave his head. Fall 1991, Clouseau released their first [[English language]] album; ''Close Encounters'' (of which the title track is a translation of \"Daar gaat ze\") was a huge success in Germany. The Dutch fans were less keen on the idea of Koen Wauters singing in another language and rather bought the live-album that was released during this period.\n\nIn 1992 Clouseau released a [[Dutch language|Dutch-language]] album, ''Doorgaan'' (''Keep on going''). At the same time, they supported Swedish group [[Roxette]] on their European tour performing the ''Close Encounters''-material.\n\nThe second English-language album, 1993's ''In every small town'' was recorded in [[Los Angeles]]. However, the album failed critically, receiving little attention outside the [[Benelux]] countries. Since then, Clouseau has refrained from producing English-language music (except for occasional singles, e.g. \"[[Weather With You]]\" (Crowded House cover) in 2000).\n\nIn 1995 they released the ''Oker'' album, which featured the single \"Passie\". In 1996, founder Bob Savenberg left the group. At the time he hosted the television format of the [[Ultratop 50]]. Bob Savenberg now works with upcoming artists as a manager.\n\nIn September 1996 Clouseau released the ''Adrenaline'' album, which was promoted with a large tour.\n\nOn December 22, 1998 singer Koen Wauters married the Dutch television journalist and one-time MTV-presenter [[Carolyn Lilipaly]] (they divorced in 2002). 1999 saw the release of ''In Stereo''. Clouseau were heading for a new direction. A live album was released in 2000, and Clouseau were touring Belgium and the Netherlands.\n\n===2000\u20132009===\nIn 2001, Clouseau released the disco oriented CD ''En Dans'' (''And Dance''); the artwork was designed by [[Marcel Vanthilt]] and the title track became a huge hit. Whilst the fans were waiting for new material, the two remaining bandmembers presented the 2003 and 2004 editions of ''Idool'' (the Belgian version of ''Idols'') on [[Vlaamse Televisie Maatschappij|VTM]]. In October 2004 they released the ''Vanbinnen'' (''Inside'') album.\n[[Image:Clouseau live.jpg|thumb|right|Clouseau performing in December 2009]]\nSince 2002 Clouseau are playing multiple Christmas shows at the [[Sportpaleis Antwerp]]. These concerts are a huge success with tickets selling out well in advance and each year's series surpassing the previous. In 2005, 13 shows attracted over 200,000 visitors in total. Due to Koen's [[Dakar Rally|Dakar]]-participation they couldn't add any further dates.\n\nIn 2006 Clouseau performed in Antwerp at the [[0110 concerts]] for tolerance, organised by [[Tom Barman]], singer/guitarist with dEUS. At that moment seven shows were added for that year's Christmas stint (Clouseau Speciale Editie).\n\nThe band released their latest CD ''Vonken & Vuur'' (''Sparks & Flames'') in March 2007 with \"De Tegenpartij\" (\"The Opposition Party\") being the first single. The Dutch release followed a month later.\n\nTheir 20th anniversary was celebrated with the tribute album ''Braveau Clouseau''.\n\nOn December 5, 2008 Clouseau played the first of their Crescendo Christmas-shows.\n\nIn 2009 they expressed their tiredness of Belgian communal tensions in a pro-Belgium song, a novelty in Flemish commercial popular culture. They toured across railway-stations and festivals which included their first show in the Netherlands in nine years.\n\nIn 2017 a documentary was aired in honour of their 30th anniversary.\n\n==Members==\n* [[Tjen Berghmans]] (up to September 1990)\n* [[Karel Theys]] (up to March 1991)\n* [[Bob Savenberg]] (up to 1996)\n* [[Kris Wauters]]\n* [[Koen Wauters]]\n\n==Band==\n* [[Frank Michiels]] (Percussion)\n* [[Hans Francken]] (Keyboards)\n* [[Herman Cambr\u00e9]] (Drums)\n* [[Eric Melaerts]] (Guitar)\n* [[Tom Lodewyckx]] (Guitar)\n* [[Vincent Pierens]] (Bass Guitar)\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Albums===\n* ''[[Hoezo?]]'' (1989)\n* ''[[Of zo...]]'' (1990)\n* ''[[Close Encounters (Clouseau album)|Close Encounters]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Live '91 (Clouseau album)|Live '91]]'' (1991)\n* ''[[Doorgaan]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[In Every Small Town]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Het Beste van]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[Oker (album)|Oker]]'' (1995)\n* ''[[Adrenaline (Clouseau album)|Adrenaline]]'' (1996)\n* ''[[87- 97]]'' (1997)\n* ''[[In Stereo (Clouseau album)|In Stereo]]'' (1999)\n* ''[[Live (Clouseau album)|Live]]'' (2000)\n* ''[[Ballades (album)|Ballades]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[En Dans]]'' (2001)\n* ''[[Live in het Sportpaleis]]'' DVD (\"Live at the Sport Palace, Antwerp\") (2003)\n* ''[[Vanbinnen]]'' (2004)\n* ''[[Clouseau in 't lang]] DVD (\"Live at the Sport Palace, Antwerp\") (2006)\n* ''[[Vonken en Vuur]]'' (2007)\n* ''[[Zij Aan Zij]]'' (2009)\n* ''Clouseau'' (2013)\n* ''Clouseau Danst'' (2016)\n* ''Tweesprong'' (2019)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/zw/album/tweesprong/1481510628|title=Tweesprong by Clouseau|website=Apple Music|accessdate=16 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Singles===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Year\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Single\n!colspan=\"3\"|Peak chart positions\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Album\n|- style=\"font-size:smaller\"\n!width=\"35\"|<small>[[Ultratop|BEL<br>(FLA)]]</small><br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultratop.be/nl/search.asp?lang=nl&cat=s&artist=Clouseau&artist_search=starts&title=&title_search=starts |title=Clouseau - Flemish Chart |publisher=ultratop.be |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n!width=\"35\"|<small>[[Single Top 100|NED]]</small><br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dutchcharts.nl/search.asp?cat=s&artist=Clouseau&artist_search=starts&title=&title_search=starts |title=Clouseau - Dutch Chart |publisher=dutchcharts.nl |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n!width=\"35\"|<small>[[Media Control Charts|GER]]</small><br><ref>{{cite web|url=http://germancharts.de/search.asp?cat=s&artist=Clouseau&artist_search=starts&title=&title_search=starts |title=Clouseau - German Chart|publisher=germancharts.de |accessdate=9 February 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\"|1987\n!

[[Ellie Goulding]]'s single \"[[Love Me Like You Do]]\" was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].\n\nIt is the first installment in the [[Fifty Shades (film series)|''Fifty Shades'' film trilogy]] and was followed by two sequels, ''[[Fifty Shades Darker (film)|Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed (film)|Fifty Shades Freed]]'', released in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n21-year-old Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele is an English literature major at [[Washington State University]]\u2019s satellite campus near [[Vancouver, Washington]]. When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, becomes ill and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a 27-year-old [[billionaire]] entrepreneur, for the college newspaper, Ana agrees to go in her place. At Christian's [[Seattle]] headquarters called Grey House, Ana stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU [[Graduation|commencement]] speaker, takes an interest in her; soon after, he visits the hardware store where Ana works, and offers to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Ana had interviewed him.\n\nChristian invites Ana for coffee, but leaves abruptly after Ana confesses to being a romantic, saying he is not the man for her. Christian later sends Ana first edition copies of two [[Thomas Hardy]] novels, including ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', as a gift, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships, on an accompanying card.\n\nAna and her friends celebrate graduation at a local bar. After drinking too much, Ana spontaneously calls Christian, saying she is returning the books, and berating his behavior towards her. Christian goes to the bar to find Ana, who then passes out. She wakes up the next morning in Christian's hotel room, but is relieved to find that they were not intimate.\n\nAna and Christian begin seeing each other, though he insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] preventing her from revealing details about their dalliance. Christian explains that he has [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] relationships, but only as clearly defined in a contract between the participants. Ana reveals that she is a virgin. While considering the agreement and negotiating her own terms, and after visiting his \"playroom,\" a room stocked with a variety of [[BDSM]] toys, furniture, and gear, she and Christian have sex. Ana also meets Christian's mother. Ana asks Christian how many girls had lived in his house while he takes her home.\n\nChristian bestows a series of gifts and favors upon Ana, including a new car and a computer laptop. After Ana and Kate move to Seattle, Ana continues seeing Christian. During dinner at Christian's parents, Ana suddenly mentions she is leaving the next day to visit her mother in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later, Christian becomes frustrated when Ana says that she wants more than the one-sided relationship he proposes. She is shocked when Christian unexpectedly arrives in Georgia; he takes her flying but leaves soon afterward, to tend to an emergency in Seattle.\n\nAfter returning home, Ana continues seeing Christian, who wants further sexual experimentation. Ana initially consents, but Christian keeps emotionally distant, upsetting her. While still considering the contract, and in an effort to understand Christian psychologically, Ana asks him to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule-breaking. Christian whips Ana's buttocks with a belt. Upset and disgusted, Ana breaks up with Christian after concluding that he is wrong for her and his practices border on deviant and excessive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n  | direction = vertical\n  | footer = [[Jamie Dornan]] and [[Dakota Johnson]].\n  | image1 = Jamie Dornan January 2013.jpg\n  | width1 = 132\n  | image2 = Dakota Johnson 2014 (cropped).jpg\n  | width2 = 132\n}}\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele, a 21-year-old English Literature student attending [[Washington State University]].\n* [[Jamie Dornan]] as Christian Grey, a 27-year-old billionaire, entrepreneur, and CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.\n* [[Eloise Mumford]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh,<ref name=\"mumford\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/eloise-mumford-fifty-shades-of-grey-1200865898/ |title='Fifty Shades': Eloise Mumford Tapped to Play Anastasia Steele's Roommate |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |first=Justin |last=Kroll |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Anastasia's best friend/roommate who begins a relationship with Christian's older brother, Elliot Grey.\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Carla Wilks,<ref name=\"elhe\">{{cite web|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|title=Jennifer Ehle Joining 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' As Anastasia Steele's Mother|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/jennifer-ehle-joining-fifty-shades-of-grey-as-anastasia-steeles-mother/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |date=October 7, 2013}}</ref> Anastasia's mother.\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey,<ref name=\"harden\">{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Adds Marcia Gay Harden as Christian Grey's Mother |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-adds-marcia-661732 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> Christian Grey's adoptive mother.\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as Jose Rodriguez,<ref name=\"rasuk\">{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Sneider|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Casts 'How to Make It in America' Star Victor Rasuk as Jose|url=http://www.thewrap.com/fifty-shades-grey-casts-make-america-star-victor-rasuk-jose/|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> one of Anastasia's close friends.\n* [[Luke Grimes]] as Elliot Grey,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='True Blood' Actor Joins 'Fifty Shades of Grey' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-luke-grimes-650995|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013|date=October 25, 2013}}</ref> Christian's adopted older brother.\n* [[Rita Ora]] as Mia Grey,<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Rita Ora|author-link=Rita Ora|user=RitaOra|title=It's official!

[[Ellie Goulding]]'s single \"[[Love Me Like You Do]]\" was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].\n\nIt is the first installment in the [[Fifty Shades (film series)|''Fifty Shades'' film trilogy]] and was followed by two sequels, ''[[Fifty Shades Darker (film)|Fifty Shades Darker]]'' and ''[[Fifty Shades Freed (film)|Fifty Shades Freed]]'', released in 2017 and 2018, respectively.\n\n==Plot==\n21-year-old Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele is an English literature major at [[Washington State University]]\u2019s satellite campus near [[Vancouver, Washington]]. When her roommate, Kate Kavanagh, becomes ill and is unable to interview Christian Grey, a 27-year-old [[billionaire]] entrepreneur, for the college newspaper, Ana agrees to go in her place. At Christian's [[Seattle]] headquarters called Grey House, Ana stumbles her way through the meeting. Christian, who is that year's WSU [[Graduation|commencement]] speaker, takes an interest in her; soon after, he visits the hardware store where Ana works, and offers to do a photo shoot to accompany the article for which Ana had interviewed him.\n\nChristian invites Ana for coffee, but leaves abruptly after Ana confesses to being a romantic, saying he is not the man for her. Christian later sends Ana first edition copies of two [[Thomas Hardy]] novels, including ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'', as a gift, with a quote from the latter book about the dangers of relationships, on an accompanying card.\n\nAna and her friends celebrate graduation at a local bar. After drinking too much, Ana spontaneously calls Christian, saying she is returning the books, and berating his behavior towards her. Christian goes to the bar to find Ana, who then passes out. She wakes up the next morning in Christian's hotel room, but is relieved to find that they were not intimate.\n\nAna and Christian begin seeing each other, though he insists that she sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]] preventing her from revealing details about their dalliance. Christian explains that he has [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] relationships, but only as clearly defined in a contract between the participants. Ana reveals that she is a virgin. While considering the agreement and negotiating her own terms, and after visiting his \"playroom,\" a room stocked with a variety of [[BDSM]] toys, furniture, and gear, she and Christian have sex. Ana also meets Christian\u2019s mother. Ana asks Christian how many girls had lived in his house while he takes her home.\n\nChristian bestows a series of gifts and favors upon Ana, including a new car and a computer laptop. After Ana and Kate move to Seattle, Ana continues seeing Christian. During dinner at Christian's parents, Ana suddenly mentions she is leaving the next day to visit her mother in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later, Christian becomes frustrated when Ana says that she wants more than the one-sided relationship he proposes. She is shocked when Christian unexpectedly arrives in Georgia; he takes her flying but leaves soon afterward, to tend to an emergency in Seattle.\n\nAfter returning home, Ana continues seeing Christian, who wants further sexual experimentation. Ana initially consents, but Christian keeps emotionally distant, upsetting her. While still considering the contract, and in an effort to understand Christian psychologically, Ana asks him to demonstrate how he would \"punish\" her for rule-breaking. Christian whips Ana's buttocks with a belt. Upset and disgusted, Ana breaks up with Christian after concluding that he is wrong for her and his practices border on deviant and excessive.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Multiple image\n  | direction = vertical\n  | footer = [[Jamie Dornan]] and [[Dakota Johnson]].\n  | image1 = Jamie Dornan January 2013.jpg\n  | width1 = 132\n  | image2 = Dakota Johnson 2014 (cropped).jpg\n  | width2 = 132\n}}\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Anastasia \"Ana\" Steele, a 21-year-old English Literature student attending [[Washington State University]].\n* [[Jamie Dornan]] as Christian Grey, a 27-year-old billionaire, entrepreneur, and CEO of Grey Enterprises Holdings Inc.\n* [[Eloise Mumford]] as Katherine \"Kate\" Kavanagh,<ref name=\"mumford\">{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/news/eloise-mumford-fifty-shades-of-grey-1200865898/ |title='Fifty Shades': Eloise Mumford Tapped to Play Anastasia Steele's Roommate |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |first=Justin |last=Kroll |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> Anastasia's best friend/roommate who begins a relationship with Christian's older brother, Elliot Grey.\n* [[Jennifer Ehle]] as Carla Wilks,<ref name=\"elhe\">{{cite web|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|title=Jennifer Ehle Joining 'Fifty Shades Of Grey' As Anastasia Steele's Mother|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/10/jennifer-ehle-joining-fifty-shades-of-grey-as-anastasia-steeles-mother/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |accessdate=October 8, 2013 |date=October 7, 2013}}</ref> Anastasia's mother.\n* [[Marcia Gay Harden]] as Dr. Grace Trevelyan-Grey,<ref name=\"harden\">{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Adds Marcia Gay Harden as Christian Grey's Mother |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-adds-marcia-661732 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=December 4, 2013 |date=December 3, 2013}}</ref> Christian Grey's adoptive mother.\n* [[Victor Rasuk]] as Jose Rodriguez,<ref name=\"rasuk\">{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Sneider|title='Fifty Shades of Grey' Casts 'How to Make It in America' Star Victor Rasuk as Jose|url=http://www.thewrap.com/fifty-shades-grey-casts-make-america-star-victor-rasuk-jose/|work=[[TheWrap]]|date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}</ref> one of Anastasia's close friends.\n* [[Luke Grimes]] as Elliot Grey,<ref>{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title='True Blood' Actor Joins 'Fifty Shades of Grey' |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-luke-grimes-650995|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=December 4, 2013|date=October 25, 2013}}</ref> Christian's adopted older brother.\n* [[Rita Ora]] as Mia Grey,<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Rita Ora|author-link=Rita Ora|user=RitaOra|title=It's official!

It also describes inter-type relations (i.e. nested types) and defines which types are expected as method arguments and which types the user can expect to receive as method return values.

This specification describes methods, method parameters, types and return types. It also supports user documentation on service, method and parameter levels.\n|-\n|request\n|Specification for JSON requests. It contains information about which method that is to be invoked and all the arguments for the method call. Arguments in the request must obey the parameter definition of the same method described in the corresponding JSON-WSP description.\n|-\n|response\n|Specification for JSON responses. The response object contains the result of a service method invocation. The return type must obey the defined return type of the same method in the corresponding JSON-WSP description.\n|-\n|fault\n|Specification for JSON fault responses. The fault object contains a fault code and a fault string. The fault information specifies whether the fault occurred on the client or server side. Depending on the server side service framework more detailed information can be extracted, i.e. the filename and line number where the fault occurred.\n|}\n\nNOTE: JSON-WSP specification 1.0 is still{{When|date=July 2012}} not final.

It can be used anywhere in the description as a primitive type. In requests and responses that involve attachments, the message format must be [[MIME#Multipart messages|multipart/related]] where the attachments are transported as mimeparts of media type: [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2046#section-4.5.1 application/octet-stream] with no Content-Transfer-Encoding (only raw binary). Mimeparts must have a unique CONTENT-ID in their entity headers. Attachment values in the JSON-WSP request/response objects must match the regular expression \"^cid:(.+)$\" where the capture group maps to one of the mimepart's CONTENT-ID.\n\n=== Attachment service description example ===\nThe following example shows what a simple JSON-WSP description with attachments could look like:\n\n<source lang=\"javascript\">\n{\n    \"type\": \"jsonwsp/description\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"url\": \"http://mysite.com/TransferService/jsonwsp\",\n    \"servicename\": \"TransferService\",\n    \"types\": {\n        \"File\": {\n            \"data\": \"attachment\",\n            \"name\": \"string\"\n        }\n    },\n    \"methods\": {\n        \"upload\": {\n            \"ret_info\": {\n                \"doc_lines\": [],\n                \"type\": \"number\"\n            },\n            \"doc_lines\": [],\n            \"params\": {\n                \"incoming\": {\n                    \"def_order\": 1,\n                    \"doc_lines\": [],\n                    \"type\": [ \"File\" ],\n                    \"optional\": false\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n</source>\n\n=== Attachment service request example ===\nA request to the method \"upload\" described above could look like this:\n\n<source lang=\"mime\">\nContent-Type: multipart/related; boundary=\"2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\"\n\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/json, charset=UTF-8\nContent-ID: body\n\n{\n    \"type\": \"jsonwsp/request\",\n    \"version\": \"1.0\",\n    \"methodname\": \"upload\",\n    \"args\": {\n        \"incoming\": [ {\n            \"data\": \"cid:img2354.png\",\n            \"name\": \"face.png\"\n        }, {\n            \"data\": \"cid:cv.pdf\",\n            \"name\": \"cv.pdf\"\n        } ]\n    }\n}\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-ID: img2354.png\n\n<png-image binary data>\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25\nContent-Type: application/octet-stream\nContent-ID: cv.pdf\n\n<pdf-image binary data>\n--2676ff6efebdb664f8f7ccb34f864e25--\n</source>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[JSON-RPC]] JSON-based remote procedure call\n* [[JSON#JSON Schema|JSON Schema]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Web service specifications]]\n[[Category:Remote procedure call]]\n[[Category:JSON]]\n", "text_old": ":[https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=757972316 This article] is on hold ([[Talk:JSON-WSP#Why has the content been deleted.3F|will be deleted]]), perhaps you are searching for [[JSON-RPC]] or [[JSON#JSON Schema|JSON Schema]].\n\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{Original research|date=July 2014}}\n{{Notability|date=January 2018}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}}}\n\n'''JSON-WSP''' (JavaScript Object Notation Web-Service Protocol) is a web-service protocol that uses [[JSON]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|format=PDF|title=ECMAScript \u2013 2017 Language Specification|website=Ecma-international.org|access-date=28 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150412040502/http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-262.pdf|archive-date=12 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> for service description, requests and responses. It is inspired from [[JSON-RPC]], but the lack of a service description specification with documentation in JSON-RPC sparked the design of JSON-WSP.\n\nThe description format has the same purpose for JSON-WSP as [[WSDL]] has for [[SOAP]] or [[Interface description language|IDL]] for [[CORBA]], which is to describe the types and methods used in a given service. It also describes inter-type relations (i.e. nested types) and defines which types are expected as method arguments and which types the user can expect to receive as method return values. Finally the description opens the possibility to add documentation on service, method, parameter and return levels.\n\nCommunication between clients and a JSON-WSP server is carried out using [[HTTP]] [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.3|title=Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Semantics and Content|first1=Fielding|last1=Roy|first2=Reschke|last2=Julian|website=Tools.ietf.org|accessdate=28 January 2018}}</ref> requests and responses, with the JSON objects as data with the content-type application/json.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140936/http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.html |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref>\n\n== Specifications ==\nJSON-WSP consists of four JSON object specifications:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Specification\n!Description\n|-\n|description\n|Service description specification (like [[WSDL]]). This specification describes methods, method parameters, types and return types. It also supports user documentation on service, method and parameter levels.\n|-\n|request\n|Specification for JSON requests. It contains information about which method that is to be invoked and all the arguments for the method call. Arguments in the request must obey the parameter definition of the same method described in the corresponding JSON-WSP description.\n|-\n|response\n|Specification for JSON responses. The response object contains the result of a service method invocation. The return type must obey the defined return type of the same method in the corresponding JSON-WSP description.\n|-\n|fault\n|Specification for JSON fault responses. The fault object contains a fault code and a fault string. The fault information specifies whether the fault occurred on the client or server side. Depending on the server side service framework more detailed information can be extracted, i.e. the filename and line number where the fault occurred.\n|}\n\nNOTE: JSON-WSP specification 1.0 is still{{When|date=July 2012}} not final. Please refer to the real-world example in this article to get an idea of how the specification is going to be structured. The current state of the actual specification is kept at launchpad.net:.<ref>[http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~jakob-simon-gaarde/ladon/trunk/view/head:/docs/specs/jsonwsp.spec] {{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> An RFC proposal is currently being created and hopefully accepted within a couple of months.{{When|date=July 2012}}\n\n=== Understanding the specification notation ===\n==== Building blocks ====\n* If the name of the building block being defined starts with '''rx-''', it means that the definition is a [[regular expression]].

Infection is spread to the susceptible patient in the clinical setting by various means. Health care staff also spread infection, in addition to contaminated equipment, bed linens, or air droplets. The infection can originate from the outside environment, another infected patient, staff that may be infected, or in some cases, the source of the infection cannot be determined. In some cases the microorganism originates from the patient's own skin microbiota, becoming opportunistic after surgery or other procedures that compromise the protective skin barrier. Though the patient may have contracted the infection from their own skin, the infection is still considered nosocomial since it develops in the health care setting.\n\nIn the United States, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] estimated roughly 1.7 million hospital-associated infections, from all types of [[microorganism]]s, including [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]] combined, cause or contribute to 99,000 deaths each year.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Klevens |first1=R.

droplets are generated from the source person mainly by coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures, such as bronchoscopy. \n|-\n|[[Airborne transmission]]\n|Dissemination can be either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue {5 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]] or smaller in size} of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air-handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Microorganisms transmitted by airborne transmission include ''[[Legionella]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and the [[rubeola]] and [[varicella]] viruses.\n|-\n|Common vehicle transmission\n|This applies to microorganisms transmitted to the host by contaminated items, such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.\n|-\n|[[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector borne transmission]]\n|This occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms.\n|}\n\nContact transmission is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact transmission and indirect-contact transmission.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Routes of contact transmission\n!Route\n!Description\n|-\n|Direct-contact transmission\n|This involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as when a person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other [[health care|patient-care]] activities that require direct personal contact. Direct-contact transmission also can occur between two patients, with one serving as the source of the infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.\n|-\n|Indirect-contact transmission\n|This involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments, [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s, or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between patients. In addition, the improper use of saline flush syringes, vials, and bags has been implicated in disease transmission in the US, even when healthcare workers had access to gloves, disposable needles, intravenous devices, and flushes.<ref name=salineflush>{{cite journal |vauthors=Jain SK, Persaud D, Perl TM, etal |title=Nosocomial malaria and saline flush |journal=Emerging Infect.

An adaptation of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services payment policy causes poor-performing hospitals to lose up to 3% of their inpatient revenues, whereas hospitals that are able to avoid HAIs can earn up to 3% in rewards. During the program\u2019s first 2 years, complication rates fell by 15.26 percent across all hospital-acquired conditions tracked by the state (including those not covered by the program), from a risk-adjusted complication rate of 2.38 per 1,000 people in 2009 to a rate of 2.02 in 2011. The 15.26-percent decline translates into more than $100 million in cost savings for the health care system in Maryland, with the largest savings coming from avoidance of urinary tract infections, [[sepsis]] and other severe infections, and [[pneumonia]] and other lung infections.

Furthermore, patients are often prescribed antibiotics and other antimicrobial drugs to help treat illness; this may increase the [[natural selection|selection pressure]] for the emergence of resistant strains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kol\u00e1r|first=M.|last2=Urb\u00e1nek|first2=K.|last3=L\u00e1tal|first3=T.|date=May 2001|title=Antibiotic selective pressure and development of bacterial resistance|journal=International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents|volume=17|issue=5|pages=357\u2013363|issn=0924-8579|pmid=11337221|doi=10.1016/S0924-8579(01)00317-X}}</ref>\n\n===Sterilization===\nSterilization goes further than just sanitizing. It kills all microorganisms on equipment and surfaces through exposure to chemicals, ionizing radiation, dry heat, or steam under pressure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gibraltarlabsinc.com/the-different-methods-of-sterilizing-medical-equipment/|title=The Different Methods of Sterilizing Medical Equipment|date=2013-05-31|website=Gibraltar Laboratories|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref>\n\n===Isolation===\n{{Main article|Isolation (health care)}}\nIsolation is the implementation of isolating precautions designed to prevent transmission of microorganisms by common routes in hospitals. (See [[Universal precautions]] and [[Transmission-based precautions]].) Because agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of transfer of microorganisms is directed primarily at transmission for example isolation of infectious cases in special hospitals and isolation of patient with infected wounds in special rooms also isolation of joint transplantation patients on specific rooms.\n\n===Handwashing===\n[[Handwashing]] frequently is called the single most important measure to reduce the risks of transmitting [[skin flora|skin microorganism]]s from one person to another or from one site to another on the same patient. Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with [[blood]], [[body fluid]]s, [[secretion]]s, [[excretion]]s, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions. \nThe spread of nosocomial infections, among immunocompromised patients is connected with health care workers' hand contamination in almost 40% of cases, and is a challenging problem in the modern hospitals. The best way for workers to overcome this problem is conducting correct hand-hygiene procedures; this is why the WHO launched in 2005 the GLOBAL Patient Safety Challenge.<ref>World Alliance for patient safety. WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. http://www.who.int/rpc/guidelines/9789241597906/en/. 2009</ref>\nTwo categories of micro-organisms can be present on health care workers' hands: transient flora and resident flora. The first is represented by the micro-organisms taken by workers from the environment, and the bacteria in it are capable of surviving on the human skin and sometimes to grow. The second group is represented by the permanent micro-organisms living on the skin surface (on the stratum corneum or immediately under it). They are capable of surviving on the human skin and to grow freely on it. They have low pathogenicity and infection rate, and they create a kind of protection from the colonization from other more pathogenic bacteria. The skin of workers is colonized by 3.9 x 10<sup>4</sup> \u2013 4.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>. The microbes comprising the resident flora are: ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'', ''S. hominis'', and ''Microccocus'', ''Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dermobacterium'', and ''Pitosporum'' spp., while transient organisms are ''S. aureus'', and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', and ''Acinetobacter, Enterobacter'' and ''Candida'' spp. The goal of hand hygiene is to eliminate the transient flora with a careful and proper performance of hand washing, using different kinds of soap, (normal and antiseptic), and alcohol-based gels. The main problems found in the practice of hand hygiene is connected with the lack of available sinks and time-consuming performance of hand washing. An easy way to resolve this problem could be the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, because of faster application compared to correct hand-washing.<ref>Hugonnet S, Perneger TV, Pittet D. Alcohol based hand rub improves compliance with hand hygiene in intensive care units. Arch Intern med 2002; 162: 1037-1043.</ref>\n\nImproving patient hand washing has also been shown to reduce the rate of nosocomial infection. Patients who are bed-bound often do not have as much access to clean their hands at mealtimes or after touching surfaces or handling waste such as tissues.  By reinforcing the importance of handwashing and providing santizing gel or wipes within reach of the bed, nurses were directly able to reduce infection rates.  A study published in 2017 demonstrated this by improving patient education on both proper hand-washing procedure and important times to use sanitizer and successfully reduced the rate of enterococci and \"S. aureus\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haverstick, Stacy|author2=Goodrich, Cara|author3=Freeman, Regi|author4=James, Shandra|author5=Kullar, Rajkiran|author6=Ahrens, Melissa|date=June 2017|title=Patients' Hand Washing and Reducing Hospital-Acquired Infection|journal=Critical Care Nurse|volume=37|issue=3|pages=e1\u2013e8|url=http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/37/3/e1.abstract|doi=10.4037/ccn2017694|pmid=28572111}}</ref>\n\nAll visitors must follow the same procedures as hospital staff to adequately control the spread of infections. Moreover, multidrug-resistant infections can leave the hospital and become part of the community [[flora (microbiology)|flora]] if steps are not taken to stop this transmission.\n\nIt is unclear whether or not nail polish or rings affected surgical wound infection rates.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arrowsmith|first1=VA|last2=Taylor|first2=R|title=Removal of nail polish and finger rings to prevent surgical infection.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Aug 4, 2014|volume=|issue=8|pages=CD003325|pmid=25089848|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003325.pub3}}</ref>\n\n===Gloves===\nIn addition to hand washing, [[medical gloves|gloves]] play an important role in reducing the risks of transmission of microorganisms. Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of [[bloodborne pathogen]] infections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=16265&p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER |title=Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens;Needlestick and Other Sharps Injuries; Final Rule. - 66:5317-5325 |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref> Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms from a patient or a [[fomite]] can transmit those micro-organisms to another patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts, and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.\n\nWearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing due to the possibility of contamination when gloves are replaced, or by damage to the glove. Doctors wearing the same gloves for multiple patient operations presents an infection control hazard.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bacteria Can Persist on Gloves, Transfer to Surfaces|first=Neil|last=Osterweil|date=June 19, 2016|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/865048|work=[[Medscape]]}}</ref>\n\n===Surface sanitation===\nSanitizing surfaces is part of nosocomial infection in health care environments. Modern sanitizing methods such as [[NAV-CO2|Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems]] have been effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and influenza agents. Use of [[hydrogen peroxide]] vapor has been clinically proven to reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition.

droplets are generated from the source person mainly by coughing, sneezing, and talking, and during the performance of certain procedures, such as bronchoscopy. \n|-\n|[[Airborne transmission]]\n|Dissemination can be either airborne droplet nuclei (small-particle residue {5 [[micrometre|\u00b5m]] or smaller in size} of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time) or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host within the same room or over a longer distance from the source patient, depending on environmental factors; therefore, special air-handling and ventilation are required to prevent airborne transmission. Microorganisms transmitted by airborne transmission include ''[[Legionella]]'', ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and the [[rubeola]] and [[varicella]] viruses.\n|-\n|Common vehicle transmission\n|This applies to microorganisms transmitted to the host by contaminated items, such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment.\n|-\n|[[Vector (epidemiology)|Vector borne transmission]]\n|This occurs when vectors such as mosquitoes, flies, rats, and other vermin transmit microorganisms.\n|}\n\nContact transmission is divided into two subgroups: direct-contact transmission and indirect-contact transmission.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Routes of contact transmission\n!Route\n!Description\n|-\n|Direct-contact transmission\n|This involves a direct body surface-to-body surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible host and an infected or colonized person, such as when a person turns a patient, gives a patient a bath, or performs other [[health care|patient-care]] activities that require direct personal contact. Direct-contact transmission also can occur between two patients, with one serving as the source of the infectious microorganisms and the other as a susceptible host.\n|-\n|Indirect-contact transmission\n|This involves contact of a susceptible host with a contaminated intermediate object, usually inanimate, such as contaminated instruments, [[Hypodermic needle|needle]]s, or dressings, or contaminated gloves that are not changed between patients.

(See [[Universal precautions]] and [[Transmission-based precautions]].) Because agent and host factors are more difficult to control, interruption of transfer of microorganisms is directed primarily at transmission for example isolation of infectious cases in special hospitals and isolation of patient with infected wounds in special rooms also isolation of joint transplantation patients on specific rooms.\n\n===Handwashing===\n[[Handwashing]] frequently is called the single most important measure to reduce the risks of transmitting [[skin flora|skin microorganism]]s from one person to another or from one site to another on the same patient. Washing hands as promptly and thoroughly as possible between patient contacts and after contact with [[blood]], [[body fluid]]s, [[secretion]]s, [[excretion]]s, and equipment or articles contaminated by them is an important component of infection control and isolation precautions. \nThe spread of nosocomial infections, among immunocompromised patients is connected with health care workers' hand contamination in almost 40% of cases, and is a challenging problem in the modern hospitals. The best way for workers to overcome this problem is conducting correct hand-hygiene procedures; this is why the WHO launched in 2005 the GLOBAL Patient Safety Challenge.<ref>World Alliance for patient safety. WHO Guidelines on Hand Hygiene in Health Care. http://www.who.int/rpc/guidelines/9789241597906/en/. 2009</ref>\nTwo categories of micro-organisms can be present on health care workers' hands: transient flora and resident flora. The first is represented by the micro-organisms taken by workers from the environment, and the bacteria in it are capable of surviving on the human skin and sometimes to grow. The second group is represented by the permanent micro-organisms living on the skin surface (on the stratum corneum or immediately under it). They are capable of surviving on the human skin and to grow freely on it. They have low pathogenicity and infection rate, and they create a kind of protection from the colonization from other more pathogenic bacteria. The skin of workers is colonized by 3.9 x 10<sup>4</sup> \u2013 4.6 x 10<sup>6</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup>. The microbes comprising the resident flora are: ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'', ''S. hominis'', and ''Microccocus'', ''Propionibacterium, Corynebacterium, Dermobacterium'', and ''Pitosporum'' spp., while transient organisms are ''S. aureus'', and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', and ''Acinetobacter, Enterobacter'' and ''Candida'' spp. The goal of hand hygiene is to eliminate the transient flora with a careful and proper performance of hand washing, using different kinds of soap, (normal and antiseptic), and alcohol-based gels. The main problems found in the practice of hand hygiene is connected with the lack of available sinks and time-consuming performance of hand washing. An easy way to resolve this problem could be the use of alcohol-based hand rubs, because of faster application compared to correct hand-washing.<ref>Hugonnet S, Perneger TV, Pittet D. Alcohol based hand rub improves compliance with hand hygiene in intensive care units.

Patients who are bed-bound often do not have as much access to clean their hands at mealtimes or after touching surfaces or handling waste such as tissues.  By reinforcing the importance of handwashing and providing santizing gel or wipes within reach of the bed, nurses were directly able to reduce infection rates.  A study published in 2017 demonstrated this by improving patient education on both proper hand-washing procedure and important times to use sanitizer and successfully reduced the rate of enterococci and \"S. aureus\".<ref>{{cite journal|author=Haverstick, Stacy|author2=Goodrich, Cara|author3=Freeman, Regi|author4=James, Shandra|author5=Kullar, Rajkiran|author6=Ahrens, Melissa|date=June 2017|title=Patients' Hand Washing and Reducing Hospital-Acquired Infection|journal=Critical Care Nurse|volume=37|issue=3|pages=e1\u2013e8|url=http://ccn.aacnjournals.org/content/37/3/e1.abstract|doi=10.4037/ccn2017694|pmid=28572111}}</ref>\n\nAll visitors must follow the same procedures as hospital staff to adequately control the spread of infections.

Gloves are worn for three important reasons in hospitals. First, they are worn to provide a protective barrier for personnel, preventing large scale contamination of the hands when touching blood, body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and non-intact skin. In the United States, the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has mandated wearing gloves to reduce the risk of [[bloodborne pathogen]] infections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=16265&p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER |title=Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens;Needlestick and Other Sharps Injuries; Final Rule. - 66:5317-5325 |publisher=Osha.gov |accessdate=2011-07-11}}</ref> Second, gloves are worn to reduce the likelihood that microorganisms present on the hands of personnel will be transmitted to patients during invasive or other patient-care procedures that involve touching a patient's mucous membranes and nonintact skin. Third, they are worn to reduce the likelihood that the hands of personnel contaminated with micro-organisms from a patient or a [[fomite]] can transmit those micro-organisms to another patient. In this situation, gloves must be changed between patient contacts, and hands should be washed after gloves are removed.\n\nWearing gloves does not replace the need for handwashing due to the possibility of contamination when gloves are replaced, or by damage to the glove. Doctors wearing the same gloves for multiple patient operations presents an infection control hazard.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bacteria Can Persist on Gloves, Transfer to Surfaces|first=Neil|last=Osterweil|date=June 19, 2016|url=https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/865048|work=[[Medscape]]}}</ref>\n\n===Surface sanitation===\nSanitizing surfaces is part of nosocomial infection in health care environments. Modern sanitizing methods such as [[NAV-CO2|Non-flammable Alcohol Vapor in Carbon Dioxide systems]] have been effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and influenza agents.
