Representing the company's foray into the [[executive car]] scene, it was developed as a result of the successes of the turbocharged 99 and 900 models.<ref name=AG125>{{cite journal | ref = AG125 | journal = De AutoGids | number = 125 | volume = 5 | page = 21 | title = Saab 9000, de achtergronden | trans-title = Saab 9000, the background | first = Jean-Jacques | last = Renaux | language = nl-be | date = 5 July 1984 | publisher = Uitgeverij Auto-Magazine | location = Brussels, Belgium }}</ref> The 9000 remained in production until MY 1998 and it was replaced by the [[Saab 9-5]] in late 1997, although some final cars were produced into 1998. The Saab 9000 was only available with petrol engines and never as a convertible (except for one prototype).  Each car was sold at a loss of approximately $US 2000 due to the high quality of each component.\n\nSaab designed the 9000 as part of the [[Type Four platform]] in conjunction with the Italian automaker [[Fiat Automobiles]]. Fiat retailed similar derivative versions as the more basic [[Fiat Croma]], the luxury-themed [[Lancia Thema]], and the sports-oriented [[Alfa Romeo 164]]. Unlike the 164, which shares only the chassis, the Croma and Thema are outwardly similar to the 9000. As such, much of the bodywork appeared interchangeable between the 9000, Croma and Thema; for example, the doors. However, because Saab fitted heavier side impact protection they will not fit.<ref name=\"Lund (2009), p. 77.\">[[#Lund (2009)|Lund (2009)]], p. 77.</ref> Also the front of the Saab is radically different from the Italian siblings due to the much improved crash protection.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lund |first=Eric |date=20 December 2014 |url=http://www.gp.se/motor/1.2576401-sveriges-modernaste-bil-fyller-30?post_id=672138261_10152598564303262 |title=Sveriges modernaste bil fyller 30 |trans-title=Sweden's most modern car turns 30 |language=sv | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141220125846/http://www.gp.se/motor/1.2576401-sveriges-modernaste-bil-fyller-30?post_id=672138261_10152598564303262 | work=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]] |archivedate=20 December 2014}}</ref> Only seven parts are actually interchangeable.<ref name=\"Lund (2009), p. 77.\"/> The 9000's body was designed by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]] and Saab designer [[Bj\u00f6rn Envall]].\n\nDespite being shorter overall than the [[Saab 900|900]] which was still produced in parallel, the 9000 has a longer [[wheelbase]] and greater interior space with 123-cu.ft. of interior space (23.5-cu.ft. in the trunk, 56.5-cu.ft. with rear seats folded), qualifying as an [[EPA]]-rated \u201c[[Full-size car|large car]]\", a distinction shared only with the contemporary Rolls-Royce in America.<ref>https://www.hemmings.com/blog/article/saab-9000-aero/</ref> Unlike the [[Saab 900|900]], the 9000 kept the ignition switch in the more conventional steering column position rather than between the front seats.

This original model was a five-door [[liftback]], sharing much of its appearance and bodywork with the [[Type Four platform]] relatives\u2014the [[Fiat Croma]] and [[Lancia Thema]]. Drag resistance for the original model is C<sub>d</sub> 0.34, very competitive for the time.<ref name=AGp25>[[#AG125|Renaux]], p. 25</ref> For MY 1987 a modern ZF automatic with four stages became available (and remained the only available automatic version until the end of production), and the 9000 was rolled out in the most important market for Saab: the US. In 1987 for model year 1988, Saab released a sedan variant of the 9000 known as the CD. With the introduction of the CD, Saab took the opportunity to re-style the front-end for the sedan. This involved smoothing the edges of the headlamps and grille, and sloping the front outwards. Saab adapted the design of the sedan to the current facelift of the [[Saab 900]], which had already received a similar new front for the MY 1987. This re-design marked a departure from the more upright front styling of the 1984 original, which was also similar to the old design of the Saab 900 from 1978-1986. The fact that the older medium class model Saab 900 had received the facelift first seems curiously. The next facelift for the Saab 9000 was followed by the 1991 release of a partially redesigned five-door liftback for the 1992 model year, known as the CS. At the release of the CS, the original liftback variant was retrospectively designated CC to differentiate it from the newer version, which it continued to sell out of stock alongside in some markets as an entry-level model. \n\nThe Saab 9000 was awarded Best Prestige Car 1985 by the French magazine L\u2019Action Automobile.<ref>[http://teknikensvarld.se/historien-om-saab-9000-585777/ Teknikens V\u00e4rld: Historien om Saab 9000]</ref>\n\n[[Saab Direct Ignition]] was introduced 1988 with the 9000 CD and its B202 turbo engine. The same engine in the CC got the DI with MY 1989. Since then all new engine releases for the 9000 got the DI from beginning (except the later V6 which came from GM). For MY 1990 Saab introduced the new developed larger B234 2.3-litre engine, providing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in the normally aspirated engine. For MY 1991, the ''B234'' became available also with a turbocharger, producing {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and an impressive torque.\n\nFrom 1988, all 9000 variants were equipped with a [[Saab Information Display]] (SID) which showed fuel consumption, distance to an empty fuel tank, alternator output voltage, outside temperature, and lowest battery voltage during vehicle start.<ref>Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 3, pp 381-2 to 381-3.</ref> If the outside temperature fell to {{convert|-3|to|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, the temperature display is automatically selected to warn of possible \"black ice\" road conditions.

The Trionic system used resistor spark plugs to detect for engine knock in place of the knock sensors incorporated into the engine block in the previous [[Automatic Performance Control|APC]] system.\n\nFor MY 1993 the model range was revised to provide some uniformity to the model designations on all markets. They became CS/CSE and CD/CDE:\n\n- the CS / CD with basis equipment (which in principle already contained more equipment than the German competition in particular offered at the time)\n\n- the CSE / CDE came with already most available equipment from factory\n\nIn principle, both equipment lines could be combined with the engines available in the respective MY. This means that even a \"simple\" CS could be ordered with the 200 HP turbo engine. The face lifted CS models and furthermore \"old fashioned\" CD were available in MY 1992 in most countries with the same four engines which had also powered the former CC:\n- the old B202 with and without turbo\n- the B234 with and without turbo\nThis changed for MY 1993: in the US a new two-litre engine, the B204, with also two balance shafts (like in the B234) became available as light pressure turbo on both CS and CD giving 150hp. The background of the new B204 engine was that Saab needed a suitable engine for the upcoming [[Saab_900#Saab_900_NG_(1994-1998)|new Saab 902]]. Since Saab was always under high cost pressure, the new B204 and a forthcoming newly B234 engine were designed to fit both the new Saab 900/2 and the Saab 9000.\nSo worth paying attention to there were two generations of B234 engine, one made from 1990-1993 (called \"long block\"), the other from 1994 to 1998 (\"short block\"). The later motors had a revised oil sump system, head, timing cover, and different bell housing pattern.\n\nTherefore over the years three different engine types developed from Saab itself were available for the 9000: B202/B204/B234 (with the old B202 phased out on all markets for MY 1994). The B204 and B234 both came as non-turbos and turbo variants which additionally split in so called LPT (low pressure turbo, also named \"Ecopower\") and FPT (full pressure turbo). Both systems used the same [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] ''T25'' turbocharger with a base boost pressure of {{convert|0.4|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}}, but the full pressure turbo is equipped with a boost control valve that is manipulated by the ECU. This allows the boost pressure to be increased as the ECU sees fit. Maximum stock boost on a full pressure turbo varies from {{convert|0.7|to|1.02|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}} depending on the year and transmission.\n\nFor MY 1995 a 210hp three-litre V6, originating from General Motors and also found on the Opel (and Vauxhall) Omega, was introduced.\nFor MY 1996 the name \u201cEcopower\u201d was now applied to all turbo engines regardless of FPT or LPT variants. The 2.3 litre injection engine (without turbo) phased out.\n\nEnd of production:\nAs the CD and the Aero already expired after MY 1997, only 1400 of the Saab 9000 were produced for the last 1998 model year, and of these only 400 were exported to the United States, the main market for Saab. Saab already concentrated on the successor of the Saab 9000, the [[Saab 9-5]].\n\n\n=== 9000 CC (liftback) ===\nOriginally known simply as the 9000, the original liftback variant was later given the CC identifier, standing for \"combi coupe\", to differentiate it from the CD (\"Corps Diplomatique\") sedan and CS liftback. Saab also uses this different identifier for the Saab 900 versions. While originally equipped with an upright front design, this was replaced by the sloped version in MY 1990 that had earlier debuted on the 9000 CD (sedan) in 1988.\n\nThe original MY 1985 CC model (for this MY only available in Europe) was powered by an air-cooled, [[turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[double overhead camshaft]], 16-valve [[inline-four engine]], providing 175 bhp without and 160 bhp with catalysator.<ref>Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 0, p 022-1.</ref> Earlier on in the development, the [[PRV engine]] had also been considered.<ref name=\"klassikerrumpa\">{{cite web |first = Claes | last = Johansson |url=http://www.klassiker.nu/zino.aspx?articleID=11764 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222234734/http://www.klassiker.nu/zino.aspx?articleID=11764 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2013 |title= Saab utan svart rumpa | trans-title = Saab without the black behind | language = se | work = Klassiker.nu }}</ref> \nThe 9000 became available in the US for MY 1986, and since MY 1987 onwards the turbo-charger became water-cooled. <ref>http://saabmuseum.com/en/model-years/saab-9000-model-year-changes/</ref>\n\nAs with the Saab 900 CC, the Saab 9000 CC had some special series in some countries, such as the \"[https://www.voitures-collection-youngtimers.fr/saab-youngtimer/saab-9000-turbo-16-sp/ Saab 9000 turbo 16 SP]\" in France (SP stands for \"Sport and Performance\") with 185-204 hp with the B202 turbo engine, supplied by special control units and optimized fuel injection. In Germany and Switzerland there were also a special edition named \"Saab 9000 Turbo 16 S\", with an airflow kit and the B202 turbo with catalytic converter tuned up to 195hp (for MY 1990), and for MY 1991 and 1992 (also available as CD with the new 195hp B234 Turbo. But the most popular special series is the so called \"Talladega\" (Europe) or \"Carlsson\"(UK), both models available as CC and CD (sedan) versions. The \u201cCarlsson\u201d (models) takes its name from legendary Swedish rally ace Erik Carlsson, who secured numerous wins for Saab in the Sixties. In markets outside the UK, it was known as the Talladega in honour of the 19 endurance records set by three standard turbocharged 9000s at Talladega Speedway in the US in 1986. Since MY 1988 it was available both with and without catalytic converter. Saab had scared the power to 175 hp (160 original) in the catalytic converter engine and 192 hp (175) in non-cat. The pressure was around 1.0 bar. Furthermore, a new \"black box\" (APC) had been installed in the \"Talladegas\" which allows higher power.<ref>https://teknikensvarld.se/provkorning-av-saab-9000-talladega-169110/</ref> In the UK, however, it carried on the tradition of the Saab 900 Carlsson and took its moniker from Swedish rally legend Erik Carlsson.<ref>https://www.saabplanet.com/saab-9000-carlsson-performance-with-responsibility/</ref> 9000 Carlsson models were produced with a paint-matched airflow body kit, only with a manual transmission, spoiler, and specially tuned turbocharged engine producing 195 bhp (185 bhp with catalytic converter) with the B202 turbo in MY 1990 up to {{convert|225|bhp|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in MY 1991-92 with the B234 turbo.<ref>https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1991/41/the-motor-sport-road-test-saab-9000-carlsson</ref> The \"Carlsson\" was produced from MY 1990 to 1992 (changing from CC to CS design) with engine output up to 225 bhp and can be described as the precursor of the further Aero, which was introduced in MY 1993 with the CS design. A number of the Carlsson editions fitted with the ''B202'' turbocharged engine were sold into the Australian market. \nAll four series, the \"SP 16\" (France), \"Turbo 16 S\" (Germany, Switzerland), \"Talladega\" (Europe, US) and \"Carlsson\" are rare items sought today from Saab fans around the world. Unfortunately many of the few remaining specimens are often not in good condition.\n\n\n=== 9000 CD (sedan) ===\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1 = 1990 Saab 9000 CD non-turbo.jpg\n| image2 = 1990 Saab 9000 CD rear.jpg | caption2 = 1987\u20131994 Saab 9000 CD (US)\n| image3 = 1994-1997 Saab 9000 CD 2.3t sedan (2011-10-25) 02.jpg | caption3 = 1994\u20131997 Saab 9000 CD 2.3t sedan (Australia)\n}}\n\nThe Saab 9000 CD Sedan model was presented in Nice in January 1988. The CD was the four-door sedan body style with from beginning a slightly more aerodynamic nose which the CC get not until MY 1991. Just as in the launch of the CC variant, the 9000 CD was initially available only with the B202 turbo engine, but Saab combined it right from the start with its new \"DI ignition system\" (the CC B202 turbo got the DI system in MY 1989). At the [[Birmingham Motor Show]] in September 1988, Saab premiered the non-turbo model of the CD with the naturally aspirated 2.0-litre inline-four.<ref name = \"Saab 9000 Model Year Changes\"/>  For MY 1990 Saab introduced the {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.3-litre ''B234'' normally aspirated engine for both body shapes, the CC and CD. Since then the CD was available with the same basic engines as the CC for all MY (except the 225 PS \"Aero\" engine). The CD kept its old front and back till MY 1994, when Saab redesigned the CD for the first time since its start now wearing the front and back similar to the CS. The sedan ended production in 1997.\n\nFrom the beginning, Saab had placed the CD and later the CDE above the hatchback model in terms of equipment and price. This was in keeping with the spirit of the times, which saw an expensive notchback model more as a car for business people (with or without a chauffeur) who did not need the cargo space of the CC. \nThis is why Saab never offered the CD or CDE with a folding rear seat, which would have been at the expense of stability and peace and quiet in the interior. The CDE model was offered initially with only the {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} turbocharged engine.\n\nIn 1995, a 3.0-litre ''[[GM 54-Degree V6 engine|B308]]'' V6 engine with {{convert|210|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} was introduced as standard for the CDE sedan and optional for the CSE liftback. The V6 was discontinued in the United States after one year along with the CDE model, but continued on in Europe until 1997. In some European markets, the V6 engine was offered as a high-spec CDE '''Griffin''' model with numerous luxury appointments, such as an optional second air conditioning unit in the boot for the rear occupants and with all available electric options, special eucalyptus green paint, a separate rear-seat air conditioning system, walnut trim and rear window blinds.\n\n\n=== 9000 CS (liftback) ===\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1 = 2nd-Saab-9000.jpg | caption1 = 1991\u20131994 Saab 9000 CS (US)\n| image2 = 1993 Saab 9000 CS 2.3i hatchback (2015-07-09) 02.jpg | caption2 = 1991-1994 Saab 9000 CS (Australia)\n| image3 = 1996 Saab 9000 CS 2.3t hatchback (2015-05-29) 02.jpg | caption3 = 1994\u20131998 Saab 9000 CS (Australia)\n}}\n\nSaab presented an updated version of the liftback body variant in 1991 for the 1992 model year with the CS. This replaced the CC. Featuring a lowered front fascia with new headlights, grille and a substantially redesigned rear-end. \n[[Saab_H_engine#B204_&_B234|Here]] is an overview over the different versions of the different engine types used in the Saab 9000 CS Versions.  \n\n[[File:1997 Saab 9000 Aero 2.3 Turbo hatchback (2012-09-01) 01.jpg|thumb|1994\u20131998 Saab 9000 CS Aero (Australia)]]\n\nAfter the old B202 engine phased out after MY 1993, there were in summary 9 different engine versions for the CS available in the upcoming years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.swipnet.se/danny/9000engines.htm |publisher=Home.swipnet.se |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429213936/http://home.swipnet.se/danny/9000engines.htm |title=ModelGuide_9000_engines |archive-date=29 April 2008}}</ref> \nAfter the 1995 model year, the both naturally aspirated four-cylinder engines were discontinued in the United States. \n\nA limited edition Anniversary model was introduced 1997 to mark Saab's 50th anniversary, featuring leather seats embossed with the classic, aircraft-inspired Saab logo and a colour-keyed body kit. The engine typ was freely selectable from the available turbo engines of MY 1997 except the Aero engine with 225hp. The \"Anniversary\" could be ordered till the end of the 9000 production in 1998.

This setup removed the risk of body and facial injury in the event of an accident.

The Saab 9000 was only available with petrol engines and never as a convertible (except for one prototype).\n\nSaab designed the 9000 as part of the [[Type Four platform]] in conjunction with the Italian automaker [[Fiat Automobiles]]. Fiat retailed similar derivative versions as the more basic [[Fiat Croma]], the luxury-themed [[Lancia Thema]], and the sports-oriented [[Alfa Romeo 164]]. Unlike the 164, which shares only the chassis, the Croma and Thema are outwardly similar to the 9000. As such, much of the bodywork appeared interchangeable between the 9000, Croma and Thema; for example, the doors.

This original model was a five-door [[liftback]], sharing much of its appearance and bodywork with the [[Type Four platform]] relatives\u2014the [[Fiat Croma]] and [[Lancia Thema]]. Drag resistance for the original model is C<sub>d</sub> 0.34, very competitive for the time.<ref name=AGp25>[[#AG125|Renaux]], p. 25</ref> For MY 1987 a modern ZF automatic with four stages became available (and remained the only available automatic version until the end of production), and the 9000 was rolled out in the most important market for Saab: the US. In 1987 for model year 1988, Saab released a sedan variant of the 9000 known as the CD. With the introduction of the CD, Saab took the opportunity to re-style the front-end for the sedan. This involved smoothing the edges of the headlamps and grille, and sloping the front outwards. Saab adapted the design of the sedan to the current facelift of the [[Saab 900]], which had already received a similar new front for the MY 1987. This re-design marked a departure from the more upright front styling of the 1984 original, which was also similar to the old design of the Saab 900 from 1978-1986. The fact that the older medium class model Saab 900 had received the facelift first seems curiously. The next facelift for the Saab 9000 was followed by the 1991 release of a partially redesigned five-door liftback for the 1992 model year, known as the CS. At the release of the CS, the original liftback variant was retrospectively designated CC to differentiate it from the newer version, which it continued to sell out of stock alongside in some markets as an entry-level model. \n\nThe Saab 9000 was awarded Best Prestige Car 1985 by the French magazine L\u2019Action Automobile.<ref>[http://teknikensvarld.se/historien-om-saab-9000-585777/ Teknikens V\u00e4rld: Historien om Saab 9000]</ref>\n\n[[Saab Direct Ignition]] was introduced 1988 with the 9000 CD and its B202 turbo engine. The same engine in the CC got the DI with MY 1989. Since then all new engine releases for the 9000 got the DI from beginning (except the later V6 which came from GM). For MY 1990 Saab introduced the new developed larger B234 2.3-litre engine, providing {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} in the normally aspirated engine. For MY 1991, the ''B234'' became available also with a turbocharger, producing {{convert|195|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and an impressive torque.\n\nFrom 1988, all 9000 variants were equipped with a [[Saab Information Display]] (SID) which showed fuel consumption, distance to an empty fuel tank, alternator output voltage, outside temperature, and lowest battery voltage during vehicle start.<ref>Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 3, pp 381-2 to 381-3.</ref> If the outside temperature fell to {{convert|-3|to|3|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}, the temperature display is automatically selected to warn of possible \"black ice\" road conditions.

The Trionic system used resistor spark plugs to detect for engine knock in place of the knock sensors incorporated into the engine block in the previous [[Automatic Performance Control|APC]] system.\n\nFor MY 1993 the model range was revised to provide some uniformity to the model designations on all markets. They became CS/CSE and CD/CDE:\n\n- the CS / CD with basis equipment (which in principle already contained more equipment than the German competition in particular offered at the time)\n\n- the CSE / CDE came with already most available equipment from factory\n\nIn principle, both equipment lines could be combined with the engines available in the respective MY. This means that even a \"simple\" CS could be ordered with the 200 HP turbo engine. The face lifted CS models and furthermore \"old fashioned\" CD were available in MY 1992 in most countries with the same four engines which had also powered the former CC:\n- the old B202 with and without turbo\n- the B234 with and without turbo\nThis changed for MY 1993: in the US a new two-litre engine, the B204, with also two balance shafts (like in the B234) became available as light pressure turbo on both CS and CD giving 150hp. The background of the new B204 engine was that Saab needed a suitable engine for the upcoming [[Saab_900#Saab_900_NG_(1994-1998)|new Saab 902]]. Since Saab was always under high cost pressure, the new B204 and a forthcoming newly B234 engine were designed to fit both the new Saab 900/2 and the Saab 9000.\nSo worth paying attention to there were two generations of B234 engine, one made from 1990-1993 (called \"long block\"), the other from 1994 to 1998 (\"short block\"). The later motors had a revised oil sump system, head, timing cover, and different bell housing pattern.\n\nTherefore over the years three different engine types developed from Saab itself were available for the 9000: B202/B204/B234 (with the old B202 phased out on all markets for MY 1994). The B204 and B234 both came as non-turbos and turbo variants which additionally split in so called LPT (low pressure turbo, also named \"Ecopower\") and FPT (full pressure turbo). Both systems used the same [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] ''T25'' turbocharger with a base boost pressure of {{convert|0.4|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}}, but the full pressure turbo is equipped with a boost control valve that is manipulated by the ECU. This allows the boost pressure to be increased as the ECU sees fit. Maximum stock boost on a full pressure turbo varies from {{convert|0.7|to|1.02|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}} depending on the year and transmission.\n\nFor MY 1995 a 210hp three-litre V6, originating from General Motors and also found on the Opel (and Vauxhall) Omega, was introduced.\nFor MY 1996 the name \u201cEcopower\u201d was now applied to all turbo engines regardless of FPT or LPT variants. The 2.3 litre injection engine (without turbo) phased out.\n\nEnd of production:\nAs the CD and the Aero already expired after MY 1997, only 1400 of the Saab 9000 were produced for the last 1998 model year, and of these only 400 were exported to the United States, the main market for Saab. Saab already concentrated on the successor of the Saab 9000, the [[Saab 9-5]].\n\n\n=== 9000 CC (liftback) ===\nOriginally known simply as the 9000, the original liftback variant was later given the CC identifier, standing for \"combi coupe\", to differentiate it from the CD (\"Corps Diplomatique\") sedan and CS liftback. Saab also uses this different identifier for the Saab 900 versions. While originally equipped with an upright front design, this was replaced by the sloped version in MY 1990 that had earlier debuted on the 9000 CD (sedan) in 1988.\n\nThe original MY 1985 CC model (for this MY only available in Europe) was powered by an air-cooled, [[turbocharger|turbocharged]], [[double overhead camshaft]], 16-valve [[inline-four engine]], providing 175 bhp without and 160 bhp with catalysator.<ref>Saab 9000 Service manual, vol 0, p 022-1.</ref> Earlier on in the development, the [[PRV engine]] had also been considered.<ref name=\"klassikerrumpa\">{{cite web |first = Claes | last = Johansson |url=http://www.klassiker.nu/zino.aspx?articleID=11764 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130222234734/http://www.klassiker.nu/zino.aspx?articleID=11764 |url-status=dead |archive-date=22 February 2013 |title= Saab utan svart rumpa | trans-title = Saab without the black behind | language = se | work = Klassiker.nu }}</ref> \nThe 9000 became available in the US for MY 1986, and since MY 1987 onwards the turbo-charger became water-cooled. <ref>http://saabmuseum.com/en/model-years/saab-9000-model-year-changes/</ref>\n\nAs with the Saab 900 CC, the Saab 9000 CC had some special series in some countries, such as the \"[https://www.voitures-collection-youngtimers.fr/saab-youngtimer/saab-9000-turbo-16-sp/ Saab 9000 turbo 16 SP]\" in France (SP stands for \"Sport and Performance\") with 185-204 hp with the B202 turbo engine, supplied by special control units and optimized fuel injection. In Germany and Switzerland there were also a special edition named \"Saab 9000 Turbo 16 S\", with an airflow kit and the B202 turbo with catalytic converter tuned up to 195hp (for MY 1990), and for MY 1991 and 1992 (also available as CD with the new 195hp B234 Turbo. But the most popular special series is the so called \"Talladega\" (Europe) or \"Carlsson\"(UK), both models available as CC and CD (sedan) versions. The \u201cCarlsson\u201d (models) takes its name from legendary Swedish rally ace Erik Carlsson, who secured numerous wins for Saab in the Sixties. In markets outside the UK, it was known as the Talladega in honour of the 19 endurance records set by three standard turbocharged 9000s at Talladega Speedway in the US in 1986. Since MY 1988 it was available both with and without catalytic converter. Saab had scared the power to 175 hp (160 original) in the catalytic converter engine and 192 hp (175) in non-cat. The pressure was around 1.0 bar. Furthermore, a new \"black box\" (APC) had been installed in the \"Talladegas\" which allows higher power.<ref>https://teknikensvarld.se/provkorning-av-saab-9000-talladega-169110/</ref> In the UK, however, it carried on the tradition of the Saab 900 Carlsson and took its moniker from Swedish rally legend Erik Carlsson.<ref>https://www.saabplanet.com/saab-9000-carlsson-performance-with-responsibility/</ref> 9000 Carlsson models were produced with a paint-matched airflow body kit, only with a manual transmission, spoiler, and specially tuned turbocharged engine producing 195 bhp (185 bhp with catalytic converter) with the B202 turbo in MY 1990 up to {{convert|225|bhp|abbr=on|disp=flip}} in MY 1991-92 with the B234 turbo.<ref>https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1991/41/the-motor-sport-road-test-saab-9000-carlsson</ref> The \"Carlsson\" was produced from MY 1990 to 1992 (changing from CC to CS design) with engine output up to 225 bhp and can be described as the precursor of the further Aero, which was introduced in MY 1993 with the CS design. A number of the Carlsson editions fitted with the ''B202'' turbocharged engine were sold into the Australian market. \nAll four series, the \"SP 16\" (France), \"Turbo 16 S\" (Germany, Switzerland), \"Talladega\" (Europe, US) and \"Carlsson\" are rare items sought today from Saab fans around the world. Unfortunately many of the few remaining specimens are often not in good condition.\n\n\n=== 9000 CD (sedan) ===\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1 = 1990 Saab 9000 CD non-turbo.jpg\n| image2 = 1990 Saab 9000 CD rear.jpg | caption2 = 1987\u20131994 Saab 9000 CD (US)\n| image3 = 1994-1997 Saab 9000 CD 2.3t sedan (2011-10-25) 02.jpg | caption3 = 1994\u20131997 Saab 9000 CD 2.3t sedan (Australia)\n}}\n\nThe Saab 9000 CD Sedan model was presented in Nice in January 1988. The CD was the four-door sedan body style with from beginning a slightly more aerodynamic nose which the CC get not until MY 1991. Just as in the launch of the CC variant, the 9000 CD was initially available only with the B202 turbo engine, but Saab combined it right from the start with its new \"DI ignition system\" (the CC B202 turbo got the DI system in MY 1989). At the [[Birmingham Motor Show]] in September 1988, Saab premiered the non-turbo model of the CD with the naturally aspirated 2.0-litre inline-four.<ref name = \"Saab 9000 Model Year Changes\"/>  For MY 1990 Saab introduced the {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.3-litre ''B234'' normally aspirated engine for both body shapes, the CC and CD. Since then the CD was available with the same basic engines as the CC for all MY (except the 225 PS \"Aero\" engine). The CD kept its old front and back till MY 1994, when Saab redesigned the CD for the first time since its start now wearing the front and back similar to the CS. The sedan ended production in 1997.\n\nFrom the beginning, Saab had placed the CD and later the CDE above the hatchback model in terms of equipment and price. This was in keeping with the spirit of the times, which saw an expensive notchback model more as a car for business people (with or without a chauffeur) who did not need the cargo space of the CC. \nThis is why Saab never offered the CD or CDE with a folding rear seat, which would have been at the expense of stability and peace and quiet in the interior. The CDE model was offered initially with only the {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|disp=flip}} turbocharged engine.\n\nIn 1995, a 3.0-litre ''[[GM 54-Degree V6 engine|B308]]'' V6 engine with {{convert|210|PS|kW|0|abbr=on}} was introduced as standard for the CDE sedan and optional for the CSE liftback. The V6 was discontinued in the United States after one year along with the CDE model, but continued on in Europe until 1997. In some European markets, the V6 engine was offered as a high-spec CDE '''Griffin''' model with numerous luxury appointments, such as an optional second air conditioning unit in the boot for the rear occupants and with all available electric options, special eucalyptus green paint, a separate rear-seat air conditioning system, walnut trim and rear window blinds.\n\n\n=== 9000 CS (liftback) ===\n{{multiple image | align = left | direction = vertical | width = 200\n| image1 = 2nd-Saab-9000.jpg | caption1 = 1991\u20131994 Saab 9000 CS (US)\n| image2 = 1993 Saab 9000 CS 2.3i hatchback (2015-07-09) 02.jpg | caption2 = 1991-1994 Saab 9000 CS (Australia)\n| image3 = 1996 Saab 9000 CS 2.3t hatchback (2015-05-29) 02.jpg | caption3 = 1994\u20131998 Saab 9000 CS (Australia)\n}}\n\nSaab presented an updated version of the liftback body variant in 1991 for the 1992 model year with the CS. This replaced the CC. Featuring a lowered front fascia with new headlights, grille and a substantially redesigned rear-end. \n[[Saab_H_engine#B204_&_B234|Here]] is an overview over the different versions of the different engine types used in the Saab 9000 CS Versions.  \n\n[[File:1997 Saab 9000 Aero 2.3 Turbo hatchback (2012-09-01) 01.jpg|thumb|1994\u20131998 Saab 9000 CS Aero (Australia)]]\n\nAfter the old B202 engine phased out after MY 1993, there were in summary 9 different engine versions for the CS available in the upcoming years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://home.swipnet.se/danny/9000engines.htm |publisher=Home.swipnet.se |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429213936/http://home.swipnet.se/danny/9000engines.htm |title=ModelGuide_9000_engines |archive-date=29 April 2008}}</ref> \nAfter the 1995 model year, the both naturally aspirated four-cylinder engines were discontinued in the United States. \n\nA limited edition Anniversary model was introduced 1997 to mark Saab's 50th anniversary, featuring leather seats embossed with the classic, aircraft-inspired Saab logo and a colour-keyed body kit. The engine typ was freely selectable from the available turbo engines of MY 1997 except the Aero engine with 225hp. The \"Anniversary\" could be ordered till the end of the 9000 production in 1998. In the last MY 1998 the \"Anniversary\" could be also ordered with the 225hp engine. Today this model is sought after by aficionados.\n\nA special version of the CS is the so called Saab 9000 CS Aero:\nSaab revealed at the Paris Salon of October 1992 for MY 1993 the fastest Saab to date: the 9000 Aero. \nThe Aero was powered by a {{convert|225|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} version of Saab's 2.3-litre ''B234'' engine, with more power courtesy of a larger [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] ''TD04'' turbocharger. Automatic transmission-equipped Aeros were limited to {{convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and kept the regular turbocharged models' [[Garrett AiResearch]] T25 turbocharger.

It is situated with [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] to its south and [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] to its north, at the eastern end of [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]] and generally between Interstates [[Interstate 680 (California)|680]] and [[Interstate 880 (California)|880]] which run roughly north\u2013south through the city. With [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] bordering directly on the north, Milpitas sits in the extreme northeast section of the [[South Bay (San Francisco, California)|South Bay]], bordering the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] and [[Fremont, California|Fremont]]. Milpitas is also located within the [[Silicon Valley]]. The corporate headquarters of [[SonicWall]], [[Maxtor]], [[LSI Corporation]], [[Adaptec]], [[Intersil]], [[FireEye]], Viavi and Lumentum (formerly [[JDSU]]), [[KLA-Tencor]], and [[View, Inc.]] sit within the industrial zones of Milpitas. [[Flextronics|Flex]] and [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] also have offices in Milpitas. The population was 78,106 at the 2018 census.\n\n== History ==\nMilpitas was first inhabited by the [[Tamyen]] (also spelled ''Thomien, Tamien, Thamien'', or ''Tamiayn''), a linguistic subgroup of the Muwekma [[Ohlone]] people who had resided in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for thousands of years. The Ohlone Indians lived a traditional life based on everyday [[hunting]] and gathering. Some of the Ohlone lived in various villages within what is now Milpitas, including sites underneath what are now the Calvary Assembly of God Church and Higuera Adobe Park.<ref name=\"MarvinCunningham1990\">Marvin-Cunningham (1990)</ref> Archaeological evidence gathered from Ohlone graves at the Elmwood Correctional Facility in 1993 revealed a rich trade with other tribes from Sacramento to Monterey.\n\nDuring the Spanish expeditions of the late 18th century, several [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] were founded in the San Francisco Bay Area. During the mission period, Milpitas served as a crossroads between [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe]] in present-day [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] and [[Mission Santa Clara de Asis]] in present-day [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. The land of modern-day Milpitas was divided between the {{convert|6353|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Rincon de Los Esteros]] (Spanish for \"corner of the wetlands\") granted to Ygnacio Alviso; the {{convert|4457.8|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Milpitas]] (Spanish for \"little corn fields\") granted to [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alviso]]; and the {{convert|4394.35|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Los Tularcitos]] (Spanish for \"little tule marshes\") granted to Jos\u00e9 Higuera. Jose Maria Alviso was the son of Francisco Xavier Alviso and Maria Bojorquez, both of whom arrived in San Francisco as children with the [[de Anza Expedition]]. (A son of Ygnacio Alviso was also named Jose Maria Alviso, this has led to some confusion by researchers.)  Due to Jose Maria Alviso's descendants' difficulty securing his claims to the Rancho Milpitas property, portions of his land were either swindled from the Alviso family or were sold to American settlers to pay for legal fees.<ref>{{cite web|author=Editors of the Milpitas History Homepage |url=http://milpitashistory.org/home/ |title=The Milpitas History Homepage |website=Milpitashistory.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Jose Maria Alviso adobe 1920.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jose Maria Alviso Adobe]], c. 1920]]\nBoth landowners had built prominent [[adobe]] homes on their properties. Today, both adobes still exist and are the oldest structures in Milpitas. The seriously eroded walls of the Jose Higuera Adobe, now in Higuera Adobe Park, are encapsulated in a brick shell built c.1970 by Marian Weller, a descendant of pioneer Joseph Weller.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/higuera/higuera.html |title=Higuera Adobe |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jose Maria Alviso Adobe|Alviso Adobe]] can be seen mostly in its original form with one kitchen addition made by the Cuciz family after they purchased the adobe from the Gleason family in 1922. Prior to the city acquiring the Alviso Adobe in 1995, it was the oldest continuously occupied adobe house in California dating from the Mexican period and today is still gradually being restored and undergoing seismic upgrades by the City of Milpitas. Alviso Adobe History Park is to be opened, after the exterior restoration of the adobe and outbuildings is completed, as an educational museum with historic items, trees, buildings, and documents.\n\n[[Image:Milpitas view2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Monument Peak (Milpitas, California)|Monument Peak]] is the most visible landmark in Milpitas and has long been a symbol of Milpitas. (Click on the image for a detailed description.)]]\n\nIn the 1850s, large numbers of Americans of [[England|English]], [[Germany|German]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] descent arrived to farm the fertile lands of Milpitas. The Burnett, Rose, Dempsey, Jacklin, Trimble, Ayer, Parks, Wool, Weller, Minnis, and Evans families are among the early settlers of Milpitas.<ref name=\"Loomis1986\">Loomis (1986)</ref> (Today many schools, streets, and parks have been named in honor of these families.)  These early settlers farmed the land that was once the ranchos. Some set up businesses on what was then called Mission Road (now called Main Street) between Calaveras Road (now called Carlo Street) and the Alviso-Milpitas Road (now called Serra Way). By the late 20th century this area became known as the \"Midtown\" district. Yet another influx of immigration came in the 1870s and 1880s as Portuguese sharecroppers from the [[Azores]] came to farm the Milpitas hillsides. Many of the Azoreans had such locally well-known surnames as Coelho, Covo, Mattos, Nunes, Spangler, Serpa, and Silva.\n\nThere is a local legend that in 1857, when the U.S. Postal Service wanted to locate a Post Office in Frederick Creighton's store near the intersection of Mission Road and Alviso-Milpitas Road to serve the newly created Township, there was some support for naming it ''Penitencia,'' after the small Roman Catholic confessional building that had served local Indians and ranchers and had once stood several miles south of the village near Penitencia Creek which ran just west of the Mission Road. A local farmer and first Assistant Postmaster, Joseph Weller, felt the Spanish word ''Penitencia'' might be confused with the English word \"penitentiary.\" Instead of choosing ''Penitencia,'' he suggested another popular name for the area, ''Milpitas,'' after the name of Alviso's property, ''Rancho Milpitas''. Thus was born \"Milpitas Township.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://milpitashistory.org/weller/wellerpalm.html |title=Weller Palm |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\nFor over a century, Milpitas served as a popular rest stop for travelers on the old Oakland\u2212San Jose Highway. At the north side of the intersection of that road with the Milpitas-Alviso Road, for many years stood \"French's Hotel\" that had been originally built by Alex Anderson prior to 1859, when Alfred French bought it from Austin M. Thompson.<ref name=\"maple hall\">{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/maplehall/maplehall.html |title=Maple Hall |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> South of the site of French's Hotel, was a saloon dating from at least 1856 when Agustus Rathbone purchased the land and \"improvements\" from Richard Greenham. The first murder in Milpitas was committed in the early 1860s in \"Rathbone's Saloon\" (alas, the murderer escaped).  Later the saloon was replaced by a hotel that is shown on the 1893 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map as \"Goodwin's Hotel\" (perhaps the same Henry K. Goodwin who, in 1890, loaned money to prominent local rancher Marshall Pomeroy). Presumably, this hotel burned down and \"Smith's Corner,\" which still stands, was built in 1895, by John Smith, as a saloon that served beer and wine to thirsty travelers for a century before becoming a restaurant in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/smithscorner/smithscorners.html |title=Smith's Corners |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> Around this central core, grocery and dry goods stores, blacksmithies, service stations, and, in the 1920s, one of America's earliest \"fast food\" chain restaurants, \"The Fat Boy\", opened nearby. Another of Milpitas' most popular restaurants was the \"Kozy Kitchen\" established in 1940 by the Carlo family in the former \"Central Market\" building. Kozy Kitchen was demolished soon after Jimmy Carlo sold the restaurant in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/kozykitchen/kozykitchen.html |title=Kozy Kitchen |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> Even in the early 1950s,  Milpitas served a farming community of 800 people who walked a mere one or two blocks to work.\n\n[[File:2009-0723-CA-MilpitasLibrary.JPG|thumb|left|The new Milpitas Library (2009) integrates the historic [[Milpitas Grammar School]] building (1915).]]\n\nOn January 26, 1954, faced with getting swallowed up by a rapidly expanding San Jose, Milpitas residents [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city that included the recently built Ford Auto Assembly plant. When San Jose attempted to [[annexation|annex]] Milpitas barely seven years later, the \"Milpitas Minutemen\" were quickly organized to oppose annexation and keep Milpitas independent. An overwhelming majority of Milpitas registered voters voted \"No\" to annexation in the 1961 election as a result of a vigorous anti-annexation campaign. Following the election, the anti-annexation committee, who had compared themselves to the Revolutionary War Minutemen who fought the British on Lexington Green\u2014a role filled in this case by the neighboring city of San Jose - adopted the image of Daniel Chester French's Minuteman statue, that stands near the site of the Old North Bridge in Concord, MA, as part of the official city seal. In the 1960s, the city approved the construction of the Calaveras overpass. Formerly at a junction with the [[Union Pacific]] railroad, Calaveras Boulevard had a bridge passing over six sets of railroad tracks after the construction was completed. Though the result was that local residents could now drive over the train tracks without waiting for a slow freight to pass, it resulted in the loss of the historical residential area. Here houses owned by city leaders had to be purchased by the city at full market value and either moved or demolished.<ref name=\"Devincenzi2004\">Devincenzi (2004)</ref>\n\nStarting in 1955, with the construction of the Ford Motor Assembly Plant, and accelerating in the 1960s and 1970s, extensive residential and retail development took place. Hayfields in Milpitas rapidly disappeared as industries and residential housing developments spread. Soon, the once rural town of Milpitas found itself a [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] suburb. The population jumped from about 800 in 1950 to 62,698 in 2000. Several local farmers and businessmen who had chipped in from $2 to $50 to file for incorporation, had become millionaires within ten years. Most of them then moved away.<ref name=\"maple hall\"/>\n\nAccording to the book ''The Color of Law'' by Richard Rothstein (2017), when the Ford plant moved from Richmond to Milpitas in 1953, the town incorporated in order to pass laws that would exclude African American workers from residing there. \u201cUnion leaders met with Ford Executives and negotiated an agreement permitting all 1400 Richmond plant workers, including the approximately 250 African Americans, to transfer to the new facility. Once Ford\u2019s plans became known, Milpitas residents incorporated the town and passed an emergency ordinance permitting the newly installed city council to ban apartment construction and allow only single family homes. ... The Federal Housing Administration approved subdivision plans that met their specifications in Milpitas and guaranteed mortgages to qualified buyers....One of the specifications for mortgages insured in Milpitas (as in the rest of the country at that time) was an openly stated prohibition on sales to African Americans. Because Milpitas had no apartments, and houses in the area were off-limits to black workers-though their incomes and economic circumstances were like those of whites on the assembly line-African Americans had to choose between giving up the good industrial jobs, moving to apartments in a segregated neighborhood of San Jose, or enduring lengthy commutes between North Richmond and Milpitas.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America|first=Richard|last=Rothstein|publisher=[[W.

Gross, a civil rights activist, became Milpitas' first black city councilman with the backing of the UAW. This election was recognized nationally and received attention from Look and Life magazines. In 1966, Ben F. Gross became California's first black mayor when he was elected by the city's residents and \"the only black mayor of a predominantly white town in California\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/ben-gross-1921 |title=Ben Gross (1921- ) &#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> Mayor Gross was reelected in 1968 and continued fighting against Milpitas' annexation by San Jose.\n\nThe Ford [[San Jose Assembly Plant]] closed in 1984, later being converted into a shopping mall, known as [[The Great Mall of the Bay Area]], which opened in 1994.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the Milpitas [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|light rail transit system]] station was added, making it the northeasternmost light rail destination in the region. On January 26, 2004, the city celebrated the 50th anniversary of its incorporation and issued the book ''Milpitas: Five Dynamic Decades'' to commemorate 50 years of Milpitas' history as a busy, exciting crossroads community.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Milpitas'' is the [[plural]] [[diminutive]] of ''[[milpa]],'' Mexican Spanish for \"cornfield.\" The name means \"Place of little cornfields.\"<ref name=\"AnnZeise\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gomilpitas.com/historyMilpa.htm|title=How Milpitas Got Its Name|author=Ann Zeise|publisher=Ann Zeise:Go Mipitas!|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> The word ''milpa'' is derived from the [[Nahuatl]] words ''milli'', meaning \"agricultural field,\" and ''pan'', meaning \"on.\"\n\nThe name ''Milpitas'', perhaps used by Jose Maria Alviso to name his land grant, ''Rancho de las Milpitas'', may have meant that there had been small Native American gardens nearby because of the rich [[alluvial soil]]s of the area.<ref name=\"AnnZeise\"/>\n\nThe first deed of property sale in Milpitas is found in the Santa Clara County Records General Index 1850\u20131856 (K-143) and is dated February 14, 1856. It is Juana Galindo Alviso, widow of Jose Maria Alviso, to Michael and Ellen Hughes for 800 acres of land, today the Main Street area south of Carlo Street, although the deed gives the name of the Rancho as ''Rancho San Miguel'', rather than as ''Milpitas''.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[Image:Milpitas mtns2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The southeastern foothills of Milpitas]]\nMilpitas is located at {{Coord|37|26|5|N|121|53|42|W|type:city}} (37.434586, -121.895059).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Milpitas lies in the northeastern corner of the [[Santa Clara Valley]], which is south of [[San Francisco]]. Milpitas is generally considered to be a [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] suburb in the [[South Bay (San Francisco, California)|South Bay]], a term used to denote the southern part of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|35.3|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. {{convert|35.2|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of it is land and {{convert|0.13|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of it (0.36%) is water.\n\nThe median elevation of Milpitas is 19&nbsp;feet (6&nbsp;m). At [[Piedmont Road]], Evans Road, and North Park Victoria Avenue, the elevation is generally about 100&nbsp;feet (30&nbsp;m), while the western area is almost at [[sea level]]. The highest point in Milpitas is a 1,289-foot (393 m) peak in the southeastern foothills.\n\nTo the east of Milpitas is a range of high foothills and mountains, part of the Diablo Range which runs along the east side of San Francisco Bay. [[Monument Peak (Milpitas, California)|Monument Peak]], the most prominent summit in the eastern Milpitas hills, is one of the oldest and most well-known symbols of Milpitas. It currently has a broadcasting antenna which serves television stations [[KICU-TV|KICU]] and [[KQEH]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n\nAlthough not within Milpitas city limits, Monument Peak, [[Calaveras Reservoir]], [[Arroyo Hondo (Santa Clara County, California)|Arroyo Hondo]], Laguna Valley, and the surrounding region are culturally and historically considered part of Milpitas. ''(Loomis, Patricia - Milpitas: A Century of Little Cornfields)'' Many Portuguese farmers from the [[Azores]] have settled there, including the Coelho, Covo, Mattos, Serpa, and Silva families. They are often nicknamed by longtime Milpitans as the \"hill people.\" These Azorean families still own the undeveloped lands in the Milpitas foothills, such as the Silvas living on Old Calaveras Road.<ref name=\"MarvinCunningham1990\" /> The southeasternmost hills belong to the City of Milpitas, which then leases the lands to [[cattle]] livestock companies.\n\nThere are also many creeks in Milpitas, most of which are part of the [[Berryessa Creek]] [[drainage basin|watershed]]. [[Calera Creek]], [[Arroyo de los Coches]], [[Penitencia Creek]] and [[Piedmont Creek]] are some of the creeks that flow from the Milpitas hills and empty into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. (''See'' [[Berryessa Creek]])\n\n=== Urban layout ===\n[[Image:Milpitas kristin ridge way.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Large, newly built homes on Kristinridge Way in Milpitas, located south of the Parktown development and adjacent to Hillcrest]]\nMilpitas is divided into three sections by Interstates [[Interstate 680 (California)|680]] and [[Interstate 880 (California)|880]]. To the west of I-880 is a largely industrial and commercial area. Between I-880 and its eastern counterpart freeway, I-680, is an industrial zone in the south and residential neighborhoods in the north. Other residential neighborhoods and undeveloped mountains lie east of I-680.\n\nIn reality, Milpitas has no concentrated downtown \"center,\" but instead has several small retail centers generally located near residential developments and anchored by a supermarket. The so-called \"Midtown\" area, the oldest part of Milpitas, has few remaining historic residences and was the only commercial district that existed before 1945. Midtown is situated in the region where Main and Abel Streets run parallel to each other bordered by Montague Expressway in the south and Weller Street at the north end. A [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] post office, Saint John the Baptist Catholic Church, Elementary & Junior High Catholic School, the [[Santa Clara County Library|Milpitas Public Library]] (which incorporates the old Milpitas Grammar School building), the Smith/DeVries mansion, the Senior Center, and Elmwood Correctional Facility are all in the Midtown section of Milpitas. The Milpitas Civic Center, which includes City Hall, is not located in Midtown, but stands at the intersection of Milpitas and [[Calaveras Boulevard]]s. The Civic Center is separated from Midtown by the Calaveras overpass. The boundaries that divide major Milpitas neighborhoods and districts include [[Calaveras Road|Calaveras Boulevard]] running from east to west and the [[Union Pacific]] railroad, which runs from north to south. The newest retail centers are west of Interstate 880. There are several predominantly Asian retail centers with store signs written in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[Image:MtHamilton wb.jpeg|thumb|250px|Typical oak savannah landscape. Photo of [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], a peak southeast of Milpitas.]]\n\n{{See also|San Jose, California#Climate|l1=Climate of San Jose, California}}\n\nSet within a warm [[Mediterranean]] [[climate]] zone in [[Santa Clara County]], Milpitas enjoys warm, sunny weather with few extreme temperatures. Rainfall is confined mostly to the winter months. During winter, temperatures are relatively cold at an average of 41&nbsp;\u00b0F to 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (-0.5C to 15C). Showers and cloudy days come and go during this season dropping most of the city's annual {{convert|15|in|mm}} of precipitation, and as spring approaches, the gentle rains gradually dwindle. In summer, the grasslands on the hillsides dehydrate rapidly and form bright, golden sheets on the mountains set off by stands of oak. Summer is dry and warm but not hot like in other parts the Bay Area. Temperatures infrequently reach over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) with most days in the low 80s to the mid 80s. From June to September, Milpitas experiences little rain, and as autumn approaches, the weather gradually cools down. Many temperate-climate trees drop their leaves during fall in the South Bay but the winter temperature is warm enough for evergreens like palm trees to thrive.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Milpitas, California\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  79\n|Feb record high F =  81\n|Mar record high F =  89\n|Apr record high F =  95\n|May record high F = 101\n|Jun record high F = 109\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 105\n|Sep record high F = 108\n|Oct record high F = 101\n|Nov record high F =  85\n|Dec record high F =  79\n|year record high F =109\n|Jan high F = 58\n|Feb high F = 63\n|Mar high F = 68\n|Apr high F = 72\n|May high F = 76\n|Jun high F = 82\n|Jul high F = 84\n|Aug high F = 84\n|Sep high F = 82\n|Oct high F = 74\n|Nov high F = 65\n|Dec high F = 58\n|year high F =\n|Jan low F = 41\n|Feb low F = 44\n|Mar low F = 46\n|Apr low F = 48\n|May low F = 53\n|Jun low F = 56\n|Jul low F = 58\n|Aug low F = 58\n|Sep low F = 56\n|Oct low F = 50\n|Nov low F = 45\n|Dec low F = 40\n|year low F =\n|Jan record low F = 24\n|Feb record low F = 26\n|Mar record low F = 30\n|Apr record low F = 35\n|May record low F = 37\n|Jun record low F = 42\n|Jul record low F = 47\n|Aug record low F = 47\n|Sep record low F = 42\n|Oct record low F = 36\n|Nov record low F = 21\n|Dec record low F = 19\n|year record low F =19\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.03\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.84\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.69\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.02\n|May precipitation inch = 0.44\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.10\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.06\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.07\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.23\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.87\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.73\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.00\n|year precipitation inch=15.08\n|source 1 = <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USCA0706|title= weather.com|publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2010 }}</ref>\n|date=September 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 6572\n|1970= 26561\n|1980= 37820\n|1990= 50686\n|2000= 62698\n|2010= 66790\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=80430\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0647766|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Milpitas city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Milpitas had a population of 66,790.

Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m\u00b2) size sells for between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable than the rest of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as a similar sized house may cost well over a million dollars in more affluent cities such as [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]] or [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]]. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]'s housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline in the housing market, however, median sales prices in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.\n\n=== 2014 ===\nIn 2014, [[Money Magazine]] ranked Milpitas 29th out of 50 for the best places in the US to live.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://time.com/money/3312340/milpitas-ca-best-places-to-live/|title = 50 Best Places to Live|date = |accessdate = January 10, 2014|website = 50 Best Places to Live|publisher = Money Magazine|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Law and government ==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Milpitas, California}}\n\n===City government===\nThe city is headed by five-member city council consisting of a [[mayor]], a vice mayor, and three councilmembers.

Samuel Ayer High School (now the Milpitas Sports Center, Teen Center, Calaveras Hills HS., and Adult Education Center) on [[Calaveras Road]] was built as the only high school located in the city. In the late 1960s MUSD was formed and included Ayer High which had previously been part of East Side Union High School District. In the 1970s, [[Milpitas High School]] was built on Escuela Parkway and, due to declining enrollment, Samuel Ayer High School closed. Currently Milpitas High is one of the biggest high schools in the county, with approximately 3000 students. The continuation school, Calaveras Hills High School is one of the best schools for \"at risk\" students in the state.

Dominant among these are overcrowded schools, lack of adequate open parkland, traffic congestion, and air quality. Seekers of public offices typically face stiff competition at election time.\n\n=== Pollution ===\nMilpitas occasionally experiences odorous air traveling downwind from bay [[salt marsh]]es, from the [[Newby Island landfill]], from the anaerobic digestion facility at Zero Waste Energy Development Company, and from the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] [[sewage treatment]] plant's percolation ponds. Most malodorous during the autumn, it is especially pungent west of [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] because of its close location to the [[San Francisco Bay]] and the direction of the prevailing winds out of the north-northwest. The City of Milpitas would like to remedy this air quality problem to the extent it can and encourages its residents to file odor complaints.<ref name=\"Kathleen Phalen\">[http://www.ci.milpitas.ca.gov/_pdfs/council/2011/011811/item_08.pdf Report to the Mayor and City Council  on  Odor Control in Milpitas] January 18, 2011, by: Kathleen Phalen, Utility Engineer</ref>\n\nLocal creeks and the nearby San Francisco Bay suffer somewhat from water pollution originating from street water [[surface runoff|runoff]] and industrial wastes. The creeks in Milpitas, especially [[Calera Creek|Calera]], Scott, and [[Berryessa Creek]]s, used to be prime fishing spots for native [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] until pollutants from urban development and industry killed the fish starting in the 1950s. While small populations of steelhead and even salmon still may be seen in area streams these cannot legally be fished and consumption of legal catches is limited by [[Mercury content in fish|mercury contamination]].\n\nThe I-880 corridor has experienced relatively elevated levels of air pollution from freeway traffic. For example, eight-hour standards for [[carbon monoxide]] have been near to maximum levels for the last two decades.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau, Ballard George et al., ''Environmental Assessment of the I880/Dixon Landing Road Interchange Improvement Project, Cities of Fremont and Milpitas'', Earth Metrics Incorporated, Federal Highway Administration Publication, March 1989</ref>\n\n=== Controversy ===\n\n==== Hillside Open Space Initiative ====\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Milpitas voters enacted measures to protect the west-facing hillsides east of the city from development.\n\n== Culture and recreation ==\n[[Image:Milpitas Civic Center.jpg|thumb|The future new Milpitas Senior Center (formerly Milpitas Public Library) is to the right of Milpitas City Hall, and Milpitas Community Center is on the left edge of the panorama.]]\n\nMilpitas residents enjoy various visual and performing arts. The Milpitas Alliance for the Arts, founded in 1997, is an organization which promotes and funds [[mural]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[sculpture]]s, and many other forms of art. The \"Art in Your Park\" project has put many sculptures in local Milpitas parks, including a ceramic tower in Hillcrest Park, a sundial in Augustine Park, and a historical memorial in Murphy Park. The Celebrate Milpitas Festival is held annually every August, featuring vendors of crafts-type merchandise and providing local talent with a performance venue while selling visitors samplings of exotics like garlic fries or lumpia and even offerings from one or two Californian wineries. The suburb offers a rich variety of food options, including sit-down restaurants and fast food.\n\nThe city has many athletic and educational recreational programs which are located in several city buildings, including the city's sports center, teen center, library, community center, and senior center.\n\n===Shopping Super Centers===\nMilpitas is home to the largest Bay Area enclosed shopping mall (in terms of land area), the [[Great Mall of the Bay Area]]. The Great Mall is a part of the Simon mall branch and is the biggest mall/outlet shopping center in northern California. There are approximately 200 stores within the mall, with a total of {{convert|1357000|sqft|m2}} of retail area.\n\nA large outdoor shopping center called [[Milpitas Square]] is anchored by the [[99 Ranch Market]] west of Interstate 880. Another shopping center in Milpitas is The Seasons Marketplace anchored by [[Seafood City]]. Other Milpitas [[shopping center]]s and [[plaza]]s include Ulferts Center, Milpitas Town Center, Jacklin Square, McCarthy Ranch, Parktown Plaza, Beresford Square, and the City Square.\n\nIn the past, Milpitas had a very different culture from that of its modern suburban state. As late as the 1950s, Milpitas was an unincorporated rural town with the Midtown district on Main Street as its main center of business and social activities. Many old businesses include Main Street Gas (operated by the [[Azores|Azorean]] Spangler brothers), Smith's Corner Saloon, and Kozy Kitchen. The Cracolice Building was one of the oldest commercial buildings in Milpitas and was the site of many political conventions and meetings. \"As Milpitas Goes, So Goes the State\" used to be a popular slogan around the town. Most of the land now within modern-day Milpitas' boundaries was used for [[strawberry]], [[asparagus]], [[apricot]], and [[potato]] cultivation until the postwar boom during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n=== Parks ===\n[[Image:Ed levin park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ed R. Levin County Park]] is nestled in the foothills of Milpitas.]]\n[[Ed R. Levin County Park]] is the largest county regional park near Milpitas. The [[Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation Department|County of Santa Clara Parks and Recreation Department]] runs the park. Monument Peak can be accessed through trails that lead north through the county park. The park also provides facilities for [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]] and includes a newly built [[dog park]] that was a joint effort by the county and the city of Milpitas. Two golf courses, Spring Valley Golf Course and Summitpointe Golf Course, are located in the Milpitas foothills. Both have expensive gated residential developments located adjacent to them.\nMilpitas itself has 17 traditional neighborhood parks which are generally 3 to 10 [[acre]]s (12,000 to 40,000 m\u00b2). There also is a sports complex with two swimming pools and sports parks with baseball and tennis play areas fenced off. There are also smaller parks of less than {{convert|3|acre|m2}} scattered in newer developments. Milpitas has begun to develop the San Francisco Water District's Hetch Hetchy right-of-way as park land in lieu of using land from new high density residential developments adjacent to it. Together, these parks total {{convert|166|acre|m2}} of land area or less than 2% of the city's acreage.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Road Network ===\nFrom north to south, the major east\u2013west roads in Milpitas are Dixon Landing Road, Jacklin Road, [[Calaveras Boulevard]], and Landess Avenue/Montague Expressway. From east to west, the major north\u2013south roads are Piedmont Road, Evans Road, Park Victoria Drive, Milpitas Boulevard, Main Street, Abel Street, and McCarthy Boulevard. Milpitas roads that reach into the hills are, from north to south, Country Club Drive, Old Calaveras Road, Calaveras Road, and a private ranch drive, the historic Urridias Ranch Road.\n\nAs with many other Californian suburbs, Milpitas has divided roads that are maintained well by the local city government. Street signs are in green. Like the San Jose public works system, all pedestrians must manually press a button in order to turn the pedestrian signal lights on (unlike the South Bay cities, [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] has automatic pedestrian lights at intersections and does not have \"press to cross\" buttons for pedestrians).\n\nNot all streets in Milpitas have bicycle lanes or sidewalks. It has a walk score of 48.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.walkscore.com/CA/Milpitas |website=WalkScore|title=Milpitas neighborhoods on Walk Score}}</ref> Piedmont Road, Evans Road, and Jacklin Road have excellent bike lanes and sidewalks with ample spacing, but Montague Expressway and South Milpitas Boulevard have limited sidewalks and narrow bike lanes, which causes some problems for workers commuting by bike or on foot.\n\n[[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]] and [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] lead north to Fremont and south to downtown San Jose. [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]] begins at Milpitas and goes west to [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] and [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]].\n\n=== Public Transportation ===\n\nThe [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA) runs [[light rail]] and local buses for public transportation. Three light rail stations lie within city limits: [[Montague (VTA)|Montague]], [[Great Mall/Main Transit Center|Great Mall/Main]], and [[I-880/Milpitas (VTA)|I-880/Milpitas]], all on the [[Alum Rock \u2013 Santa Teresa (VTA)|Alum Rock \u2013 Santa Teresa light rail line]]. VTA bus routes in Milpitas are 46, 47, 66, 70, 71, 77.<ref name=\"vta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vta.org/|title=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMilpitas does not currently have any [[commuter rail]] service. However, VTA runs timed connecting shuttles to the [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train's [[Santa Clara \u2013 Great America Station]], meeting the four daily trains in the morning for workers commuting to Milpitas.\n\nAs part of its [[Silicon Valley BART extension]], BART will begin serving the newly constructed [[Milpitas (BART station)|Milpitas BART station]] in 2019.\n\nThe nearest major airport to the city is the [[Norman Y. Mineta]] [[San Jose International Airport]] (SJC), less than ten minutes away in San Jos\u00e9. The city is also served by the general aviation [[Reid\u2013Hillview Airport]] in [[East San Jose]].\n\nMilpitas borders salt ponds on the [[San Francisco Bay]] in the extreme northwest, but has no boat access.  Alviso, a neighborhood in San Jos\u00e9 and formerly a neighboring city, has a marina and boat launch that allows motorized and non-motorized boats access to the bay.\n\n[[China Airlines]] formerly operated a bus service to [[San Francisco International Airport]] for flights to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050524234430/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/promotionen/promotionen000006.htm]</ref>\n\n=== Communications ===\nLike most other Bay Area cities, [[United States Postal Service|USPS]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[FedEx Corporation|FedEx]], and [[DHL]] are readily available to Milpitas. The USPS post office on Abel Street is Milpitas' main office for postal mail and is the only USPS post office in the city. [[ZIP code]] 95035 is exclusively for Milpitas and is the only standard ZIP code for the city. 95036 is a new ZIP that is used sometimes for [[post office box]]es in Milpitas. Until the merge with [[SBC Communications|SBC]], Milpitas had relied on [[Pacific Bell]] for its telecommunications services. American Telegraph and Telephone (AT&T) acquired Southern Bell (SBC) in 2006 and became the land-line telephone provider in the city. As part of the agreement for the merger of AT&T with SBC, Milpitas residents were offered high speed DSL internet access with AT&T for only $10 per month until December 2009, although few residents were aware of the offer.\n\nOn [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2009, the public-private partnership [[Silicon Valley Unwired]] announced the implementation of a free municipal [[WiFi]] wireless network for the entire city. After the [[Google WiFi]] network in Mountain View, it is the second municipal wireless network, providing free Internet access.\n\n== Films featuring Milpitas ==\n\nThe ''[[Milpitas Monster]]'' was filmed in the town in 1976. Originally started as a high school project, it developed into a feature-length film. In the quiet town of Milpitas, California, a gigantic creature is spawned in a [[pollution|polluted]], overflowing [[Landfill|waste disposal]] site. The townspeople rally to destroy the creature, which has an uncontrollable desire to consume large quantities of garbage cans.\n\nThe movie ''[[River's Edge]]'' was inspired by the true story of a murder that happened in  Milpitas in 1981. It is a story about a teenage boy who murders a classmate and shows off the body to his friends. The names and races of the individuals involved were changed. The story was \"Hollywood-ized\" for dramatic purposes. The filmmakers added stories that did not occur and characters who did not exist. It starred some relatively unknown actors at the time, including [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Crispin Glover]] and [[Ione Skye]], as well as veteran actor [[Dennis Hopper]]. The movie was inspired by the [[murder of Marcy Renee Conrad]] who was killed by a fellow teen named Anthony Broussard. He later dumped her body in a ditch in the east foothills of Milpitas.\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Newspapers ===\n* ''[[Milpitas Post]]''\n* ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''\n* ''[[East Bay Express]]''\n* ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''\n* ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''\n* ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''\n* ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]''\n* ''Wave Magazine''\n* ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''\n* ''[[SF Weekly]]''\n* ''[[Singtao Daily]]'' San Francisco edition\n* ''[[World Journal]]'' San Francisco edition\n* ''Kanzhongguo Times''\n\n=== Radio ===\n'''Country''':\n\n* [[KRTY]], 95.3 -

It is situated with [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] to its south and [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] to its north, at the eastern end of [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]] and generally between Interstates [[Interstate 680 (California)|680]] and [[Interstate 880 (California)|880]] which run roughly north\u2013south through the city. With [[Alameda County, California|Alameda County]] bordering directly on the north, Milpitas sits in the extreme northeast section of the [[South Bay (San Francisco, California)|South Bay]], bordering the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] and [[Fremont, California|Fremont]]. Milpitas is also located within the [[Silicon Valley]]. The corporate headquarters of [[SonicWall]], [[Maxtor]], [[LSI Corporation]], [[Adaptec]], [[Intersil]], [[FireEye]], Viavi and Lumentum (formerly [[JDSU]]), [[KLA-Tencor]], and [[View, Inc.]] sit within the industrial zones of Milpitas. [[Flextronics|Flex]] and [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] also have offices in Milpitas. The population was 78,106 at the 2018 census.\n\n== History ==\nMilpitas was first inhabited by the [[Tamyen]] (also spelled ''Thomien, Tamien, Thamien'', or ''Tamiayn''), a linguistic subgroup of the Muwekma [[Ohlone]] people who had resided in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] for thousands of years. The Ohlone Indians lived a traditional life based on everyday [[hunting]] and gathering. Some of the Ohlone lived in various villages within what is now Milpitas, including sites underneath what are now the Calvary Assembly of God Church and Higuera Adobe Park.<ref name=\"MarvinCunningham1990\">Marvin-Cunningham (1990)</ref> Archaeological evidence gathered from Ohlone graves at the Elmwood Correctional Facility in 1993 revealed a rich trade with other tribes from Sacramento to Monterey.\n\nDuring the Spanish expeditions of the late 18th century, several [[Spanish Missions of California|missions]] were founded in the San Francisco Bay Area. During the mission period, Milpitas served as a crossroads between [[Mission San Jos\u00e9 de Guadalupe]] in present-day [[Fremont, California|Fremont]] and [[Mission Santa Clara de Asis]] in present-day [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]]. The land of modern-day Milpitas was divided between the {{convert|6353|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Rincon de Los Esteros]] (Spanish for \"corner of the wetlands\") granted to Ygnacio Alviso; the {{convert|4457.8|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Milpitas]] (Spanish for \"little corn fields\") granted to [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Alviso]]; and the {{convert|4394.35|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Rancho Los Tularcitos]] (Spanish for \"little tule marshes\") granted to Jos\u00e9 Higuera. Jose Maria Alviso was the son of Francisco Xavier Alviso and Maria Bojorquez, both of whom arrived in San Francisco as children with the [[de Anza Expedition]]. (A son of Ygnacio Alviso was also named Jose Maria Alviso, this has led to some confusion by researchers.)  Due to Jose Maria Alviso's descendants' difficulty securing his claims to the Rancho Milpitas property, portions of his land were either swindled from the Alviso family or were sold to American settlers to pay for legal fees.<ref>{{cite web|author=Editors of the Milpitas History Homepage |url=http://milpitashistory.org/home/ |title=The Milpitas History Homepage |website=Milpitashistory.org |date= |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Jose Maria Alviso adobe 1920.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jose Maria Alviso Adobe]], c. 1920]]\nBoth landowners had built prominent [[adobe]] homes on their properties. Today, both adobes still exist and are the oldest structures in Milpitas. The seriously eroded walls of the Jose Higuera Adobe, now in Higuera Adobe Park, are encapsulated in a brick shell built c.1970 by Marian Weller, a descendant of pioneer Joseph Weller.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/higuera/higuera.html |title=Higuera Adobe |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Jose Maria Alviso Adobe|Alviso Adobe]] can be seen mostly in its original form with one kitchen addition made by the Cuciz family after they purchased the adobe from the Gleason family in 1922. Prior to the city acquiring the Alviso Adobe in 1995, it was the oldest continuously occupied adobe house in California dating from the Mexican period and today is still gradually being restored and undergoing seismic upgrades by the City of Milpitas. Alviso Adobe History Park is to be opened, after the exterior restoration of the adobe and outbuildings is completed, as an educational museum with historic items, trees, buildings, and documents.\n\n[[Image:Milpitas view2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Monument Peak (Milpitas, California)|Monument Peak]] is the most visible landmark in Milpitas and has long been a symbol of Milpitas. (Click on the image for a detailed description.)]]\n\nIn the 1850s, large numbers of Americans of [[England|English]], [[Germany|German]], and [[Ireland|Irish]] descent arrived to farm the fertile lands of Milpitas. The Burnett, Rose, Dempsey, Jacklin, Trimble, Ayer, Parks, Wool, Weller, Minnis, and Evans families are among the early settlers of Milpitas.<ref name=\"Loomis1986\">Loomis (1986)</ref> (Today many schools, streets, and parks have been named in honor of these families.)  These early settlers farmed the land that was once the ranchos. Some set up businesses on what was then called Mission Road (now called Main Street) between Calaveras Road (now called Carlo Street) and the Alviso-Milpitas Road (now called Serra Way). By the late 20th century this area became known as the \"Midtown\" district. Yet another influx of immigration came in the 1870s and 1880s as Portuguese sharecroppers from the [[Azores]] came to farm the Milpitas hillsides. Many of the Azoreans had such locally well-known surnames as Coelho, Covo, Mattos, Nunes, Spangler, Serpa, and Silva.\n\nThere is a local legend that in 1857, when the U.S. Postal Service wanted to locate a Post Office in Frederick Creighton's store near the intersection of Mission Road and Alviso-Milpitas Road to serve the newly created Township, there was some support for naming it ''Penitencia,'' after the small Roman Catholic confessional building that had served local Indians and ranchers and had once stood several miles south of the village near Penitencia Creek which ran just west of the Mission Road. A local farmer and first Assistant Postmaster, Joseph Weller, felt the Spanish word ''Penitencia'' might be confused with the English word \"penitentiary.\" Instead of choosing ''Penitencia,'' he suggested another popular name for the area, ''Milpitas,'' after the name of Alviso's property, ''Rancho Milpitas''. Thus was born \"Milpitas Township.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://milpitashistory.org/weller/wellerpalm.html |title=Weller Palm |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref>\n\nFor over a century, Milpitas served as a popular rest stop for travelers on the old Oakland\u2212San Jose Highway. At the north side of the intersection of that road with the Milpitas-Alviso Road, for many years stood \"French's Hotel\" that had been originally built by Alex Anderson prior to 1859, when Alfred French bought it from Austin M. Thompson.<ref name=\"maple hall\">{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/maplehall/maplehall.html |title=Maple Hall |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> South of the site of French's Hotel, was a saloon dating from at least 1856 when Agustus Rathbone purchased the land and \"improvements\" from Richard Greenham. The first murder in Milpitas was committed in the early 1860s in \"Rathbone's Saloon\" (alas, the murderer escaped).  Later the saloon was replaced by a hotel that is shown on the 1893 Sanborn Fire Insurance Map as \"Goodwin's Hotel\" (perhaps the same Henry K. Goodwin who, in 1890, loaned money to prominent local rancher Marshall Pomeroy). Presumably, this hotel burned down and \"Smith's Corner,\" which still stands, was built in 1895, by John Smith, as a saloon that served beer and wine to thirsty travelers for a century before becoming a restaurant in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/smithscorner/smithscorners.html |title=Smith's Corners |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> Around this central core, grocery and dry goods stores, blacksmithies, service stations, and, in the 1920s, one of America's earliest \"fast food\" chain restaurants, \"The Fat Boy\", opened nearby. Another of Milpitas' most popular restaurants was the \"Kozy Kitchen\" established in 1940 by the Carlo family in the former \"Central Market\" building. Kozy Kitchen was demolished soon after Jimmy Carlo sold the restaurant in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Munzel |url=http://www.milpitashistory.org/kozykitchen/kozykitchen.html |title=Kozy Kitchen |website=Milpitashistory.org |date=2003-01-24 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> Even in the early 1950s,  Milpitas served a farming community of 800 people who walked a mere one or two blocks to work.\n\n[[File:2009-0723-CA-MilpitasLibrary.JPG|thumb|left|The new Milpitas Library (2009) integrates the historic [[Milpitas Grammar School]] building (1915).]]\n\nOn January 26, 1954, faced with getting swallowed up by a rapidly expanding San Jose, Milpitas residents [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a city that included the recently built Ford Auto Assembly plant. When San Jose attempted to [[annexation|annex]] Milpitas barely seven years later, the \"Milpitas Minutemen\" were quickly organized to oppose annexation and keep Milpitas independent. An overwhelming majority of Milpitas registered voters voted \"No\" to annexation in the 1961 election as a result of a vigorous anti-annexation campaign. Following the election, the anti-annexation committee, who had compared themselves to the Revolutionary War Minutemen who fought the British on Lexington Green\u2014a role filled in this case by the neighboring city of San Jose - adopted the image of Daniel Chester French's Minuteman statue, that stands near the site of the Old North Bridge in Concord, MA, as part of the official city seal. In the 1960s, the city approved the construction of the Calaveras overpass. Formerly at a junction with the [[Union Pacific]] railroad, Calaveras Boulevard had a bridge passing over six sets of railroad tracks after the construction was completed. Though the result was that local residents could now drive over the train tracks without waiting for a slow freight to pass, it resulted in the loss of the historical residential area. Here houses owned by city leaders had to be purchased by the city at full market value and either moved or demolished.<ref name=\"Devincenzi2004\">Devincenzi (2004)</ref>\n\nStarting in 1955, with the construction of the Ford Motor Assembly Plant, and accelerating in the 1960s and 1970s, extensive residential and retail development took place. Hayfields in Milpitas rapidly disappeared as industries and residential housing developments spread. Soon, the once rural town of Milpitas found itself a [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] suburb. The population jumped from about 800 in 1950 to 62,698 in 2000. Several local farmers and businessmen who had chipped in from $2 to $50 to file for incorporation, had become millionaires within ten years. Most of them then moved away.<ref name=\"maple hall\"/>\n\nAccording to the book ''The Color of Law'' by Richard Rothstein (2017), when the Ford plant moved from Richmond to Milpitas in 1953, the town incorporated in order to pass laws that would exclude African American workers from residing there. \u201cUnion leaders met with Ford Executives and negotiated an agreement permitting all 1400 Richmond plant workers, including the approximately 250 African Americans, to transfer to the new facility. Once Ford\u2019s plans became known, Milpitas residents incorporated the town and passed an emergency ordinance permitting the newly installed city council to ban apartment construction and allow only single family homes. ... The Federal Housing Administration approved subdivision plans that met their specifications in Milpitas and guaranteed mortgages to qualified buyers....One of the specifications for mortgages insured in Milpitas (as in the rest of the country at that time) was an openly stated prohibition on sales to African Americans. Because Milpitas had no apartments, and houses in the area were off-limits to black workers-though their incomes and economic circumstances were like those of whites on the assembly line-African Americans had to choose between giving up the good industrial jobs, moving to apartments in a segregated neighborhood of San Jose, or enduring lengthy commutes between North Richmond and Milpitas.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Color of Law: A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America|first=Richard|last=Rothstein|publisher=[[W.

Gross, a civil rights activist, became Milpitas' first black city councilman with the backing of the UAW. This election was recognized nationally and received attention from Look and Life magazines. In 1966, Ben F. Gross became California's first black mayor when he was elected by the city's residents and \"the only black mayor of a predominantly white town in California\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/?q=aaw/ben-gross-1921 |title=Ben Gross (1921- ) &#124; The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed |publisher=The Black Past |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2017-01-11}}</ref> Mayor Gross was reelected in 1968 and continued fighting against Milpitas' annexation by San Jose.\n\nThe Ford [[San Jose Assembly Plant]] closed in 1984, later being converted into a shopping mall, known as [[The Great Mall of the Bay Area]], which opened in 1994.\n\nIn the early 21st century, the Milpitas [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|light rail transit system]] station was added, making it the northeasternmost light rail destination in the region. On January 26, 2004, the city celebrated the 50th anniversary of its incorporation and issued the book ''Milpitas: Five Dynamic Decades'' to commemorate 50 years of Milpitas' history as a busy, exciting crossroads community.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Milpitas'' is the [[plural]] [[diminutive]] of ''[[milpa]],'' Mexican Spanish for \"cornfield.\" The name means \"Place of little cornfields.\"<ref name=\"AnnZeise\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gomilpitas.com/historyMilpa.htm|title=How Milpitas Got Its Name|author=Ann Zeise|publisher=Ann Zeise:Go Mipitas!|accessdate=January 4, 2014}}</ref> The word ''milpa'' is derived from the [[Nahuatl]] words ''milli'', meaning \"agricultural field,\" and ''pan'', meaning \"on.\"\n\nThe name ''Milpitas'', perhaps used by Jose Maria Alviso to name his land grant, ''Rancho de las Milpitas'', may have meant that there had been small Native American gardens nearby because of the rich [[alluvial soil]]s of the area.<ref name=\"AnnZeise\"/>\n\nThe first deed of property sale in Milpitas is found in the Santa Clara County Records General Index 1850\u20131856 (K-143) and is dated February 14, 1856. It is Juana Galindo Alviso, widow of Jose Maria Alviso, to Michael and Ellen Hughes for 800 acres of land, today the Main Street area south of Carlo Street, although the deed gives the name of the Rancho as ''Rancho San Miguel'', rather than as ''Milpitas''.\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[Image:Milpitas mtns2.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The southeastern foothills of Milpitas]]\nMilpitas is located at {{Coord|37|26|5|N|121|53|42|W|type:city}} (37.434586, -121.895059).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Milpitas lies in the northeastern corner of the [[Santa Clara Valley]], which is south of [[San Francisco]]. Milpitas is generally considered to be a [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] suburb in the [[South Bay (San Francisco, California)|South Bay]], a term used to denote the southern part of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|35.3|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}}. {{convert|35.2|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of it is land and {{convert|0.13|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}} of it (0.36%) is water.\n\nThe median elevation of Milpitas is 19&nbsp;feet (6&nbsp;m). At [[Piedmont Road]], Evans Road, and North Park Victoria Avenue, the elevation is generally about 100&nbsp;feet (30&nbsp;m), while the western area is almost at [[sea level]]. The highest point in Milpitas is a 1,289-foot (393 m) peak in the southeastern foothills.\n\nTo the east of Milpitas is a range of high foothills and mountains, part of the Diablo Range which runs along the east side of San Francisco Bay. [[Monument Peak (Milpitas, California)|Monument Peak]], the most prominent summit in the eastern Milpitas hills, is one of the oldest and most well-known symbols of Milpitas. It currently has a broadcasting antenna which serves television stations [[KICU-TV|KICU]] and [[KQEH]] to the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n\nAlthough not within Milpitas city limits, Monument Peak, [[Calaveras Reservoir]], [[Arroyo Hondo (Santa Clara County, California)|Arroyo Hondo]], Laguna Valley, and the surrounding region are culturally and historically considered part of Milpitas. ''(Loomis, Patricia - Milpitas: A Century of Little Cornfields)'' Many Portuguese farmers from the [[Azores]] have settled there, including the Coelho, Covo, Mattos, Serpa, and Silva families. They are often nicknamed by longtime Milpitans as the \"hill people.\" These Azorean families still own the undeveloped lands in the Milpitas foothills, such as the Silvas living on Old Calaveras Road.<ref name=\"MarvinCunningham1990\" /> The southeasternmost hills belong to the City of Milpitas, which then leases the lands to [[cattle]] livestock companies.\n\nThere are also many creeks in Milpitas, most of which are part of the [[Berryessa Creek]] [[drainage basin|watershed]]. [[Calera Creek]], [[Arroyo de los Coches]], [[Penitencia Creek]] and [[Piedmont Creek]] are some of the creeks that flow from the Milpitas hills and empty into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. (''See'' [[Berryessa Creek]])\n\n=== Urban layout ===\n[[Image:Milpitas kristin ridge way.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Large, newly built homes on Kristinridge Way in Milpitas, located south of the Parktown development and adjacent to Hillcrest]]\nMilpitas is divided into three sections by Interstates [[Interstate 680 (California)|680]] and [[Interstate 880 (California)|880]]. To the west of I-880 is a largely industrial and commercial area. Between I-880 and its eastern counterpart freeway, I-680, is an industrial zone in the south and residential neighborhoods in the north. Other residential neighborhoods and undeveloped mountains lie east of I-680.\n\nIn reality, Milpitas has no concentrated downtown \"center,\" but instead has several small retail centers generally located near residential developments and anchored by a supermarket. The so-called \"Midtown\" area, the oldest part of Milpitas, has few remaining historic residences and was the only commercial district that existed before 1945. Midtown is situated in the region where Main and Abel Streets run parallel to each other bordered by Montague Expressway in the south and Weller Street at the north end. A [[United States Postal Service|USPS]] post office, Saint John the Baptist Catholic Church, Elementary & Junior High Catholic School, the [[Santa Clara County Library|Milpitas Public Library]] (which incorporates the old Milpitas Grammar School building), the Smith/DeVries mansion, the Senior Center, and Elmwood Correctional Facility are all in the Midtown section of Milpitas. The Milpitas Civic Center, which includes City Hall, is not located in Midtown, but stands at the intersection of Milpitas and [[Calaveras Boulevard]]s. The Civic Center is separated from Midtown by the Calaveras overpass. The boundaries that divide major Milpitas neighborhoods and districts include [[Calaveras Road|Calaveras Boulevard]] running from east to west and the [[Union Pacific]] railroad, which runs from north to south. The newest retail centers are west of Interstate 880. There are several predominantly Asian retail centers with store signs written in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean.\n\n=== Climate ===\n[[Image:MtHamilton wb.jpeg|thumb|250px|Typical oak savannah landscape. Photo of [[Mount Hamilton (California)|Mount Hamilton]], a peak southeast of Milpitas.]]\n\n{{See also|San Jose, California#Climate|l1=Climate of San Jose, California}}\n\nSet within a warm [[Mediterranean]] [[climate]] zone in [[Santa Clara County]], Milpitas enjoys warm, sunny weather with few extreme temperatures. Rainfall is confined mostly to the winter months. During winter, temperatures are relatively cold at an average of 41&nbsp;\u00b0F to 59&nbsp;\u00b0F (-0.5C to 15C). Showers and cloudy days come and go during this season dropping most of the city's annual {{convert|15|in|mm}} of precipitation, and as spring approaches, the gentle rains gradually dwindle. In summer, the grasslands on the hillsides dehydrate rapidly and form bright, golden sheets on the mountains set off by stands of oak. Summer is dry and warm but not hot like in other parts the Bay Area. Temperatures infrequently reach over 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (38&nbsp;\u00b0C) with most days in the low 80s to the mid 80s. From June to September, Milpitas experiences little rain, and as autumn approaches, the weather gradually cools down. Many temperate-climate trees drop their leaves during fall in the South Bay but the winter temperature is warm enough for evergreens like palm trees to thrive.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Milpitas, California\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  79\n|Feb record high F =  81\n|Mar record high F =  89\n|Apr record high F =  95\n|May record high F = 101\n|Jun record high F = 109\n|Jul record high F = 108\n|Aug record high F = 105\n|Sep record high F = 108\n|Oct record high F = 101\n|Nov record high F =  85\n|Dec record high F =  79\n|year record high F =109\n|Jan high F = 58\n|Feb high F = 63\n|Mar high F = 68\n|Apr high F = 72\n|May high F = 76\n|Jun high F = 82\n|Jul high F = 84\n|Aug high F = 84\n|Sep high F = 82\n|Oct high F = 74\n|Nov high F = 65\n|Dec high F = 58\n|year high F =\n|Jan low F = 41\n|Feb low F = 44\n|Mar low F = 46\n|Apr low F = 48\n|May low F = 53\n|Jun low F = 56\n|Jul low F = 58\n|Aug low F = 58\n|Sep low F = 56\n|Oct low F = 50\n|Nov low F = 45\n|Dec low F = 40\n|year low F =\n|Jan record low F = 24\n|Feb record low F = 26\n|Mar record low F = 30\n|Apr record low F = 35\n|May record low F = 37\n|Jun record low F = 42\n|Jul record low F = 47\n|Aug record low F = 47\n|Sep record low F = 42\n|Oct record low F = 36\n|Nov record low F = 21\n|Dec record low F = 19\n|year record low F =19\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.03\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.84\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.69\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.02\n|May precipitation inch = 0.44\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.10\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.06\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.07\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.23\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.87\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.73\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.00\n|year precipitation inch=15.08\n|source 1 = <ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USCA0706|title= weather.com|publisher= |accessdate=September 14, 2010 }}</ref>\n|date=September 2010\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 6572\n|1970= 26561\n|1980= 37820\n|1990= 50686\n|2000= 62698\n|2010= 66790\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=80430\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=July 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010===\nThe [[2010 United States Census]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php?fl=06:0647766|title=2010 Census Interactive Population Search: CA - Milpitas city|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|accessdate=July 12, 2014}}</ref> reported that Milpitas had a population of 66,790.

Compared to other South Bay bedroom communities Milpitas is considered affordable. For example, a regular one-story, detached single-family home with a 1,300-square-foot (140 m\u00b2) size sells for between $600,000 to $700,000 in the city. These prices are slightly more affordable than the rest of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], as a similar sized house may cost well over a million dollars in more affluent cities such as [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino]] or [[Saratoga, California|Saratoga]]. Reasons for the expensive housing in the South Bay Area include the regional high tech industries, mild climate, strong foreign investment in the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]]'s housing, and a huge demand for limited homes. With the decline in the housing market, however, median sales prices in Milpitas have declined from nearly $700,000 to less than $500,000, and single-family new house construction building permits have plummeted from a 2004 average price of $949,900 to $269,400 in 2007.\n\n=== 2014 ===\nIn 2014, [[Money Magazine]] ranked Milpitas 29th out of 50 for the best places in the USA to live.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://time.com/money/3312340/milpitas-ca-best-places-to-live/|title = 50 Best Places to Live|date = |accessdate = January 10, 2014|website = 50 Best Places to Live|publisher = Money Magazine|last = |first = }}</ref>\n\n== Law and government ==\n{{See also|List of mayors of Milpitas, California}}\n\n===City government===\nThe city is headed by five-member city council consisting of a [[mayor]], a vice mayor, and three councilmembers.

Samuel Ayer High School (now the Milpitas Sports Center, Teen Center, Calaveras Hills HS., and Adult Education Center) on [[Calaveras Road]] was built as the only high school located in the city. In the late 1960s MUSD was formed and included Ayer High which had previously been part of East Side Union High School District. In the 1970s, [[Milpitas High School]] was built on Escuela Parkway and, due to declining enrollment, Samuel Ayer High School closed. Currently Milpitas High is one of the biggest high schools in the county, with approximately 3000 students. The continuation school, Calaveras Hills High School is one of the best schools for \"at risk\" students in the state.

Dominant among these are overcrowded schools, lack of adequate open parkland, traffic congestion, and air quality. Seekers of public offices typically face stiff competition at election time.\n\n=== Pollution ===\nMilpitas occasionally experiences odorous air traveling downwind from bay [[salt marsh]]es, from the [[Newby Island landfill]], from the anaerobic digestion facility at Zero Waste Energy Development Company, and from the [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] [[sewage treatment]] plant's percolation ponds. Most malodorous during the autumn, it is especially pungent west of [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] because of its close location to the [[San Francisco Bay]] and the direction of the prevailing winds out of the north-northwest. The City of Milpitas would like to remedy this air quality problem to the extent it can and encourages its residents to file odor complaints.<ref name=\"Kathleen Phalen\">[http://www.ci.milpitas.ca.gov/_pdfs/council/2011/011811/item_08.pdf Report to the Mayor and City Council  on  Odor Control in Milpitas] January 18, 2011, by: Kathleen Phalen, Utility Engineer</ref>\n\nLocal creeks and the nearby San Francisco Bay suffer somewhat from water pollution originating from street water [[surface runoff|runoff]] and industrial wastes. The creeks in Milpitas, especially [[Calera Creek|Calera]], Scott, and [[Berryessa Creek]]s, used to be prime fishing spots for native [[Rainbow trout|steelhead]] until pollutants from urban development and industry killed the fish starting in the 1950s. While small populations of steelhead and even salmon still may be seen in area streams these cannot legally be fished and consumption of legal catches is limited by [[Mercury content in fish|mercury contamination]].\n\nThe I-880 corridor has experienced relatively elevated levels of air pollution from freeway traffic. For example, eight-hour standards for [[carbon monoxide]] have been near to maximum levels for the last two decades.<ref>C. Michael Hogan, Marc Papineau, Ballard George et al., ''Environmental Assessment of the I880/Dixon Landing Road Interchange Improvement Project, Cities of Fremont and Milpitas'', Earth Metrics Incorporated, Federal Highway Administration Publication, March 1989</ref>\n\n=== Controversy ===\n\n==== Hillside Open Space Initiative ====\n\nIn the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Milpitas voters enacted measures to protect the west-facing hillsides east of the city from development.\n\n== Culture and recreation ==\n[[Image:Milpitas Civic Center.jpg|thumb|The future new Milpitas Senior Center (formerly Milpitas Public Library) is to the right of Milpitas City Hall, and Milpitas Community Center is on the left edge of the panorama.]]\n\nMilpitas residents enjoy various visual and performing arts. The Milpitas Alliance for the Arts, founded in 1997, is an organization which promotes and funds [[mural]]s, [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[sculpture]]s, and many other forms of art. The \"Art in Your Park\" project has put many sculptures in local Milpitas parks, including a ceramic tower in Hillcrest Park, a sundial in Augustine Park, and a historical memorial in Murphy Park. The Celebrate Milpitas Festival is held annually every August, featuring vendors of crafts-type merchandise and providing local talent with a performance venue while selling visitors samplings of exotics like garlic fries or lumpia and even offerings from one or two Californian wineries. The suburb offers a rich variety of food options, including sit-down restaurants and fast food.\n\nThe city has many athletic and educational recreational programs which are located in several city buildings, including the city's sports center, teen center, library, community center, and senior center.\n\n===Shopping Super Centers===\nMilpitas is home to the largest Bay Area enclosed shopping mall (in terms of land area), the [[Great Mall of the Bay Area]]. The Great Mall is a part of the Simon mall branch and is the biggest mall/outlet shopping center in northern California. There are approximately 200 stores within the mall, with a total of {{convert|1357000|sqft|m2}} of retail area.\n\nA large outdoor shopping center called [[Milpitas Square]] is anchored by the [[99 Ranch Market]] west of Interstate 880. Another shopping center in Milpitas is The Seasons Marketplace anchored by [[Seafood City]]. Other Milpitas [[shopping center]]s and [[plaza]]s include Ulferts Center, Milpitas Town Center, Jacklin Square, McCarthy Ranch, Parktown Plaza, Beresford Square, and the City Square.\n\nIn the past, Milpitas had a very different culture from that of its modern suburban state. As late as the 1950s, Milpitas was an unincorporated rural town with the Midtown district on Main Street as its main center of business and social activities. Many old businesses include Main Street Gas (operated by the [[Azores|Azorean]] Spangler brothers), Smith's Corner Saloon, and Kozy Kitchen. The Cracolice Building was one of the oldest commercial buildings in Milpitas and was the site of many political conventions and meetings. \"As Milpitas Goes, So Goes the State\" used to be a popular slogan around the town. Most of the land now within modern-day Milpitas' boundaries was used for [[strawberry]], [[asparagus]], [[apricot]], and [[potato]] cultivation until the postwar boom during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\n=== Parks ===\n[[Image:Ed levin park.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ed R. Levin County Park]] is nestled in the foothills of Milpitas.]]\n[[Ed R. Levin County Park]] is the largest county regional park near Milpitas. The [[Santa Clara County Parks and Recreation Department|County of Santa Clara Parks and Recreation Department]] runs the park. Monument Peak can be accessed through trails that lead north through the county park. The park also provides facilities for [[hang gliding]] and [[paragliding]] and includes a newly built [[dog park]] that was a joint effort by the county and the city of Milpitas. Two golf courses, Spring Valley Golf Course and Summitpointe Golf Course, are located in the Milpitas foothills. Both have expensive gated residential developments located adjacent to them.\nMilpitas itself has 17 traditional neighborhood parks which are generally 3 to 10 [[acre]]s (12,000 to 40,000 m\u00b2). There also is a sports complex with two swimming pools and sports parks with baseball and tennis play areas fenced off. There are also smaller parks of less than {{convert|3|acre|m2}} scattered in newer developments. Milpitas has begun to develop the San Francisco Water District's Hetch Hetchy right-of-way as park land in lieu of using land from new high density residential developments adjacent to it. Together, these parks total {{convert|166|acre|m2}} of land area or less than 2% of the city's acreage.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Road Network ===\nFrom north to south, the major east-west roads in Milpitas are Dixon Landing Road, Jacklin Road, [[Calaveras Boulevard]], and Landess Avenue/Montague Expressway. From east to west, the major north-south roads are Piedmont Road, Evans Road, Park Victoria Drive, Milpitas Boulevard, Main Street, Abel Street, and McCarthy Boulevard. Milpitas roads that reach into the hills are, from north to south, Country Club Drive, Old Calaveras Road, Calaveras Road, and a private ranch drive, the historic Urridias Ranch Road.\n\nAs with many other Californian suburbs, Milpitas has divided roads that are maintained well by the local city government. Street signs are in green. Like the San Jose public works system, all pedestrians must manually press a button in order to turn the pedestrian signal lights on (unlike the South Bay cities, [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] has automatic pedestrian lights at intersections and does not have \"press to cross\" buttons for pedestrians).\n\nNot all streets in Milpitas have bicycle lanes or sidewalks. It has a walk score of 48.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.walkscore.com/CA/Milpitas |website=WalkScore|title=Milpitas neighborhoods on Walk Score}}</ref> Piedmont Road, Evans Road, and Jacklin Road have excellent bike lanes and sidewalks with ample spacing, but Montague Expressway and South Milpitas Boulevard have limited sidewalks and narrow bike lanes, which causes some problems for workers commuting by bike or on foot.\n\n[[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]] and [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]] lead north to Fremont and south to downtown San Jose. [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]] begins at Milpitas and goes west to [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]] and [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]].\n\n=== Public Transportation ===\n\nThe [[Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority]] (VTA) runs [[light rail]] and local buses for public transportation. Three light rail stations lie within city limits: [[Montague (VTA)|Montague]], [[Great Mall/Main Transit Center|Great Mall/Main]], and [[I-880/Milpitas (VTA)|I-880/Milpitas]], all on the [[Alum Rock \u2013 Santa Teresa (VTA)|Alum Rock \u2013 Santa Teresa light rail line]]. VTA bus routes in Milpitas are 46, 47, 66, 70, 71, 77.<ref name=\"vta\">{{cite web|url=http://www.vta.org/|title=Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMilpitas does not currently have any [[commuter rail]] service. However, VTA runs timed connecting shuttles to the [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train's [[Santa Clara \u2013 Great America Station]], meeting the four daily trains in the morning for workers commuting to Milpitas.\n\nAs part of its [[Silicon Valley BART extension]], BART will begin serving the newly constructed [[Milpitas (BART station)|Milpitas BART station]] in 2019.\n\nThe nearest major airport to the city is the [[Norman Y. Mineta]] [[San Jose International Airport]] (SJC), less than ten minutes away in San Jos\u00e9. The city is also served by the general aviation [[Reid\u2013Hillview Airport]] in [[East San Jose]].\n\nMilpitas borders salt ponds on the [[San Francisco Bay]] in the extreme northwest, but has no boat access.  Alviso, a neighborhood in San Jos\u00e9 and formerly a neighboring city, has a marina and boat launch that allows motorized and non-motorized boats access to the bay.\n\n[[China Airlines]] formerly operated a bus service to [[San Francisco International Airport]] for flights to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20050524234430/http://www.china-airlines.com/en/promotionen/promotionen000006.htm]</ref>\n\n=== Communications ===\nLike most other Bay Area cities, [[United States Postal Service|USPS]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[FedEx Corporation|FedEx]], and [[DHL]] are readily available to Milpitas. The USPS post office on Abel Street is Milpitas' main office for postal mail and is the only USPS post office in the city. [[ZIP code]] 95035 is exclusively for Milpitas and is the only standard ZIP code for the city. 95036 is a new ZIP that is used sometimes for [[post office box]]es in Milpitas. Until the merge with [[SBC Communications|SBC]], Milpitas had relied on [[Pacific Bell]] for its telecommunications services. American Telegraph and Telephone (AT&T) acquired Southern Bell (SBC) in 2006 and became the land-line telephone provider in the city. As part of the agreement for the merger of AT&T with SBC, Milpitas residents were offered high speed DSL internet access with AT&T for only $10 per month until December 2009, although few residents were aware of the offer.\n\nOn [[Earth Day]], April 22, 2009, the public-private partnership [[Silicon Valley Unwired]] announced the implementation of a free municipal [[WiFi]] wireless network for the entire city. After the [[Google WiFi]] network in Mountain View, it is the second municipal wireless network, providing free Internet access.\n\n== Films featuring Milpitas ==\n\nThe ''[[Milpitas Monster]]'' was filmed in the town in 1976. Originally started as a high school project, it developed into a feature-length film. In the quiet town of Milpitas, California, a gigantic creature is spawned in a [[pollution|polluted]], overflowing [[Landfill|waste disposal]] site. The townspeople rally to destroy the creature, which has an uncontrollable desire to consume large quantities of garbage cans.\n\nThe movie ''[[River's Edge]]'' was inspired by the true story of a murder that happened in  Milpitas in 1981. It is a story about a teenage boy who murders a classmate and shows off the body to his friends. The names and races of the individuals involved were changed. The story was \"Hollywood-ized\" for dramatic purposes. The filmmakers added stories that did not occur and characters who did not exist. It starred some relatively unknown actors at the time, including [[Keanu Reeves]], [[Crispin Glover]] and [[Ione Skye]], as well as veteran actor [[Dennis Hopper]]. The movie was inspired by the [[murder of Marcy Renee Conrad]] who was killed by a fellow teen named Anthony Broussard. He later dumped her body in a ditch in the east foothills of Milpitas.\n\n== Media ==\n\n=== Newspapers ===\n* ''[[Milpitas Post]]''\n* ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]''\n* ''[[East Bay Express]]''\n* ''[[Oakland Tribune]]''\n* ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''\n* ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]''\n* ''[[Metro Silicon Valley]]''\n* ''Wave Magazine''\n* ''[[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]''\n* ''[[SF Weekly]]''\n* ''[[Singtao Daily]]'' San Francisco edition\n* ''[[World Journal]]'' San Francisco edition\n* ''Kanzhongguo Times''\n\n=== Radio ===\n'''Country''':\n\n* [[KRTY]], 95.3 -

After fruitless attempts to chase down rebel cavalry raiders on foot, the brigade was converted to mounted infantry.
