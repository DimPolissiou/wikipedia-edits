Rafelson paid Lange a visit in upstate New York, where she was doing [[summer stock theater]], and has famously recounted how he watched the budding actress conversing on the telephone for half an hour before their meeting when he decided that he had found the lead for his film. After his meeting with Lange, he wrote her name down on a piece of paper, placed it in an envelope, and sealed it. After several meetings and auditions with other actresses (though Rafelson had already made his decision, he feared he had done so too quickly and wanted to make sure his choice was absolutely right), the final choice was between Lange and Meryl Streep. In the end, Rafelson offered Lange the lead role opposite Nicholson in his remake of the classic ''[[film noir]]'', [[The Postman Always Rings Twice (1981 film)|''The Postman Always Rings Twice'']] (1981).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/28062%257C0/Goin-South.html|title=Goin' South|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924162726/https://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/28062%7C0/Goin-South.html|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> Upon offering her the part, he gave her the sealed envelope in which he had placed the piece of paper with her name on it.

By 1301 he had arrived in [[Trabzon|Trebizond]], for in November of that year he escorted emperor Alexios II in the campaign against the \"Amitiotai\", [[Oghuz Turks|Turkomans]] from [[Diyarbak\u0131r]] (Amida), who had penetrated deep into Trebizond's territory to sack Kerasous (modern [[Giresun]]), the second most important city of the Empire.\n\nOne important relationship Loukites developed while living in Trebizond was with the astronomer [[Gregory Choniades]]: of Choniades' 16 surviving letters, four were to Loukites. Two surviving manuscripts, one a copy of the ''[[Iliad]]'' (Ambros. I 58 sup.) the other a copy of [[Thucydides]] (Vatican. Ottob. gr. 211), that had been part of Choniades' library, also bear Loukites' bookplates.<ref>L. G.

His funerary inscription is reportedly in the [[Hagia Sophia, Trabzon|Hagia Sophia]] of Trebizond, on the eastern side of the church in the arch behind the sanctum.\n\n== Writings ==\n\nTwo of his works have survived:\n\n* An [[encomium]] to [[Eugenios of Trebizond|Saint Eugenios]] the patron saint of Trebizond, whose cult had been promoted during the rule of the Grand Komnenoi.\n* A funeral oration for Alexios II Komnenos, which Loukites delivered nine days after Alexios' death on 3 May 1330. In that speech, Loukites mentions all but two of the ancestors of Alexios II, asking them to accept the late emperor among their ranks; the order and selection has led some writers to believe he was describing a series of portraits painted on the walls of the hall where Loukites delivered the oration.<ref>Oikonomides, \"The Chancery\", pp. 322-324; Rosenqvist, J.O., \"Three Trapezuntine Notes\", ''Byzantinoslavica'', '''54''' (1993), pp. 294-299</ref> [[Athanasios Papadopoulos-Kerameus]] published an edition of this work in his ''Analekta Hierosolymitikes Stachyologias'' (St. Petersburg, 1891).\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* Vathi Theodora, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150417062347/http://www.ehw.gr/asiaminor/forms/fLemmaBodyExtended.aspx?lemmaID=8274 \"Constantine Loukites\"], ''Encyclopaedia of the Hellenic World, Asia Minor''\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Loukites, Constantine}}\n[[Category:14th-century Byzantine people]]\n[[Category:People of the Empire of Trebizond]]\n[[Category:Byzantine letter writers]]\n[[Category:13th-century births]]\n[[Category:14th-century deaths]]\n[[Category:Greek Macedonians]]\n[[Category:Byzantine poets]]\n", "name_user": "Graham87", "label": "safe", "comment": "typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_Loukites"}
