An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.\n\n''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies. The Wisp power-ups introduced in ''Sonic Colors'' became a staple of the ''Sonic'' series.\n\n==Gameplay==\n===Premise and setting===\n[[File:Sonic_Colors_gameplay.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Sonic Colors'', showing Sonic in one of the game's levels]]\n''Sonic Colors'' is a 2D [[platform game]] set in [[outer space]].

The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.\n\nSonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.\n\nHowever, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote= From a general game design perspective, in recent years we've been able to introduce Sonic to new fans, a lot of the Nintendo/''Mario'' fans, and because of that, we've made changes to the design, and we've designed things in ''Sonic Colors'' that we think will really appeal to people who are unfamiliar with the Sonic brand and the Sonic gameplay.|source=Takashi Iizuka, on why ''Sonic Colors'' was designed to appeal to a wider demographic.<ref name=\"vg\"/> |width=30em|quoted=1}}\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''Sonic Unleashed''.<ref name=\"Q&A\">{{cite web|last1=Earwaker|first1=Kiran|title=Sonic Colours \u2013 Q&A Feature|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|website=Total Video Games|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606165905/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|archivedate=June 6, 2015|date=August 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While they kept most of ''Unleashed''{{'}}s core gameplay elements,<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Jason|title=E3 2010 Q&A: Takashi Iizuka on Sonic Colors|url=https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|website=Sonic Stadium|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002057/https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> developers [[Sonic Team]] and [[Dimps]] decided to create an equal balance between speed and platforming similar to that of the games released for the Sega Genesis, in comparison to the straightforward gameplay of ''Unleashed''.<ref name=\"spong interview\">{{cite web|last1=Joscelyne|first1=Svend|title=Interviews// Sonic Colours Producer, Takashi Iizuka|url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|website=SPOnG|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68WAmiXNY?url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|archivedate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Following requests by fans, the team also made the decision to make Sonic the only playable character, and to omit \"gimmick\" themes such as the [[swordplay]] mechanic used in the 2009 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]''.<ref name=\"canvas\"/> The team chose to develop ''Sonic Colors'' on [[Nintendo]]'s Wii and DS consoles, hoping to expand upon the audience attracted by the successful ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] games.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/>\n\nOne of the first ideas was the setting should be an amusement park; Sonic Team then realized that \"any sort of terrestrial amusement park would be too small to contain Sonic's adventures.\" From this came the idea of an interplanetary park, which would allow for more creativity and variance in the game.<ref name=\"canvas\">{{Cite journal|title=Fresh Canvas|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|last=Thomason|first=Steve|date=July 2010|issue=256|pages=50\u201357}}</ref> The developers used [[Disneyland]] as visual inspiration for the levels.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/> Sonic Team also desired something that would diversify the gameplay, but did not slow it down.

An installment in the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series, it follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]]'s quest to stop his nemesis [[Doctor Eggman]] from enslaving an alien race and taking over the world. The gameplay is similar to prior ''Sonic'' games, with players collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies; the camera perspective occasionally switches from [[Third-person view|third-person]] to [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] perspectives. The game also introduces [[Wisp (Sonic)|Wisp]]s, [[power-ups]] the player can use to increase attack power and reach new areas.\n\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''[[Sonic Unleashed]]''. Examining criticisms of past games, the developers made Sonic the only playable character and worked to balance speed and platforming; the Wisps were introduced to diversify the gameplay without slowing it down. Two versions of the game were developed: one for the [[Wii]] by [[Sonic Team]], and one for the [[Nintendo DS]] by [[Dimps]]. The game was designed for a wider demographic than previous games, specifically children and fans of the ''[[Super Mario]]'' series. In anticipation of the game's release, Sega delisted several ''Sonic'' games with sub-average [[Metacritic]] scores to increase the value of the brand.\n\n''Sonic Colors'' received positive reviews. Critics recommended the title for its graphics, audio, gameplay, replay value, and considered it an improvement over previous installments. However, some criticized its difficulty and weak [[multiplayer]] mode. The game was a commercial success, selling over two million copies.

The park is made up of several planet-sized attractions. Suspicious, Sonic the Hedgehog and his best friend [[Tails (character)|Tails]] investigate. They meet Yacker, who comes from a species of [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]] known as Wisps. After Tails invents a translator to communicate with him, they learn that other Wisps have been enslaved by Eggman, who plans to harness their energy for a mind-control laser that will allow him to take over Earth.\n\nSonic proceeds to visit the planets, liberating the Wisps and shutting down the generators linked to the amusement park. He meets many of his friends along the way, who are also exploring the park in an attempt to disrupt Eggman's plans.{{efn|name=DS}} After Sonic frees the Wisps, Eggman tries to fire the cannon at the world, but a piece of wreckage causes it to malfunction. As the amusement park begins to explode, Sonic confronts Eggman. Eggman uses the Nega-Wisps to power his final contraption, a robot that uses the powers of all the Wisps that Sonic has met against him. As the machine gets weaker, the Wisps escape and help Sonic defeat Eggman, sending him hurtling off into space. The Wisps carry Sonic out of the exploding amusement park. Returning safely to Earth, Yacker thanks Sonic and Tails.\n\nHowever, Sonic and Tails soon learn that the leading Mother Wisp had been infected by the negative energy and transformed into the Nega-Mother Wisp. Using the power of the Chaos Emeralds, Sonic transforms into Super Sonic and fights her. Following her defeat, the Mother Wisp returns to normal and the Wisps part ways with the two heroes.{{efn|name=DS|Only in the Nintendo DS version.}} In a [[post-credits scene]], Eggman is seen stranded in space with his henchmen [[Orbot and Cubot]].\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote= From a general game design perspective, in recent years we've been able to introduce Sonic to new fans, a lot of the Nintendo/''Mario'' fans, and because of that, we've made changes to the design, and we've designed things in ''Sonic Colors'' that we think will really appeal to people who are unfamiliar with the Sonic brand and the Sonic gameplay.|source=Takashi Iizuka, on why ''Sonic Colors'' was designed to appeal to a wider demographic.<ref name=\"vg\"/> |width=30em|quoted=1}}\nDevelopment of ''Sonic Colors'' began in 2008, following the completion of ''Sonic Unleashed''.<ref name=\"Q&A\">{{cite web|last1=Earwaker|first1=Kiran|title=Sonic Colours \u2013 Q&A Feature|url=http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|website=Total Video Games|accessdate=July 10, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606165905/http://www.totalvideogames.com/Sonic-Colours/feature-15514.html|archivedate=June 6, 2015|date=August 3, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> While they kept most of ''Unleashed''{{'}}s core gameplay elements,<ref name=\"sonicstadiuminterview\">{{cite web|last1=Berry|first1=Jason|title=E3 2010 Q&A: Takashi Iizuka on Sonic Colors|url=https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|website=Sonic Stadium|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002057/https://www.sonicstadium.org/2010/06/sonic-colors-interview-with-takashi-iizuka/|archivedate=September 22, 2017}}</ref> developers [[Sonic Team]] and [[Dimps]] decided to create an equal balance between speed and platforming similar to that of the games released for the Sega Genesis, in comparison to the straightforward gameplay of ''Unleashed''.<ref name=\"spong interview\">{{cite web|last1=Joscelyne|first1=Svend|title=Interviews// Sonic Colours Producer, Takashi Iizuka|url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|website=SPOnG|accessdate=September 17, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68WAmiXNY?url=http://spong.com/feature/10110209/Interview-Sonic-Colours-Producer-Takashi-Iizuka|archivedate=June 18, 2012}}</ref> Following requests by fans, the team also made the decision to make Sonic the only playable character, and to omit \"gimmick\" themes such as the [[swordplay]] mechanic used in the 2009 [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Sonic and the Black Knight]]''.<ref name=\"canvas\"/> The team chose to develop ''Sonic Colors'' on [[Nintendo]]'s Wii and DS consoles, hoping to expand upon the audience attracted by the successful ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]] games.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/>\n\nOne of the first ideas was the setting should be an amusement park; Sonic Team then realized that \"any sort of terrestrial amusement park would be too small to contain Sonic's adventures.\" From this came the idea of an interplanetary park, which would allow for more creativity and variance in the game.<ref name=\"canvas\">{{Cite journal|title=Fresh Canvas|journal=[[Nintendo Power]]|last=Thomason|first=Steve|date=July 2010|issue=256|pages=50\u201357}}</ref> The developers used [[Disneyland]] as visual inspiration for the levels.<ref name=\"spong interview\"/> Sonic Team also desired something that would diversify the gameplay, but did not slow it down.

On Windows, this interface is implemented through the [[Win32 console]]. {{mono|cmd.exe}} may take advantage of features available to native programs of its own platform.

The system works by inserting a \"tappet\" between the cam shaft and the valve and the engine management system can control the amount of oil that is allowed into the \"tappet\" thus changing the effective opening profile of the inlet valve. The system can also change the overlap of the inlet and exhaust valves as well as changing the amount of lift and this allows the engine to maintain a steady pressure in the inlet manifold which is used to increase the amount of torque the engine produces while maintaining the efficiency of the engine. The system is said to increase torque by 20% while reducing emissions by a similar amount. All engines except the 1750 TBi have a [[Start&Stop]] system and all are [[Euro5]] rated.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta revealed |accessdate=19 December 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph| location=London | first=Simon | last=Arron | date=5 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091210214123/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html| archivedate= 10 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe top of the range model has 1.7 L turbocharged engine the 1750 TBi \u2013 {{convert|235|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} with an exclusive Quadrifoglio Verde configuration (called Cloverleaf in the UK).

The system controls the amount of air going into the engine by controlling when air is allowed into the engine and how much the inlet valve opens. The system works by inserting a \"tappet\" between the cam shaft and the valve and the engine management system can control the amount of oil that is allowed into the \"tappet\" thus changing the effective opening profile of the inlet valve. The system can also change the overlap of the inlet and exhaust valves as well as changing the amount of lift and this allows the engine to maintain a steady pressure in the inlet manifold which is used to increase the amount of torque the engine produces while maintaining the efficiency of the engine. The system is said to increase torque by 20% while reducing emissions by a similar amount. All engines except the 1750 TBi have a [[Start&Stop]] system and all are [[Euro5]] rated.<ref name=\"telegraph.co.uk\">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html|title=Alfa Romeo Giulietta revealed |accessdate=19 December 2009|work=The Daily Telegraph| location=London | first=Simon | last=Arron | date=5 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091210214123/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/news/6718104/Alfa-Romeo-Giulietta-revealed.html| archivedate= 10 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe top of the range model has 1.7 L turbocharged engine the 1750 TBi \u2013 {{convert|235|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} with an exclusive Quadrifoglio Verde configuration (called Cloverleaf in the UK).

Founded in 1885, the UofA was the first university in the [[Arizona Territory]]. {{as of|2018}}, the university enrolls 45,217 students<ref name=\"Facts\"/> in 19 separate colleges/schools, including the [[University of Arizona College of Medicine]] in Tucson and Phoenix and the [[James E.

The University of Arizona is governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]]. The University of Arizona is one of the elected members of the [[Association of American Universities]] and is the only representative from the state of Arizona to this group.\n\nKnown as the [[Arizona Wildcats]] (often shortened to \"Cats\"), the UA's intercollegiate athletic teams are members of the [[Pac-12 Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].

The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

After a 25-year tenure as Arizona head coach, Olson announced his retirement from the Arizona basketball program in October 2008. After two seasons of using interim coaches, Arizona named [[Sean Miller]], head coach at [[Xavier University]], as its new head basketball coach in April 2009. During his tenure to date, Miller has led the Wildcats to seven conference championships and six appearances in the NCAA tournament. Miller has served as head coach for four of the seven seasons in Arizona history in which the Wildcats have won 30 or more games.\n\n====Football====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats football}}\n[[File:Arizona Stadium East Side.jpg|thumb|[[Arizona Stadium]] has a total capacity of 55,675]]\nThe [[American Football|football]] team began at The University of Arizona in 1899 under the nickname \"Varsity\" (a name kept until the 1914 season when the team was deemed the \"Wildcats\").<ref name=\"History 7\">{{cite web | title=The First Football Team \u2013 1899 | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701033605/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history7.php |archivedate=July 1, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe football team was notably successful in the 1990s, under head coach [[Dick Tomey]]; his \"Desert Swarm\" defense was characterized by tough, hard-nosed tactics.

The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-[[Pac-12 Conference|12]] academic honors for their performance in the classroom.\n\n====Softball====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats softball}}\n\nThe Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach [[Mike Candrea]] (NCAA Softball Championship).

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.<ref name=\"LaxCats\">{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Ryan |title=Arizona Wildcats Lacrosse: LaxCats, Hidden Gem in the Desert |url=https://zonazealots.com/2015/04/01/arizona-wildcats-lacrosse-laxcats-hidden-gem-desert/ |website=FanSided |accessdate=19 August 2019 |date=2016}}</ref> In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by [[Carl Runk]], an Arizona graduate and football player.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]]. The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma.

From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games. [[Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium]] hosted baseball games until the 2012 season, when the baseball program began playing home games at [[Hi Corbett Field]], a former [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] facility three miles southeast of campus.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Wildcat Family Statue, University of Arizona.jpg|thumb|upright|Wildcat Family Statue]]\n\n===Fraternities and sororities===\nThe University of Arizona recognizes 51 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greek.arizona.edu/|title=UA Fraternity & Sorority Programs|author=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=January 2, 2019|df=}}</ref> {{as of|2018||df=|lc=|since=}}, more than 16% of students are part of UA's 52-chapter Greek life program.

Every year (usually in March), the students elect a Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three at-large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. Students for Sustainability become an ASUA recognized program in 2008. It focuses on pursuing institutionalized sustainability throughout the University of Arizona and the greater Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=Students for Sustainability|access-date=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313004014/http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)====\nIn 1997, the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the ''de facto'' body representing graduate and professional students. Each year (usually in March or April), the graduate and professional students elect representatives by constituency and at-large representatives. The President, Administrative Vice President (AVP), and Executive Vice President (EVP) are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. GPSC is a member of two national advocacy organizations, [[Student Advocates for Graduate Education]] (SAGE) and the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS). GPSC officers and representatives serve on numerous University committees. GPSC administers grant programs that support the research, projects, travel, and professional development of graduate and professional students.\n\n====Residence Hall Association (RHA)====\nOn-campus residents also have their own student leadership organization known as the Residence Hall Association (RHA). Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual units of the RHA are: the executive board, the general body and the 24 individual hall councils.\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of nine student leaders that help run the organization. The positions are as follow: President, National Communications Coordinator, the Directors of Business Administration, Operations, Programming, Marketing and Equipment Services, the RHA parliamentarian, the Executive Director of the National Residence Hall Honorary and an advisor. The RHA Executive Board is elected to one-year terms during the spring semester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uarha.com/contact |title=Contact Us |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |publisher=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe General Body is composed of representatives from each of the 24 residence halls on campus, the executive board and liaisons from ASUA, Advocates Coming Together and Eco-Reps.

The Arizona Territory's \"[[Thieving Thirteenth]]\" Legislature approved the University of Arizona in 1885 and selected the city of Tucson to receive the appropriation to build the university. Tucson hoped to receive the appropriation for the territory's mental hospital, which carried a $100,000 allocation instead of the $25,000 allotted to the territory's only university (Arizona State University was also chartered in 1885, but it was created as Arizona's [[normal school]], and not a university).{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Flooding on the [[Salt River (Arizona)|Salt River]] delayed Tucson's legislators, and by they time they reached [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], back-room deals allocating the most desirable territorial institutions had been made. Tucson was largely disappointed with receiving what was viewed as an inferior prize.

The program's requirements entail that each honors student must complete 30 credit hours of honors credit by graduation time and maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.5. To complete these credit hours, students may take courses designated as honors at the University of Arizona or may turn a regular course into an [[honors course]] through an honors contract. In addition, they must collaborate with a [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] member and write an honors thesis before graduating with honors from the University of Arizona.\n\nThe University of Arizona Honors College recently completed construction on an Honors dormitory known as the Honors Village. The facility includes a meal hall, which is open to the public, classroom spaces, faculty offices, and space for 1052 student residents.\n\nThere are additional resources available to honors students in the University of Arizona Honors College. Such resources include: longer library check-out dates, cheaper printing options at the Slonaker House, priority registration, additional honors advising, smaller class sizes taught by Honors faculty, clubs and organizations specifically available to only honors students such as the Honors Student Council and the Honors College Ambassadors, and additional scholarship opportunities.

As part of the project, additional new office space for the Library was constructed on the existing fifth floor.\n\nThe Special Collections Library is adjacent to the Main Library. It was established in 1958, and it houses materials primarily concerned with Arizona and Southwestern history, borderlands studies, and literature. \n\nThe Weaver Science and Engineering Library is in a nearby building from the 1960s that houses volumes and periodicals from those fields. The Music Building (on the northwest quadrant of campus where many of the fine arts disciplines are clustered) houses the Fine Arts Library, including reference collections for architecture, music (including sheet music, recordings and listening stations), and photography. There is a small library at the [[Center for Creative Photography]], also in the fine arts complex, devoted to the art and science of photography. The Law Library is in the law building (James E. Rogers College of Law) at the intersection of Speedway Boulevard and Mountain Avenue.\n\nThe Arizona Health Sciences Library, built in 1996, is on the Health Sciences Center on the north end of campus and in Phoenix on the Phoenix Biomedical Campus, in the Health Sciences Education Building (HSEB). The library serves the Colleges of Medicine, Nursing, Pharmacy and Public Health, the University of Arizona Health Network, and is a resource for health professionals and citizens across the state.\n\n===Academic organizations and centers===\n[[University of Arizona Poetry Center|The University of Arizona Poetry Center]] houses an extensive collection of contemporary poetry.

The north and south sides of campus are delineated by a grassy expanse called the Mall, which stretches from Old Main eastward to the campus' eastern border at Campbell Avenue (a major north-south arterial street). The west and east sides of campus are separated roughly by Highland Avenue and the Student Union Memorial Center (see below).\n\nThe science and mathematics buildings tend to be clustered in the southwest quadrant; the intercollegiate athletics facilities to the southeast; the arts and humanities buildings to the northwest (with the dance department being a major exception as its main facilities are far to the east end of campus), with the engineering buildings in the north central area. The optical and space sciences buildings are clustered on the east side of campus near the sports stadiums and the (1976) main library.\n[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|left|University of Arizona Mall]]\n\nSpeedway Boulevard, one of Tucson's primary east-west arterial streets, traditionally defined the northern boundary of campus but since the 1980s, several university buildings have been constructed north of this street, expanding into a neighborhood traditionally filled with apartment complexes and single-family homes. The university has purchased a handful of these apartment complexes for student housing in recent years. Sixth Street typically defines the southern boundary, with single-family homes (many of which are rented out to students) south of this street.\n\nPark Avenue has traditionally defined the western boundary of campus, and there is a stone wall which runs along a large portion of the east side of the street, leading to the old Main Gate, and into the driveway leading to Old Main. Along or adjacent to all of these major streets are a wide variety of retail facilities serving the student, faculty and staff population (as is the case in other similar university neighborhoods throughout the United States): shops, bookstores, bars, banks, credit unions, coffeehouses and major chain fast-food restaurants such as [[Chipotle]], [[Panera Bread]] and [[Pei Wei Asian Diner|Pei Wei]]. The area near University Boulevard and Park Avenue, near the Main Gate, has been a major center of such retail activity going back to the university's early decades; many shops dating from the 1920s have been renovated since the late 1990s, other new retail shops have been built in recent years, and a nine-story [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel was built in this immediate district in 1996.

The program had only two appearances in its history prior to the last four years. Ten members received PAC-[[Pac-12 Conference|12]] academic honors for their performance in the classroom.\n\n====Softball====\n{{main|Arizona Wildcats softball}}\n\nThe Arizona softball team is among the top programs in the country. The softball team has won eight NCAA Women's College World Series titles, in 1991, 1993, 1994, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2006 and 2007 under head coach [[Mike Candrea]] (NCAA Softball Championship).

The Wildcat softball team plays at Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium.\n\n====Golf====\nThe university's golf teams have also been notably successful. The men's team won a national championship in 1992 ([[NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships]]), and has produced a number of successful professionals, most notably [[Jim Furyk]]. The women's team won national championships in 1996, 2000 and 2018 ([[NCAA Women's Golf Championship]]). The women's golf program has produced professionals [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] and [[Lorena Ochoa]].\n\n====Men's lacrosse====\nThe [[lacrosse]] team is a club team, not a varsity sport at Arizona, known as the \"Laxcats\". Its existence, since the mid-1960s, is saturated with a rich tradition of success.<ref name=\"LaxCats\">{{cite web |last1=Reyes |first1=Ryan |title=Arizona Wildcats Lacrosse: LaxCats, Hidden Gem in the Desert |url=https://zonazealots.com/2015/04/01/arizona-wildcats-lacrosse-laxcats-hidden-gem-desert/ |website=FanSided |accessdate=19 August 2019 |date=2016}}</ref> In the 1960s, Arizona was a Division I varsity program, coached by [[Carl Runk]], an Arizona graduate and football player.

Alix Creek and Michelle Oldham won the NCAA Women's Doubles Tennis title in 1993, defeating Texas in the Final. Although surprising to some, the University of Arizona has a noteworthy history in [[ice hockey]]. The school's club hockey team, formerly known as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey|Icecats]], won over 800 games between its inception in 1979 and 2011. The Icecats defeated [[Penn State]] for the National Collegiate Club Hockey National Championship in 1985. They also appeared in eight Final Fours (\u201984, \u201986, \u201987, \u201988, \u201991, \u201993, \u201994, \u201997) and ten Elite Eights. {{as of|2011}}, they are part of [[American Collegiate Hockey Association|ACHA]] Division I, and are known formally as the [[Arizona Wildcats hockey]] team. Robert M. Tanita was a nationally ranked collegiate wrestler who reached the NCAA finals tournament as WAC champion in 1963.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.arizonawildcathockey.org/history|title=History|website=Arizona Wildcat Hockey|language=en-us|access-date=February 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThree national championships for [[synchronized swimming]] were won in 1980, 1981, and 1984, though these championships were in the [[Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]], and not the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Along with winning three national championships in the pool for synchronized swimming, the Wildcats have also won their first [[NCAA]] Championship in men and women's swimming and diving for the seasons of 2007\u20132008. Topping off these weekends [[Frank Busch]], the men and women's head coach, was named [[NCAA]] Swimming Coach of the Year. Arizona men became the first team to claim a first-time title since UCLA's win in 1982. Also, the men ended Texas and Auburn's winning streak since 1998. At the end of the meet, the [[Texas Longhorns swimming and diving|Texas Longhorns]] took second while 2007's champion, the [[Auburn Tigers swimming and diving|Auburn Tigers]], took fifth. For the women, Arizona worked on the disappointment of 2007's defeat. The women were winning until the last day when Auburn grasped the title. Unlike 2007, Arizona's women did not let anyone come close. The Wildcats won with 484 team points while the Auburn Tigers came in second with 348 and the [[Stanford Cardinal]] in third with 343. Student-athletes from the women's swimming and diving team have been particularly heralded by the NCAA. The [[NCAA Woman of the Year Award]] was won by UA swimmers Whitney Myers, Lacey Nymeyer and Justine Schluntz in 2007, 2009 and 2010 respectively. The three awards and the 1994 award won by track and field athlete Tanya Hughes are the highest number of Woman of the Year awards won by a single university.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/resources/events/awards/1994-ncaa-woman-year|title=1994 NCAA Woman of the Year|last=jjackson|date=June 30, 2015|newspaper=NCAA.org - The Official Site of the NCAA|access-date=February 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Individual national championships===\nA number of notable individuals have also won national championships in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]. Arizona's first NCAA Individual Champion in the sport of Men's Swimming came in 1981 when Doug Towne won the 500-yard freestyle at the NCAA championships. Another individual champion occurred in 1989 when Mariusz Podkoscielny won the 1650-yard (mile) at the NCAA National Championships held at the IUPUI Natatorium. Some other champion swimmers include [[Crissy Ahmann-Leighton]], [[Ryk Neethling]], [[Margo Geer]], [[Kevin Cordes]], and [[Amanda Beard]]. [[Annika S\u00f6renstam]] won in 1991 in golf, and [[Brigetta Barrett]] won the women's high jump in 2013. The men's [[Cross country running|cross country]] has also produced two individual national titles in 1986 (Aaron Ramirez) and 1994 (Martin Keino) ([[NCAA Men's Cross Country Championship|NCAA Men's Cross Country Champions]]). The women's cross country also produced two individual national titles in 1996 (Amy Skieresz) and 2001 (Tara Chaplin) ([[NCAA Women's Cross Country Championship]]). Another notable individual was football standout [[Vance Johnson]] who won the NCAA long jump in 1982.\n\n===Rivalries===\nA strong athletic rivalry exists between the University of Arizona and [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], Arizona. The University of Arizona leads the all-time record against Arizona State University in men's basketball (149\u201383), as well as in football (49\u201342\u20131). The football rivalry game between the schools is known as \"The Duel in the Desert.\" The trophy awarded after each game, the [[Territorial Cup]], is the nation's oldest rivalry trophy, distinguished by the NCAA. Rivalries have also been created with other [[Pac-12 Conference|Pac-12]] teams, especially [[University of California, Los Angeles]] which has provided a worthy [[softball]] rival and was Arizona's main basketball rival in the early and mid-1990s.\n\n===Mascot===\n[[File:Wilma & Wilber Wildcat in the bucket of Tucson Fire Department ladder truck 1.JPG|thumb|Wilma & Wilbur Wildcat at the 100th homecoming at the University of Arizona]]\nThe university's mascots are a pair of [[anthropomorphized]] [[Bobcat|wildcats]] named [[Wilbur and Wilma]]. The identities of Wilbur and Wilma are kept secret through the year as the mascots appear only in costume. In 1986, Wilbur married his longtime wildcat girlfriend, Wilma. Together, Wilbur and Wilma appear along with the [[cheerleading]] squad at most Wildcat sporting events.<ref name=\"Wilber\">{{cite web | title=Wilbur & Wilma Wildcat | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=Traditions Tour | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060214175921/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions3.php |archivedate = February 14, 2006}}</ref> Arizona's first mascot was a real desert [[bobcat]] named \"Rufus Arizona\", introduced in 1915.<ref name=\"History 10\">{{cite web | title=Rufus Arizona | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060226193333/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/history/history10.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = February 26, 2006}}</ref>\n\nWilbur was originally created by Bob White as a cartoon character in the university's humor magazine, ''Kitty Kat''. From 1915 through the 1950s the school mascot was a live [[bobcat]], a species known locally as a wildcat. This succession of live mascots were known by the common name of Rufus Arizona, originally named after Rufus von Kleinsmid, president of the university from 1914 to 1921. 1959 marked the creation of the first incarnated Wilbur, when University student John Paquette and his roommate, Dick Heller, came up with idea of creating a costume for a student to wear. Ed Stuckenhoff was chosen to wear the costume at the homecoming game in 1959 against Texas Tech and since then it has become a long-standing tradition. Wilbur celebrated his 50th birthday in November 2009.\n\n===Fight song===\nIn 1952 Jack K. Lee, an applicant for the UA's band directorship, departed Tucson by air following an interview with UA administration. From his airplane window, Lee observed the huge letters on the roof of the UA gymnasium reading \"BEAR DOWN.\" Inspired, Lee scribbled down the music and lyrics to an up-tempo song. By the time his plane landed, he had virtually finished it. A few weeks later Lee was named the UA band director, and in September 1952, the UA band performed \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" in public for the first time. Soon thereafter, \"Bear Down, Arizona!\" became accepted as UA's fight song ([[Bear Down]]).<ref name=\"Berger Memorial Fountain\">{{cite web | title=Berger Memorial Fountain | publisher=Arizona Board of Regents | year=2005 | work=UA History | accessdate=March 29, 2006 | url=http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060504055919/http://www.arizona.edu/tours/traditions/traditions11.php <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===ZonaZoo===\nOfficially implemented in 2003, ZonaZoo is the official student section and student ticketing program for the University of Arizona Athletics.

The official capacity has changed often. The largest crowd to see a game in McKale was 15,176 in 1976 for a game against the [[University of New Mexico]], a main rival during that period. In 2000, the floor in McKale was dubbed Lute Olson Court, for the basketball program's winningest coach. During a memorial service in 2001 for Lute's wife, Bobbi, who died after a battle with ovarian cancer, the floor was renamed Lute and Bobbi Olson Court. In addition to the playing surface, McKale Center is host to the offices of the UA athletic department. McKale Center is named after J.F. Pop McKale, who was athletic director and coach from 1914 through 1957. Joe Cavaleri (\"The Ooh-Aah Man\") made his dramatic and inspiring appearances there. [[Arizona Stadium]], built in 1928 and last expanded in 2013, seats 56,037 patrons. It hosts [[American football]] games and has also been used for university graduations. The turf is [[bermuda grass]], taken from the local Tucson National Golf Club. Arizona football's home record is 258\u2013139\u201312. The largest crowd ever in Arizona Stadium was 59,920 in 1996 for a game against Arizona State University. [[Rita Hillenbrand Memorial Stadium]] hosts [[softball]] games. [[Jerry Kindall Field at Frank Sancet Stadium]] hosted baseball games until the 2012 season, when the baseball program began playing home games at [[Hi Corbett Field]], a former [[Cactus League]] [[spring training]] facility three miles southeast of campus.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Wildcat Family Statue, University of Arizona.jpg|thumb|upright|Wildcat Family Statue]]\n\n===Fraternities and sororities===\nThe University of Arizona recognizes 51 [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] chapters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greek.arizona.edu/|title=UA Fraternity & Sorority Programs|author=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=January 2, 2019|df=}}</ref> {{as of|2018||df=|lc=|since=}}, more than 16% of students are part of UA's 52-chapter Greek life program.

Every year (usually in March), the students elect a Senator to represent each of the respective undergraduate colleges, three at-large senators, an Administrative Vice President, an Executive Vice President and President to 1-year terms. The ASUA oversees the ZonaZoo and UA Spring Fling programs, while holding administrative oversight for the nearly 600 student clubs on campus. Each of the Senators and all Administrative Officers also are appointed to serve on the various University of Arizona Faculty and Administrative Committees. Students for Sustainability become an ASUA recognized program in 2008. It focuses on pursuing institutionalized sustainability throughout the University of Arizona and the greater Tucson area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|title=About Us|website=Students for Sustainability|access-date=February 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313004014/http://www.uasfs.com/about-us.html|archive-date=March 13, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n====Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC)====\nIn 1997, the Graduate and Professional Student Council (GPSC) split from the ASUA and has since become the ''de facto'' body representing graduate and professional students. Each year (usually in March or April), the graduate and professional students elect representatives by constituency and at-large representatives. The President, Administrative Vice President (AVP), and Executive Vice President (EVP) are also elected at large by the graduate and professional student body. GPSC is a member of two national advocacy organizations, [[Student Advocates for Graduate Education]] (SAGE) and the [[National Association of Graduate-Professional Students]] (NAGPS). GPSC officers and representatives serve on numerous University committees. GPSC administers grant programs that support the research, projects, travel, and professional development of graduate and professional students.\n\n====Residence Hall Association (RHA)====\nOn-campus residents also have their own student leadership organization known as the Residence Hall Association (RHA). Anyone who lives on campus is automatically a member of RHA. The individual units of the RHA are: the executive board, the general body and the 24 individual hall councils.\n\nThe Executive Board is composed of nine student leaders that help run the organization. The positions are as follow: President, National Communications Coordinator, the Directors of Business Administration, Operations, Programming, Marketing and Equipment Services, the RHA parliamentarian, the Executive Director of the National Residence Hall Honorary and an advisor. The RHA Executive Board is elected to one-year terms during the spring semester.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uarha.com/contact |title=Contact Us |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |publisher=University of Arizona Residence Hall Association |access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe General Body is composed of representatives from each of the 24 residence halls on campus, the executive board and liaisons from ASUA, Advocates Coming Together and Eco-Reps. At general body meetings issues regarding the residence halls and their 6,000 plus inhabitants are discussed and decided upon.\n\nFinally, each of the 24 residence halls on campus have their own councils which provide a variety of services and programming opportunities for residents. Each of these councils must include the following: one sustainability representative, one social justice advocate and two RHA representatives that represent their hall at the general meetings.

In [[Ezekiel 38]], Gog is an individual and Magog is his land;{{sfn|Lust|1999b|pp=373\u2013374}} in Genesis 10 Magog is a man, but no Gog is mentioned; and centuries later Jewish tradition changed Ezekiel's \"Gog ''from'' Magog\" into \"Gog ''and'' Magog\",{{r|boring}} which is the form in which they appear in the Christian New Testament's [[Book of Revelation]], although there they are peoples rather than individuals.{{r|mounce}}\n\nA legend was attached to Gog and Magog by the time of the [[Pax Romana|Roman period]], that the [[Gates of Alexander]] were erected by [[Alexander the Great]] to repel the tribe. Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].\n\nThe legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.\n\nThe conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|\u064a\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c \u0648\u0645\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Ya\u02bej\u016bj wa-Ma\u02bej\u016bj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P.

Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].\n\nThe legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.\n\nThe conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|\u064a\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c \u0648\u0645\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Ya\u02bej\u016bj wa-Ma\u02bej\u016bj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P.

The coin depicts [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], and a stylized image honoring the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] Moon mission on the reverse, with both sides designed by [[Frank Gasparro]] (the reverse is based on the Apollo 11 mission patch designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]). It is the only large-size U.S. dollar coin whose circulation strikes contained no silver.\n\nIn 1965, because of rises in bullion prices, the Mint began to strike copper-nickel [[cladding (metalworking)|clad]] coins instead of silver. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, but beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President [[Richard Nixon]], who had served as [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing mintage of the new coin on December 31, 1970.\n\nAlthough the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars failed to circulate to any degree, except in and around [[Nevada]] casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776\u20131976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of the [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial of American independence]]. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]], struck beginning in 1979, but that coin also failed to circulate. Given their modest cost and the short length of the series, complete sets of Eisenhower dollars are inexpensive to assemble and are becoming more popular among coin collectors.\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Peace dollar#Striking of 1964-D dollars|Coinage Act of 1965#Coin shortage}}\nThe silver dollar had never been a popular coin, circulating little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The [[Peace dollar]], the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]]. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2842\u20132846}}\n\nOn August 3, 1964, [[88th United States Congress|Congress]] passed legislation providing for the striking of 45 million silver dollars. This legislation was enacted when coins vanished from circulation as the price of silver rose past $1.29 per ounce, making silver dollars worth more as bullion than as currency. The new pieces were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where \"hard money\" was popular. Numismatic periodicals complained that striking the dollars was a waste of resources.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=461}} The law had been passed at the urging of the [[Senate Majority Leader]], [[Mike Mansfield]] (Democrat\u2013Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=78}} Despite the efforts of Mint Director [[Eva Adams]] and her staff to persuade him, Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay, and on May 12, 1965 the [[Denver Mint]] began striking 1964-D Peace dollars{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=86}}\u2014the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 13, 1964}}\n\nA public announcement of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965,{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=87\u201388}} only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources at a time of severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, [[89th United States Congress|Congress]] inserted a provision in the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=98\u2013101}} That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=36}}\n\n==Inception==\n[[File:1964 Peace dollar restrike.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An unofficially produced 1964-D Peace dollar, struck over a genuine silver dollar by a private mint]]\nIn 1969, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] Mint Director [[Mary Brooks]] sought the reissuance of the dollar coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the [[Kennedy half dollar]], but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]], [[Wright Patman]], who had been persuaded, against his better judgment, by Nixon's predecessor, [[Lyndon Johnson]], to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=37}}\n\nOn March 28, 1969, former president and World War II general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] died. Soon after, New Jersey Representative [[Florence Dwyer]], like Eisenhower, a Republican, suggested that the proposed dollar coin bear his likeness. She spoke to Democratic Missouri Representative [[Leonor Sullivan]], who agreed that the dollar should bear a portrait of Eisenhower as \"equal time\" to the half dollar, which bore the likeness of Democratic president [[John F. Kennedy]].{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}} A bill was filed by Connecticut Congressman [[Robert N. Giaimo]] to authorize an Eisenhower dollar, to be struck without silver content. The [[Joint Commission on the Coinage]], drawing members from the administration and from Congress, including Giaimo, recommended the dollar in spring<!-- I can show it is in the Northern Hemisphere spring as the article was published on June 15 and Eisenhower died on March 28, so it had to be.

It also called for the elimination of silver from the half dollar, and for the transfer from the Treasury to the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) of quantities of rare silver dollars, so they could be sold. Giaimo noted that the coin would be useful in casinos, which were striking their own tokens in the absence of circulating dollar coins, and in the vending industry, which was starting to sell higher-priced items.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|June 15, 1969}}\n\nOn October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed legislation for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating that he hoped to have it approved by the full House in time for the late president's birthday on October 14.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 4, 1969}} On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against the manner in which the legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman [[H. R. Gross]] objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: \"You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 7, 1969}} Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator [[Peter Dominick]], calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from [[Mamie Eisenhower]], recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 15, 1969}}{{sfn|''The Bulletin''|October 15, 1969}} Idaho Senator [[James A. McClure|James McClure]] stated, \"It is somehow beneath the dignity of a great president like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin.\" On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative [[Robert R. Casey]] introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon landing]]. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}} Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, \"We came in peace for all mankind,\" to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.{{sfn|Ike Group|p=57}}\n\nIn March 1970, the two houses reached a compromise whereby 150 million dollars would be struck in the 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|March 8, 1970}} The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, with the aid of Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as \"a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get.\" {{sfn|''Spokane Daily Chronicle''|March 6, 1970}} The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=29}}\n\nAlthough the compromise passed the Senate in March 1970,{{sfn|''The Spokesman-Review''|March 20, 1970}} it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who was determined to end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a [[conference committee]] and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as [[91st United States Congress|Congress]] had adjourned, not signing the bill would [[pocket veto]] it, on December 31, 1970, Nixon hastily signed it only minutes before the midnight deadline.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}}{{sfn|Gilkes}}{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 17, 1970}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|left|The [[Apollo 11]] mission insignia, designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], served as the basis of the Eisenhower dollar's reverse.]]\nFor Mint Chief Engraver [[Frank Gasparro]], the opportunity to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro had been one of more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, [[Mamie Eisenhower]], as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the [[Washington quarter]].{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}}\n\nBefore the legislation passed, Gasparro had prepared two reverses, the one actually used, and a reverse with a more formal [[spreadeagle (heraldry)|heraldic eagle]], which numismatic historian and coin dealer [[Q. David Bowers]] finds reminiscent of [[pattern coin]]s prepared in the 1870s. At Congress's insistence, the chief engraver created a design in commemoration of the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing, based on the [[mission patch]] conceived by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and others. Bowers deems the choice of the lunar landing \"a stroke of genius,\" allowing the dollar, which would be little-used in commerce, to be a commemorative both of Eisenhower and of the Moon mission.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The reverse depicts an eagle (representing the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander]], ''Eagle'') swooping low over the Moon's surface, holding an olive branch, token of peace, in its claws.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}\n\nThe use of Collins' mission patch design had initially been opposed by some government officials because of the fierce expression of the eagle; Gasparro's initial concept met similar objections. The Mint Director recalled that Gasparro had gone to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] to look at eagles, and on his return had prepared a design which she felt emphasized the eagle's predatory nature.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=34}} Brooks informed Gasparro that the eagle was \"too fierce, too warlike, a little too aggressive\" and asked that the expression be made friendlier. Gasparro, who reportedly was unhappy at having to change the eagle,{{sfn|Ike Group|p=58}} described the final version as \"pleasant looking.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] also feared that the eagle's expression might offend, and sought a neutral visage.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The distant Earth may be seen above the bird, and there are 13 stars in honor of the original states.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}\n\nBowers deems the bust of Eisenhower \"well modeled\" by Gasparro, and notes that the fact that the eagle on the reverse holds only an olive branch, rather than arrows as well (token of war), \"meant that the public would like the design.\"{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} Nevertheless, he notes that Eisenhower's stern expression was widely criticized as not typical of a man noted for geniality.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}} Numismatic author David Lange opines that \"the Eisenhower dollar is one of the poorest products to emanate from the U.S. Mint.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Lange writes that, although Gasparro had designed only one side of the coin for the Kennedy half dollar and [[Lincoln cent#Lincoln Memorial design (1959\u20132008)|Lincoln Memorial reverse]] for the cent, \"the Eisenhower dollar was his design alone and should have served as a showcase for his talent. Sadly, it is a mediocre design that reveals his typically unnatural treatment of Ike's hair and the eagle's feathers.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Some collectors complained after the release that the Earth was not fully shown, not realizing that Gasparro had carefully followed the mission badge. The chief engraver responded by clarifying the design.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Eisenhower design.png|thumb|right|The Eisenhower dollar's design as released by the Treasury in January 1971 (probably from photographs of the galvano)]]\nTwo prototype dollars were struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}} However, collectors have found at least two 1971-S coins that have been certified as prototypes.<ref>[http://www.ikegroup.info/chapter34/chapter34.pdf THE LYDSTON AND CHATHAM 1971-S PROTOTYPE IKES]</ref>  Striking such large pieces of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier [[reducing lathe]] to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore at least some of the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief.{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58\u201359}} This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=6\u20137}} Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2860, 2864}} The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the [[San Francisco Mint]]) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses. The first coin struck was for presentation to Mamie Eisenhower; the second to [[David Eisenhower]] (grandson of Dwight and Mamie Eisenhower) and the third to David Eisenhower's father-in-law, President Nixon.{{sfn|''The Press-Courier''|April 1, 1971}}\n\n[[File:Brown Ike.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1974-S \"brown Ike\", partially open to show the coin and holder]]\nOn January 29, 1971, the Mint announced the prices for the 40% silver pieces which would be struck at San Francisco: $3 for uncirculated specimens and $10 for mirror-surfaced [[proof coinage|proof pieces]], with orders to be taken by mail beginning on July 1, with a limit of five of each per customer.

Many were hoarded by collectors; there was initially sufficient demand for the coins that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to purchase rolls in search of better specimens. An oily film was found on a large number of the coins; these coins were cleaned by collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}{{sfn|''Youngstown Vindicator''|November 4, 1971}}\n\nThough there was initially strong\npublic interest in the new dollar, from the very start the coin still failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in conjunction with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, and then stopped circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin's bulky size and weight, and the lack of potential uses for it.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=40}} Even so, it was successful in quickly replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos.{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} According to numismatist Randy Camper, over 70% of \"circulating\" Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}}<!-- Essay by Camper in volume --> Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, few machines were modified to accept the coins.{{sfn|Herbert}} Lange recalled, \"The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don't recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them.\"{{sfn|Lange}}\n\n==Production==\n===Early years (1971\u20131974)===\n[[File:1973-S Blue Ike.jpg|thumb|right|1973-S \"blue Ike\": envelope, pliofilm coin holder, and printed insert]]\nThe Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin.

Bailey noted, \"the circulation value of the coin has been nil\".{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2870}} Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 24, 1971}} More than 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} In May 1972, Treasury Secretary [[John Connally]], testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as \"just unconscionable\", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|May 11, 1972}}\n\nThe 1972 silver pieces were again struck at San Francisco.

Over the years, many 1973 and 1973-D dollar coins have been found in circulation, leading to speculation that the 230,798 pieces which were reported melted after the Mint failed to sell as many mint sets as anticipated, were released into circulation.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2877, 2880}} John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, citing a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C.

Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.{{sfn|Breen|1988|pp=581\u2013582}}\n\nThe American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was established by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the \"Bicentennial\"). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector's sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776\u20131976.

Williams, the youngest person to that point to design a U.S. coin, had submitted a design depicting the [[Liberty Bell]] superimposed against the Moon. Gasparro slightly modified the design, simplifying the features visible on the lunar surface, and altering the lettering and the bell.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=424}} Williams and the designers of the other denominations operated the presses to strike the first coins on August 12, 1974; a set of these prototypes was later given to the new president, [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=472}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|pp=424\u2013425}} Williams' design was liked by the public but attracted criticism from some numismatists as the Liberty Bell had been previously used on coinage (for example, on the [[Franklin half dollar]]).{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} Fearing that a low-mintage 1975 piece would be hoarded, the Mint obtained legislation in December 1974 allowing it to continue coining 1974-dated pieces until it began coinage of Bicentennial pieces.{{sfn|Ganz|1976|pp=66\u201368}}\n\nThe Bicentennial dollars were the first of the three denominations to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=10}} The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=503}} The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces.

It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations.

An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have differentiated it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines. Such exotic metals as titanium were considered before the Mint decided on the standard clad composition.

Anthony]].{{sfn|Ganz July 1979|pp=49, 52}} Many in the new Congress and in the Carter Administration were social progressives, and supported [[women's lib]]. Ohio Representative [[Mary Rose Oakar]] also introduced legislation for a [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]] in October 1978; it proceeded rapidly through [[95th United States Congress|Congress]] and was signed by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin. Anthony's stern expression caused some to dub it the \"Susan B. Agony\" dollar. The Eisenhower dollar's reverse was used for the Anthony dollar. Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces, the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2, 1979. It need not have worried; the public quickly rejected the new coin as too close in size and weight to the quarter dollar, and production for circulation ceased after 1980.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2929\u20132930}} Mint Director [[Stella Hackel Sims]] stated, \"people are accustomed to the Eisenhower dollar, but in time, they'll become accustomed to the Susan\".{{sfn|Logan October 1979|p=101}} Attempts were made to give the new smaller dollars out as change in postal transactions, and to force their use by U.S. military personnel in Europe; both failed.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2930}}\n\nThe Eisenhower dollar is the final regular-issue dollar coin to have been minted in silver (collectors and proof issues were minted with a purity of 40% Ag<ref>{{Cite book|last=Yeoman, R.

However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and most pieces acquired nicks, scratches or \"bag marks\" from contact with each other soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars due to the lack of precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can on face value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2858}} A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine [[coin grading|MS-67]] condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925. According to numismatic writer Steve Reach, \"as more people submit modern-era coins like Eisenhower dollars for third-party certification, the true rarity of many issues in top-grades is becoming clear.\"{{sfn|Reach}}\n\nSome of the 1971-D pieces exhibit a variety in which (among several differences) the eagle lacks brow lines, these have been dubbed by Eisenhower dollar specialists the \"Friendly Eagle Pattern\".{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58\u201359}} The 1972 dollar struck at Philadelphia is broken down into three varieties, which were made as Gasparro adjusted the design to take advantage of better steel being used in the Mint's dies. A midyear change in the design was announced by Brooks at the [[American Numismatic Association]]'s 1972 convention in New Orleans, although she did not state exactly what was being changed. The three varieties may be differentiated by examining the depiction of the Earth on the reverse. Type I dollars show the Earth somewhat flattened, Florida pointing to the southeast, with the islands mostly to the southeast of the tip of the peninsula. The Earth is round and Florida points to the south on the Type II, with a single, large island to the southeast. The Type III is similar to the Type II, except that there are two islands directly to the south of the peninsula.{{sfn|1972 varieties}} The Type II is from a single reverse die, used in March 1972, and erroneously placed in service at Philadelphia\u2014it is identical to and should have been used for the silver proof strikes at San Francisco. The Type III was placed in service, replacing the Type I, in September 1972.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=7}} The Type I is most common; the Type III design was used in 1973 and after. The 1972 Type II is expensive in top grades, as is the 1776\u20131976 Type I from Philadelphia, which was only available in mint sets.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Hicks|p=644}}\n\nSome 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) have the [[serif]]s at the foot of the \"R\" in \"LIBERTY\" missing; this is dubbed the \"peg leg\" variety.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The serifs are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint obtained better steel for dies, the serifs returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks serifs on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower's head during the coin's tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn 1974 and again in 1977, the [[Denver Mint]] struck a small number of pieces on silver-clad planchets, or blanks. Both times, these came from planchets which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found independently by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2890, 2917}} The 1974 planchets were initially intended to be used for \"brown Ike\" proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof planchets were to be used for uncirculated \"blue Ikes\", but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof planchets, intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776\u20131976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}\n\nBowers notes that the [[Morgan dollar]] (struck between 1878 and 1921) was not widely collected at the time, only to become very popular later, and suggests that one day, the turn of the Eisenhower dollar will come.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2857}} Numismatist Charles Morgan said of the Eisenhower dollar in 2012,\n\n{{quote |\nIt stands today as the greatest achievement in clad coinage in U.S. history. It was the most technically challenging coin ever attempted&nbsp; ... Researching the Eisenhower Dollar is vital for numismatic historians who want to understand what the post-silver era was like.

In this respect, it truly is a perfect collectible coin.{{sfn|Morgan}}\n}}\n\n==Mintage figures==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\nCirculation strikes:{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=252\u2013253, 345}}\n{{div col}}\n*1971 47,799,000\n*1971-D 68,587,424\n*1972 75,890,000\n*1972-D 92,548,511\n*1973 1,769,258\n*1973-D 1,769,258\n*1974 27,366,000\n*1974-D  45,517,000\n:''(No dollars dated 1975)''\n*1776\u20131976 Type I 4,019,000\n*1776\u20131976-D Type I 21,048,710\n*1776\u20131976 Type II 113,318,000\n*1776\u20131976-D Type II 82,179,564\n*1977 12,596,000\n*1977-D 32,983,006\n*1978 25,702,000\n*1978-D 33,102,890\n{{div col end}}\n{{col-break}}\nUncirculated silver:{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=252\u2013253, 345}}\n*1971-S 6,868,530 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1972-S  2,193,056 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1973-S  1,883,140 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1974-S 1,900,156 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1776\u20131976-S 4,908,319 (3-coin Bicentennial set)\n{{col-break}}\nProof:{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=252\u2013253, 345}}\n*1971-S silver 4,265,234 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1972-S silver 1,811,631 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1973-S clad  2,760,339 (Regular annual set)\n*1973-S silver 1,013,646 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1974-S clad 2,612,568 (Regular annual set)\n*1974-S silver 1,306,579 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1776\u20131976-S clad Type I 2,845,450 (1975 regular annual set)\n*1776\u20131976-S clad Type II 4,149,730 (1976 regular annual set)\n*1976-S silver 3,998,621 (3-coin Bicentennial set)\n*1977-S 3,251,152 (Regular annual set)\n*1978-S 3,127,781 (Regular annual set)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Money|Numismatics|United States}}\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book\n| last = Bowers\n| first = Q.

The coin depicts [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]], and a stylized image honoring the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] Moon mission on the reverse, with both sides designed by [[Frank Gasparro]] (the reverse is based on the Apollo 11 mission patch designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]]). It is the only large-size U.S. dollar coin whose circulation strikes contained no silver.\n\nIn 1965, because of rises in bullion prices, the Mint began to strike copper-nickel [[cladding (metalworking)|clad]] coins instead of silver. No dollar coins had been issued in thirty years, but beginning in 1969, legislators sought to reintroduce a dollar coin into commerce. After Eisenhower died that March, there were a number of proposals to honor him with the new coin. While these bills generally commanded wide support, enactment was delayed by a dispute over whether the new coin should be in base metal or 40% silver. In 1970, a compromise was reached to strike the Eisenhower dollar in base metal for circulation, and in 40% silver as a collectible. President [[Richard Nixon]], who had served as [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] under Eisenhower, signed legislation authorizing mintage of the new coin on December 31, 1970.\n\nAlthough the collector's pieces sold well, the new dollars failed to circulate to any degree, except in and around [[Nevada]] casinos, where they took the place of privately issued tokens. There are no dollars dated 1975; coins from that year and from 1976 bear a double date 1776\u20131976, and a special reverse by Dennis R. Williams in honor of the [[United States Bicentennial|bicentennial of American independence]]. Beginning in 1977, the Mint sought to replace the Eisenhower dollar with a smaller-sized piece. Congress authorized the [[Susan B. Anthony dollar]], struck beginning in 1979, but that coin also failed to circulate. Given their modest cost and the short length of the series, complete sets of Eisenhower dollars are inexpensive to assemble and are becoming more popular among coin collectors. \n\n==Background==\n{{Further|Peace dollar#Striking of 1964-D dollars|Coinage Act of 1965#Coin shortage}}\nThe silver dollar had never been a popular coin, circulating little except in the West; it served as a means of monetizing metal and generally sat in bank vaults once struck. The [[Peace dollar]], the last circulating dollar made of silver, was not struck after 1935, and in most years in the quarter century after that, the bullion value of a silver dollar did not exceed 70 cents. In the early 1960s, though, silver prices rose, and the huge stocks of silver dollars in the hands of banks and the government were obtained by the public through the redemption of [[Silver certificate (United States)|silver certificates]]. This caused shortages of silver dollars in the western states where the pieces circulated, and interests there sought the issuance of more dollars.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2842\u20132846}}\n\nOn August 3, 1964, [[88th United States Congress|Congress]] passed legislation providing for the striking of 45 million silver dollars. This legislation was enacted when coins vanished from circulation as the price of silver rose past $1.29 per ounce, making silver dollars worth more as bullion than as currency. The new pieces were intended to be used at Nevada casinos and elsewhere in the West where \"hard money\" was popular. Numismatic periodicals complained that striking the dollars was a waste of resources.{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=461}} The law had been passed at the urging of the [[Senate Majority Leader]], [[Mike Mansfield]] (Democrat\u2013Montana), who represented a state that heavily used silver dollars.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=78}} Despite the efforts of Mint Director [[Eva Adams]] and her staff to persuade him, Senator Mansfield refused to consider any cancellation or delay, and on May 12, 1965 the [[Denver Mint]] began striking 1964-D Peace dollars{{sfn|Burdette|2005|p=86}}\u2014the Mint had obtained congressional authorization to continue striking 1964-dated coins into 1965.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 13, 1964}}\n\nA public announcement of the new pieces was made on May 15, 1965,{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=87\u201388}} only to be met with a storm of objections. Both the public and many congressmen saw the issue as a poor use of Mint resources at a time of severe coin shortages, which would only benefit coin dealers. On May 24, one day before a hastily called congressional hearing, Adams announced that the pieces were deemed trial strikes, never intended for circulation. The Mint later stated that 316,076 pieces had been struck; all were reported melted amid heavy security. To ensure that there would be no repetition, [[89th United States Congress|Congress]] inserted a provision in the [[Coinage Act of 1965]] forbidding the coinage of silver dollars for five years.{{sfn|Burdette|2005|pp=98\u2013101}} That act also removed silver from the dime and quarter, and reduced the silver content of the half dollar to 40%.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=36}}\n\n==Inception==\n[[File:1964 Peace dollar restrike.jpg|thumb|left|200px|An unofficially produced 1964-D Peace dollar, struck over a genuine silver dollar by a private mint]]\nIn 1969, [[Richard Nixon|Nixon administration]] Mint Director [[Mary Brooks]] sought the reissuance of the dollar coin. By this time, rising bullion prices threatened the continued use of silver in the [[Kennedy half dollar]], but Brooks hoped to maintain the dollar as a silver coin. Brooks' proposal for a new silver dollar was opposed by the chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Banking Committee]], [[Wright Patman]], who had been persuaded, against his better judgment, by Nixon's predecessor, [[Lyndon Johnson]], to support the continued use of silver in the half dollar.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=37}}\n\nOn March 28, 1969, former president and World War II general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] died. Soon after, New Jersey Representative [[Florence Dwyer]], like Eisenhower, a Republican, suggested that the proposed dollar coin bear his likeness.

It also called for the elimination of silver from the half dollar, and for the transfer from the Treasury to the [[General Services Administration]] (GSA) of quantities of rare silver dollars, so they could be sold. Giaimo noted that the coin would be useful in casinos, which were striking their own tokens in the absence of circulating dollar coins, and in the vending industry, which was starting to sell higher-priced items.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|June 15, 1969}}\n\nOn October 3, 1969, the House Banking Committee passed legislation for a silverless Eisenhower dollar, with Patman stating that he hoped to have it approved by the full House in time for the late president's birthday on October 14.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 4, 1969}} On October 6, the bill's sponsors lost a procedural vote which would have allowed for no amendments. While some representatives spoke against the manner in which the legislation was to be considered, Iowa Congressman [[H. R. Gross]] objected to the base-metal composition of the proposed coin: \"You would be doing the memory of President Eisenhower no favor to mint a dollar made perhaps of scrap metal.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 7, 1969}} Both houses voted on October 14, Eisenhower's birthday. Although the House passed the administration-backed bill for a base metal dollar, the Senate passed the bill as amended by Colorado Senator [[Peter Dominick]], calling for the piece to be minted in 40% silver. Instrumental in the passage of the Senate amendment was a letter from [[Mamie Eisenhower]], recalling that her husband had liked to give silver dollars as mementoes, and had gone to some effort to obtain coins struck in the year of his birth, 1890.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 15, 1969}}{{sfn|''The Bulletin''|October 15, 1969}} Idaho Senator [[James A. McClure|James McClure]] stated, \"It is somehow beneath the dignity of a great president like General Eisenhower to withhold silver from the coin.\" On October 29, 1969, Texas Representative [[Robert R. Casey]] introduced legislation to honor both Eisenhower and the recent [[Apollo 11]] [[Moon landing]]. These provisions would become part of the enacted bill authorizing the Eisenhower dollar.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2860}} Casey originally wanted the mission theme of Apollo 11, \"We came in peace for all mankind,\" to appear on the coin; when the Mint informed him that there was not room for that inscription, he settled for requiring that the reverse design be emblematic of that theme.{{sfn|Ike Group|p=57}}\n\nIn March 1970, the two houses reached a compromise whereby 150 million dollars would be struck in the 40% silver alloy for collectors and others. The circulating dollar, though, would have no silver and would be struck in larger quantities.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|March 8, 1970}} The 47.4 million troy ounces of silver needed to strike the collectors' pieces would come from bullion already held by the government. The compromise was worked out by McClure and other congressional Republicans, with the aid of Brooks, an Idahoan. McClure described the deal as \"a lot less than the country deserves, but a lot more than it appeared we would get.\" {{sfn|''Spokane Daily Chronicle''|March 6, 1970}} The reason for having a collector's edition with silver was to avoid the hoarding which had driven the Kennedy half dollar from circulation.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=29}}\n\nAlthough the compromise passed the Senate in March 1970,{{sfn|''The Spokesman-Review''|March 20, 1970}} it was blocked in the House by Representative Patman, who was determined to end silver in the coinage. The Senate passed the bill again in September, this time attaching it as a [[rider (legislation)|rider]] to a bank holding company bill sought by Patman. The bill, which also included provisions to eliminate silver from the half dollar and to transfer the rare silver dollars to the GSA, was approved by a [[conference committee]] and passed both houses. Nixon had intended to let the bill pass into law without his signature. When aides realized that as [[91st United States Congress|Congress]] had adjourned, not signing the bill would [[pocket veto]] it, on December 31, 1970, Nixon hastily signed it only minutes before the midnight deadline.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|pp=37, 40}}{{sfn|Gilkes}}{{sfn|''The New York Times''|September 17, 1970}}\n\n==Design==\n[[File:Apollo 11 insignia.png|thumb|left|The [[Apollo 11]] mission insignia, designed by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]], served as the basis of the Eisenhower dollar's reverse.]]\nFor Mint Chief Engraver [[Frank Gasparro]], the opportunity to put Eisenhower on a coin was the fulfillment of a longtime dream. On June 19, 1945, Gasparro had been one of more than 4 million people who gathered in New York to watch a parade celebrating the Allied victory in Europe. Although Gasparro, then an assistant engraver at the Mint, only saw a glimpse of General Eisenhower, he stepped back from the crowd and drew the general's features. That sketch served as the basis of his design for the obverse. Gasparro consulted with the late president's widow, [[Mamie Eisenhower]], as to the designs of both sides of the coin; the former [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] was presented with a galvano (a metallic model used in the coin design process) by Brooks and Gasparro on January 1, 1971.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} Gasparro wrote in 1991 that he had six weeks to complete the work beginning in mid-November 1970, that his extensive research into eagles over the years was a great help in creating the reverse, and that his sketches were adopted without change. The chief engraver was not given full freedom of design; he was instructed to have the layout of the obverse resemble that of the [[Washington quarter]].{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}}\n\nBefore the legislation passed, Gasparro had prepared two reverses, the one actually used, and a reverse with a more formal [[spreadeagle (heraldry)|heraldic eagle]], which numismatic historian and coin dealer [[Q. David Bowers]] finds reminiscent of [[pattern coin]]s prepared in the 1870s. At Congress's insistence, the chief engraver created a design in commemoration of the [[Apollo 11]] lunar landing, based on the [[mission patch]] conceived by astronaut [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] and others. Bowers deems the choice of the lunar landing \"a stroke of genius,\" allowing the dollar, which would be little-used in commerce, to be a commemorative both of Eisenhower and of the Moon mission.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The reverse depicts an eagle (representing the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar lander]], ''Eagle'') swooping low over the Moon's surface, holding an olive branch, token of peace, in its claws.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}\n\nThe use of Collins' mission patch design had initially been opposed by some government officials because of the fierce expression of the eagle; Gasparro's initial concept met similar objections. The Mint Director recalled that Gasparro had gone to the [[Philadelphia Zoo]] to look at eagles, and on his return had prepared a design which she felt emphasized the eagle's predatory nature.{{sfn|Wolenik March 1971|p=34}} Brooks informed Gasparro that the eagle was \"too fierce, too warlike, a little too aggressive\" and asked that the expression be made friendlier. Gasparro, who reportedly was unhappy at having to change the eagle,{{sfn|Ike Group|p=58}} described the final version as \"pleasant looking.\"{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}} The [[United States Department of State|State Department]] also feared that the eagle's expression might offend, and sought a neutral visage.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} The distant Earth may be seen above the bird, and there are 13 stars in honor of the original states.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|January 24, 1971}}\n\nBowers deems the bust of Eisenhower \"well modeled\" by Gasparro, and notes that the fact that the eagle on the reverse holds only an olive branch, rather than arrows as well (token of war), \"meant that the public would like the design.\"{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2851}} Nevertheless, he notes that Eisenhower's stern expression was widely criticized as not typical of a man noted for geniality.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2855}} Numismatic author David Lange opines that \"the Eisenhower dollar is one of the poorest products to emanate from the U.S. Mint.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Lange writes that, although Gasparro had designed only one side of the coin for the Kennedy half dollar and [[Lincoln cent#Lincoln Memorial design (1959\u20132008)|Lincoln Memorial reverse]] for the cent, \"the Eisenhower dollar was his design alone and should have served as a showcase for his talent. Sadly, it is a mediocre design that reveals his typically unnatural treatment of Ike's hair and the eagle's feathers.\"{{sfn|Lange}} Some collectors complained after the release that the Earth was not fully shown, not realizing that Gasparro had carefully followed the mission badge. The chief engraver responded by clarifying the design.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}\n\n==Release==\n[[File:Eisenhower design.png|thumb|right|The Eisenhower dollar's design as released by the Treasury in January 1971 (probably from photographs of the galvano)]]\nTwo prototype dollars were struck at the [[Philadelphia Mint]] on January 25, 1971; they were subsequently destroyed.{{sfn|Bailey|p=10}} However, collectors have found at least two 1971-S coins that have been certified as prototypes.<ref>[http://www.ikegroup.info/chapter34/chapter34.pdf THE LYDSTON AND CHATHAM 1971-S PROTOTYPE IKES]</ref>  Striking such large pieces of tough copper-nickel proved destructive to the Mint's dies, and Gasparro repeatedly used the Janvier [[reducing lathe]] to lower the relief to be used on the circulation strikes and the uncirculated silver clad coins. The chief engraver altered the resulting master die directly to restore at least some of the detail which was lost as the relief was lowered. The proof coins struck at San Francisco, nevertheless, remained in high relief.{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58\u201359}} This meant that in 1971 and for much of 1972 (until better-quality steel was used in the dies), the uncirculated strikes had a lower relief, less detailed surface, compared with the proof coins. Proof coins are struck slowly, and generally multiple times, to bring out the full detail.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=6\u20137}} Striking of Eisenhower dollars for circulation began at Denver on February 3, apparently without any ceremony; minting at Philadelphia also began early in the year, although Bowers, in his comprehensive encyclopedia of silver and clad dollar coins, does not record a specific date.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2860, 2864}} The first Eisenhower dollars in 40% silver, with an uncirculated finish, were struck at the San Francisco Assay Office (today the [[San Francisco Mint]]) on March 31, 1971; Brooks ceremoniously operated the presses.

Many were hoarded by collectors; there was initially sufficient demand for the coins that many banks imposed a limit of one coin per customer. The clad pieces were struck from coinage strip purchased by the Mint from contractors. Many were not well-struck, causing collectors to purchase rolls in search of better specimens. An oily film was found on a large number of the coins; these coins were cleaned by collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}}{{sfn|''Youngstown Vindicator''|November 4, 1971}}\n\nThough there was initially strong\npublic interest in the new dollar, from the very start the coin still failed to circulate. In 1976, a Treasury study done in conjunction with a private-sector firm found that the Eisenhower dollar had a near-100 percent attrition rate, that is, almost always, a coin was used in only one transaction, and then stopped circulating (by comparison, the attrition rate of the quarter was close to zero). This was because of the coin's bulky size and weight, and the lack of potential uses for it.{{sfn|Logan May 1979|p=40}} Even so, it was successful in quickly replacing private-issue tokens in Nevada casinos.{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} According to numismatist Randy Camper, over 70% of \"circulating\" Eisenhower dollars were used in casinos.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}}<!-- Essay by Camper in volume --> Although the vending machine industry lobbied for the Eisenhower dollar, few machines were modified to accept the coins.{{sfn|Herbert}} Lange recalled, \"The fact is that these coins never circulated outside of casinos and nearby areas, and I don't recall ever seeing a vending machine that accepted them.\"{{sfn|Lange}}\n\n==Production==\n===Early years (1971\u20131974)===\n[[File:1973-S Blue Ike.jpg|thumb|right|1973-S \"blue Ike\": envelope, pliofilm coin holder, and printed insert]]\nThe Mint struck over 125 million of the Eisenhower dollars in 1971, more than doubling its largest annual production for a dollar coin.

Bailey noted, \"the circulation value of the coin has been nil\".{{sfn|Bailey|p=9}} Many Eisenhower dollars were put aside as souvenirs by non-collectors.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2870}} Nevertheless, the silver coins sold so well that in October 1971, Mint Director Brooks warned that orders for 1971-S proof dollars would not all be filled until well into 1972. She ascribed the delay to the large public demand and to production difficulties which she indicated had been corrected.{{sfn|''The New York Times''|October 24, 1971}} More than 11 million of the 1971-S silver pieces were sold, in proof and uncirculated, with nearly 7 million in proof.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2866}} In May 1972, Treasury Secretary [[John Connally]], testifying before a Senate committee, described the profits the Mint had made on the silver version of the Eisenhower dollar as \"just unconscionable\", with the average profit on a silver coin at $3.89, and expected to increase as production became more efficient. Mint officials felt that reducing the price would anger those who had already purchased the pieces.{{sfn|Toledo ''Blade''|May 11, 1972}}\n\nThe 1972 silver pieces were again struck at San Francisco.

Over the years, many 1973 and 1973-D dollar coins have been found in circulation, leading to speculation that the 230,798 pieces which were reported melted after the Mint failed to sell as many mint sets as anticipated, were released into circulation.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2877, 2880}} John Wexler, Bill Crawford, and Kevin Flynn, in their volume on Eisenhower dollars, deny this, citing a 1974 letter from Assistant Director of the Mint for Public Services Roy C.

Various problems with the issues, including mishandling of distributions and complaints that public coins should not be used for private profit, resulted in firm Treasury Department opposition to such issues, and none were struck after 1954.{{sfn|Breen|1988|pp=581\u2013582}}\n\nThe American Revolutionary Bicentennial Commission (ARBC) was established by Congress in 1966 as an oversight body for the 1976 two-hundredth anniversary of American independence (the \"Bicentennial\"). In 1970, its coins and medals advisory committee recommended the issuance of a special half dollar, and subsequently the committee sought the temporary redesign of circulating American coins. Brooks and the Mint initially opposed legislation to effect these proposals, but eventually Brooks supported legislation to redesign the reverses of the quarter, half dollar and dollar coins, and to issue special collector's sets in silver clad. Legislation to authorize this was signed by President Nixon on October 18, 1973. By the terms of this legislation, coins of these denomination minted for delivery after July 4, 1975 and before December 31, 1976 would bear special reverses, and also be dated 1776\u20131976.

Williams, the youngest person to that point to design a U.S. coin, had submitted a design depicting the [[Liberty Bell]] superimposed against the Moon. Gasparro slightly modified the design, simplifying the features visible on the lunar surface, and altering the lettering and the bell.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=424}} Williams and the designers of the other denominations operated the presses to strike the first coins on August 12, 1974; a set of these prototypes was later given to the new president, [[Gerald Ford]].{{sfn|Breen|1988|p=472}}{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|pp=424\u2013425}} Williams' design was liked by the public but attracted criticism from some numismatists as the Liberty Bell had been previously used on coinage (for example, on the [[Franklin half dollar]]).{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2852}} Fearing that a low-mintage 1975 piece would be hoarded, the Mint obtained legislation in December 1974 allowing it to continue coining 1974-dated pieces until it began coinage of Bicentennial pieces.{{sfn|Ganz|1976|pp=66\u201368}}\n\nThe Bicentennial dollars were the first of the three denominations to be struck for distribution to the public; these were coined beginning in February 1975.{{sfn|''Coin World Almanac''|1977|p=10}} The silver pieces were struck at San Francisco beginning on April 23, 1975.{{sfn|Marotta|2001|p=503}} The Mint found that the copper nickel dollar was striking indistinctly, a problem not seen with the silver pieces.

It engaged a private firm to study the six current denominations of U.S. coinage, and make recommendations. The firm concluded in its report that the Eisenhower dollar was too large and heavy to circulate effectively, but if the diameter was reduced by about a third, and the weight by two-thirds, it might be used.{{sfn|CoinAge May 1979}} That report found that \"the Eisenhower dollar has not been widely accepted by the public because of its large size and weight\".{{sfn|Logan July 1979|p=42}} In January 1977, just prior to leaving office, Ford's Treasury Secretary, [[William E.

An 11-sided coin was considered, which would have differentiated it from the quarter, but the patterns would not work in vending machines.

Gasparro was given photographs of Anthony and told to reproduce her appearance exactly on the coin. Anthony's stern expression caused some to dub it the \"Susan B. Agony\" dollar. The Eisenhower dollar's reverse was used for the Anthony dollar. Convinced that the public would hoard the new pieces, the Mint Bureau produced half a billion before its official release to the public on July 2, 1979.

However, many were badly struck, without full detail, especially in 1971 and 1972, and most pieces acquired nicks, scratches or \"bag marks\" from contact with each other soon after striking. Although lower-grade silver coins can be melted, this is not practical for Eisenhower dollars due to the lack of precious metal content, and dealers often try to get any premium they can on face value. Completing a set of highest-grade specimens may be difficult and expensive, especially for the 1971 and 1972 from Philadelphia or Denver, which were not sold in mint sets, and thus only came to collectors through banks.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2858}} A 1973-D piece, tied with ten other specimens for the finest known of that date and mint mark in near-pristine [[coin grading|MS-67]] condition sold in June 2013 for $12,925. According to numismatic writer Steve Reach, \"as more people submit modern-era coins like Eisenhower dollars for third-party certification, the true rarity of many issues in top-grades is becoming clear.\"{{sfn|Reach}}\n\nSome of the 1971-D pieces exhibit a variety in which (among several differences) the eagle lacks brow lines, these have been dubbed by Eisenhower dollar specialists the \"Friendly Eagle Pattern\".{{sfn|Ike Group|pp=58\u201359}} The 1972 dollar struck at Philadelphia is broken down into three varieties, which were made as Gasparro adjusted the design to take advantage of better steel being used in the Mint's dies. A midyear change in the design was announced by Brooks at the [[American Numismatic Association]]'s 1972 convention in New Orleans, although she did not state exactly what was being changed. The three varieties may be differentiated by examining the depiction of the Earth on the reverse. Type I dollars show the Earth somewhat flattened, Florida pointing to the southeast, with the islands mostly to the southeast of the tip of the peninsula. The Earth is round and Florida points to the south on the Type II, with a single, large island to the southeast. The Type III is similar to the Type II, except that there are two islands directly to the south of the peninsula.{{sfn|1972 varieties}} The Type II is from a single reverse die, used in March 1972, and erroneously placed in service at Philadelphia\u2014it is identical to and should have been used for the silver proof strikes at San Francisco. The Type III was placed in service, replacing the Type I, in September 1972.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=7}} The Type I is most common; the Type III design was used in 1973 and after. The 1972 Type II is expensive in top grades, as is the 1776\u20131976 Type I from Philadelphia, which was only available in mint sets.{{sfn|Morgan}}{{sfn|Hicks|p=644}}\n\nSome 1971-S proof pieces (and a few uncirculated 1971-S) have the [[serif]]s at the foot of the \"R\" in \"LIBERTY\" missing; this is dubbed the \"peg leg\" variety.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=8, 202}} The serifs are missing on all 1972-S, both uncirculated and proof. After the Mint obtained better steel for dies, the serifs returned for all of the remaining non-Bicentennial coinage, from all mints, though the leg of the R was shortened, and also for the Type II Bicentennial (the Type I lacks serifs on the R). Gasparro was often trying to improve the detail of Eisenhower's head during the coin's tenure, and as the R is the letter closest to it, these changes were most likely made in an effort to improve the flow of metal as the coins were struck.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|pp=182\u2013184}}\n\nIn 1974 and again in 1977, the [[Denver Mint]] struck a small number of pieces on silver-clad planchets, or blanks. Both times, these came from planchets which had been shipped from the San Francisco Assay Office to Denver. The first ones in 1974 were found independently by two Las Vegas blackjack dealers.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|pp=2852, 2890, 2917}} The 1974 planchets were initially intended to be used for \"brown Ike\" proof strikings; Mint policy then was that rejected silver proof planchets were to be used for uncirculated \"blue Ikes\", but these were placed in the bin for rejected copper-nickel proof planchets, intended to be shipped to be coined for circulation at Denver. The 1977 pieces resulted from pieces rejected for Bicentennial silver proof use, which were again placed in the wrong bin (they should have been melted, as the Mint was no longer striking silver uncirculated Eisenhower dollars). Between 10 and 20 of each date are known. Wexler, Crawford, and Flynn report an even rarer 1776\u20131976-D dollar in silver, but state that none have been offered at auction or submitted to the major coin grading services.{{sfn|Wexler|Crawford|Flynn|2007|p=8}}\n\nBowers notes that the [[Morgan dollar]] (struck between 1878 and 1921) was not widely collected at the time, only to become very popular later, and suggests that one day, the turn of the Eisenhower dollar will come.{{sfn|Bowers|1993|p=2857}} Numismatist Charles Morgan said of the Eisenhower dollar in 2012,\n\n{{quote |\nIt stands today as the greatest achievement in clad coinage in U.S. history. It was the most technically challenging coin ever attempted&nbsp; ... Researching the Eisenhower Dollar is vital for numismatic historians who want to understand what the post-silver era was like. The Eisenhower Dollar was a noble failure. In this respect, it truly is a perfect collectible coin.{{sfn|Morgan}}\n}}\n\n==Mintage figures==\n{{col-begin}}{{col-break}}\nCirculation strikes:{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=252\u2013253, 345}}\n{{div col}}\n*1971 47,799,000\n*1971-D 68,587,424\n*1972 75,890,000\n*1972-D 92,548,511\n*1973 1,769,258\n*1973-D 1,769,258\n*1974 27,366,000\n*1974-D  45,517,000\n:''(No dollars dated 1975)''\n*1776\u20131976 Type I 4,019,000\n*1776\u20131976-D Type I 21,048,710\n*1776\u20131976 Type II 113,318,000\n*1776\u20131976-D Type II 82,179,564\n*1977 12,596,000\n*1977-D 32,983,006\n*1978 25,702,000\n*1978-D 33,102,890\n{{div col end}}\n{{col-break}}\nUncirculated silver:{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=252\u2013253, 345}}\n*1971-S 6,868,530 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1972-S  2,193,056 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1973-S  1,883,140 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1974-S 1,900,156 (\"blue Ike\")\n*1776\u20131976-S 4,908,319 (3-coin Bicentennial set)\n{{col-break}}\nProof:{{sfn|Yeoman|2013|pp=252\u2013253, 345}}\n*1971-S silver 4,265,234 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1972-S silver 1,811,631 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1973-S clad  2,760,339 (Regular annual set)\n*1973-S silver 1,013,646 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1974-S clad 2,612,568 (Regular annual set)\n*1974-S silver 1,306,579 (\"brown Ike\")\n*1776\u20131976-S clad Type I 2,845,450 (1975 regular annual set)\n*1776\u20131976-S clad Type II 4,149,730 (1976 regular annual set)\n*1976-S silver 3,998,621 (3-coin Bicentennial set)\n*1977-S 3,251,152 (Regular annual set)\n*1978-S 3,127,781 (Regular annual set)\n{{col-end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Portal|Money|Numismatics|United States}}\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*{{cite book\n| last = Bowers\n| first = Q.
