Despite rebellions and other challenges, he is known as an effective ruler who brought long-term stability while he remained in power, and is especially notable as one of the greatest patrons of architecture in the Mamluk period, and particularly of the [[Burji dynasty|Burji Mamluk]] period which was otherwise marked by Egypt's relative decline.<ref name=\"Raymond1993\">Raymond, Andr\u00e9. 1993.

The ground floor extends eastwards, thereby entering the Haram al-Sharif, and stretches out over the western wall of the Haram. This is contrary to the other ''madrasa''s in the vicinity, since the Mamluk ''madrasa''s were erected on the borders of the ''Haram'' (Sanctuary) and not within it. The entrance to the Madrasa opens on the eastern and southern side with two tapered arches. The entrance is covered by a fan-shaped vault, built of alternating colours of red and white stone. The door is set into a recessed wall covered by a semi-dome, and enriched with carved decorations that are also inset with glazed ceramic tiles. Standing on either side of the entrance are two ''mastabas'' of stone. And at the height of two courses from the surfaces of the ''mastabas'', there is an inscription stating the date of constructionand extolling the most prominent titles of Sultan Qaytbay. The entrance leads to the vestibule, to the north of which was once a large hall known as the assembly hall (Qa'at al-Majma'). On the eastern wall of the hall there is a door and two windows opening onto the terrace of the Haram al-Sharif. In the northern wall there is also an entrance and window; while on the southern wall there is another window and a ''mihrab'' decorated with coloured marble. Once the assembly hall of the Aqsa Mosque Library, it has recently become a training centre for the restoration and preservation of manuscripts and documents.To the south of the vestibule there is a stone stairwell which leads to the first floor and to a minaret that towers above Bab al-Silsila. The first floor of the ''madrasa'' consists of a hall, which has four ''iwans'' in a cruciform plan; the largest being the southern ''iwan,'' which contains the ''mihrab''. Today large parts of the first floor are in ruins, and nothing remains of the ''iwan''s except the walls. Despite this, the ground plan is clearly evident, for it corresponds with the Mamluk design of the four-''iwan'' cruciform plan, in the middle of which is the central courtyard. <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://islamicart.museumwnf.org/database_item.php?id=monument;ISL;pa;Mon01;8;en&pageD=N|title=Discover Islamic Art - Virtual Museum - monument_ISL_pa_Mon01_8_en|website=islamicart.museumwnf.org|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nThe madrasa was centered around a large rectangular courtyard similar to those built by Qaytbay earlier at [[Complex of Sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay|his own funerary mosque-madrasa]] in Cairo and in other late Mamluk madrasas of the period. However, the eastern side of the courtyard was taken up by a triple-arched [[loggia]] which, thanks to its elevated position, provided an unimpeded view of the Dome of the Rock. Living quarters for students were arranged around another upper courtyard or terrace built over the adjacent Baladiyya Madrasa.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|title=MIFAO 43 Mat\u00e9riaux pour un Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Part 2 Syrie du Sud T.1 J\u00e9rusalem \"Ville\"  |url=https://archive.org/details/MIFAO43|first=M.|last=Berchem, van|authorlink=Max van Berchem |year=1922|volume =| publisher=Impr. de l'Institut fran\u00e7ais d'arch\u00e9ologie orientale|location=Cairo|language=French, Arabic}} (pp. [https://archive.org/details/MIFAO43/page/n196/1up  352]\u2212374)\n\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qR_qAAAAMAAJ   |title=Mamluk Jerusalem |year=1987|author=Burgoyne, Michael Hamilton |authorlink= |isbn=090503533X}} (pp. 589\u2212605)\n\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTrdBAAAQBAJ |title=Pilgrimage, Sciences and Sufism: Islamic Art in the West Bank and Gaza|year=2013|author1=Hawari, M.|authorlink1= Mahmoud Hawari |author2= Yusuf Natsheh|author3= Nazmi Al-Ju'beh |publisher=Museum With No Frontiers, MWNF   |isbn=978-3902782113}}  (pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kTrdBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT88&pg=PT100  88]\u2013[https://books.google.com/books?id=kTrdBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PT88&pg=PT102 90])\n\n*{{cite journal|last=Marom|first=Roy |date= 2019|title=A short history of Mulabbis (Petah Tikva, Israel)|journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly |volume=151 |number=151:2|pages=134\u2013145|doi=10.1080/00310328.2019.1621734 }}\n\n*{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/histoiredejrus00ulayuoft|title=Histoire de J\u00e9rusalem et d'H\u00e9bron depuis Abraham jusqu'\u00e0 la fin du XVe si\u00e8cle de J.-C. : fragments de la Chronique de Moudjir-ed-dyn|year=1876|author=Moudjir ed-dyn|authorlink= Mujir al-Din|editor=Sauvaire}} (p.
