Muslims in Uttar Pradesh do not form a single ethnic community, but are differentiated by sectarian and [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradari]] divisions, as well as by language and geography. Nevertheless, the community shares some unifying cultural factors.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nMuch of [[Uttar Pradesh]] formed part of the various [[Delhi sultanate|Sultanate]] after 1205 CE and was ruled from their capital, Delhi. As a consequence of these invasions, there arose a community in what is now Uttar Pradesh, which was referred to as Hindustani Musalmans.\nEarly settlement of Northern Muslims was due to the invasions and then establishment of Turkic Sultanate in North India. Most Muslim in Northern India, particularly in Delhi and adjoining areas were of Turkic Origin or Turks. These Turks remained part of the establishment for a few centuries until very late in the [[Mughal Empire]], when there was mass migration from Persia and Afghan regions to Delhi. Consequently, Turks were pushed down the ladder as the Rulers and Courtiers of Delhi and became involved in farming and semi-skilled work. Famous Turkic Sufis include Nizamuddin Auliya, Amir Khusro etc. Mehroli was the first organized township of Turks who had built numerous Turkic Monuments such as Qutib Minar, Purana Qila, Turkman Darwaza etc. Turkic communities in India are currently recognized by their trades such as Turks Jhojhey, mainly live in Muzzafarnagar, Saharanpur, BulandShahar,Aligharh,  Ghaziabad, Hapur, Meerrut. While in early 12 century Turkic sultanet Ghorid, Khilzi, Gaznawied Turk's settled in Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal City. But During British regime & fall of Mughal empire in 1857 [[Chagatai Turk's]] [[Timurid Empire]] under the [[Mughal family]] also settaled in tarai belt of Rampur and [[Uttarakhand]]. Now they are known as Turk's Farmers. Some of the Turks also write \"Pasha\" in their surname in Uttar Pradesh. In medieval times, Some Afghan pashtun of Mardan division the term as [[Rohilla Pathan]] or [[Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathan]] also settaled & ruled during early 17th century till 1947 in [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], [[Barreilly]], [[Badaun]], [[Pilibhit]] [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Farukhabad]], [[Lakhimpur, Uttar Pradesh|Lakhimpur]], [[Kannoj]] district.  ''Hindustani Musalman'' was applied to those Muslims who were either converts to [[Islam]] or who had a long settled in [[India]] such as Ansari, Kureshi, Salmani, Ghosi etc. These Hindustani Musalmans did not form a single community, as they were divided by ethnic, linguistic and economic differences. Often these early settlers lived in fortified towns, known as [[Qasbah]]s. Important qasbas include [[Kakori]] in [[Lucknow District]], [[Sandila|Sandhila]] in [[Hardoi District]] and [[Zaidpur]] in [[Barabanki district|Barabanki]] District. With the rise of the [[Mongols]] under [[Genghis Khan]], there was an influx of Muslim refugees into [[North India]], many of whom settled in the provincial qasbas, bringing with them a Persianized culture. Many of these early settlers are the ancestors of the Abbasid persianized dynasty [[Sayyid of Uttar Pradesh|Sayyid]] in Lucknow, Faizabad, Hardoi, Juanpur. and [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] community In Azamgharh, Mubarakpur, Mau, Vanaras these qasbas, over time a number of cultural norms acrose, which still typify many Uttar Pradesh Muslim traditions.<ref>Muslims in India edited by Zafar Imam Orient Longman</ref> The [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultans of Delhi]] and their Mughal successors patronized the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Muslim culture: Islamic jurists of the [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] school, Persian literati who were [[Shia]] [[Ithn\u0101\u2018ashariyyah]] and [[Sufi]]s of several orders, including the [[Chishti]], [[Qadiri]] and [[Naqshbandi]]. These [[Sufi]] orders were particularly important in converting [[Hindu]]s to [[Islam]].<ref name=\"autogenerated823\">Muslim Peoples: volume 2: A World Ethnographic Survey edited by Richard Weekes pages 823 to 828</ref>\n\nFound among the [[Salafi]] are [[Iraqi biradri|Iraqis]] who migrated to Ballia and Ghazipur districts of Eastern part of the state in 16th century from Sindh, Pakistan and claim descent from [[Thaheem]] people of Sindh who are from the Arab tribe of [[Bani Tamim]] who migrated to Sindh during Arab conquest of Sindh in 711&nbsp;AD.\n\nThe [[Urdu language|Urdu]] speaking people of Uttar Pradesh has diverse roots. Many [[Sufi]] missionaries from Middle East and Central Asia migrated and settled in South Asia. Many natives converted to [[Islam]] due to the [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of South Asia. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later Mughal Empire ruled the [[North India|northern India]] region. During the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later Mughal Empire attracted Muslim refugees, [[Nobility|nobles]], [[Technocracy|technocrats]], [[bureaucrat]]s, soldiers, [[Merchant|traders]], scientists, architects, [[artisan]]s, teachers, poets, artists, theologians and [[Sufi]]s from the rest of the [[Muslim world]] and they migrated and settled in the South Asia. During the reign of [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Sultan Ghyasuddin Balban]] (1266\u20131286) thousands of Central Asian Muslims sought [[Right of asylum|asylum]] including more than of 15 sovereigns and their nobles due to the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran]]. At the court of [[Iltutmish|Sultan Iltemish]] in Delhi the first wave of these Muslim refugees escaping from the Central Asian [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|genocide]] perpetrated by the barbaric hordes of [[Genghis Khan]], brought administrators from [[Iran]], painters from China, theologians from [[Samarkand]], [[Nishapur]] and [[Bukhara]], divines and saints from all Muslim lands, craftsmen and men and maidens from every region, doctors adept in Greek medicine, philosophers from everywhere. The Muslims from various Northern provinces such as [[Hyderabad Deccan]], [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]], [[Sindh]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]], Gujarat, [[Kashmir]] and other parts of South Asia also moved to capitals of Muslim empire in Delhi and [[Agra]]. Millions of natives converted to [[Islam]] during the Muslim rule. [[Lodi dynasty]] was dominated by the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] soldiers from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Afghanistan]] who settled in the [[North India|northern India]]. After the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)]] Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] defeated the [[Lodi dynasty]] with [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Chagatai people|Chagatai]] and [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Uygur people|Uygur]] soldiers and nobility. These Central Asian Turk soldiers and nobles were awarded estates and they settled with their families in the northern India. [[Safavid dynasty|Safavi Emperor]] [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] provided financial aid, 12,000 choice of cavalry and thousands of infantry soldiers to Mughal Emperor [[Humayun]] to regain his Empire. [[Persian people|Persians]] [[Nobility|nobles]], [[Technocracy|technocrats]] and [[bureaucrat]]s, also joined Mughal Emperor Humayun and his Persian and Pashtun soldiers in the reconquest of South Asia. These soldiers were awarded estates and they settled with their families in the northern India. These diverse ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups merged over the centuries to the form [[Urdu language|Urdu]] speaking Muslims of South Asia.\n\nThe Rohilla leader Daud Khan was awarded the [[Katehar]] (later called [[Rohilkhand]]) region in the then [[North India|northern India]] by Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] Alamgir (ruled 1658\u20131707) to suppress the [[Rajput]] uprisings, which had afflicted this region. Originally, some 20,000 soldiers from various Pashtun tribes ([[Yusafzai]], Ghori, Osmani, [[Ghilzai]], Barech, [[Marwat]], [[Durrani]], [[Tareen]], [[Kakar]], [[Naghar]], [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]] and [[Khattak]]) were hired by Mughals to provide soldiers to the Mughal armies. Their performance was appreciated by Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] Alamgir, and an additional force of 25,000 Pashtuns were recruited from modern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Afghanistan]] and were given respected positions in Mughal Army. Nearly all of Pashtuns settled in the [[Katehar]] region and also brought their families from modern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Afghanistan]]. During [[Nadir Shah]]'s invasion of northern India in 1739, the new wave of Pashtuns settled increasing their population to over 100,0000. Due to the large settlement of Rohilla Afghans, the Katehar region gained fame as Rohilkhand. [[Bareilly]] was made the capital of the Rohilkhand state and it became Pashtun majority city with [[Gali Nawaban]] as the main royal street. Other important cities were [[Moradabad]], [[Rampur (Uttar Pradesh)|Rampur]], [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Badaun District|Badaun]], and others.<ref>''An Eighteenth Century History of North India: An Account Of The Rise And Fall Of The Rohilla Chiefs In Janbhasha'' by Rustam Ali Bijnori by Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui Manohar Publications</ref><ref>''Imperial Gazetteer of India'' by W M Hunter</ref> After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] fought in 1761 between the [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] and [[Maratha Empire]] thousands of Pashtun and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] soldiers settled in the northern India. These diverse ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups merged over the centuries to the form the Urdu speaking Muslims of South Asia.\n\nIt is estimated that about 35% of Urdu speakers are of Pashtun origin. The provinces such as [[United Provinces (1937\u201350)|Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] had significant population of Pashtuns. These Pashtuns over the years lost their language [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and culture and adopted Urdu as their first language. Sub-groups also includes the [[Hyderabadi Muslims]], [[Memon people|Memon Muslims]], [[Bihari Muslims]] etc. who keep many of their unique cultural traditions.<ref>Karen Isaksen Leonard, ''Locating home: India's Hyderabadis abroad''</ref> Muslims from what are now the states of Delhi, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were themselves of heterogeneous origin.\n\nThe [[Kayastha]] and [[manihar]] community that has historically been involved in the occupations of land [[Records management|record keeping]] and accounting. Many Hindu Kayasth found favour with [[Muslim]] rulers for whom the acted as [[Qanungoh Shaikh|Qanungo]]s. This close association, led to the conversion of many members of the [[Kayastha]] community to [[Islam]]. The [[Muslim Kayasths]] speak [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]]<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">People of India Uttar Pradesh page 1047</ref> The Kayasth sometime use [[Siddiqui]], [[Quraishi]], [[Khan (surname)|Khan]], [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]], [[Usmani]] and [[Farooqi]] as their surnames, and consider themselves belonging to the [[Shaikhs in South Asia|Shaikh]] community.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Endogamy and Status Mobility among Siddiqui Shaikh in Social Stratication edited by Dipankar Gupta</ref>\nThis region also saw the settlement of [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] soldiers and administrors from what is now [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]]. The largest settlement was that of [[Rohilkhand]], which was home to a number of [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] principalities. Other immigrants included [[Kamboh]]s from [[Punjab region|Punjab]], who together with the [[Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathan]] formed part of the ruling elite in [[North India]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1931\">The Caste System of North India by E A H Blunt, first edition in 1931 by Oxford University Press</ref>\n\nIndian converts to [[Islam]] ultimately outnumbered the immigrant Muslims, and were also of diverse origin. Many of the converts belonged to the [[Hindu]] artisan [[caste]]s, who were drawn to the new qasbas. Over time, many of these artisan groups evolved into caste like groupings, such as the [[Momin Ansari|Momin]], who were weavers. Many of these new converts continued to speak their original dialects, such as [[Awadhi]] and [[Khari boli]]. These groups were sometimes referred to collectively as [[Ajlaf]]. Groups that claimed actual or putative foreign ancestry were referred to as [[Ashraf]]s. Over time a fourfold division arose among the Ashraf, with the [[Sayyid of Uttar Pradesh|Sayyid]]s (the actual or claimed descendants of the Islamic prophet, [[Mohammad]]), the [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]], communities signifies [[Arab people|Arab]] descent and comes under high [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradari]] of society, however majority are the native [[Brahmin]], [[Kshatriya]] and [[Vaishya]] clans who used the title of Sheikh after conversion to [[Islam]], the [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]]s, descendants of Central Asian [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] and [[Mongol]]s and the [[Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathans]], descendants of [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] tribesmen from [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"autogenerated1931\"/> Occasionally, important convert communities such as the [[Muslim Kayasths|Kayastha Muslim]] and [[manihar]] of eastern Uttar Pradesh, were also granted [[Ashraf]] status.\n\nIn western [[Uttar Pradesh]], there was conversion to [[Islam]] of a number of agrarian [[castes]] such as the [[Tyagi (Muslim)|Tyagi]], [[Ranghar]] and [[Muley Jat]]. Many of these convert communities kept many of their pre-Islamic customs, such as [[clan]] [[exogamy]]. According to some scholars, this also led to the creeping into [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradari]] system.<ref>Muslim Caste in Uttar Pradesh: A Study in Culture Contact by Ghaus Ansari</ref>\nWith the collapse of the [[Sultanate of Delhi]], the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] established their control, U.P. became the heartland of their vast empire; the region was known as Hindustan, which is used to this day as the name for India in several languages. [[Agra]] and [[Fatehpur Sikri]] were the capital cities of [[Akbar]], the great [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor of India. At their zenith, during the rule of [[Aurangzeb]], the Mughal Empire covered almost the entire South Asia (including present day [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]), which was ruled at different times from Delhi, [[Agra]] and [[Allahabad]].\n\n=== Later history ===\n[[File:Saadat Ali Khan I.jpg|thumb|125px|right|[[Burhan ul Mulk Sa'adat Khan]]]]\n[[File:Safdarjung, second Nawab of Awadh, Mughal dynasty. India. early 18th century.jpg|left|thumb|125px|[[Safdarjung]]]]\n\nWhen the [[Mughal Empire]] disintegrated, their territory remained confined to the [[Doab]] region of and Delhi. Other areas of Hindustan ([[Uttar Pradesh]] or U.P.) were now ruled by different rulers: [[Oudh]] was ruled by the [[Shia]] Nawabs of Oudh, [[Rohilkhand]] by the [[Rohilla]]s, [[Bundelkhand]] by the [[Marathas]] and [[Benaras]] by its own king, while [[Nepal]] controlled Kumaon-Garhwal as a part of [[Greater Nepal]]. The state's capital city of [[Lucknow]] was established by the Muslim [[Nawabs of Oudh]] in the 18th century. It became an important centre of [[Muslim]] culture, and the centre for the development of [[Urdu]] literature.<ref>The Rise and Decline of the Ruhela by Iqbal Hussain</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated2\">The crisis of empire in Mughal north India : Awadh and the Punjab, 1707\u201348 / Muzaffar Alam</ref>\n\nOf all the Muslim states and dependencies of the [[Mughal empire]], [[Awadh]] had the newest royal family. They were descended from a [[Persian people|Persian]] adventurer called [[Saadat Ali Khan I|Sa'adat Khan]], originally from [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]] in [[Persia]]. There were many Khurasanis in the service of the Mughals, mostly soldiers, and if successful, they could hope for rich rewards. These Khurasanis were [[Shia]], and [[Lucknow]] became a centre of [[Shia]] culture in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Burhan ul Mulk Sa'adat Khan proved to be amongst the most successful of this group. In 1732, he was made governor of the province of Awadh. His original title was [[Nazim]], which means Governor, but soon he was made [[Nawab]]. In 1740, the Nawab was called [[Vizier|Wazir]] or [[vizier]], which means [[Chief Minister]], and thereafter he was known as the Nawab Wazir. In practice, from Sa'adat Khan onwards, the titles had been hereditary, though in theory they were in the gift of the Mughal emperor, to whom allegiance was paid. A nazar, or token tribute, was sent each year to Delhi, and members of the imperial family were treated with great deference; two of them actually lived in [[Lucknow]] after 1819, and were treated with great courtesy.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n[[File:Victoria gate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aligarh Muslim University]]]]\n\nBy the early 19th Century, the British had established their control over what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]]. This led to an end of almost six centuries of [[Muslim]] rule over [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The British rulers created a class of feudal landowners who were generally referred to as [[zamindar]]s, and in [[Awadh]] as [[taluqdar]]s. Many of these large landowners provided patronage to the arts, and funded many of the early Muslim educational institutions. A major educational institution was the [[Aligarh Muslim University]], which gave its name to the [[Aligarh]] movement. Under the guidance of Sir [[Sayyid Ahmed Khan]], the Urdu speaking Muslim elite sought to retain their position of political and administrative importance by reconciling their Mughal and Islamic culture with English education. A somewhat different educational movement was led by the [[Ulema]] of [[Deoband]], who founded a religious school or Dar-ul-Uloom designed to revitalize Islamic learning. The aim of the [[Deobandi]]s, as the movement became known as was to purge the Muslims of all strata of traditions and customs that were claimed to be [[Hindu]]. Most of the early proselytization was concentrated in the [[Doab]] region where [[Deoband]] is located, which was home to a number of peasant castes, such as the [[Ranghar|Rajput Muslim]], [[Muslim Gujjar (Uttar Pradesh)|Gujjar]], [[Muslim Tyagi|Tyagi]] and [[Muley Jat|Jat]], who had maintained a number of pre-Islamic customs. A reaction to the growth of the [[Deobandi]] movement was the rise of the [[Barelvi]] sub-sect, which was much more tolerant of the customs and traditions of the local population.<ref name=\"autogenerated823\"/>\n\nThe role of [[Urdu language]] played an important role in the development of Muslim self-consciousness in the early twentieth century. Uttar Pradesh Muslims set up [[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu|Anjuman]]s or associations for the protection and promotion of [[Urdu]]. These early [[Muslim]] associations formed the nucleus of the [[All India Muslim League]] in [[Dhaka]] in 1905. Many of the leaders belonged to the Ashraf category. Uttar Pradesh Muslims formed the core of the movement for a separate [[Muslim]] state, later known as [[Pakistan]]. The eventual effect of this movement led to the [[partition of India]], and creation of [[Pakistan]]. This led to an exodus of many [[Muslim]] professionals to [[Pakistan]], and the division of the Uttar Pradeshi Muslims, with the formation of the [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] ethnic group of [[Pakistan]]. The role of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] was extremely important in the creation of [[Pakistan]].<ref>Separatism among Indian Muslims : the politics of the United Provinces' Muslims 1860\u20131923 / Francis Robinson</ref>\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nThe net result of partition and independence in 1947, was the division of the Urdu speaking Uttar Pradesh Muslims. It also led to major social, political and cultural changes, for example [[Urdu]] lost its status. The abolishment of the [[zamindar]]i system also had a profound impact, as these large landowners provided patronage to local artisans. This was especially true of the [[Awadh]] region. But Muslim artisan communities have held their own, with the growth of specialized industries such as lock manufacturing in [[Aligarh]]. The Muslim peasantry in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] benefited from the [[Green Revolution]], while those in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] did poorly. Another important event was the demise of the Muslim League, with most Muslims initially supporting the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref>Legacy of a divided nation: India's Muslims since independence By [[Mushirul Hasan]]</ref> The post partition period also saw a reduction in [[Religious violence in India#Anti Muslim Violence|communal violence]] between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslims]]. This was also a period where Muslim leadership was still in the hands of [[Ashraf]] leaders such as [[Abdul Majeed Khwaja]] in [[Aligarh]] and [[Rafi Ahmed Kidwai]] in [[Barabanki district|Barabanki]]. However, from the late 1960s onwards, there has been an increase in the number of communal riots, culminating in the destruction of the [[Babri Masjid]] in [[Ayodhya]] in December 1992. This period has also seen the decline of Muslim support for the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">The Production of Hindu-Muslim Violence in Contemporary India By Paul R. Brass</ref>\n\nThe last three decades have seen two issues confronting the Muslim community, often referred to as [[Mandir]] and [[Mandal Commission|Mandal]]. Mandir refers to the building of a [[Hindu]] temple in the town of [[Ayodhya]] in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], on the site of [[Babri Mosque]]. This cause has been championed by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], and as a consequence, there has been an increase in [[Religious violence in India#Anti Muslim Violence|communal violence]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> The other issue is commonly referred to as Mandal, a reference to the [[Mandal Commission]], which was set up to consider the question of seat reservations and quotas for people to redress caste discrimination. Among the groups identified for reservation included a number of ajlaf communities. This has led to greater assertion of ajlaf political power, and a decline in the ashraf leadership. A major controversy is a demand for the Muslim community to receive reservation as a whole, which is being opposed by many Ajlaf communities. There are also demands to extend the [[scheduled caste]] status, which the Indian Constitution restricts to [[Hindu]] [[caste]]s only, to Muslim Ajlaf groups like the [[Halalkhor]] and [[Lal Begi]].<ref>Identity and Identification in India: Defining By Laura Dudley Jenkins</ref>\n\nFamous Muslims from Uttar Pradesh include the famous writer and poet [[Javed Akhtar]], actress Shabana Azami, Vice President of India [[Hamid Ansari|Mohammad Hamid Ansari]], Suhaib Ilyasi of India's Most Wanted fame, Maolana Dr. Kalbe Sadiq Vice President of Muslim Personal Law Board, actor and director [[Muzaffar Ali]], Journalist [[Saeed Naqvi]], Persian Scholar [[Naiyer Masud|Dr. Naiyer Masud Rizvi]], linguist [[Prof. Masud Husain Khan]], Governor [[Syed Sibtey Razi]], historian [[Irfan Habib]], politician [[Salman Khursheed]] and cricketer [[Mohammad Kaif]].\n\n== Controversy over Reservation ==\n\nStudies including the now famous [[Sachar Committee|Sachar Report]] have identified that the [[Muslim]] community in [[Uttar Pradesh]] lags behind in terms of economics, educational attainment and political representation. The general political consensus in India has been for a number of historic reasons, that the Muslim community as whole should not be subject to any [[affirmative action]] policies, such as other socially deprived groupings, for example the [[Scheduled Castes]]. However, the state has conceded that certain [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradaris]] within the larger Muslim community of UP do deserve reservations in jobs and quotas in educational institutions. This principle has been established by the [[Mandal Commission]].<ref>Politics of inclusion : caste, minority, and representation in India / Zoya Hasan Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2009.

They were very successful in spreading Islam, as many aspects of Sufi belief systems and practices had their parallels in Indian philosophical literature, in particular nonviolence and [[monism]]. The Sufis' orthodox approach towards Islam made it easier for Hindus to practice. [[Moinuddin Chishti|Hazrat Khawaja Muin-ud-din Chishti]], [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]], [[Nizam-ud-din Auliya]], [[Shah Jalal]], [[Amir Khusro]], [[Sarkar Sabir Pak]], Shekh Alla-ul-Haq Pandwi, [[Ashraf Jahangir Semnani]], [[Sarkar Waris Pak]], [[Ata Hussain Fani Chishti]] trained Sufis for the propagation of Islam in different parts of India. Once the Islamic Empire was established in India, Sufis invariably provided a touch of colour and beauty to what might have otherwise been rather cold and stark reigns. The Sufi movement also attracted followers from the [[artisan]] and [[Dalit (outcaste)|untouchable]] communities; they played a crucial role in bridging the distance between Islam and the indigenous traditions. [[Ahmad Sirhindi]], a prominent member of the [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam. [[Ahmed Rida Khan]] contributed a lot by defending traditional and orthodox Islam in India through his work ''Fatawa Razvia''.\n\n== Social system ==\n\nSome South Asian Muslims have been known to stratify their society according to ''[[Qaum|quoms]]''.<ref name=\"barth_leach_aspects\">{{cite book\n | last = Barth\n | first = Fredrik\n | editor = E.

For example, an individual will belong to the [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] quom and [[Behlim]] [[Rangrez]] or [[Fareedi]] biradari.<ref>Caste and social stratification among Muslims in India, edited by Imtiaz Ahmad.</ref>\n\nIt is commonly believed{{By whom|date=February 2011}} that Muslims in Uttar Pradesh are divided into the ''[[Ashraf]]'' and ''Ajlaf'' categories which are distinguished by ethnic origin and descent. However, a number of students making empirical studies of Muslim communities in different parts of India have found that this distinction is not really meaningful in understanding the existing pattern among the diverse social groups in any locality. It may be asked, therefore, if the 'ashraf' and 'ajlaf' categories constitute meaningful units of distinction for the study of social stratification among Indian Muslims. Technically, the ashraf are descendants of groups with foreign ancestry, while the ajlaf are those whose ancestors are said to have converted to [[Islam]]. The Ashraf are further divided into four groupings, the [[Sayyid of Uttar Pradesh|Sayyid]], the supposed descendants of [[Mohammed]], the [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] and [[siddiqui manihar]] claiming descents from early [[Arab people|Arab]] or [[Persian people|Persian]] settlers, the [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] who claim descent from the [[Mughal Dynasty]] and finally the [[Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathan]], who claim descents from [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] groups that have settled in [[India]]. Technically the first two groups intermarry with each other, while the latter two intermarry. Included sometimes in the [[Ashraf]] category are [[Muslim Rajput]] groups such as the [[Rangrez]], [[manihar]] and [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]]. A third category, ''arzaal'' are supposed to be converts from [[Hindu]] [[Dalit]] communities. However, the term arzaal is never used in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Groups that tend to fall in this category include the [[Halalkhor]] and [[Lal Begi]].<ref>Basic problems of OBC & Dalit Muslims / edited by Ashfaq Husain Ansari.</ref> The reality is more complicated, with UP Muslims identifying themselves in smaller units called [[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradaris]], which are localized lineage groupings. For example, the [[Qidwai]] Shaikh are one such localized lineage group, concentrated in [[Barabanki District]].<ref>Muslim Caste in Uttar Pradesh (A Study of Culture Contact), Ghaus Ansari, Lucknow, 1960</ref>\n\nThose communities falling within the ajlaf category were traditionally associated with the practice of a particular craft, for example the [[Momin Ansari|Ansari]] were weavers, while the [[Saifi]] were blacksmiths. These artisan communities also call themselves biradaries or brotherhoods in English, and each biradari is characterised by strict endogamy. In the older parts of town and cities in [[Uttar Pradesh]], they are also characterised by residential segration.<ref>Boundaries and identities : Muslims, work and status in Aligarh / E. A.

For example, the [[Doab]] region to home to number of biradaris of peasant cultivators, such as the [[Baluch (Uttar Pradesh)|Baloch]], [[Dogar]], [[Garha]], [[Muslim Gujjar (Uttar Pradesh)|Gujjar]], [[Muley Jat|Jat]], [[Jhojha]], [[Muslim Kamboh (Uttar Pradesh)|Kamboh]], [[Ranghar|Rajput]] and [[Muslim Tyagi]], often living in their own villages, and following distinct customs. Almost all these groups are [[Sunni]], and speak [[Khari boli]]. While the region of [[Awadh]] is home to both large communities of [[Momin Ansari|Ansari]]s, [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]]s and [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]], some of whom are [[Shia]], and most speak [[Awadhi]].<ref>People of India.

The original language of the Mughals was [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, but after their arrival in South Asia, they came to adopt Persian. Gradually, the need to communicate with local inhabitants led to a composition of Sanskrit-derived languages, written in the [[Perso-Arabic script]] and with literary conventions and specialized vocabulary being retained from Persian, Arabic and Turkic; the new standard was eventually given its own name of ''Urdu''.<ref>Hindi By Yamuna Kachru https://books.google.com/books?id=ooH5VfLTQEQC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=urdu+heavy+persian&source=bl&ots=dG3qgmaV95&sig=WivP7AW9eRlTcp4oscBoHCBFEE0&hl=en&ei=9sp8SqzpLI6y-AaM5vxG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9#v=onepage&q=urdu%20heavy%20persian&f=false</ref>\n\nUrdu is often [[Hindi#Standard Hindi and Urdu|contrasted with Hindi]], another standardised form of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].

Muslims in Uttar Pradesh do not form a single ethnic community, but are differentiated by sectarian and [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradari]] divisions, as well as by language and geography. Nevertheless, the community shares some unifying cultural factors.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Early history ===\n\nMuch of [[Uttar Pradesh]] formed part of the various [[Delhi sultanate|Sultanate]] after 1205 CE and was ruled from their capital, Delhi. As a consequence of these invasions, there arose a community in what is now Uttar Pradesh, which was referred to as Hindustani Musalmans.\nEarly settlement of Northern Muslims was due to the invasions and then establishment of Turkic Sultanate in North India. Most Muslim in Northern India, particularly in Delhi and adjoining areas were of Turkic Origin or Turks. These Turks remained part of the establishment for a few centuries until very late in the [[Mughal Empire]], when there was mass migration from Persia and Afghan regions to Delhi. Consequently, Turks were pushed down the ladder as the Rulers and Courtiers of Delhi and became involved in farming and semi-skilled work. Famous Turkic Sufis include Nizamuddin Auliya, Amir Khusro etc. Mehroli was the first organized township of Turks who had built numerous Turkic Monuments such as Qutib Minar, Purana Qila, Turkman Darwaza etc. Turkic communities in India are currently recognized by their trades such as Turks Jhojhey, mainly live in Muzzafarnagar, Saharanpur, BulandShahar,Aligharh,  Ghaziabad, Hapur, Meerrut. While in early 12 century Turkic sultanet Ghorid, Khilzi, Gaznawied Turk's settled in Bijnor, Moradabad, Sambhal City. But During British regime & fall of Mughal empire in 1857 [[Chagatai Turk's]] [[Timurid Empire]] under the [[Mughal family]] also settaled in tarai belt of Rampur and [[Uttarakhand]]. Now they are known as Turk's Farmers. Some of the Turks also write \"Pasha\" in their surname in Uttar Pradesh. In medieval times, Some Afghan pashtun of Mardan division the term as [[Rohilla Pathan]] or [[Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathan]] also settaled & ruled during early 17th century till 1947 in [[Rampur, Uttar Pradesh|Rampur]], [[Barreilly]], [[Badaun]], [[Pilibhit]] [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Farukhabad]], [[Lakhimpur, Uttar Pradesh|Lakhimpur]], [[Kannoj]] district.  ''Hindustani Musalman'' was applied to those Muslims who were either converts to [[Islam]] or who had a long settled in [[India]] such as Ansari, Kureshi, Salmani, Ghosi etc. These Hindustani Musalmans did not form a single community, as they were divided by ethnic, linguistic and economic differences. Often these early settlers lived in fortified towns, known as [[Qasbah]]s. Important qasbas include [[Kakori]] in [[Lucknow District]], [[Sandila|Sandhila]] in [[Hardoi District]] and [[Zaidpur]] in [[Barabanki district|Barabanki]] District. With the rise of the [[Mongols]] under [[Genghis Khan]], there was an influx of Muslim refugees into [[North India]], many of whom settled in the provincial qasbas, bringing with them a Persianized culture. Many of these early settlers are the ancestors of the Abbasid persianized dynasty [[Sayyid of Uttar Pradesh|Sayyid]] in Lucknow, Faizabad, Hardoi, Juanpur. and [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] community In Azamgharh, Mubarakpur, Mau, Vanaras these qasbas, over time a number of cultural norms acrose, which still typify many Uttar Pradesh Muslim traditions.<ref>Muslims in India edited by Zafar Imam Orient Longman</ref> The [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Sultanate of Delhi|Sultans of Delhi]] and their Mughal successors patronized the \u00e9migr\u00e9 Muslim culture: Islamic jurists of the [[Sunni]] [[Hanafi]] school, Persian literati who were [[Shia]] [[Ithn\u0101\u2018ashariyyah]] and [[Sufi]]s of several orders, including the [[Chishti]], [[Qadiri]] and [[Naqshbandi]]. These [[Sufi]] orders were particularly important in converting [[Hindu]]s to [[Islam]].<ref name=\"autogenerated823\">Muslim Peoples: volume 2: A World Ethnographic Survey edited by Richard Weekes pages 823 to 828</ref>\n\nFound among the [[Salafi]] are [[Iraqi biradri|Iraqis]] who migrated to Ballia and Ghazipur districts of Eastern part of the state in 16th century from Sindh, Pakistan and claim descent from [[Thaheem]] people of Sindh who are from the Arab tribe of [[Bani Tamim]] who migrated to Sindh during Arab conquest of Sindh in 711&nbsp;AD.\n\nThe [[Urdu language|Urdu]] speaking people of Uttar Pradesh has diverse roots. Many [[Sufi]] missionaries from Middle East and Central Asia migrated and settled in South Asia. Many natives converted to [[Islam]] due to the [[missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s dot the landscape of South Asia. The [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later Mughal Empire ruled the [[North India|northern India]] region. During the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later Mughal Empire attracted Muslim refugees, [[Nobility|nobles]], [[Technocracy|technocrats]], [[bureaucrat]]s, soldiers, [[Merchant|traders]], scientists, architects, [[artisan]]s, teachers, poets, artists, theologians and [[Sufi]]s from the rest of the [[Muslim world]] and they migrated and settled in the South Asia. During the reign of [[Ghiyas ud din Balban|Sultan Ghyasuddin Balban]] (1266\u20131286) thousands of Central Asian Muslims sought [[Right of asylum|asylum]] including more than of 15 sovereigns and their nobles due to the [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran]]. At the court of [[Iltutmish|Sultan Iltemish]] in Delhi the first wave of these Muslim refugees escaping from the Central Asian [[Mongol invasion of Khwarezmia and Eastern Iran|genocide]] perpetrated by the barbaric hordes of [[Genghis Khan]], brought administrators from [[Iran]], painters from China, theologians from [[Samarkand]], [[Nishapur]] and [[Bukhara]], divines and saints from all Muslim lands, craftsmen and men and maidens from every region, doctors adept in Greek medicine, philosophers from everywhere. The Muslims from various Northern provinces such as [[Hyderabad Deccan]], [[Balochistan region|Balochistan]], [[Sindh]], [[Punjab region|Punjab]], Gujarat, [[Kashmir]] and other parts of South Asia also moved to capitals of Muslim empire in Delhi and [[Agra]]. Millions of natives converted to [[Islam]] during the Muslim rule. [[Lodi dynasty]] was dominated by the [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] soldiers from [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Afghanistan]] who settled in the [[North India|northern India]]. After the [[Battle of Panipat (1526)]] Mughal Emperor [[Babur]] defeated the [[Lodi dynasty]] with [[Tajik people|Tajik]], [[Chagatai people|Chagatai]] and [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]], [[Uygur people|Uygur]] soldiers and nobility. These Central Asian Turk soldiers and nobles were awarded estates and they settled with their families in the northern India. [[Safavid dynasty|Safavi Emperor]] [[Tahmasp I|Shah Tahmasp]] provided financial aid, 12,000 choice of cavalry and thousands of infantry soldiers to Mughal Emperor [[Humayun]] to regain his Empire. [[Persian people|Persians]] [[Nobility|nobles]], [[Technocracy|technocrats]] and [[bureaucrat]]s, also joined Mughal Emperor Humayun and his Persian and Pashtun soldiers in the reconquest of South Asia. These soldiers were awarded estates and they settled with their families in the northern India. These diverse ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups merged over the centuries to the form [[Urdu language|Urdu]] speaking Muslims of South Asia.\n\nThe Rohilla leader Daud Khan was awarded the [[Katehar]] (later called [[Rohilkhand]]) region in the then [[North India|northern India]] by Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] Alamgir (ruled 1658\u20131707) to suppress the [[Rajput]] uprisings, which had afflicted this region. Originally, some 20,000 soldiers from various Pashtun tribes ([[Yusafzai]], Ghori, Osmani, [[Ghilzai]], Barech, [[Marwat]], [[Durrani]], [[Tareen]], [[Kakar]], [[Naghar]], [[Afridi (Pashtun)|Afridi]] and [[Khattak]]) were hired by Mughals to provide soldiers to the Mughal armies. Their performance was appreciated by Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] Alamgir, and an additional force of 25,000 Pashtuns were recruited from modern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Afghanistan]] and were given respected positions in Mughal Army. Nearly all of Pashtuns settled in the [[Katehar]] region and also brought their families from modern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Afghanistan]]. During [[Nadir Shah]]'s invasion of northern India in 1739, the new wave of Pashtuns settled increasing their population to over 100,0000. Due to the large settlement of Rohilla Afghans, the Katehar region gained fame as Rohilkhand. [[Bareilly]] was made the capital of the Rohilkhand state and it became Pashtun majority city with [[Gali Nawaban]] as the main royal street. Other important cities were [[Moradabad]], [[Rampur (Uttar Pradesh)|Rampur]], [[Shahjahanpur]], [[Badaun District|Badaun]], and others.<ref>''An Eighteenth Century History of North India: An Account Of The Rise And Fall Of The Rohilla Chiefs In Janbhasha'' by Rustam Ali Bijnori by Iqtidar Husain Siddiqui Manohar Publications</ref><ref>''Imperial Gazetteer of India'' by W M Hunter</ref> After the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] fought in 1761 between the [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] and [[Maratha Empire]] thousands of Pashtun and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] soldiers settled in the northern India. These diverse ethnic, cultural and linguistic groups merged over the centuries to the form the Urdu speaking Muslims of South Asia.\n\nIt is estimated that about 35% of Urdu speakers are of Pashtun origin. The provinces such as [[United Provinces (1937\u201350)|Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]] had significant population of Pashtuns. These Pashtuns over the years lost their language [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and culture and adopted Urdu as their first language.

Many of the converts belonged to the [[Hindu]] artisan [[caste]]s, who were drawn to the new qasbas. Over time, many of these artisan groups evolved into caste like groupings, such as the [[Momin Ansari|Momin]], who were weavers. Many of these new converts continued to speak their original dialects, such as [[Awadhi]] and [[Khari boli]]. These groups were sometimes referred to collectively as [[Ajlaf]]. Groups that claimed actual or putative foreign ancestry were referred to as [[Ashraf]]s.

Many of these convert communities kept many of their pre-Islamic customs, such as [[clan]] [[exogamy]].

At their zenith, during the rule of [[Aurangzeb]], the Mughal Empire covered almost the entire South Asia (including present day [[Afghanistan]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]), which was ruled at different times from Delhi, [[Agra]] and [[Allahabad]].\n\n=== Later history ===\n[[File:Saadat Ali Khan I.jpg|thumb|125px|right|[[Burhan ul Mulk Sa'adat Khan]]]]\n[[File:Safdarjung, second Nawab of Awadh, Mughal dynasty.

These Khurasanis were [[Shia]], and [[Lucknow]] became a centre of [[Shia]] culture in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Burhan ul Mulk Sa'adat Khan proved to be amongst the most successful of this group. In 1732, he was made governor of the province of Awadh. His original title was [[Nazim]], which means Governor, but soon he was made [[Nawab]]. In 1740, the Nawab was called [[Vizier|Wazir]] or [[vizier]], which means [[Chief Minister]], and thereafter he was known as the Nawab Wazir. In practice, from Sa'adat Khan onwards, the titles had been hereditary, though in theory they were in the gift of the Mughal emperor, to whom allegiance was paid. A nazar, or token tribute, was sent each year to Delhi, and members of the imperial family were treated with great deference; two of them actually lived in [[Lucknow]] after 1819, and were treated with great courtesy.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/>\n\n[[File:Victoria gate.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aligarh Muslim University]]]]\n\nBy the early 19th Century, the British had established their control over what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]]. This led to an end of almost six centuries of [[Muslim]] rule over [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The British rulers created a class of feudal landowners who were generally referred to as [[zamindar]]s, and in [[Awadh]] as [[taluqdar]]s. Many of these large landowners provided patronage to the arts, and funded many of the early Muslim educational institutions. A major educational institution was the [[Aligarh Muslim University]], which gave its name to the [[Aligarh]] movement. Under the guidance of Sir [[Sayyid Ahmed Khan]], the Urdu speaking Muslim elite sought to retain their position of political and administrative importance by reconciling their Mughal and Islamic culture with English education. A somewhat different educational movement was led by the [[Ulema]] of [[Deoband]], who founded a religious school or Dar-ul-Uloom designed to revitalize Islamic learning. The aim of the [[Deobandi]]s, as the movement became known as was to purge the Muslims of all strata of traditions and customs that were claimed to be [[Hindu]]. Most of the early proselytization was concentrated in the [[Doab]] region where [[Deoband]] is located, which was home to a number of peasant castes, such as the [[Ranghar|Rajput Muslim]], [[Muslim Gujjar (Uttar Pradesh)|Gujjar]], [[Muslim Tyagi|Tyagi]] and [[Muley Jat|Jat]], who had maintained a number of pre-Islamic customs. A reaction to the growth of the [[Deobandi]] movement was the rise of the [[Barelvi]] sub-sect, which was much more tolerant of the customs and traditions of the local population.<ref name=\"autogenerated823\"/>\n\nThe role of [[Urdu language]] played an important role in the development of Muslim self-consciousness in the early twentieth century. Uttar Pradesh Muslims set up [[Anjuman Taraqqi-i-Urdu|Anjuman]]s or associations for the protection and promotion of [[Urdu]]. These early [[Muslim]] associations formed the nucleus of the [[All India Muslim League]] in [[Dhaka]] in 1905. Many of the leaders belonged to the Ashraf category. Uttar Pradesh Muslims formed the core of the movement for a separate [[Muslim]] state, later known as [[Pakistan]]. The eventual effect of this movement led to the [[partition of India]], and creation of [[Pakistan]]. This led to an exodus of many [[Muslim]] professionals to [[Pakistan]], and the division of the Uttar Pradeshi Muslims, with the formation of the [[Muhajir (Pakistan)|Muhajir]] ethnic group of [[Pakistan]]. The role of the [[Aligarh Muslim University]] was extremely important in the creation of [[Pakistan]].<ref>Separatism among Indian Muslims : the politics of the United Provinces' Muslims 1860\u20131923 / Francis Robinson</ref>\n\n=== Modern history ===\n\nThe net result of partition and independence in 1947, was the division of the Urdu speaking Uttar Pradesh Muslims. It also led to major social, political and cultural changes, for example [[Urdu]] lost its status. The abolishment of the [[zamindar]]i system also had a profound impact, as these large landowners provided patronage to local artisans. This was especially true of the [[Awadh]] region. But Muslim artisan communities have held their own, with the growth of specialized industries such as lock manufacturing in [[Aligarh]]. The Muslim peasantry in western [[Uttar Pradesh]] benefited from the [[Green Revolution]], while those in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] did poorly. Another important event was the demise of the Muslim League, with most Muslims initially supporting the [[Indian National Congress]].<ref>Legacy of a divided nation: India's Muslims since independence By [[Mushirul Hasan]]</ref> The post partition period also saw a reduction in [[Religious violence in India#Anti Muslim Violence|communal violence]] between [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslims]]. This was also a period where Muslim leadership was still in the hands of [[Ashraf]] leaders such as [[Abdul Majeed Khwaja]] in [[Aligarh]] and [[Rafi Ahmed Kidwai]] in [[Barabanki district|Barabanki]]. However, from the late 1960s onwards, there has been an increase in the number of communal riots, culminating in the destruction of the [[Babri Masjid]] in [[Ayodhya]] in December 1992. This period has also seen the decline of Muslim support for the [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">The Production of Hindu-Muslim Violence in Contemporary India By Paul R. Brass</ref>\n\nThe last three decades have seen two issues confronting the Muslim community, often referred to as [[Mandir]] and [[Mandal Commission|Mandal]]. Mandir refers to the building of a [[Hindu]] temple in the town of [[Ayodhya]] in eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]], on the site of [[Babri Mosque]]. This cause has been championed by the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], and as a consequence, there has been an increase in [[Religious violence in India#Anti Muslim Violence|communal violence]].<ref name=\"autogenerated3\"/> The other issue is commonly referred to as Mandal, a reference to the [[Mandal Commission]], which was set up to consider the question of seat reservations and quotas for people to redress caste discrimination. Among the groups identified for reservation included a number of ajlaf communities. This has led to greater assertion of ajlaf political power, and a decline in the ashraf leadership. A major controversy is a demand for the Muslim community to receive reservation as a whole, which is being opposed by many Ajlaf communities. There are also demands to extend the [[scheduled caste]] status, which the Indian Constitution restricts to [[Hindu]] [[caste]]s only, to Muslim Ajlaf groups like the [[Halalkhor]] and [[Lal Begi]].<ref>Identity and Identification in India: Defining By Laura Dudley Jenkins</ref>\n\nFamous Muslims from Uttar Pradesh include the famous writer and poet [[Javed Akhtar]], actress Shabana Azami, Vice President of India [[Hamid Ansari|Mohammad Hamid Ansari]], Suhaib Ilyasi of India's Most Wanted fame, Maolana Dr. Kalbe Sadiq Vice President of Muslim Personal Law Board, actor and director [[Muzaffar Ali]], Journalist [[Saeed Naqvi]], Persian Scholar [[Naiyer Masud|Dr. Naiyer Masud Rizvi]], linguist [[Prof. Masud Husain Khan]], Governor [[Syed Sibtey Razi]], historian [[Irfan Habib]], politician [[Salman Khursheed]] and cricketer [[Mohammad Kaif]].\n\n== Controversy over Reservation ==\n\nStudies including the now famous [[Sachar Committee|Sachar Report]] have identified that the [[Muslim]] community in [[Uttar Pradesh]] lags behind in terms of economics, educational attainment and political representation. The general political consensus in India has been for a number of historic reasons, that the Muslim community as whole should not be subject to any [[affirmative action]] policies, such as other socially deprived groupings, for example the [[Scheduled Castes]]. However, the state has conceded that certain [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradaris]] within the larger Muslim community of UP do deserve reservations in jobs and quotas in educational institutions. This principle has been established by the [[Mandal Commission]].<ref>Politics of inclusion : caste, minority, and representation in India / Zoya Hasan Oxford : Oxford University Press, 2009. ISBN/{{ISBN|9780195696950}}</ref>\n\nMany of these [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradaris]] that have been traditionally associated with a particular craft have been granted [[Other Backward Class]] status, which in theory makes them eligible for a number of [[Affirmative action|affirmative action]] schemes.<ref>Basic problems of OBC & dalit Muslims / edited by Ashfaq Husain Ansari. {{ISBN|8183870880}}</ref> There has been some criticism as the selection of criteria, which many disadvantaged Muslim [[Baradari (brotherhood)|Baradaris]] excluded from the lists drawn up by the [[Government of India]]. For example, certain Baradaris whose [[Hindu]] counterparts were lists as [[Scheduled Caste]]s were omitted from the first Uttar Pradeh list. This was part dealt with by including [[Nat (Muslim)|Muslim Nat]]s, [[Mochi (Muslim)|Muslim Mochi]]s and [[Muslim Dhobi]]s, whose [[Hindu]] counterparts have [[Scheduled Caste]] status as backward communities.<ref>http://www.ncbc.nic.in/Pdf/Uttar%20Pradesh/Uttanpradesh-Vol1/5.pdf</ref> However, a number of extremely marginalized Muslim communities such as the [[Muslim Dabgar]]. [[Muslim Bandhmati]]s. Muslim Dom and [[Muslim Bansphor]] remain excluded despite the fact that there Hindu counterparts are on the Scheduled Caste list. Other economically deprived groups such as the [[Kankali]], [[Kanmailia]] and [[Kingharia]] have also been excluded, while groups such the [[Muslim Kayasths|Kayastha Muslims]] and [[Muslim Kamboh (Uttar Pradesh)|Muslim Kamboh]] have been included. All in all, approximately 44 communities have been included in the Uttar Pradesh OBC list.<ref name=\"muslimsocieties\">{{cite web|url=http://www.muslimsocieties.org/Vol_4_No_1_Scheduling_the_OBCs_Among_the_Muslims_in_Uttar_Pradesh.html|title=Islam and Muslim Societies \u2013 The Journal &#124; Vol. 4 No. 1 \u2013 2011 &#124; Scheduling the OBCs Among the Muslims in Uttar Pradesh: Discrepancies and Irregularities|publisher=muslimsocieties.org|accessdate=30 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of India]] has recently made an announcement of the establishment of a sub-quota of 4.5% for minorities within the existing 27% reservation meant for the Other Backward Classes.

They were very successful in spreading Islam, as many aspects of Sufi belief systems and practices had their parallels in Indian philosophical literature, in particular nonviolence and [[monism]]. The Sufis' orthodox approach towards Islam made it easier for Hindus to practice. [[Moinuddin Chishti|Hazrat Khawaja Muin-ud-din Chishti]], [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]], [[Nizam-ud-din Auliya]], [[Shah Jalal]], [[Amir Khusro]], [[Sarkar Sabir Pak]], Shekh Alla-ul-Haq Pandwi, [[Ashraf Jahangir Semnani]], [[Sarkar Waris Pak]], [[Ata Hussain Fani Chishti]] trained Sufis for the propagation of Islam in different parts of India. Once the Islamic Empire was established in India, Sufis invariably provided a touch of colour and beauty to what might have otherwise been rather cold and stark reigns. The Sufi movement also attracted followers from the [[artisan]] and [[Dalit (outcaste)|untouchable]] communities; they played a crucial role in bridging the distance between Islam and the indigenous traditions. [[Ahmad Sirhindi]], a prominent member of the [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] advocated the peaceful conversion of Hindus to Islam. [[Ahmed Rida Khan]] contributed a lot by defending traditional and orthodox Islam in India through his work ''Fatawa Razvia''.\n\n== Social system ==\n\nSome South Asian Muslims have been known to stratify their society according to ''[[Qaum|quoms]]''.<ref name=\"barth_leach_aspects\">{{cite book\n | last = Barth\n | first = Fredrik\n | editor = E.

The [[Qaum|quoms]] who deal with human emissions are ranked the lowest. These quams are further divided into ''[[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradaris]]'', which claim descent from an actual or putative common male ancestor. For example, an individual will belong to the [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] quom and [[Behlim]] [[Rangrez]] or [[Fareedi]] biradari.<ref>Caste and social stratification among Muslims in India, edited by Imtiaz Ahmad.</ref>\n\nIt is commonly believed{{By whom|date=February 2011}} that Muslims in Uttar Pradesh are divided into the ''[[Ashraf]]'' and ''Ajlaf'' categories which are distinguished by ethnic origin and descent. However, a number of students making empirical studies of Muslim communities in different parts of India have found that this distinction is not really meaningful in understanding the existing pattern among the diverse social groups in any locality. It may be asked, therefore, if the 'ashraf' and 'ajlaf' categories constitute meaningful units of distinction for the study of social stratification among Indian Muslims. Technically, the ashraf are descendants of groups with foreign ancestry, while the ajlaf are those whose ancestors are said to have converted to [[Islam]]. The Ashraf are further divided into four groupings, the [[Sayyid of Uttar Pradesh|Sayyid]], the supposed descendants of [[Mohammed]], the [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]] and [[siddiqui manihar]] claiming descents from early [[Arab people|Arab]] or [[Persian people|Persian]] settlers, the [[Mughal (tribe)|Mughal]] who claim descent from the [[Mughal Dynasty]] and finally the [[Pathans of Uttar Pradesh|Pathan]], who claim descents from [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] groups that have settled in [[India]]. Technically the first two groups intermarry with each other, while the latter two intermarry. Included sometimes in the [[Ashraf]] category are [[Muslim Rajput]] groups such as the [[Rangrez]], [[manihar]] and [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]]. A third category, ''arzaal'' are supposed to be converts from [[Hindu]] [[Dalit]] communities. However, the term arzaal is never used in [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Groups that tend to fall in this category include the [[Halalkhor]] and [[Lal Begi]].<ref>Basic problems of OBC & Dalit Muslims / edited by Ashfaq Husain Ansari.</ref> The reality is more complicated, with UP Muslims identifying themselves in smaller units called [[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradaris]], which are localized lineage groupings. For example, the [[Qidwai]] Shaikh are one such localized lineage group, concentrated in [[Barabanki District]].<ref>Muslim Caste in Uttar Pradesh (A Study of Culture Contact), Ghaus Ansari, Lucknow, 1960</ref>\n\nThose communities falling within the ajlaf category were traditionally associated with the practice of a particular craft, for example the [[Momin Ansari|Ansari]] were weavers, while the [[Saifi]] were blacksmiths. These artisan communities also call themselves biradaries or brotherhoods in English, and each biradari is characterised by strict endogamy. In the older parts of town and cities in [[Uttar Pradesh]], they are also characterised by residential segration.<ref>Boundaries and identities : Muslims, work and status in Aligarh / E. A. Mann. {{ISBN|0-8039-9422-2}}</ref> Among other traditional artisan [[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradaris]] in UP are the [[Behna]], [[Bhatiara]], [[Bhisti]], [[Muslim Dhobi|Dhobi]], [[Muslim Halwai]], [[Muslim Teli|Teli]] and [[Raj (caste)|Raj]], which were at one time associated with a particular craft or trade.\n<ref>''People of India''.

I SBN/ISSN 8173041148 (set)</ref>\n\nIn addition to occupational specialization, both [[Baradari (brotherhood)|biradaris]] are also concentrated in a particular geographic area. For example, the [[Doab]] region to home to number of biradaris of peasant cultivators, such as the [[Baluch (Uttar Pradesh)|Baloch]], [[Dogar]], [[Garha]], [[Muslim Gujjar (Uttar Pradesh)|Gujjar]], [[Muley Jat|Jat]], [[Jhojha]], [[Muslim Kamboh (Uttar Pradesh)|Kamboh]], [[Ranghar|Rajput]] and [[Muslim Tyagi]], often living in their own villages, and following distinct customs. Almost all these groups are [[Sunni]], and speak [[Khari boli]]. While the region of [[Awadh]] is home to both large communities of [[Momin Ansari|Ansari]]s, [[Khanzada (Awadh)|Khanzada]]s and [[Shaikh of Uttar Pradesh|Shaikh]], some of whom are [[Shia]], and most speak [[Awadhi]].<ref>People of India. Uttar Pradesh / general editor, K.S. Singh; editors, Amir Hasan, B.R. Rizvi, J.C. Das. I SBN/ISSN 8173041148 (set)</ref>\n\nThe population is also further divided by linguistic division. Muslims in [[Uttar Pradesh]] speak [[Urdu]], as well as also local Hindi dialects, such as [[Bhojpuri]], [[Awadhi]], [[Khari Boli]] and [[Braj Bhasha]].\n\n== Language ==\n\n[[File:Zaban urdu mualla.png|left|thumb|The phrase ''Zaban-e Urdu-e Mualla'' (\"The language of the exalted camp\") written in [[Nasta\u02bfl\u012bq script]].]]{{Main|Urdu}}\n\nWhat unites the various Muslim communities in Uttar Pradesh is the use of the [[Urdu]] language. Urdu has much in common with the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], as is thus mutually intelligible with [[Standard Hindi]]. The grammatical description in this article concerns this standard Urdu. The original language of the Mughals was [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], a [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language, but after their arrival in South Asia, they came to adopt Persian. Gradually, the need to communicate with local inhabitants led to a composition of Sanskrit-derived languages, written in the [[Perso-Arabic script]] and with literary conventions and specialized vocabulary being retained from Persian, Arabic and Turkic; the new standard was eventually given its own name of ''Urdu''.<ref>Hindi By Yamuna Kachru https://books.google.com/books?id=ooH5VfLTQEQC&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2&dq=urdu+heavy+persian&source=bl&ots=dG3qgmaV95&sig=WivP7AW9eRlTcp4oscBoHCBFEE0&hl=en&ei=9sp8SqzpLI6y-AaM5vxG&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=9#v=onepage&q=urdu%20heavy%20persian&f=false</ref>\n\nUrdu is often [[Hindi#Standard Hindi and Urdu|contrasted with Hindi]], another standardised form of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]].

Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton?

On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister.

The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%.

By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire. Major paved the way for the Good Friday Agreement, also known as the 'Belfast Agreement', which was signed after he left office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Good-Friday-Agreement |title=Good Friday Agreement |encyclopedia= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |date= 15 April 2019}}</ref>\nIn March 1995, Major refused to answer the phone calls of United States President [[Bill Clinton]] for several days because of his anger at Clinton's decision to invite Gerry Adams to the [[White House]] for [[Saint Patrick's Day|St Patrick's Day]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1243638,00.html|title='Mandela helped me survive Monicagate, Arafat could not make the leap to peace&nbsp;\u2013 and for days John Major wouldn't take my calls'|work=The Guardian |location=London | date= 21 June 2004 | accessdate=17 September 2006 | first=Alan | last=Rusbridger}}</ref>\n\n===Rail===\nFrom 1994 to 1997, Major [[privatisation of British Rail|privatised British Rail]], splitting it up into [[Passenger rail franchising in Great Britain|franchises to be run by the private sector]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/docSummary.php?docID=12| title=Railways Act 1993| author=Her Majesty's Government | year=1903| website=The Railways Archive| publisher=originally published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office| accessdate=26 November 2006}}</ref> The process was controversial at the time, and the [[Impact of the privatisation of British Rail|effect of privatising the railway]] is still disputed, with large growth in passenger numbers and increasing efficiency matched by large public subsidy<ref>{{cite news|title= Have train fares gone up or down since British Rail?|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21056703|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=22 January 2013|publisher=BBC News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/regulation-industry/what-would-we-consider-a-successful-railway-system|title=What would we consider a successful railway system?|last=Southwood|first=Ben|date=19 August 2014|publisher=[[Adam Smith Institute]]|accessdate=23 September 2016}}</ref> and concern about foreign companies running British railways.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/revealed-how-the-world-gets-rich-from-privatising-british-public-services-9874048.html|title=Revealed: How the world gets rich \u2013 from privatising British public services|work=[[The Independent]]|accessdate= 30 December 2015|date=20 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===\"Sleaze\"===\nAt the 1993 [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Conference, Major began the \"[[Back to Basics (campaign)|Back to Basics]]\" campaign, which he intended to also be about a wide variety of issues including the economy, education and policing, but which was interpreted by many (including Conservative cabinet ministers) purely in the context of returning to the moral and [[family values]] that they associated with the Conservative Party.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=403\u201308}}\n\nInstead of being well received, \"Back to Basics\" instead became synonymous with scandal, often exposed in lurid and embarrassing detail by [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid newspapers]] such as ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

[[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] and [[Leader of the Conservative Party (UK)|Leader of the Conservative Party]] from 1990 to 1997. Major was [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] in the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher Government]] from 1989 to 1990, and was [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]] from 1979 until his retirement in 2001. Since the death of [[Margaret Thatcher]] in 2013, he has been both the oldest and earliest-serving of all [[Living prime ministers of the United Kingdom|living former prime ministers]].\n\nBorn in [[St Helier, London|St Helier, Surrey]], Major grew up in [[Brixton]]. He initially worked as an insurance clerk, and then at the [[London Electricity Board]], before becoming an executive at [[Standard Chartered]]. He was first elected to the House of Commons at the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]] as MP for [[Huntingdon (UK Parliament constituency)|Huntingdon]]. He served as a Parliamentary Private Secretary, Assistant Whip and as a Minister for Social Security. In 1987, he joined the Cabinet as [[Chief Secretary to the Treasury]], and was promoted to foreign secretary two years later. Just three months later in October 1989, he was appointed chancellor of the Exchequer, where he presented the 1990 budget. Major became prime minister after Thatcher resigned in November 1990. He presided over British participation in the [[Gulf War]] in March 1991, and negotiated the [[Maastricht Treaty]] in December 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1991/dec/11/european-council-maastricht |title=European Council (Maastricht) |website=Hansard |date=11 December 1991 |accessdate=17 May 2011}}</ref> He went on to lead the Conservatives to a record fourth consecutive electoral victory, winning the most votes in British electoral history with over 14&nbsp;million votes at the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]], albeit with a reduced majority in the House of Commons. Shortly after this, in what came to be known as [[Black Wednesday]] (September 1992), his government was forced to withdraw the [[pound sterling]] from the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]]. This event led to a loss of confidence in Conservative economic policies and Major was never able to achieve a lead in opinion polls again.\n\nDespite the eventual revival of economic growth amongst other successes such as the beginnings of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], by the mid-1990s, the Conservative Party was embroiled in scandals involving various MPs (including cabinet ministers). Criticism of Major's leadership reached such a pitch that he chose to resign as party leader in June 1995, challenging his critics to either back him or challenge him; he was duly challenged by [[John Redwood]] but was easily re-elected. By this time, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] had moved toward the [[Centrism|centre]] under the leadership of [[Tony Blair]] and won many by-elections, eventually depriving Major's government of a parliamentary majority in December 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Major minority|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-major-minority-1314246.html|website=The Independent|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=13 December 1996}}</ref> Major went on to lose the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] five months later, in one of the largest electoral defeats since the [[Reform Act 1832|Great Reform Act]] of 1832.\n\nMajor was succeeded by [[William Hague]] as Leader of the Conservative Party in June 1997. He went on to retire from active politics, leaving the House of Commons at the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]].

Two years later, in a surprise July 1989 reshuffle, Major succeeded [[Geoffrey Howe]] as [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]]. The rapid promotion surprised many, due to Major's relative lack of experience in the Cabinet. Just three months later, in October 1989, Major was appointed [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] after the sudden resignation of [[Nigel Lawson]]. This meant that, despite only being in the Cabinet for little over two years, Major had gone from the most junior position in the Cabinet to holding two of the [[Great Offices of State]].\n\nAs Chancellor, Major presented only one Budget, the first to be televised live, in early 1990. He publicised it as ''a budget for savings'' and announced the [[Tax-exempt special savings account|Tax-Exempt Special Savings Account]] (TESSA), arguing that measures were required to address the marked fall in the household [[Average propensity to save|savings ratio]] that had been apparent during the previous [[Fiscal year|financial year]]. In June 1990, Major suggested that the proposed Single European Currency should be a \"hard [[wikt:ecu|ecu]]\", competing against existing national currencies; this idea was not in the end adopted. In October 1990, Major and [[Douglas Hurd]], Major's successor as Foreign Secretary, persuaded Thatcher to support British entry to the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism]], a move which she had resisted for many years, and which had played a part in the resignation of Nigel Lawson.<ref>Edmund Dell, ''The Chancellors: A History of the Chancellors of the Exchequer, 1945\u201390'' (HarperCollins, 1997), pp. 541\u201350.</ref>\n\nAfter [[Michael Heseltine]] challenged Thatcher for the leadership of the Conservative Party [[1990 Conservative Party leadership election|in November 1990]], Major and Douglas Hurd were the proposer and seconder on her nomination papers for the leadership ballot. After Thatcher was unable to win enough support to prevent a second ballot, she announced her resignation as Prime Minister and Conservative Leader. Major subsequently announced on 22 November that he would stand in the second ballot. A close ally of Thatcher, Major was supported by her during the remainder of the leadership contest. Major had been at home in Huntingdon recovering from a wisdom tooth operation during the first leadership ballot. Thatcher's nomination papers for the second ballot were sent to him by car for him to sign \u2013 it later emerged that he had signed both Thatcher's papers and a set of papers for his own candidacy in case she withdrew.\n\nUnlike in the first ballot, a candidate only required a simple majority of Conservative MPs to win, in this case 186 of 372 MPs. The ballot was held on the afternoon of 27 November; although Major fell two votes short of the required winning total, he polled far enough ahead of both Douglas Hurd and [[Michael Heseltine]] to secure immediate concessions from them. With no remaining challengers, Major was formally named Leader of the Conservative Party that evening and was duly appointed Prime Minister the following day. He was the first Prime Minister younger than the Monarch since [[Stanley Baldwin]] (under [[George V]] between 1935 and 1936).\n\n==Prime Minister==\n{{Infobox administration\n| image = John Major 1996.jpg\n| image_size = \n| name = Premiership of John Major\n| term_start = 28 November 1990\n| term_end = 2 May 1997\n| premier = John Major\n| premier_link = Prime Minister of the United Kingdom\n| cabinet = [[First Major ministry|1st Major ministry]]<br />[[Second Major ministry|2nd Major ministry]]\n| party = [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]]\n| election = [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992]]\n| appointer = Elizabeth II\n| seat = [[10 Downing Street]]\n| predecessor = [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]]\n| successor = [[Premiership of Tony Blair|Tony Blair]]\n| seal = Royal Coat of Arms of the United Kingdom (HM Government).svg\n| seal_size = \n| seal_caption = Royal Arms of the Government\n| official_url = \n}}\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of John Major]], [[Prime ministership of John Major]] -->\n{{Further|First Major ministry|Second Major ministry}}\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = \n   | footer    =\n   | image1    = Arcbushmaj.jpg\n   | alt1      = \n   | caption1  = Major with President [[George H.

The Conservatives had been consistently behind Labour in the opinion polls since 1989, and the gap had widened significantly during 1990. Within two months of Major becoming Prime Minister, Major was required to lead Britain through the first [[Gulf War]], playing a key role in persuading US President [[George H. W. Bush]] to support [[no-fly zone]]s. During this period, Major and his Cabinet survived an [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] assassination attempt by [[Downing Street mortar attack|mortar attack]]. The Conservatives managed to regain a lead in the opinion polls after this period, with polls also showing Major as the most popular Prime Minister since [[Harold Macmillan]] in the early 1960s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/673348.stm John Major: A life in politics], BBC News, 28 September 2002.</ref>\n\nIn spite of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Leader]] [[Neil Kinnock]]'s repeated calls for an immediate general election after Major became Prime Minister, it wasn't until March 1992 that Major called an election for 9 April. Major took his campaign onto the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned [[soapbox]] as he had done in his days on Lambeth Council. This approach stood in contrast to the Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting [[Negative campaigning|negative campaign]] advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. During the campaign, both parties were either tied or within one point of each other in opinion polls, leading to uncertainty over who would win \u2013 or whether there would be an outright election winner at all. On the night of the election, exit polls indicated a very slim Labour lead, which most observers predicted would translate into either a [[hung parliament]] or a small Labour majority, with Major's best hope of retaining power being with the Tories remaining in government as a minority government or as part of a coalition.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8280050.stm|title=Poll tracker: Interactive guide to the opinion polls|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=8 March 2010 | date=29 September 2009 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nDespite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election outright, gaining in excess of 14&nbsp;million votes, the highest popular vote ever recorded by a British political party in a general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.\n\nMajor's Brixton roots were used in a campaign poster during the Conservative Party's 1992 election campaign: \"What does the Conservative Party offer a working class kid from Brixton? They made him Prime Minister.\"{{sfn|Bennett|1996}}\n\n===Black Wednesday===\n{{Main|Black Wednesday}}\nMajor's second honeymoon as Prime Minister following his election victory did not last long. On 16 September 1992, the UK was forced to exit the [[European Exchange Rate Mechanism|Exchange Rate Mechanism]] (ERM) in difficult circumstances, in a day which would come to be known as \"Black Wednesday\", with billions of pounds wasted in a futile attempt to defend the value of sterling. The upheaval caused by the day's events was such that Major came close to resigning as Prime Minister, preparing an unsent letter of resignation addressed to the Queen.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1409254,00.html|title=Treasury papers reveal cost of Black Wednesday |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 9 February 2005|accessdate=2 October 2006  | first=Matthew | last=Tempest}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1483186/Major-was-ready-to-quit-over-Black-Wednesday.html|title= Major was ready to quit over Black Wednesday|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date= 10 February 2005|accessdate=30 September 2009  | first1=Toby | last1=Helm}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Major continued to defend Britain's membership of the ERM, stating that \"the ERM was the medicine to cure the ailment, but it was not the ailment\", the disaster of Black Wednesday left the Government's economic credibility irreparably damaged.{{sfn|Major|2000|p=341}} Major kept his economic team unchanged for seven months after Black Wednesday before eventually sacking [[Norman Lamont]] as [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], replacing him with [[Kenneth Clarke]]. This came after months of press criticism of Lamont during his 1993 budget and a heavy defeat at a by-election in [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. His delay in sacking Lamont was exploited by Major's critics both inside and outside of his party, who used it to claim Major was too indecisive. Immediately after Black Wednesday, the Conservatives fell far behind Labour in the opinion polls and Major would never be able to regain the lead for the rest of his time as Prime Minister, being trounced in local council elections and the European Parliament elections on the way, as well as suffering a string of by-election defeats which gradually wiped out the Conservative majority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/historical-polls/voting-intention-1992-1997 |title=UK Polling Report |publisher=UK Polling Report |accessdate=13 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWithin a year of his triumphant election victory, public opinion on Major plummeted, with Black Wednesday, mine closures, the [[Maastricht Treaty|Maastricht]] dispute and high unemployment being cited as four key areas of dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister. Newspapers which traditionally supported the Conservatives and had championed Major at the election were now being severely critical of him almost daily.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/leading-article-john-major-is-he-up-to-the-job-1453316.html | location=London | work=The Independent | date=4 April 1993 | title=Leading Article: John Major: Is he up to the job?}}</ref> The UK's forced withdrawal from the ERM was succeeded by a partial economic recovery with a new policy of flexible [[exchange rate]]s, allowing lower interest rates and [[devaluation]], thereby increasing demand for UK goods in export markets. The recession that had started shortly before Major became Prime Minister was declared over in April 1993, when the economy grew by 0.2%. Unemployment also started to fall; it had stood at nearly 3 million by the end of 1992, but by the spring of 1997 it had fallen to 1.7&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/26/newsid_2503000/2503271.stm |title=BBC ON THIS DAY &#124; 1993: Recession over&nbsp;\u2013 it's official |publisher=BBC News |date=26 April 1962 |accessdate=17 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/wanted-a-wartsandall-tally-of-uks-jobless-1316516.html |title=Wanted: a warts-and-all tally of UK's jobless&nbsp;\u2013 Business, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=30 December 1996 |accessdate=17 April 2010  | first=John | last=Philpott}}</ref>\n\n===Europe===\nOn becoming Prime Minister, Major had promised to keep Britain \"at the very heart of Europe\", and claimed to have won \"game, set and match for Britain\" \u2013 by negotiating the Social Chapter and Single Currency opt-outs from the [[Maastricht Treaty]], and by ensuring that there was no overt mention of a \"Federal\" Europe and that foreign and defence policy were kept as matters of inter-governmental co-operation, in separate \"pillars\" from the supranational European Union. By 2010 some of these concessions, although not Britain's non-membership of the Single Currency, had been overtaken by subsequent events.\n\nEven these moves towards greater European integration met with vehement opposition from the [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] wing of Major's party and his Cabinet, as the Government attempted to ratify the Maastricht Treaty in the first half of 1993. Although Labour supported the treaty, they tactically opposed certain provisions of the Treaty to exploit divisions in the Government. This opposition included passing an amendment that required a vote on the Social Chapter aspects of the Treaty before it could be ratified. On 22 July 1993, several Conservative MPs, known as the [[Maastricht Rebels]], voted against the Treaty, and the Government was defeated. Major called another vote on the following day, which he declared as a [[1993 vote of confidence in the Major ministry|vote of confidence]]. He won the vote but the damage had been done to his authority in Parliament.\n\nLater that day, Major gave an interview to [[ITN]]'s [[Michael Brunson]]. During an unguarded moment when Major thought that the microphones had been switched off, Brunson asked why he did not sack the ministers who were conspiring against him. He replied: \"Just think it through from my perspective. You are the Prime Minister, with a majority of 18&nbsp;... where do you think most of the poison is coming from? From the dispossessed and the never-possessed. Do we want three more of the bastards out there? What's [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]'s maxim?\"<ref>The maxim referred to is Johnson's comment about [[J. Edgar Hoover]]: Johnson had once sought a way to remove Hoover from his post as head of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), but upon realising that the problems involved in such a plan were insurmountable, he accepted Hoover's presence philosophically, reasoning that it would be \"better to have him inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in\".</ref> Major later said that he had picked the number three from the air and that he was referring to \"former ministers who had left the government and begun to create havoc with their anti-European activities\",{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=343\u201344}} but many journalists suggested that the three were [[Peter Lilley]], [[Michael Portillo]] and [[Michael Howard]], three of the more prominent \"[[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]]s\" within his Cabinet.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk|title=Major hits out at Cabinet|first1=Paul|last1=Routledge|first2=Simon|last2=Hoggart|work=[[The Observer]]|date=25 July 1993|accessdate=10 October 2011|location=London}}</ref> Throughout the rest of Major's time as Prime Minister the exact identity of the three was blurred, with [[John Redwood]]'s name frequently appearing in a list along with two of the others. The tape of this conversation was leaked to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' and widely reported, embarrassing Major.\n\nBy April 1993, a mere 12 months after his general election triumph, John Major's popularity as Prime Minister had slumped. As well as his party's dismal showings in the opinion polls, Major's own personal ratings in opinion polls were similarly low. He was now being reviled on an almost daily basis by newspapers whose support the Conservatives had once appeared to have taken for granted. Critics from all corners were also criticising his 'consensus' approach to politics, which contrasted sharply to the confrontational approach of [[Margaret Thatcher]] \u2013 while others were keen to point out that Major's conciliatory approach to the job was something that many observers had been hoping for when Thatcher left office in 1990. Comparisons were being drawn up with an earlier Conservative prime minister, [[Anthony Eden]] \u2013 who had risen through the ranks as a highly respected government minister before becoming prime minister, only to be seen as a disappointment after he did take over.\n\nArguments continued over Europe. Early in 1994 Major vetoed the Belgian politician [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] to succeed [[Jacques Delors]] as [[President of the European Commission]] for being excessively federalist, only to find that he had to accept a Luxembourg politician of similar views, [[Jacques Santer]], instead. Around this time Major \u2013 who in an unfortunate phrase denounced the Labour Leader [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]] as \"Monsieur Oui, the poodle of Brussels\" \u2013 tried to demand an increase in the Qualified Majority needed for voting in the newly enlarged European Union (i.e. making it easier for Britain, in alliance with other countries, to block federalist measures). After Major had to back down on this issue [[Tony Marlow]] called openly in the House of Commons for his resignation. In 1996 European governments banned British beef over claims that it was infected with [[mad cow disease]] \u2013 the British government withheld co-operation with the EU over the issue, but did not succeed in getting the ban lifted, only a timetable of lifting it. The conflict has been named the [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#The ban on British beef|Beef war]]. By April 2013, [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy#Epidemiology|vCJD]] \u2013 the human form of the disease \u2013 had killed 280 people (176 of them in Britain).\n\nFor the rest of Major's premiership the main argument was over whether Britain would join the planned European Single Currency. Some leading Conservatives, including Chancellor [[Ken Clarke]], favoured joining and insisted that Britain retain a completely free choice, whilst increasing numbers of others expressed their reluctance to join. By this time billionaire [[James Goldsmith|Sir James Goldsmith]] had set up his own Referendum Party, siphoning off some Conservative support, and at the 1997 General Election many Conservative candidates were openly expressing reluctance to join.\n\n===Bosnia===\nMajor's premiership saw the ongoing war in [[Bosnia]]. Government policy was to maintain the United Nations arms embargo which restricted the flow of weapons into the region and to oppose airstrikes against Bosnian Serbs. The Government's reasoning was that an arms embargo would only create a \"level killing field\" and that airstrikes would endanger UN peacekeepers and the humanitarian aid effort. This policy was criticised by Thatcher and others who saw the Bosnian Muslims as the main victims of Serb aggression and compared the situation to events in the Second World War. The [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]], by contrast, was committed to a policy of \"lift and strike\" (lifting the arms embargo and inflicting airstrikes on the Serbs) causing tensions in the \"special relationship\" ([[Douglas Hurd]] and others strongly opposed this policy).\n\n[[File:Sea King HC4 with PM John Major Sarajevo 1996.JPEG|thumb|A [[Westland Sea King]] helicopter carrying Major above the Ilidza Compound in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia]], during [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] in 1996.]]\nSome commentators compared the Major Government's policy to \"amoral equivalency\" because it appeared to judge the Bosnian Government and the Bosnian Serbs equally culpable.<ref>{{cite web |last=Bogdanor |first=Vernon |url=http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |title=No apologies for Bosnia  |publisher=Bosnia.org.uk |accessdate=17 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130724040607/http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=1081&reportid=163 |archive-date=24 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> To some extent, these critics of Major's policy were later vindicated when, in an article published in 2011, the then-Defence Secretary [[Malcolm Rifkind]] accepted that the arms embargo was a \"serious mistake\" by the UN.<ref>{{cite web|last=Attila |first=Marko |url=http://greatersurbiton.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/sir-malcolm-rifkind-arms-embargo-on-bosnia-was-the-most-serious-mistake-made-by-the-un/ |title=Sir Malcolm Rifkind: Arms embargo on Bosnia was 'the most serious mistake made by the UN' \" Greater Surbiton |publisher=Greatersurbiton.wordpress.com |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Northern Ireland===\nMajor opened talks with the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) upon taking office.

The [[Downing Street Declaration]] was issued on 15 December 1993 by Major and [[Albert Reynolds]], the Irish [[Taoiseach]], with whom he had a friendly relationship: an IRA ceasefire followed in 1994. In the House of Commons, Major refused to sign up to the first draft of the \"[[George J. Mitchell|Mitchell]] Principles\", which resulted in the ending of the ceasefire.

Later, [[David Willetts]] resigned as [[Paymaster General]] after he was accused of rigging evidence to do with ''Cash for Questions''.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=476, 500\u201301, 691}}\n\nDefence Minister [[Jonathan Aitken]] was accused by the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[investigative journalism]] series ''[[World in Action]]'' and ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper of secretly doing deals with leading Saudi princes. He denied all accusations and promised to wield the \"sword of truth\" in libel proceedings which he brought against ''The Guardian'' and the producers of ''World in Action'' [[Granada Television]]. At an early stage in the trial, it became apparent that he had lied under oath, and he was subsequently (after the Major government had fallen from power) convicted of perjury and sentenced to a term of imprisonment.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=480, 500\u201302}}\n\nMajor attempted to draw some of the sting from the financial scandals by setting up public inquiries \u2013 the Nolan Report into standards expected in public life, and the Scott Report into the Arms to Iraq Scandal.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=344\u201345, 501}}\n\nAlthough [[Tim Smith (British politician)|Tim Smith]] stepped down from the House of Commons at the 1997 general election, both Neil Hamilton and Jonathan Aitken sought re-election for their seats, and were both defeated, in Hamilton's case by the former BBC Reporter [[Martin Bell]], who stood as an anti-sleaze candidate, both the Labour and Liberal Democrat candidates withdrawing in his favour, amidst further publicity unfavourable to the Conservatives.{{sfn|Seldon|1998|pp=717\u201319}}\n\nMajor later commented in his memoirs on the \"routine\" with which he would be telephoned over the weekend to be warned of the latest embarrassing story due to break. He wrote that he took a stern line against financial impropriety, but was angered at the way in which a host of scandals, many of them petty sexual misdemeanours by a small number of MPs, were exploited by the press and Opposition for political advantage. He also conceded that the issue \"fed the public belief that the Conservative(s)&nbsp;... had been in government too long, and had got into bad habits\" and quoted Labour's claim in 1997: \"Nothing better encapsulates what people think of this government. Sleaze will be one of the things which brings this government down.\"{{sfn|Major|1999|pp=550\u201352}}\n\n===Leadership crisis===\nOn 22 June 1995, tired of continual threats of leadership challenges that never arose, Major resigned as Leader of the Conservative Party and announced he would contest the resulting [[1995 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] \u2013 he continued to serve as Prime Minister while the leadership was vacant, but would have resigned had he not been re-elected by a large enough majority. [[John Redwood]] resigned as [[Secretary of State for Wales]] to stand against him. Major won by 218 votes to Redwood's 89, with 12 spoiled ballots, eight 'active' abstentions and two MPs abstaining, enough to easily win in the first round. The amount was three more than the target he had privately set himself, having earlier resolved to resign if he could not carry the support of at least 215 of his MPs, the two-thirds threshold of his own parliamentary party.{{sfn|Major|1999}}\n\n''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, still at this stage supporting the Conservative Party, had lost faith in Major and declared its support for Redwood in the leadership election, running the front-page headline \"Redwood versus Deadwood\".<ref>{{cite news |title=PM assails 'malcontent' Redwood |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/pm-assails-malcontent-redwood-1588458.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first1=Donald | last1=Macintyre | first2=Colin | last2=Brown | date=27 June 1995}}</ref>\n\n===1997 election and resignation===\nMajor's comfortable re-election as Conservative Leader failed to restore his authority. Despite efforts to improve the popularity of the Conservative Party, Labour remained far ahead in the opinion polls as the election loomed, despite the economic boom that had followed the exit from recession four years earlier, and the swift fall in unemployment. By-election losses and defections meant that in December 1996, the Conservatives had lost their majority in the House of Commons. Major managed to survive to the end of the Parliament, leading what had effectively become a minority government, and called an election on 17 March 1997 as the five-year limit for its timing approached. Major had deliberately delayed the election until close to the last possible moment in the hope that a still-improving economy would help the Conservatives hold a greater number of seats, and that voters would be deterred from Labour by exposing the party's policies with slogans like \"New Labour, New Danger\". He was also accused by the opposition of proroguing Parliament earlier than usual for political purposes, to delay the publication of a report into the \"Cash for Questions\" scandal.<ref>{{cite news | author       =<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> | title        = Fury as sleaze report buried | url          = https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1997/mar/19/conservatives.uk | work         = The Guardian | location     = London | date         = 19 March 1997 | access-date  =10 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Major, his attempts to win public support and swing the election in favour of the Tories did not work. Even ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper, which had championed the Conservatives five years earlier and claimed to have won the 1992 general election for the party, declared its support for [[Tony Blair]]'s \"New Labour\", condemning the Tories as \"tired, divided and rudderless\".{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nOn 1 May 1997, the Conservative Party suffered the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|worst electoral defeat]] by a ruling party since the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In the new Parliament, Labour held 418 seats, the Conservatives 165, and the Liberal Democrats 46, giving Labour a majority of 179; it was the lowest number of Conservative seats in Parliament for over a century, and the new political landscape appeared likely to guarantee Labour at least two successive parliamentary terms in government. Major himself was re-elected in his own constituency of Huntingdon with a reduced majority of 18,140, but 179 other Conservative MPs were defeated, including present and former Cabinet Ministers such as Norman Lamont, Malcolm Rifkind and Michael Portillo. The huge election defeat also left the Conservatives without any MPs in Scotland or Wales for the first time in history. The party would not return to government until [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010]], and did not win a parliamentary majority until [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015]], which only lasted two years.\n\nThe following day Major travelled to [[Buckingham Palace]] to inform the Queen of his resignation as Prime Minister. Shortly before this he had announced his intention to also resign as Conservative Leader, giving his final statement outside [[10 Downing Street]] in which he said; \"When the curtain falls, it is time to get off the stage\u2014and that is what I propose to do.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnmajor.co.uk/page824.html|title=Mr Major's Resignation Statement|date=27 June 2011}}</ref> Major then announced to the press that he intended to go with his family to [[The Oval]] to watch [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] play cricket.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\n==Final years in Parliament==\nAlthough many Conservative MPs wanted Major to resign as leader immediately, there was a movement among the grassroots of the party, encouraged by his political allies, to have him stay on as leader until the autumn. [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 7th Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Cranborne]], his Chief of Staff during the election, and the Chief Whip, [[Alastair Goodlad]], both pleaded with him to stay on. They argued that remaining as leader for a few months would give the party time to come to terms with the scale of defeat before electing a successor.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=38\u201339}} Major refused, saying: \"It would be terrible, because I would be presiding with no authority over a number of candidates fighting for the crown. It would merely prolong the agony.\"{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}}\n\nMajor served as [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] for seven weeks while the [[1997 Conservative Party leadership election|leadership election]] to replace him was underway. He formed [[Shadow Cabinet of John Major|a temporary Shadow Cabinet]], but with seven of his Cabinet Ministers having lost their seats at the election, and with few senior MPs left to replace them, several MPs had to hold multiple briefs.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major himself served as [[Shadow Foreign Secretary]] and [[Shadow Secretary of State for Defence]], and the office of [[Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland|Shadow Scotland Secretary]] was left vacant until after the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]] as the party had no MPs from Scotland.{{sfn|Snowdon|2010|p=39}} Major's resignation as Conservative Leader formally took effect on 19 June 1997 after the election of [[William Hague]].

In spite of this, conflict raged within the parliamentary Conservative Party, particularly over the extent of Britain's integration with the [[European Union]]. Major never succeeded in reconciling the \"Euro-rebels\" among his MPs to his European policy, who although relatively few in number, wielded great influence because of his small majority and their wider following among Conservative activists and voters. Episodes such as the Maastricht Rebellion led by [[Bill Cash]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]] inflicted serious political damage on him and his government. The additional bitterness on the right wing of the Conservative Party at the manner in which [[Margaret Thatcher]] had been deposed did not make Major's task any easier. A series of scandals among leading Conservative MPs also did Major and his government no favours. His task became even more difficult after the well-received election of [[Tony Blair]] as [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour leader]] in July 1994.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/7593554.stm |publisher=BBC News | title=Who has been UK's greatest post-war PM? | date=16 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor defended his government in his memoirs, focusing particularly on how under him the British economy had recovered from the recession of 1990\u20131992. He wrote that, \"During my premiership interest rates fell from 14% to 6%; unemployment was at 1.75&nbsp;million when I took office, and at 1.6&nbsp;million and falling upon my departure; and the government's annual borrowing rose from [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]0.5&nbsp;billion to nearly \u00a346&nbsp;billion at its peak before falling to \u00a31&nbsp;billion\".{{sfn|Major|2000|p=689}} [[Kenneth Clarke|Ken Clarke]] stated in 2016 that Major's reputation looked better as time went by, in the same way that [[Tony Blair]]'s legacy appeared to be in decline.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rice|first1=Michael|title=In Depth BBC Interview: Ken Clarke|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox24s3NylMI&t=1808s|accessdate=26 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe former Labour MP [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] said of Major in 1994 that, \"He was a fairly competent Chairman of Housing on Lambeth Council.

Wilson and Sarah Urich. Known to the library world as '''Florence Wilson''', she was a true generalist, interested in everything around her. Wilson was educated at Gibson's College Preparatory School in [[Philadelphia]], and wanted to become a social worker, but due to her delicate health could not obtain permission from her father. She studied at the [[Drexel Institute|Drexel Institute the University of Pennsylvania Extension Division]], and [[Columbia University]], where she also worked as a librarian. She graduated from the [[Drexel Institute Library School]] in 1909, after finally gaining the reluctant consent of her father.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Dale|first=Doris Cruger|year=1972|title=An American in Geneva: Florence Wilson and the League of Nations Library|jstor=25540353|journal=The Journal of Library History|volume=7|pages=109\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nFrom the date of her graduation until 1917, she was a librarian with Columbia University Library. During those years she was involved in a variety of tasks. She organized the drama and English libraries of Columbia University and the [[National Committee for Mental Hygiene]]. She was an instructor in cataloging and classification as well as librarian of the natural science library during the last four years at Columbia. Among her many specialties, she also specialized in international relations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Paris Peace Conference ==\nIn 1917 Wilson participated in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], working as a liaison officer of the [[American Library Association]] and the [[Library of Congress]]. Following that, in 1918\u20131919, she became only female member of the [[American Peace Commission]], and only female participant of the conference in general. Her job was taking care of documentation and historical work. Due to the work concerning the conference, she was asked to establish and organize the League of Nations library.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== League of Nations ==\n[[File:100elles-20190524-Route Marie-Florence WILSON - Route de Ferney.jpg|thumb|Route Marie-Florence WILSON - Route de Ferney]]\nDue to her work with the American Peace Commission, Wilson was \"asked to organize library of the new League of Nations\" (p. 110). When she took this position, she was the only \"female library director in all of Europe\".<ref name=\":0\" /> She worked as Assistant Librarian to the League of Nations (Second Division) from October 1, 1919, to May 31, 1922, at which point she was promoted to Librarian of the League of Nations (First Division), serving there from June 1, 1922, to December 31, 1926.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lonsea.de/pub/person/10765|title=LONSEA - League of Nations Search Engine|website=lonsea.de|language=de|access-date=5 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs Chief of Section, she oversaw a substantial division on the League: between 1921 and 1922, her yearly budget for acquisition of books was $40,000 and she supervised 13 highly qualified librarians. Despite the importance of her position, Wilson's wages comprised less than half of those of her male colleagues. Her role in establishing the organization of the League of Nations Library meant she was responsible for the standardizing text references in a way that was accessible to a large international body. Her initial choice of the American referencing system was challenged by members of the League who favored their own systems of library referencing. After researching multiple European and international libraries, she settled on the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey system]] of referencing, favoring its internationalist appeal for the League.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWilson had a vision for the League of Nations Library as an accessible resource for League members, utilizing a complete bibliography of documents.

Wilson and Sarah Urich. Known to the library world as Florence Wilson, she was a true generalist, interested in everything around her. Wilson was educated at Gibson's College Preparatory School in [[Philadelphia]], and wanted to become a social worker, but due to her delicate health could not obtain permission from her father. She studied at the [[Drexel Institute|Drexel Institute the University of Pennsylvania Extension Division]], and [[Columbia University]], where she also worked as a librarian. She graduated from the [[Drexel Institute Library School]] in 1909, after finally gaining the reluctant consent of her father.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Dale|first=Doris Cruger|year=1972|title=An American in Geneva: Florence Wilson and the League of Nations Library|jstor=25540353|journal=The Journal of Library History|volume=7|pages=109\u2013129}}</ref>\n\nFrom the date of her graduation until 1917, she was a librarian with Columbia University Library. During those years she was involved in a variety of tasks. She organized the drama and English libraries of Columbia University and the [[National Committee for Mental Hygiene]]. She was an instructor in cataloging and classification as well as librarian of the natural science library during the last four years at Columbia. Among her many specialties, she also specialized in international relations.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Paris Peace Conference ==\nIn 1917 Wilson participated in the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], working as a liaison officer of the [[American Library Association]] and the [[Library of Congress]]. Following that, in 1918\u20131919, she became only female member of the [[American Peace Commission]], and only female participant of the conference in general. Her job was taking care of documentation and historical work. Due to the work concerning the conference, she was asked to establish and organize the League of Nations library.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== League of Nations ==\n[[File:100elles-20190524-Route Marie-Florence WILSON - Route de Ferney.jpg|thumb|Route Marie-Florence WILSON - Route de Ferney]]\nDue to her work with the American Peace Commission, Wilson was \"asked to organize library of the new League of Nations\" (p. 110).

Despite the importance of her position, Wilson's wages comprised less than half of those of her male colleagues. Her role in establishing the organization of the League of Nations Library meant she was responsible for the standardizing text references in a way that was accessible to a large international body. Her initial choice of the American referencing system was challenged by members of the League who favored their own systems of library referencing. After researching multiple European and international libraries, she settled on the [[Dewey Decimal Classification|Dewey system]] of referencing, favoring its internationalist appeal for the League.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWilson had a vision for the League of Nations Library as an accessible resource for League members, utilizing a complete bibliography of documents.
