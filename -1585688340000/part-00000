The group was composed of mostly Hawaiian subjects of American descent and American citizens who were members of the ''[[Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom|Missionary Party]]'', as well as foreign residents in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] that planned and carried out the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] on January 17, 1893. The goal of this group was to achieve [[Annexation of Hawaii|annexation of Hawai{{okina}}i]] by the [[United States]]. The new independent [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]] government was thwarted in this goal by the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]], and it was not until 1898 that the United States Congress approved a joint resolution of annexation creating the U.S. [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai{{okina}}i]].\n\n==Formation==\n\nThe Committee of Safety originated from a leadership group when members of the Missionary Party began to run as Independent Party candidates. For the elections of 1884 the Missionary Party strictly ran all candidates as Independent Party candidates. To ensure that Missionaries were on the Independent ticket the \u201cCommittee of Nine\u201d was formed April 16, 1883, to assume the leadership position of the Independent Party. The Committee of Nine were staunchly loyal to the Missionary Party, having social and economic philosophies that reflected the Missionary values. The Independent Party won 13 seats and was the minority party in the Hawaii legislature.

The group was composed of mostly Hawaiian subjects of American descent and American citizens who were members of the ''[[Reform Party of the Hawaiian Kingdom|Missionary Party]]'', as well as foreign residents in the [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] that planned and carried out the [[overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]] on January 17, 1893. The goal of this group was to achieve [[Annexation of Hawaii|annexation of Hawai{{okina}}i]] by the [[United States]]. The new independent [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]] government was thwarted in this goal by the administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]], and it was not until 1898 that the United States Congress approved a joint resolution of annexation creating the U.S. [[Territory of Hawaii|Territory of Hawai{{okina}}i]].\n\n==Formation==\n\nThe Committee of Safety originated from a leadership group when members of the Missionary Party began to run as Independent Party candidates. For the elections of 1884 the Missionary Party strictly ran all candidates as Independent Party candidates. To ensure that Missionaries were on the Independent ticket the \u201cCommittee of Nine\u201d was formed April 16, 1883, to assume the leadership position of the Independent Party. The Committee of Nine were staunchly loyal to the Missionary Party, having social and economic philosophies that reflected the Missionary values. The Independent Party won 13 seats and was the minority party in the Hawaii legislature. For the following elections of 1886 the committee reconvened, this time calling themselves the \u201cCommittee of Thirteen\u201d due to the change in members. Their intent was to make the Independent Party the majority party in the legislature. At the end of the elections the Independents won ten seats, a net loss of three seats.\n\n==Hawaiian League==\n\nIn January 1887 the Committee of Thirteen formed a [[secret society]] called the Hawaiian League.

Using this knowledge, he interacts with the kid or kids ordering the packages until they reach a problem, during which he calls for the assistance of one or more of the Super Wings. The additional help would assist in solving the problem before they leave with Jett.\n\nThe format remained relevant in Season 2, though the interaction segments were dropped. Jimbo also no longer works at World Airport in this season, being replaced by his niece Sky while he goes on an around-the-world vacation (though he still makes cameos in the locations Jett makes his deliveries). The assisting format was also altered, as typically more than one Super Wing ends up with Jett at the end of the episode.\n\nSeason 3 brings the interaction segment back to the fold, and sees Jimbo return as a maintenance technician. The rest of the format stays the same as in Season 2, though the assistance method was changed once again. Jett now receives help from a specialized ''team'' of Super Wings, rather than a random selection.\n\nMajor changes came in Season 4, and much of the show now takes place on World Aircraft, a giant plane functioning as a mobile airport (with Jimbo as captain and Sky as communications officer). The kids now actually call the Super Wings to make specialized products (manufactured by Storm, a new character and World Aircraft's chief engineer), which were shipped in metal containers rather than the cardboard boxes of the past seasons. Jett now regularly has a travel buddy for his deliveries, and they are instead given upgrades via a super charge beam instead of receiving help, though other Super Wings show up at random times in some episodes.\n\n== Development ==\n''Super Wings'' Mission Team was announced in September 2013, and had a licensing market debut at that year's [[MIPCOM|MIPJunior]] in [[Cannes]], [[France]].<ref name=\"KSSep13\">{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/09/03/china-korea-and-the-us-team-up-for-super-wings/|title=China, Korea and the US team up for Super Wings|work=kidscreen.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Jett''' ({{Lang-ko|\ud638\uae30}}; {{Lang-zh|\u4e50\u8fea}}; voiced by Luca Padovan (Season 1) and Hudson Loverro (Season 2) in the English version): The main character, a red and white male jet plane.

Using this knowledge, he interacts with the kid or kids ordering the packages until they reach a problem, during which he calls for the assistance of one or more of the Super Wings. The additional help would assist in solving the problem before they leave with Jett.\n\nThe format remained relevant in Season 2, though the interaction segments were dropped. Jimbo also no longer works at World Airport in this season, being replaced by his niece Sky while he goes on an around-the-world vacation (though he still makes cameos in the locations Jett makes his deliveries). The assisting format was also altered, as typically more than one Super Wing ends up with Jett at the end of the episode.\n\nSeason 3 brings the interaction segment back to the fold, and sees Jimbo return as a maintenance technician. The rest of the format stays the same as in Season 2, though the assistance method was changed once again. Jett now receives help from a specialized ''team'' of Super Wings, rather than a random selection.\n\nMajor changes came in Season 4, and much of the show now takes place on World Aircraft, a giant plane functioning as a mobile airport (with Jimbo as captain and Sky as communications officer). The kids now actually call the Super Wings to make specialized products (manufactured by Storm, a new character and World Aircraft's chief engineer), which were shipped in metal containers rather than the cardboard boxes of the past seasons. Jett now regularly has a travel buddy for his deliveries, and they are instead given upgrades via a super charge beam instead of receiving help, though other Super Wings show up at random times in some episodes.\n\n== Development ==\n''Super Wings'' Mission Team was announced in September 2013, and had a licensing market debut at that year's [[MIPCOM|MIPJunior]] in [[Cannes]], [[France]].<ref name=\"KSSep13\">{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2013/09/03/china-korea-and-the-us-team-up-for-super-wings/|title=China, Korea and the US team up for Super Wings|work=kidscreen.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Jett''' ({{Lang-ko|\ud638\uae30}}; {{Lang-zh|\u4e50\u8fea}}; voiced by Luca Padovan (Season 1) and Hudson Loverro (Season 2) in the English version): The main character, a red and white male jet plane.

Offspring of the males with the trait don't inherit the trait. Offspring of the females with the trait always inherit the trait (independently from their own gender).]]\n[[Nuclear DNA]] has two copies per cell (except for sperm and egg cells), one copy being inherited from the father and the other from the mother. Mitochondrial DNA, however, is inherited from the mother only (with [[Paternal_mtDNA_transmission|some exceptions]]) and each mitochondrial [[organelle]] typically contains between 2 and 10 [[mtDNA]] copies. During [[cell division]] the mitochondria segregate randomly between the two new cells. Those mitochondria make more copies, normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell. As mtDNA is copied when mitochondria proliferate, they can accumulate random mutations, a phenomenon called [[heteroplasmy]]. If only a few of the mtDNA copies inherited from the mother are defective, mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria (for more detailed inheritance patterns, see [[human mitochondrial genetics]]). Mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level; this phenomenon is called \"[[threshold expression]]\".\n\nMitochondria possess many of the same DNA repair pathways as nuclei do--but not all of them;<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexeyev M, Shokolenko I, Wilson G, LeDoux S | title = The maintenance of mitochondrial DNA integrity--critical analysis and update | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = a012641 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23637283 | pmc = 3632056 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a012641 }}</ref> therefore, mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial DNA than in nuclear DNA (see [[Mutation rate]]). This means that mitochondrial DNA disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often. Defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial [[DNA replication]] (all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear DNA) may also cause mitochondrial DNA mutations.\n\nMost mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by [[nuclear DNA]].

Mitochondrial DNA, however, is inherited from the mother only (with [[Paternal_mtDNA_transmission|some exceptions]]) and each mitochondrial [[organelle]] typically contains between 2 and 10 [[mtDNA]] copies. During [[cell division]] the mitochondria segregate randomly between the two new cells. Those mitochondria make more copies, normally reaching 500 mitochondria per cell. As mtDNA is copied when mitochondria proliferate, they can accumulate random mutations, a phenomenon called [[heteroplasmy]]. If only a few of the mtDNA copies inherited from the mother are defective, mitochondrial division may cause most of the defective copies to end up in just one of the new mitochondria (for more detailed inheritance patterns, see [[human mitochondrial genetics]]). Mitochondrial disease may become clinically apparent once the number of affected mitochondria reaches a certain level; this phenomenon is called \"[[threshold expression]]\".\n\nMitochondria possess many of the same DNA repair pathways as nuclei do--but not all of them;<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Alexeyev M, Shokolenko I, Wilson G, LeDoux S | title = The maintenance of mitochondrial DNA integrity--critical analysis and update | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = a012641 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23637283 | pmc = 3632056 | doi = 10.1101/cshperspect.a012641 }}</ref> therefore, mutations occur more frequently in mitochondrial DNA than in nuclear DNA (see [[Mutation rate]]). This means that mitochondrial DNA disorders may occur spontaneously and relatively often. Defects in enzymes that control mitochondrial [[DNA replication]] (all of which are encoded for by genes in the nuclear DNA) may also cause mitochondrial DNA mutations.\n\nMost mitochondrial function and biogenesis is controlled by [[nuclear DNA]]. Human mitochondrial DNA encodes 13 proteins of the [[respiratory chain]], while most of the estimated 1,500 proteins and components targeted to mitochondria are nuclear-encoded.

Philadelphia Section (1976). ''History of civil engineering and construction in the Delaware Valley''</ref> The story how it all started, has been told:\n\n:\"... Their ad in American Machinist drew one response \u2014 from the owner of a firm In New York who said he was curious to see a \"Modernizing Engineer\" and wanted the young men to \"drop in sometime\". Day and Dodge did drop in and the next morning they added their first client to their list of assets.In the early 1900's time studies, efficiency experts and program planning were virtually unknown. Management and administration had not kept up with dramatic engineering developments. Dodge and Day introduced a new concept which they called Betterment Reports \u2014 assessment and evaluation studies to help industries' management become more efficient, aggressive and progressive...\"<ref name=\"ASCE 1976\"/><ref>Harold L. Yoh (1981, 11)</ref>\n\nOne of the first notable [[engineering]] accomplishments of the [[Day & Zimmermann]] company was the design of the construction of the Gatun Lock System, one of the [[Panama Canal locks]] in 1907. The [[Panama Canal locks#construction|construction of the Gatun Lock]] began with the first concrete laid at Gatun, on August 24, 1909, by the Philadelphia-based company Day, Dodge & Zimmermann.\n\n[[File:Gatun Locks, Panama Canal LCCN2007664073.tif|thumb|800px|center|Gatun Locks under construction, circa 1913]]\n\nIn these early days the company did some graphic design as well. It was contacted by the Hershey chocolate company to produce the foil wrapper for [[Hershey's Kisses]].\n\n=== \"The Machine Shop Problem,\" 1903 ===\nIn the 1903 paper entitled \"The Machine Shop Problem\" in the ''Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers'', Day presented a method for the analysis and organization design of machine shops based on the Taylor System. The first subject of discussion was the subdivision of the departments of a machine shop. For this matter a general subdivision and a further subdivision can be made. The following topics of discussion were the means of attaining economical production in the machine shop, the Question of Power Application with Courses to fulfill the conditions, and the advantages derived from the use of individual motors on machine tools.\nThe last topic was the graphical distribution of costs, showing cost value of operations.<ref name=\"CD 1903\">Charles Day (1903)</ref>\n\n=== Routing diagram ===\nThe 1909 article in the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'' entitled ''The routing diagram as a basis for laying out industrial plants'' proposed a new type of graphic illustration of the material flow through industrial plants, named the [[routing diagram]]. The first presentation itself had the following intention:\n\n:\"The primary purpose of this article is to call attention to the advantages that can be derived from the use of the graphical routing diagram as a basis for the planning of industrial plants. This diagram, as its name implies, indicates the paths or routes followed by the materials of manufacture when passing from their crude to their finished state, and in its final development it absolutely defines the plant in all particulars of layout.\"<ref name= \"D1909 809\">Day (1909, 809)</ref>\n\nThe graphic method presented consisted of two types of routing diagram, a ''perspective routing diagram'' and a ''detail routing diagram,'' combined with an exterior view. The article itself gives as an example the design of a gasoline automobile factory. The given graphics deliver complementary views with: \n* Perspective routing diagram, in outline, showing paths followed during manufacture of principal units entering into gasoline automobiles\n* Exterior view of automobile plant to which the routing diagram relates\n* Detail Routing Diagram, Machine-tool equipment and paths or parts in a wagon- and carriage-axle plant\nThese views were illustrated with the following three images:\n\n{{Gallery\n|title= Set of routing diagrams by Charles Day, 1909\n|width=300 | height=300 | lines=3\n|align=center\n|File:Perspective routing diagram, in outline, showing paths followed during manufacture of principal units entering into gasoline automobiles, 1911.jpg\n |alt1=Perspective routing diagram, in outline\n  |Perspective routing diagram, in outline\n|File:Exterior view of automobile plant to which the routing diagram relates, 1911.jpg\n |alt2=Exterior view of automobile plant\n   |Exterior view of automobile plant\n|File:Detail Routing Diagram, Machine-tool equipment and paths or parts in a wagon- and carriage-axle plant, 1911.jpg\n |alt3=Detail Routing Diagram\n  |Detail Routing Diagram\n}}\n\nDespite this clear presentation, neither Charles Day nor anybody else is generally credited for making a seminal contribution to the routing diagram or route diagram. For example, in one of the first seminal works in the field, the 1923 book ''Industrial Management'' by [[Richard H. Lansburgh]], there is a separate chapter \"Factory Building and Plant Lay out.\" This chapter discussed the matter with the similar three types of views, and some more, without any reference to the work of Charles Day. Instead of ''perspective routing diagram'', Lansburgh speaks of ''vertical layout'', and the ''detail routing diagram'' is named a ''[[flow chart]].''<ref>[[Lansburgh, Richard Hines]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.166246 Industrial Management].'' John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 1923; 2nd rev. ed, 1928; 3rd ed. with William R. Spriegel, 1940. pp. 135-146</ref>\n\nWith the articles of Wrege (1978), Wrege (1999) and others, there is a re-evaluation of these contributions. For example, the ''AA Files'' (2005, p.&nbsp;50) summarized that:\n\n::... this new route diagram was introduced by efficiency engineer Charles Day (1879-1931) in 1911 as the basis for the layout and design of industrial plants. Assuming that interior function should entirely determine a factory's layout. Day claimed that after the [[flow diagram]] was complete the building 'merely needed to be drawn around it'. This diagrammatic method assured that 'the imagination will not be drawn upon because the assumptions are based on absolute facts and not theory' - a positivist, objective stance that came to dominate ideas about flow diagrams.<ref name=\"AA 2005\"/>\n\nDay was not the first to introduce the concept of routing diagrams. For example, [[James Bray Griffith]] in his 1905 book ''Systematizing'' already contained a section on \"[[James Bray Griffith#Charting factory layout and routing|Charting factory layout and routing]]\" which contained two simplified routing diagrams for handling lumber, that he called ''arrangements.''<ref>[[Griffith, James Bray]] (ed.). ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435019309541;view=2up;seq=82 Systematizing].'' International Accountants' Society, inc. Detroit; The Book Keeper Press, 1905. p. 72</ref> Another contemporary, [[Oscar E. Perrigo]], published on the design of machine shops in his ''Modern machine shop'' (1906), looking at machine shop lay out and arrangements of machinery.<ref>[[Oscar E. Perrigo]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/modernmachinesh00perrgoog Modern machine shop: construction, equipment and management]'' New York, The N.W. Henley publishing company, 1906.</ref> In contrast to this work, Day did take this design problem to a next level by putting the dynamic interaction first.\n\n=== Management of Navy yards ===\nIn 1911 Charles Day worked together with [[Henry Gantt]] and [[Harrington Emerson]] to study the management of Navy yards, which didn't work out right. Wren (2009) summarized that \"their efforts went for naught when, following the Interstate Commerce Commission hearings in late 1911, the Secretary of the Navy announced that he would never allow scientific management to be applied in the nation\u2019s shipyards.\"<ref name=\"WB 2009\">[[Daniel A. Wren]] & [[Arthur G. Bedeian]], ''The evolution of management thought,'' 1972; 6th edition (2009). p. 162</ref>\n\nThe breakthrough happened in the same period, as Wren (2009) further explained:\n:\"Just prior to the war, Gantt had also served as a consultant to General [[William Crozier (artillerist)|William Crozier]], head of the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. Crozier, impressed by Gantt\u2019s graphic displays, developed a series of progress and performance charts to aid in managing army arsenals. When Gantt gave up his consulting work to aid in the war effort, he puzzled over how to track the huge amount of defense work being performed at so many different sites. Scheduling was especially crucial, and the information necessary to plan and coordinate private contractors\u2019 efforts with those of government agencies was lacking. Gantt spent three months trying to solve this puzzle before realizing that ''We have all been wrong in scheduling on a basis of quantities; the essential element in the situation is time, and this should be the basis in laying out any program.''...\"<ref name=\"WB 2009\"/>\nThe developments set in motion in those days did pave the way to the realization of [[Gantt chart]]s.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Early charts of information flow ===\nIn June 1903 Charles Day had presented a paper entitled ''The Machine Shop Problem'' as described above, in which he proposed a number of charts to be used in management. This paper was first presented at the Saratoga meeting of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME). Day, by then still a junior ASME member, had presented his paper to an audience with among others Frederick Winslow Taylor, [[Henry Gantt]] and [[John Calder (engineer)|John Calder]] commenting on his ideas. It was John Calder (1903) who commented:\n\n:\"Referring to Mr. Day's graphical method of illustrating certain routine in respect to manufacturing in the shop, I will say I think that is one of the most useful methods which a manager can have before him. It can be carried out in many different ways, so that not only the manager can from time to time refresh his memory as to the duties of the men by graphically illustrating to them, but he can also have the reference there before his eyes in the event of new men coming in, and by means of that graphic representation, can show them how to pick up their work much more quickly and put it through. It also enables one to pick out bad methods and prevent work retrograding. I would say, in conclusion, that the method Mr. Day has brought forward can be used generally, broadly, and also in detail, with great success. I hand in samples of charts which I have drawn up and use daily in the practical work of production...\"<ref>ASME,  ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015023119541;view=1up;seq=1354ASME Transactions],'' Vol. 24, 1903, p. 1320.</ref>\n\nFor management historian [[Charles D. Wrege]] the work by Day and Calder were some of the earliest presenting charts of information flow. Wrege et al. (1999) summarized:\n\n:\"... Charles Day and [[John Calder (engineer)|John Calder]] revealed a series of charts designed to outline information flow and to demonstrate the advantage of network analysis of alternative methods of modernizing factories...\"<ref name=\"CDW 1999\">[[Wrege, Charles D.]], Regina A. Greenwood, and Sakae Hata. \"What we do not know about management history: Some categories of research and methods to uncover management history mysteries.\" Journal of Management History 5.7 (1999): 414-424.</ref>\n\nThere is no question one of the charts presented by Day is a network; charts that outline information flows were only presented by Calder. Day presented two [[organizational chart]]s, and four more or less [[classification chart]]s or [[concept map]]s. Furthermore, Wrege et al. (1999) mentioned how the story continued:\n\n:\"... Day\u2019s Company, Dodge and Day (later [[Day and Zimmerman]]), utilized his network charts, ''betterment reports'' and early form of ''[[decision tree]]s'' until his death in 1933, building a consulting company worth millions. After Day\u2019s death, Day and Zimmerman reportedly sold Day\u2019s original charts to the Lockheed Company...\"<ref name=\"CDW 1999\"/>\n\nFor Wrege this was an example of \"What we do not know about management history,\" because \"their eventual fate and how they became incorporated into management information systems literature is still a mystery....\"<ref name=\"CDW 1999\"/>\n\n=== Personal remembrance ===\nIn a 1931 appreciation the ''Electrical World T & D'' had the following summary of his reputation and accomplishments:\n\n:\"Mr. Day was especially known as a specialist in public utility management and operation, although he first established a national reputation as an economist and exponent of manufacturing efficiency in industrial plants. After many years of successful work in the manufacturing field he extended his interest to the public utility field, and it was not long before his contacts became far reaching, embracing both the technical and the financial phases of the business.\"<ref name=\"EW 1931\"/>\n\nOn a more personal level H. Birchard Taylor (1952) in the first Charles Day lecture remembered:\n:\"If you were to ask me to name Charles Day's personal attributes, I would reply: utter integrity; kindness; inexhaustible energy; and a rare gift of inspiring his associates with enthusiasm towards a constructive objective. His was true leadership...\"<ref>H. Birchard Taylor. \"Charles Day (1879-1931) Symbol of American Industrial Genius.\" in: ''Journal of the Franklin Institute,'' Vol. 254, p. 20</ref> \nTaylor further expressed Day's experience in [[scientific management]] since the early 1900s, and particularly his dealings with the Navy during World War I.  \nIn remembrance of his name, the Newcomen Society in North America has held an annual Charles Day lecture for decades.\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* Charles Day.

The given graphics deliver complementary views with: \n* Perspective routing diagram, in outline, showing paths followed during manufacture of principal units entering into gasoline automobiles\n* Exterior view of automobile plant to which the routing diagram relates\n* Detail Routing Diagram, Machine-tool equipment and paths or parts in a wagon- and carriage-axle plant\nThese views were illustrated with the following three images:\n\n{{Gallery\n|title= Set of routing diagrams by Charles Day, 1909\n|width=300 | height=300 | lines=3\n|align=center\n|File:Perspective routing diagram, in outline, showing paths followed during manufacture of principal units entering into gasoline automobiles, 1911.jpg\n |alt1=Perspective routing diagram, in outline\n  |Perspective routing diagram, in outline\n|File:Exterior view of automobile plant to which the routing diagram relates, 1911.jpg\n |alt2=Exterior view of automobile plant\n   |Exterior view of automobile plant\n|File:Detail Routing Diagram, Machine-tool equipment and paths or parts in a wagon- and carriage-axle plant, 1911.jpg\n |alt3=Detail Routing Diagram\n  |Detail Routing Diagram\n}}\n\nDespite this clear presentation, neither Charles Day nor anybody else is generally credited for making a seminal contribution to the routing diagram or route diagram. For example, in one of the first seminal works in the field, the 1923 book ''Industrial Management'' by [[Richard H. Lansburgh]], there is a separate chapter \"Factory Building and Plant Lay out.\" This chapter discussed the matter with the similar three types of views, and some more, without any reference to the work of Charles Day. Instead of ''perspective routing diagram'', Lansburgh speaks of ''vertical layout'', and the ''detail routing diagram'' is named a ''[[flow chart]].''<ref>[[Lansburgh, Richard Hines]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.166246 Industrial Management].'' John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 1923; 2nd rev. ed, 1928; 3rd ed. with William R. Spriegel, 1940. pp. 135-146</ref>\n\nWith the articles of Wrege (1978), Wrege (1999) and others, there is a re-evaluation of these contributions. For example, the ''AA Files'' (2005, p.&nbsp;50) summarized that:\n\n::... this new route diagram was introduced by efficiency engineer Charles Day (1879-1931) in 1911 as the basis for the layout and design of industrial plants. Assuming that interior function should entirely determine a factory's layout. Day claimed that after the [[flow diagram]] was complete the building 'merely needed to be drawn around it'. This diagrammatic method assured that 'the imagination will not be drawn upon because the assumptions are based on absolute facts and not theory' - a positivist, objective stance that came to dominate ideas about flow diagrams.<ref name=\"AA 2005\"/>\n\nDay was not the first to introduce the concept of routing diagrams. For example, [[James Bray Griffith]] in his 1905 book ''Systematizing'' already contained a section on \"[[James Bray Griffith#Charting factory layout and routing|Charting factory layout and routing]]\" which contained two simplified routing diagrams for handling lumber, that he called ''arrangements.''<ref>[[Griffith, James Bray]] (ed.). ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435019309541;view=2up;seq=82 Systematizing].'' International Accountants' Society, inc. Detroit; The Book Keeper Press, 1905. p. 72</ref> Another contemporary, [[Oscar E. Perrigo]], published on the design of machine shops in his ''Modern machine shop'' (1906), looking at machine shop lay out and arrangements of machinery.<ref>[[Oscar E. Perrigo]]. ''[https://archive.org/details/modernmachinesh00perrgoog Modern machine shop: construction, equipment and management]'' New York, The N.W. Henley publishing company, 1906.</ref> In contrast to this work, Day did take this design problem to a next level by putting the dynamic interaction first.\n\n=== Management of Navy yards ===\nIn 1911 Charles Day worked together with [[Henry Gantt]] and [[Harrington Emerson]] to study the management of Navy yards, which didn't work out right. Wren (2009) summarized that \"their efforts went for naught when, following the Interstate Commerce Commission hearings in late 1911, the Secretary of the Navy announced that he would never allow scientific management to be applied in the nation\u2019s shipyards.\"<ref name=\"WB 2009\">[[Daniel A. Wren]] & [[Arthur G. Bedeian]], ''The evolution of management thought,'' 1972; 6th edition (2009). p. 162</ref>\n\nThe breakthrough happened in the same period, as Wren (2009) further explained:\n:\"Just prior to the war, Gantt had also served as a consultant to General [[William Crozier (artillerist)|William Crozier]], head of the U.S. Army Ordnance Department. Crozier, impressed by Gantt\u2019s graphic displays, developed a series of progress and performance charts to aid in managing army arsenals. When Gantt gave up his consulting work to aid in the war effort, he puzzled over how to track the huge amount of defense work being performed at so many different sites. Scheduling was especially crucial, and the information necessary to plan and coordinate private contractors\u2019 efforts with those of government agencies was lacking. Gantt spent three months trying to solve this puzzle before realizing that ''We have all been wrong in scheduling on a basis of quantities; the essential element in the situation is time, and this should be the basis in laying out any program.''...\"<ref name=\"WB 2009\"/>\nThe developments set in motion in those days did pave the way to the realization of [[Gantt chart]]s.\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Early charts of information flow ===\nIn June 1903 Charles Day had presented a paper entitled ''The Machine Shop Problem'' as described above, in which he proposed a number of charts to be used in management. This paper was first presented at the Saratoga meeting of the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME). Day, by then still a junior ASME member, had presented his paper to an audience with among others [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]], [[Henry Gantt]] and [[John Calder (engineer)|John Calder]] commenting on his ideas. It was John Calder (1903) who commented:\n\n:\"Referring to Mr. Day's graphical method of illustrating certain routine in respect to manufacturing in the shop, I will say I think that is one of the most useful methods which a manager can have before him. It can be carried out in many different ways, so that not only the manager can from time to time refresh his memory as to the duties of the men by graphically illustrating to them, but he can also have the reference there before his eyes in the event of new men coming in, and by means of that graphic representation, can show them how to pick up their work much more quickly and put it through. It also enables one to pick out bad methods and prevent work retrograding. I would say, in conclusion, that the method Mr. Day has brought forward can be used generally, broadly, and also in detail, with great success. I hand in samples of charts which I have drawn up and use daily in the practical work of production...\"<ref>ASME,  ''[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015023119541;view=1up;seq=1354ASME Transactions],'' Vol. 24, 1903, p. 1320.</ref>\n\nFor management historian [[Charles D. Wrege]] the work by Day and Calder were some of the earliest presenting charts of information flow. Wrege et al. (1999) summarized:\n\n:\"... Charles Day and [[John Calder (engineer)|John Calder]] revealed a series of charts designed to outline information flow and to demonstrate the advantage of network analysis of alternative methods of modernizing factories...\"<ref name=\"CDW 1999\">[[Wrege, Charles D.]], Regina A. Greenwood, and Sakae Hata. \"What we do not know about management history: Some categories of research and methods to uncover management history mysteries.\" Journal of Management History 5.7 (1999): 414-424.</ref>\n\nThere is no question one of the charts presented by Day is a network; charts that outline information flows were only presented by Calder. Day presented two [[organizational chart]]s, and four more or less [[classification chart]]s or [[concept map]]s. Furthermore Wrege et al. (1999) mentioned how the story continued:\n\n:\"... Day\u2019s Company, Dodge and Day (later [[Day and Zimmerman]]), utilized his network charts, ''betterment reports'' and early form of ''[[decision tree]]s'' until his death in 1933, building a consulting company worth millions. After Day\u2019s death, Day and Zimmerman reportedly sold Day\u2019s original charts to the Lockheed Company...\"<ref name=\"CDW 1999\"/>\n\nFor Wrege this was an example of \"What we do not know about management history,\" because \"their eventual fate and how they became incorporated into management information systems literature is still a mystery....\"<ref name=\"CDW 1999\"/>\n\n=== Personal remembrance ===\nIn a 1931 appreciation the ''Electrical World T & D'' had the following summary of his reputation and accomplishments:\n\n:\"Mr. Day was especially known as a specialist in public utility management and operation, although he first established a national reputation as an economist and exponent of manufacturing efficiency in industrial plants. After many years of successful work in the manufacturing field he extended his interest to the public utility field, and it was not long before his contacts became far reaching, embracing both the technical and the financial phases of the business.\"<ref name=\"EW 1931\"/>\n\nOn a more personal level H. Birchard Taylor (1952) in the first Charles Day lecture remembered:\n:\"If you were to ask me to name Charles Day's personal attributes, I would reply: utter integrity; kindness; inexhaustible energy; and a rare gift of inspiring his associates with enthusiasm towards a constructive objective. His was true leadership...\"<ref>H. Birchard Taylor. \"Charles Day (1879-1931) Symbol of American Industrial Genius.\" in: ''Journal of the Franklin Institute,'' Vol. 254, p. 20</ref> \nTaylor further expressed Day's experience in [[scientific management]] since the early 1900s, and particularly his dealings with the Navy during World War I.  \nIn remembrance of his name, the Newcomen Society in North America has held an annual Charles Day lecture for decades.\n\n== Selected publications ==\n* Charles Day.

In his second year at university, he decided to become a singer in Korea after meeting with a Korean pop music composer who persuaded him to do so.<ref name=\"koreatimes\" />\n\n==Career==\nYang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=koreatimes /><ref name=koreajoongangdaily /><ref name=yonhap />\n\nHe was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S.\n\nActive in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years. In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\".

In his second year at university, he decided to become a singer in Korea after meeting with a Korean pop music composer who persuaded him to do so.<ref name=\"koreatimes\" />\n\n==Career==\nYang debuted in 1991 at the age of 22 with a song titled \"Rebecca\". He released other hit songs like \"Dance with Me Miss\" (1992) and \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\" (1992).<ref name=koreatimes /><ref name=koreajoongangdaily /><ref name=yonhap />\n\nHe was credited as the first pop musician to introduce Korean audiences to the [[new jack swing]] genre, which was popular in the mid-1980s and early 1990s in the U.S.\n\nActive in South Korea from 1991 to 1993, he suddenly disappeared from the public scene and returned to the U.S. In a 2019 interview with the [[The Korea Times]], he revealed that \"he was hated by many for his unusual looks and songs.\" Some also threw rocks during his performance at an open-air stage. While a 10-year visa he held in Korea as a U.S. national had to be recertified every six months, he was denied an extension to his visa for no reason by an official at the Immigration Office. His nationality as an American also made it hard for him to gain acceptance in South Korea.\n\nIn 2001, he made another debut as JIY, a member of a music band V2, with a third album \"Fantasy\". He hid his true identity as music producers told him he would not make it again due to his previous controversial image in Korea. His new song \"Fantasy\", composed by Valery Gaina of [[Cruise (band)|Cruise]], enjoyed a brief popularity before he finally put an end to his music career. Due to the agency's circumstances, it became impossible to work as a musician and after that he worked as an English teacher for 14 years. In 2015, he returned to the United States. Because of his age, he had a hard time finding work. He worked as a warehouse worker, office cleaner, and restaurant server.    \n\nIn 2019, he gained attention through [[JTBC]]'s ''[[Two Yoo Project Sugar Man]]'', a program dedicated to finding and rediscovering old singers from the past. He sang \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGIndlf_xU4&t=64s Rebecca]\", [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU462sGMclc \"GaNaDaRaMaBaSa\", \"Dance With Me Miss\"], and \"Fantasy\".

It is unclear how this might lead to FSGS, though it has been proposed that it may result in alteration of podocyte dynamics or podocytopenia.<ref name=\"Mukerji_2007\" />\n|-\n| FSGS3: [[CD2AP]]\n| {{OMIM2|607832}}\n| Another gene that may be involved in hereditary forms of FSGS is the gene known as [[CD2AP]] (CD2 associated protein) or CMS (Cas binding protein with multiple SH3 domains). The protein expressed by this gene is expressed in podocytes where it interacts with [[FYN|fyn]] and [[synaptopodin]]. There is a report that a splicing mutation in this gene was found in two patients with HIV associated FSGS and this led to altered protein translation. This has been theorized to result in altered actin binding and, thus, alteration of the cytoskeletal podocyte architecture.<ref name=\"Mukerji_2007\" />\n|-\n| FSGS4: [[APOL1]]\n| {{OMIM2|612551}}\n| In people of African descent, two common variants in [[APOL1]] have been associated with FSGS.

In the story, Juan Cortilla, a Mexican bandit played by [[Joe De Santis]], is stormed from jail. Chamberlain, as United States Army Lieutenant Winslow, asks Grey Holden (lead series character played by [[Darren McGavin]]) to transport Cortilla and his men to a military garrison. Instead, Cortilla takes over Holden's vessel and its gunpowder. [[Connie Hines]] appears with Chamberlain as Lucy Bridges, and [[Ted de Corsia]] is cast as another bandit.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0687083/| title=\"Chicota Landing\", ''Riverboat'', December 5, 1960| website=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=February 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nLess than a year later, in 1961, Chamberlain gained widespread fame as the young intern, Dr. Kildare, in the [[Dr. Kildare (TV series)|NBC/MGM television series of the same name]], co-starring with [[Raymond Massey]].
