In its early years it was one of the largest and most prosperous of the Dartmoor tin mines, along with [[Whiteworks]] and the [[Birch Tor and Vitifer mine]]s.<ref>Newman 1999, p.105</ref> Its name has several variant spellings, such as Eylesburrow, Ailsborough, Ellisborough, Hillsborough etc.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.163</ref> It was also known as Wheal Ruth for a short period around 1850.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, pp.173\u2013174</ref> The extensive remains lie to the north of the [[River Plym]], less than {{convert|1|mi}} north-east of [[Drizzlecombe]], on the southern shoulder of the hill called Eylesbarrow on top of which are two prominent [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|barrow]]s.\n\n==Geology==\nThe [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]] of the mine is [[granite]]. The large [[mining sett]] (about {{convert|3|by|2|mi}}) is crossed by many tin-bearing [[lode]]s which are substantially vertical and trend east-north-east. Most of the mine's excavations were made into just three of these lodes and were relatively shallow.<ref name=C200>Cook et al. 1974, Appendix A, pp.200-201</ref> The formation of the lodes was accompanied by extensive [[metasomatism]] which converted much of the [[plagioclase feldspar]] in the surrounding granite into the soft mineral [[kaolinite]],<ref>Edmonds et al. 1985, p.49</ref> and made excavation easier than it would have been in unaltered rock.\n\nThe lodes varied in width up to a maximum of around 2.4&nbsp;ft (0.73&nbsp;m) and were, at least in the early years of the mine's operation, sometimes of very high quality ore,{{#tag:ref|The best tin ore was called \"grain\" or \"grained\" tin, which meant that distinct crystals of [[cassiterite]] were visible. Its purity commanded a premium price.<ref name=C200/>|group=notes}} uncontaminated with other unwanted [[wikt:metalliferous|metalliferous]] ores.<ref name=C200/> The existence of these high quality ores near the surface led the miners to believe that even better ore existed deeper down, but the history of the mine suggests that this is not the case and the mineralisation becomes patchy at depth.<ref name=C200/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Open tinners workings Fox tor 2.jpg|thumb|left|Typical signs of tin-streaming on Dartmoor|alt=Regularly spaced low piles of stones in a shallow channel]]\n[[Dartmoor tin-mining#Mining methods|Streaming and open-cast mining]] for tin have taken place in this part of Dartmoor for many centuries. It is believed that the industry on the moor was at its peak as early as the 12th century.<ref>Newman 1999, p.110 (citing Worth 1953)</ref> For instance, in 1168, men from the nearby village of [[Sheepstor]] are known to have been \"tinners\".<ref name=C164/> Around 550 years later a document of 1715 stated of Sheepstor Parish that \"all the parishioners are tinners\",<ref name=C164>Cook et al. 1974, p.164</ref> but by this time working for tin on the moor was already in decline, probably because of the exhaustion of the easily accessible deposits.<ref name=N55>Newman 1998, p.55</ref>\n\nRevival came in the late 1780s, fired by the needs and innovations of the industrial revolution.<ref name=C164/><ref name=N55/> It is possible that some underground working took place on the site of the mine as early as 1790,<ref name=N110>Newman 1999, p.110</ref> but the first documentary evidence is an offer for sale of shares in a mine called \"Ailsborough\" in 1804, and records of tin dues paid from 1806 to 1810.<ref>Newman 1999, p.109</ref>\n\nBy 1814 demand had caused the price of tin to rise to about \u00a3150 per ton and in that year a [[mining sett]] called \"Ellisborough Tin Set\" was granted.<ref name=C164/> Extraction started at the mine in February 1815 and by 1820, despite several business difficulties, it was sending quantities of [[black tin]] to Cornwall for smelting.<ref name=C165>Cook et al. 1974, p.165</ref> In 1822 the mine opened its own [[smelting]] house on the site\u2014the only one in operation on the moor. There is evidence that black tin was bought from nearby mines for smelting here.<ref name=C166/>\n\nThe next ten years or so were the mine's most productive period, despite there being a fall in the price of tin from 1826.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, Appendix C, pp.212-213</ref> In addition to tin, some \"Forest Clay\" ([[kaolin]]){{#tag:ref|Kaolin is formed from the alteration of granite\u2014the large china clay workings at [[Lee Moor]] are around three miles to the south.|group=notes}} was sold.<ref name=C166/> In 1831 the mine employed over sixty men, but at the end of that year the smelter ceased operation<ref name=C166/> and there is then a four-year gap in the records.\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Eylesbarrow mine plan01.gif|thumb|A plan of the mine, see text for details|alt=map]]\nIn June 1836, when the price of tin was again at a high, a prospectus for \"Dartmoor Consolidated Tin Mines\" was published in the recently founded trade magazine [[The Mining Journal (trade magazine)|''The Mining Journal'']], offering 7,500 shares at \u00a35 each.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.167</ref> The mine apparently operated unsuccessfully on a small scale for the next few years while the price of tin fell again. In August 1838 the shares on which \u00a33.&nbsp;10s had been paid were worth only \u00a32. By early 1840 the shares, by then fully paid-up were worth just \u00a31.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, pp.169\u2013170</ref> By 1841 only three or four men were employed and in 1844, with the price of tin at an all-time low of just over \u00a360 per ton, the mine closed.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.170</ref>\n\nIn early 1847, with tin back up to around \u00a390 per ton, the mine was again advertised (this time as \"Dartmoor Consols Tin Mining Company\"), offering 2,048 shares at \u00a32 each. This resurgence of activity was bolstered with glowing reports on the quality of its ore and the previous high returns that had been made despite the shafts being of no great depth. It was also said that the smelting house \"can be made fit for use at a very trifling cost\" which will make it \"a source of great profit\".<ref name=C171>Cook et al. 1974, p.171</ref>\n\nIn June 1847 the mine captain, John Spargo, proposed a number of improvements, including the installation of a 50&nbsp;ft (15&nbsp;m) waterwheel and new stamps, and the sinking of new shafts, the whole costing a total of nearly \u00a31,000.<ref name=C171/> Much of this work was undertaken, but by October the same year, the first signs that all was not well appeared in ''The Mining Journal''. The shares had not been well taken up{{#tag:ref|In fact it was reported in April 1847 that only 636 of the 2,048 shares offered had been bought and there were outstanding debts of about \u00a3650.<ref name=C173>Cook et al. 1974, p.173</ref>|group=notes}} and the lack of money was causing problems. By the following March it was reported that the mine could not continue in operation and a final call of \u00a31 per share was being made to clear the debts of the company. It was clear that no tin had been sold.<ref name=C172>Cook et al. 1974, p.172</ref>\n{{Rquote|left|Valuable Mining Materials for Sale\u2014Ailesborough Mine \u2026<br/>An excellent water-wheel (built in 1848, and now in very good condition) 50&nbsp;feet in diameter, 3&nbsp;ft breast, with cranks, sadles, brasses, &c., complete, three balance bobs, with arch heads and pin chain complete \u2026|Extract from an advertisement in ''The Mining Journal'', 25&nbsp;September&nbsp;1852<ref name=C214>Cook et al. 1974, Appendix D, pp.213\u2013214</ref>}}\nYet another company, calling itself \"Aylesborough\", was formed during 1848, and sold over \u00a350 worth of black tin. In 1849 Captain Spargo reported that the stamps were working well and a shaft had been deepened to 20 fathoms below adit.<ref name=C173/> But problems reappeared and in 1851 it was advertised\u2014for the last time\u2014as \"Wheal Ruth\" with 2,700 shares offered at \u00a32 each.<ref name=C174>Cook et al. 1974, p.174</ref> This new concern employed only a few men, but operated successfully for a time, selling 1&nbsp;ton 4&nbsp;cwt 11&nbsp;lb of ore for \u00a361.&nbsp;9s in September 1851 and over two tons for more than \u00a3107 in the last quarter of the year.<ref name=C174/> However, on 25 September 1852 ''The Mining Journal'' ran an advert for the sale of all the mine's equipment by [[public auction]]. Since the price of tin was rising again at this time, it is most likely that the mine had become exhausted of tin that was recoverable economically.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.175</ref>\n\n==Documentation==\nAlthough it was once a large and important mine, there are no known plans of its extensive underground workings,<ref>Hamilton Jenkin 1974, p.87</ref> and there are few extant records of its output of tin ore. What is known, however, is that a total of about 276&nbsp;tons of [[white tin]] was \"[[tin coinage|coined]]\" (i.e. recorded and taxed) at [[Tavistock, Devon|Tavistock]], the nearest [[stannary town]], between the years 1822 and 1831, and this may have been worth almost \u00a330,000.<ref name=C166>Cook et al. 1974, p.166</ref> The mine's most productive year was 1825, when 403 blocks of tin weighing over 1,220&nbsp;cwt in total were coined.<ref name=C166/>\n\n==Field remains==\n{{multiple image\n |align=right\n |direction=vertical\n | width =220\n | footer =\n | image1 = New Engine shaft 1.JPG\n | alt1 = A deep pit surrounded by an unsubstantial-looking wire fence\n | caption1 = New Engine Shaft...\n | image2 = New Engine shaft 3.JPG\n | alt2 = A close-up, showing moss-covered stones lining a curving pit\n | caption2 = ...and its masonry collar\n}}\nThe large site was extensively surveyed{{#tag:ref|Mostly at a scale of 1:2500, but with the important features surveyed at 1:500.<ref name=N106/>|group=notes}} by [[English Heritage]] in 1999, and details are held in the [[English Heritage Archive]].<ref name=N106>Newman 1999, p.106</ref><ref>{{PastScape|mnumber=438809 |mname=EYLESBARROW TIN MINE|accessdate=2009-03-23}}</ref>\n\nIn common with most Dartmoor valleys, the entire valley floor of the upper [[River Plym]] and its tributaries are disturbed by the remains of [[Dartmoor tin-mining#Streaming|streamworks]]. There are also a number of [[Dartmoor tin-mining#Open cast|openworks]] that follow the lodes, and signs of leats and reservoirs and hundreds of [[prospecting pits]]. These all represent the efforts of the \"old men\" who worked the area for tin in the centuries before the mine came into being.<ref name=N110/>\n\n===Shafts and adits===\nThere are 25 [[Shaft mining|shaftheads]] visible at Eylesbarrow, most of which are on a single curved alignment along the line of the main lode, which is roughly followed by part of the main track that runs through the mine. The shaftheads exist as conical pits, the smallest being 9m in diameter and the largest, marking Pryce Deacon's Shaft near the eastern end of the alignment, 16m in diameter. Some of them (for instance New Engine Shaft, shown here) have the original masonry collar still visible. Each pit has a spoil heap nearby, usually in the shape of a crescent on the downhill side of the pit. These heaps vary in size; the largest, at Pryce Deacon's Shaft, is over {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} high and covers about {{convert|665|m2}}.<ref name=N111>Newman 1999, p.111</ref><ref name=NA1>Newman 1999, Appendix 1, pp.144\u2013146</ref> Much interpretative work has taken place to match the visible shafts with the names mentioned in the contemporary documentation, with the result that about half of them can be named and dated with some confidence.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.111\u2013115</ref>\n\n[[File:Two brothers adit entrance.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The entrance to Two Brothers Adit|alt=Looking up a notch cut in a grassy slope leading up to a small dark entrance]]\nFour [[adit]]s are referred to in the mine documents. Shallow Adit and Deep Adit both date from the early phase of working, around 1815. Shallow Adit is blocked, its position marked by a stream issuing from the hillside just to the south of the main track. Deep Adit, however, is still open. Its entrance is lined with sturdy granite slabs and is about {{convert|2.2|m|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|0.9|m|abbr=on}} wide.\n\nTwo Brother's Adit is also still open and discharges an abundant stream of water into the steep-sided gulley that surrounds it. It evidently belongs to the later phase of the mine, being first mentioned in the 1840s. The fourth adit, referred to as Deacon's Adit, is untraceable in the field and may never have passed the planning stage.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.115\u2013117</ref>\n\n===Leats, reservoir and wheelpits===\n[[File:Eylesbarrow wheelpit 1.JPG|thumb|The 1815 wheelpit|alt=A large oblong depression full of stones]]\nDespite the extensive underground workings, no more than one waterwheel was used for pumping water out of the mine. The first waterwheel, whose wheelpit can still be seen just to the north of the main track,<ref>Newman 1999, p.120</ref> was built in 1814\u201315 and was powered by water carried by a [[leat]] that curved around the south side of Higher Hartor Tor drawing water from the upper reaches of the River Plym. In 1818 this leat, known as Engine Leat, was extended over the Plym to also collect water from the Langcombe Brook, a tributary on its south bank. Another leat built in the 1820s attempted to collect water from the hillside to the north.<ref name=N140/> That the water supply was still inadequate at times is shown by the construction, before 1825, of a large linear reservoir on the line of the main leat, the northern end of which is now cut off by the main track which used to pass over it by a bridge. This reservoir was up to {{convert|13|m|abbr=on}} wide and up to {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}} deep and its {{convert|192|m|abbr=on}} long dam was about {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} thick and reinforced with substantial granite blocks on the inner face.<ref name=N140>Newman 1999, p.140</ref> [[William Crossing]] reported that the mine owner, a man named Deacon, used to entertain guests by taking them out on the reservoir in a small boat.<ref>Newman 1999, p.140, quoting Crossing (1905) ''Gems in a Granite Setting'', p.157.</ref>\n\nConstruction of a more powerful waterwheel, the one proposed by Captain Spargo in 1847, was completed by March 1849 at the latest. It replaced the earlier wheel and was sited in the head of the disused Deep Adit Shaft, close to the Two Brothers Adit. This waterwheel had a diameter of 50&nbsp;ft (15&nbsp;m) and 3&nbsp;ft (1&nbsp;m) breast and was almost certainly the largest on the moor at the time.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, pp.180-181</ref>{{#tag:ref|A 60&nbsp;ft (18&nbsp;m) diameter wheel was installed at [[Bagtor mine]] in 1862.<ref>Atkinson et al. 1978, p.12</ref>|group=notes}} Located about {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} lower down the hillside, it took advantage of a richer water supply which included the outfall from the nearby adit, an earlier leat drawing water from the Plym, some further leats to the north that attempted to collect water from the [[surface runoff]] on the hillside, as well as the re-routed Engine Leat.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.121, 123</ref>\n\nTraces of all the above-mentioned features can still be seen in the field.\n\n[[File:Eylesbarrow flat rods 2.JPG|thumb|Some of the pillars for the flatrod system that led from the first waterwheel to Old Engine Shaft|alt=A double line of stones leading into the distance]]\n\n===The flatrod system===\nAs a matter of principle a power source (such as a waterwheel) is installed as close as possible to the equipment that it drives (such as a water pump), to minimise the inevitable loss of power incurred in its transmission. When the distance between source and target is significant an efficient means of transferring the power is necessary, and in the 19th century the best method available was the [[flatrod system]]. This was used at a number of mines and consisted of a series of linked iron or wooden rods connected to a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] on a waterwheel (or steam engine). The crank converted the circular motion of the wheel into an oscillatory back-and-forth motion of the rods which, suitably supported, could be extended for some distance along the ground. A heavy weight, known as the [[balance bob]], pivoted on one or both ends of the run of the rods kept them under tension and allowed the conversion of the horizontal motion to vertical motion down the shaft.<!-- need a diagram to illustrate this -->\n\n{{Rquote|left|\u2026 143 fms. iron rods, 2\u00bc inches wide by 2\u00be inches thick, with joints, pins, &c., complete; 153 fms. iron rods, 1\u00be in. square \u2026 342 fms. of round iron rods, from 1\u00bc in. to 1\u00bd in. \u2026 139 cast iron pullies of 17-inch diameter, nearly new; 40 ditto, of 20-inch diameter \u2026|From the advert for the auction of the mine's equipment.

Consequently, the power from the waterwheel was carried by a flatrod system up the hillside to the shafts. The rods were made of iron and were supported by pulleys with flanged rims that ran on short axles supported by pairs of granite pillars around 0.4&nbsp;m apart. These pillars had distinctive notches cut into their tops to support the axles. Parts of four runs of these paired posts can be seen today. They vary in height from just above ground level to around a metre, and some run through shallow cuttings, representing the varying contour of the ground.<ref name=N121>Newman 1999, p.121</ref>\n\nFrom the wheelpit of the first waterwheel, two series of double pillars head eastwards up the hill, just to the north of the main track. The northern series heads towards Old Engine Shaft, a distance of {{convert|663|m}}. This shaft was in use from 1814 onwards. The southern, less well preserved series, probably led to Pryce Deacon's Shaft, {{convert|777|m}} away, and may have been in use in the 1840s.<ref name=N121/>\n\n[[File:Eylesbarrow wheelpit 2.JPG|thumb|upright|The remains of the wheelpit for the 50&nbsp;ft wheel|alt=A deep notch in the hillside]]\nIn the second, later, wheelpit, pictured here, the wheel itself was on the south side of the pit (on the right in this photograph). The short length of wall on the right is the end wall of the wheelpit. The mechanism operating the flatrod system was on the north side, aligned with the short section of wall visible further away on the left: this probably formed part of the first support for the flatrods, which are believed to have travelled underground until they reached a V-shaped gulley, just visible towards the top of the photograph.<ref name=N111/>\n\nThis flatrods from this wheel led towards Pryce Deacon's Shaft, {{convert|961|m}} away and also to Henry's Engine Shaft, {{convert|854|m}} away.

The chronology of the use of these systems is not certain, though the extension to the northern shaft probably represents the very last phase of underground mining at the site.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.123\u2013124</ref>\n\n===Stamping mills and smelting house===\nThe purpose of a [[Dartmoor tin-mining#Processing|stamping mill]] is to crush the mined ore to a fine sand which is then processed at an adjacent \"dressing floor\" to separate the heavier tin ore from the waste material or \"gangue\", which is dumped. There are remains of six stamping mills at Eylesbarrow mine, an unusually high number, although they were not all in use at the same time. They form a rough line down the hillside into the head of the Drizzlecombe valley and in the literature they are numbered from 1 to 6: No.&nbsp;1 is the highest, located just below the first pumping waterwheel to the north of the main track; No.&nbsp;6 is about {{convert|0.75|km|abbr=on}} distant and some {{convert|35|m|abbr=on}} lower down the slope. The prominent wall with a hole in it just below the main track is the side wall of the wheelpit of stamping mill No.&nbsp;2, the hole marking the location of the axle.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.187</ref>\n\nThe oldest mill is No.&nbsp;4 which was operating in 1804, followed the next year by No.&nbsp;6., a large construction which had its waterwheel in the centre of the floor with machinery on both sides. Both these were powered by the lower of the two leats that took water from the River Plym. The major works undertaken on the mine in 1814 included the construction of three new mills (Nos.&nbsp;1, 2 and 3) and the cutting of the higher (Engine) leat to power them.\n{{multiple image\n |align=left\n |direction=vertical\n | width = 300\n | footer =\n | image1 = Eylesbarrow sm5 view 4.JPG\n | alt1 = A step cut into a grassy slope covered with a scatter of rocks of various sizes\n | caption1 = The remains of the smelting house...\n | image2 = Flue at sm5 1.JPG\n | alt2 = A line of flat stones on the ground covering a shallow channel\n | caption2 = ...and its flue\n}}\nMill No.&nbsp;5, which had the smelter attached, was completed by 1822.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.126\u2013127</ref> The smelting house (shown here as it looks today) had two furnaces.

In its early years it was one of the largest and most prosperous of the Dartmoor tin mines, along with [[Whiteworks]] and the [[Birch Tor and Vitifer mine]]s.<ref>Newman 1999, p.105</ref> Its name has several variant spellings, such as Eylesburrow, Ailsborough, Ellisborough, Hillsborough etc.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.163</ref> It was also known as Wheal Ruth for a short period around 1850.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, pp.173\u2013174</ref> The extensive remains lie to the north of the [[River Plym]], less than {{convert|1|mi}} north-east of [[Drizzlecombe]], on the southern shoulder of the hill called Eylesbarrow on top of which are two prominent [[Bronze Age]] [[Tumulus|barrow]]s.\n\n==Geology==\nThe [[Country rock (geology)|country rock]] of the mine is [[granite]]. The large [[mining sett]] (about {{convert|3|by|2|mi}}) is crossed by many tin-bearing [[lode]]s which are substantially vertical and trend east-north-east. Most of the mine's excavations were made into just three of these lodes and were relatively shallow.<ref name=C200>Cook et al. 1974, Appendix A, pp.200-201</ref> The formation of the lodes was accompanied by extensive [[metasomatism]] which converted much of the [[plagioclase feldspar]] in the surrounding granite into the soft mineral [[kaolinite]],<ref>Edmonds et al. 1985, p.49</ref> and made excavation easier than it would have been in unaltered rock.\n\nThe lodes varied in width up to a maximum of around 2.4&nbsp;ft (0.73&nbsp;m) and were, at least in the early years of the mine's operation, sometimes of very high quality ore,{{#tag:ref|The best tin ore was called \"grain\" or \"grained\" tin, which meant that distinct crystals of [[cassiterite]] were visible. Its purity commanded a premium price.<ref name=C200/>|group=notes}} uncontaminated with other unwanted [[wikt:metalliferous|metalliferous]] ores.<ref name=C200/> The existence of these high quality ores near the surface led the miners to believe that even better ore existed deeper down, but the history of the mine suggests that this is not the case and the mineralisation becomes patchy at depth.<ref name=C200/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Open tinners workings Fox tor 2.jpg|thumb|left|Typical signs of tin-streaming on Dartmoor|alt=Regularly spaced low piles of stones in a shallow channel]]\n[[Dartmoor tin-mining#Mining methods|Streaming and open-cast mining]] for tin have taken place in this part of Dartmoor for many centuries.

There is evidence that black tin was bought from nearby mines for smelting here.<ref name=C166/>\n\nThe next ten years or so were the mine's most productive period, despite there being a fall in the price of tin from 1826.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, Appendix C, pp.212-213</ref> In addition to tin, some \"Forest Clay\" ([[kaolin]]){{#tag:ref|Kaolin is formed from the alteration of granite\u2014the large china clay workings at [[Lee Moor]] are around three miles to the south.|group=notes}} was sold.<ref name=C166/> In 1831 the mine employed over sixty men, but at the end of that year the smelter ceased operation<ref name=C166/> and there is then a four-year gap in the records.\n\n===Decline===\n[[File:Eylesbarrow mine plan01.gif|thumb|A plan of the mine, see text for details|alt=map]]\nIn June 1836, when the price of tin was again at a high, a prospectus for \"Dartmoor Consolidated Tin Mines\" was published in the recently founded trade magazine [[The Mining Journal (trade magazine)|''The Mining Journal'']], offering 7,500 shares at \u00a35 each.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.167</ref> The mine apparently operated unsuccessfully on a small scale for the next few years while the price of tin fell again. In August 1838 the shares on which \u00a33.&nbsp;10s had been paid were worth only \u00a32. By early 1840 the shares, by then fully paid-up were worth just \u00a31.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, pp.169\u2013170</ref> By 1841 only three or four men were employed and in 1844, with the price of tin at an all-time low of just over \u00a360 per ton, the mine closed.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.170</ref>\n\nIn early 1847, with tin back up to around \u00a390 per ton, the mine was again advertised (this time as \"Dartmoor Consols Tin Mining Company\"), offering 2,048 shares at \u00a32 each. This resurgence of activity was bolstered with glowing reports on the quality of its ore and the previous high returns that had been made despite the shafts being of no great depth. It was also said that the smelting house \"can be made fit for use at a very trifling cost\" which will make it \"a source of great profit\".<ref name=C171>Cook et al. 1974, p.171</ref>\n\nIn June 1847 the mine captain, John Spargo, proposed a number of improvements, including the installation of a 50&nbsp;ft (15&nbsp;m) waterwheel and new stamps, and the sinking of new shafts, the whole costing a total of nearly \u00a31,000.<ref name=C171/> Much of this work was undertaken, but by October the same year, the first signs that all was not well appeared in ''The Mining Journal''.

By the following March it was reported that the mine could not continue in operation and a final call of \u00a31 per share was being made to clear the debts of the company.

There are also a number of [[Dartmoor tin-mining#Open cast|openworks]] that follow the lodes, and signs of leats and reservoirs and hundreds of [[prospecting pits]]. These all represent the efforts of the \"old men\" who worked the area for tin in the centuries before the mine came into being.<ref name=N110/>\n\n===Shafts and adits===\nThere are 25 [[Shaft mining|shaftheads]] visible at Eylesbarrow, most of which are on a single curved alignment along the line of the main lode, which is roughly followed by part of the main track that runs through the mine. The shaftheads exist as conical pits, the smallest being 9m in diameter and the largest, marking Pryce Deacon's Shaft near the eastern end of the alignment, 16m in diameter. Some of them (for instance New Engine Shaft, shown here) have the original masonry collar still visible. Each pit has a spoil heap nearby, usually in the shape of a crescent on the downhill side of the pit. These heaps vary in size; the largest, at Pryce Deacon's Shaft, is over {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} high and covers about {{convert|665|m2}}.<ref name=N111>Newman 1999, p.111</ref><ref name=NA1>Newman 1999, Appendix 1, pp.144\u2013146</ref> Much interpretative work has taken place to match the visible shafts with the names mentioned in the contemporary documentation, with the result that about half of them can be named and dated with some confidence.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.111\u2013115</ref>\n\n[[File:Two brothers adit entrance.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The entrance to Two Brothers Adit|alt=Looking up a notch cut in a grassy slope leading up to a small dark entrance]]\nFour [[adit]]s are referred to in the mine documents. Shallow Adit and Deep Adit both date from the early phase of working, around 1815. Shallow Adit is blocked, its position marked by a stream issuing from the hillside just to the south of the main track. Deep Adit, however, is still open. Its entrance is lined with sturdy granite slabs and is about {{convert|2.2|m|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|0.9|m|abbr=on}} wide.\n\nTwo Brother's Adit is also still open and discharges an abundant stream of water into the steep-sided gulley that surrounds it. It evidently belongs to the later phase of the mine, being first mentioned in the 1840s. The fourth adit, referred to as Deacon's Adit, is untraceable in the field and may never have passed the planning stage.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.115\u2013117</ref>\n\n===Leats, reservoir and wheelpits===\n[[File:Eylesbarrow wheelpit 1.JPG|thumb|The 1815 wheelpit|alt=A large oblong depression full of stones]]\nDespite the extensive underground workings, no more than one waterwheel was used for pumping water out of the mine. The first waterwheel, whose wheelpit can still be seen just to the north of the main track,<ref>Newman 1999, p.120</ref> was built in 1814\u201315 and was powered by water carried by a [[leat]] that curved around the south side of Higher Hartor Tor drawing water from the upper reaches of the River Plym. In 1818 this leat, known as Engine Leat, was extended over the Plym to also collect water from the Langcombe Brook, a tributary on its south bank. Another leat built in the 1820s attempted to collect water from the hillside to the north.<ref name=N140/> That the water supply was still inadequate at times is shown by the construction, before 1825, of a large linear reservoir on the line of the main leat, the northern end of which is now cut off by the main track which used to pass over it by a bridge. This reservoir was up to {{convert|13|m|abbr=on}} wide and up to {{convert|1.3|m|abbr=on}} deep and its {{convert|192|m|abbr=on}} long dam was about {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} thick and reinforced with substantial granite blocks on the inner face.<ref name=N140>Newman 1999, p.140</ref> [[William Crossing]] reported that the mine owner, a man named Deacon, used to entertain guests by taking them out on the reservoir in a small boat.<ref>Newman 1999, p.140, quoting Crossing (1905) ''Gems in a Granite Setting'', p.157.</ref>\n\nConstruction of a more powerful waterwheel, the one proposed by Captain Spargo in 1847, was completed by March 1849 at the latest. It replaced the earlier wheel and was sited in the head of the disused Deep Adit Shaft, close to the Two Brothers Adit. This waterwheel had a diameter of 50&nbsp;ft (15&nbsp;m) and 3&nbsp;ft (1&nbsp;m) breast and was almost certainly the largest on the moor at the time.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, pp.180-181</ref>{{#tag:ref|A 60&nbsp;ft (18&nbsp;m) diameter wheel was installed at [[Bagtor|Bagtor mine]] in 1862.<ref>Atkinson et al. 1978, p.12</ref>|group=notes}} Located about {{convert|30|m|abbr=on}} lower down the hillside, it took advantage of a richer water supply which included the outfall from the nearby adit, an earlier leat drawing water from the Plym, some further leats to the north that attempted to collect water from the [[surface runoff]] on the hillside, as well as the re-routed Engine Leat.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.121, 123</ref>\n\nTraces of all the above-mentioned features can still be seen in the field.\n\n[[File:Eylesbarrow flat rods 2.JPG|thumb|Some of the pillars for the flatrod system that led from the first waterwheel to Old Engine Shaft|alt=A double line of stones leading into the distance]]\n\n===The flatrod system===\nAs a matter of principle a power source (such as a waterwheel) is installed as close as possible to the equipment that it drives (such as a water pump), to minimise the inevitable loss of power incurred in its transmission. When the distance between source and target is significant an efficient means of transferring the power is necessary, and in the 19th century the best method available was the [[flatrod system]]. This was used at a number of mines and consisted of a series of linked iron or wooden rods connected to a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] on a waterwheel (or steam engine). The crank converted the circular motion of the wheel into an oscillatory back-and-forth motion of the rods which, suitably supported, could be extended for some distance along the ground. A heavy weight, known as the [[balance bob]], pivoted on one or both ends of the run of the rods kept them under tension and allowed the conversion of the horizontal motion to vertical motion down the shaft.<!-- need a diagram to illustrate this -->\n\n{{Rquote|left|\u2026 143 fms. iron rods, 2\u00bc inches wide by 2\u00be inches thick, with joints, pins, &c., complete; 153 fms. iron rods, 1\u00be in. square \u2026 342 fms. of round iron rods, from 1\u00bc in. to 1\u00bd in. \u2026 139 cast iron pullies of 17-inch diameter, nearly new; 40 ditto, of 20-inch diameter \u2026|From the advert for the auction of the mine's equipment.

A fathom is equal to 6&nbsp;ft (1.83&nbsp;m).|group=notes}}}}\nAt Eylesbarrow the engine shafts in which the water pumps were situated were located high on the brow of the hill where there was no adequate water supply for a waterwheel to be located nearby. Consequently, the power from the waterwheel was carried by a flatrod system up the hillside to the shafts. The rods were made of iron and were supported by pulleys with flanged rims that ran on short axles supported by pairs of granite pillars around 0.4&nbsp;m apart. These pillars had distinctive notches cut into their tops to support the axles. Parts of four runs of these paired posts can be seen today. They vary in height from just above ground level to around a metre, and some run through shallow cuttings, representing the varying contour of the ground.<ref name=N121>Newman 1999, p.121</ref>\n\nFrom the wheelpit of the first waterwheel, two series of double pillars head eastwards up the hill, just to the north of the main track. The northern series heads towards Old Engine Shaft, a distance of {{convert|663|m}}. This shaft was in use from 1814 onwards. The southern, less well preserved series, probably led to Pryce Deacon's Shaft, {{convert|777|m}} away, and may have been in use in the 1840s.<ref name=N121/>\n\n[[File:Eylesbarrow wheelpit 2.JPG|thumb|upright|The remains of the wheelpit for the 50&nbsp;ft wheel|alt=A deep notch in the hillside]]\nIn the second, later, wheelpit, pictured here, the wheel itself was on the south side of the pit (on the right in this photograph). The short length of wall on the right is the end wall of the wheelpit. The mechanism operating the flatrod system was on the north side, aligned with the short section of wall visible further away on the left: this probably formed part of the first support for the flatrods, which are believed to have travelled underground until they reached a V-shaped gulley, just visible towards the top of the photograph.<ref name=N111/>\n\nThis flatrods from this wheel led towards Pryce Deacon's Shaft, {{convert|961|m}} away and also to Henry's Engine Shaft, {{convert|854|m}} away. A spur leads off at an angle to another unnamed shaft to the north, {{convert|1192|m|abbr=on}} distant. The chronology of the use of these systems is not certain, though the extension to the northern shaft probably represents the very last phase of underground mining at the site.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.123\u2013124</ref>\n\n===Stamping mills and smelting house===\nThe purpose of a [[Dartmoor tin-mining#Processing|stamping mill]] is to crush the mined ore to a fine sand which is then processed at an adjacent \"dressing floor\" to separate the heavier tin ore from the waste material or \"gangue\", which is dumped. There are remains of six stamping mills at Eylesbarrow mine, an unusually high number, although they were not all in use at the same time. They form a rough line down the hillside into the head of the Drizzlecombe valley and in the literature they are numbered from 1 to 6: No.&nbsp;1 is the highest, located just below the first pumping waterwheel to the north of the main track; No.&nbsp;6 is about {{convert|0.75|km|abbr=on}} distant and some {{convert|35|m|abbr=on}} lower down the slope. The prominent wall with a hole in it just below the main track is the side wall of the wheelpit of stamping mill No.&nbsp;2, the hole marking the location of the axle.<ref>Cook et al. 1974, p.187</ref>\n\nThe oldest mill is No.&nbsp;4 which was operating in 1804, followed the next year by No.&nbsp;6., a large construction which had its waterwheel in the centre of the floor with machinery on both sides. Both these were powered by the lower of the two leats that took water from the River Plym. The major works undertaken on the mine in 1814 included the construction of three new mills (Nos.&nbsp;1, 2 and 3) and the cutting of the higher (Engine) leat to power them.\n{{multiple image\n |align=left\n |direction=vertical\n | width = 300\n | footer =\n | image1 = Eylesbarrow sm5 view 4.JPG\n | alt1 = A step cut into a grassy slope covered with a scatter of rocks of various sizes\n | caption1 = The remains of the smelting house...\n | image2 = Flue at sm5 1.JPG\n | alt2 = A line of flat stones on the ground covering a shallow channel\n | caption2 = ...and its flue\n}}\nMill No.&nbsp;5, which had the smelter attached, was completed by 1822.<ref>Newman 1999, pp.126\u2013127</ref> The smelting house (shown here as it looks today) had two furnaces.

It has become standard practice to: \n* capture and use associated gas to provide local power, and to \n* reinject re-compressed gas for secondary recovery, reservoir pressure maintenance and potential later reservoir depressurization once hydrocarbon liquids recovery has been maximized and a gas export infrastructure and market access have been established. \n\nToday, it is financially viable to develop even relatively small hydrocarbon reservoirs containing non-associated gas (i.e. with little or no oil) close to a market or export route, as well as large, remote accumulations.

The film was released in selected cities on November 23, 2012,<ref name=\"HP\" /> with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012.\n\n''Hitchcock'' centers on the relationship between film director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] ([[Anthony Hopkins]]) and his wife [[Alma Reville]] ([[Helen Mirren]]) during the making of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', a controversial [[horror film]] that became one of the most acclaimed and influential works in the filmmaker's career.\n\n==Plot ==\nIn 1959, Alfred Hitchcock opens his latest film, ''[[North by Northwest]]'', to both critical and commercial success, but is troubled by a reporter's insinuation that he should retire. Seeking to reclaim the artistic daring of his youth, Hitchcock turns down film proposals, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', in favor of a horror novel called ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]],  based on the real-life crimes of murderer [[Ed Gein]]. Gein appears in sequences throughout the film, in which he seems to prompt Hitchcock's imagination regarding the ''Psycho'' story, or act as some function of Hitchcock's subconscious mind (for instance, drawing Hitchcock's attention to sand on his bathroom floor, the quantity of which reveals how much time his wife Alma has been spending at the beachhouse with Whitfield Cook).\n\nHitchcock's wife and artistic collaborator, Alma, is no more enthusiastic about the idea than his colleagues, especially since she is being lobbied by their writer friend, [[Whitfield Cook]], to look at his own screenplay. However, she warms to Hitchcock's proposal, suggesting the innovative plot turn of killing the female lead early in the film. The studio heads at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] prove more difficult to persuade, forcing Hitchcock to finance the film personally and use his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television crew (over at competitor Revue/Universal) to shoot the film, his last with Paramount.\n\nHowever, the pressures of the production, such as dealing with Geoffrey Shurlock of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], and Hitchcock's lecherous habits, such as when they confer with the female lead, [[Janet Leigh]], annoy Alma. She begins a personal writing collaboration with Whitfield Cook on his screenplay at his beach house without Hitchcock's knowledge. Hitchcock eventually discovers what she has been doing and suspects her of having an affair.  This concern affects Hitchcock's work on ''Psycho''. Hitchcock eventually confronts Alma and asks her if she is having an affair. Alma angrily denies it.\n\nAlma temporarily takes over production of the film when Hitchcock is bedridden after collapsing from overwork, but this sequence, which included a complicated [[Rear projection effect|process shot]] showing Detective Arbogast's demise, with Alma's specification of a 35mm lens, instead of the 50mm lens preferred by Hitchcock for this film, proved to be the least effective in the film.\n\nMeanwhile, Hitchcock expresses his disappointment to [[Vera Miles]] at how she didn't follow through on his plan to make her the next biggest star after [[Grace Kelly]], but Miles says she is happy with her family life.\n\nHitchcock's cut of ''Psycho'' is poorly received by the studio executives, while Alma discovers Whitfield having sex with a younger woman at his beach house. Hitchcock and Alma reconcile and set to work on improving the film. Their renewed collaboration yields results, culminating in Alma persuading Hitchcock to accept their composer's suggestion for adding [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s harsh strings score to the shower scene.\n\nAfter maneuvering Shurlock into leaving the film's content largely intact, Hitchcock learns the studio is only going to open the film in two theaters. Hitchcock arranges for special theater instructions to pique the public's interest such as forbidding admittance after the film begins. At the film's premiere, Hitchcock first views the audience from the projection booth, looking out through its small window at them. Hitchcock then waits in the lobby for the audience's reaction, conducting slashing motions to their reactions as they scream on cue. The film is rewarded with an enthusiastic reception.\n\nWith the film's screening so well received, Hitchcock publicly thanks his wife for helping make it possible and they affirm their love and partnership. At the conclusion at his home, Hitchcock addresses the audience noting ''Psycho'' proved a major high point of his career and he is currently pondering his next project. A [[The Birds (film)|raven]] lands on his shoulder, before he turns to meet with his wife.\n\nThe final title cards say that Hitchcock directed six more films after ''Psycho'', none of which would eclipse its commercial success, and although he never won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], the [[American Film Institute]] awarded him its Life Achievement Award in 1979: an award that he claimed he shared, as he had his life, with his wife, Alma.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus some historical, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n*[[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\n*[[Helen Mirren]] as [[Alma Reville]]\n*[[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]]\n*[[Toni Collette]] as [[Peggy Robertson|Peggy]]\n*[[Danny Huston]] as [[Whitfield Cook]]\n*[[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]]\n*[[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Lew Wasserman]]\n*[[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]\n*[[Michael Wincott]] as [[Ed Gein]]\n*[[Kurtwood Smith]] as Geoffrey Shurlock\n*[[Richard Portnow]] as [[Barney Balaban]]\n*[[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Joseph Stefano]]\n*[[Wallace Langham]] as [[Saul Bass]]\n*Paul Schackman as [[Bernard Herrmann]]\n*Richard Chassler as [[Martin Balsam]]\n*Josh Yeo as [[John Gavin]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 2005, it was reported that [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] would produce a television film or [[miniseries]] based on [[Stephen Rebello]]'s book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Denise|title=A&E looks into 'Live'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117925863?refCatId=14|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=September 17, 2012|date=July 13, 2005}}</ref> Subsequently, the book was optioned as a major motion picture. In 2007, [[The Montecito Picture Company]], owned by [[Ivan Reitman]] and Tom Pollock, set up a [[first-look deal]] with [[Paramount Pictures]], the original distributor of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. However, after four years of development at Paramount, production moved to [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].<ref name=\"HelenMirren\">{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Helen Mirren Circling 'Alfred Hitchcock' as Project Moves From Paramount to Fox Searchlight (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/helen-mirren-alfred-hitchcock-271024|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 17, 2012|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn November 20, 2011, [[Sacha Gervasi]] was announced as being in negotiations to direct the dramatic motion picture.

The film was released in selected cities on November 23, 2012,<ref name=\"HP\" /> with a worldwide release on December 14, 2012.\n\n''Hitchcock'' centers on the relationship between film director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] ([[Anthony Hopkins]]) and his wife [[Alma Reville]] ([[Helen Mirren]]) during the making of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', a controversial [[horror film]] that became one of the most acclaimed and influential works in the filmmaker's career.\n\n==Plot ==\nIn 1959, Alfred Hitchcock opens his latest film, ''[[North by Northwest]]'', to both critical and commercial success, but is troubled by a reporter's insinuation that he should retire. Seeking to reclaim the artistic daring of his youth, Hitchcock turns down film proposals, including ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]'' and ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank (1959 film)|The Diary of Anne Frank]]'', in favor of a horror novel called ''[[Psycho (novel)|Psycho]]'' by [[Robert Bloch]],  based on the real-life crimes of murderer [[Ed Gein]]. Gein appears in sequences throughout the film, in which he seems to prompt Hitchcock's imagination regarding the ''Psycho'' story, or act as some function of Hitchcock's subconscious mind (for instance, drawing Hitchcock's attention to sand on his bathroom floor, the quantity of which reveals how much time his wife Alma has been spending at the beachhouse with Whitfield Cook).\n\nHitchcock's wife and artistic collaborator, Alma, is no more enthusiastic about the idea than his colleagues, especially since she is being lobbied by their writer friend, [[Whitfield Cook]], to look at his own screenplay. However, she warms to Hitchcock's proposal, suggesting the innovative plot turn of killing the female lead early in the film. The studio heads at [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] prove more difficult to persuade, forcing Hitchcock to finance the film personally and use his ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'' television crew (over at competitor Revue/Universal) to shoot the film, his last with Paramount.\n\nHowever, the pressures of the production, such as dealing with Geoffrey Shurlock of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]], and Hitchcock's lecherous habits, such as when they confer with the female lead, [[Janet Leigh]], annoy Alma. She begins a personal writing collaboration with Whitfield Cook on his screenplay at his beach house without Hitchcock's knowledge. Hitchcock eventually discovers what she has been doing and suspects her of having an affair.  This concern affects Hitchcock's work on ''Psycho''. Hitchcock eventually confronts Alma and asks her if she is having an affair. Alma angrily denies it.\n\nAlma temporarily takes over production of the film when Hitchcock is bedridden after collapsing from overwork, but this sequence, which included a complicated [[Rear projection effect|process shot]] showing Detective Arbogast's demise, with Alma's specification of a 35mm lens, instead of the 50mm lens preferred by Hitchcock for this film, proved to be the least effective in the film.\n\nMeanwhile, Hitchcock expresses his disappointment to [[Vera Miles]] at how she didn't follow through on his plan to make her the next biggest star after [[Grace Kelly]], but Miles says she is happy with her family life.\n\nHitchcock's cut of ''Psycho'' is poorly received by the studio executives, while Alma discovers Whitfield having sex with a younger woman at his beach house. Hitchcock and Alma reconcile and set to work on improving the film. Their renewed collaboration yields results, culminating in Alma persuading Hitchcock to accept their composer's suggestion for adding [[Bernard Herrmann]]'s harsh strings score to the shower scene.\n\nAfter maneuvering Shurlock into leaving the film's content largely intact, Hitchcock learns the studio is only going to open the film in two theaters. Hitchcock arranges for special theater instructions to pique the public's interest such as forbidding admittance after the film begins. At the film's premiere, Hitchcock first views the audience from the projection booth, looking out through its small window at them. Hitchcock then waits in the lobby for the audience's reaction, conducting slashing motions to their reactions as they scream on cue. The film is rewarded with an enthusiastic reception.\n\nWith the film's screening so well received, Hitchcock publicly thanks his wife for helping make it possible and they affirm their love and partnership. At the conclusion at his home, Hitchcock addresses the audience noting ''Psycho'' proved a major high point of his career and he is currently pondering his next project. A [[The Birds (film)|raven]] lands on his shoulder, before he turns to meet with his wife.\n\nThe final title cards say that Hitchcock directed six more films after ''Psycho'', none of which would eclipse its commercial success, and although he never won an [[Academy Award|Oscar]], the [[American Film Institute]] awarded him its Life Achievement Award in 1979: an award that he claimed he shared, as he had his life, with his wife, Alma.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, plus some historical, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n{{castlist|\n*[[Anthony Hopkins]] as [[Alfred Hitchcock]]\n*[[Helen Mirren]] as [[Alma Reville]]\n*[[Scarlett Johansson]] as [[Janet Leigh]]\n*[[Toni Collette]] as [[Peggy Robertson|Peggy]]\n*[[Danny Huston]] as [[Whitfield Cook]]\n*[[Jessica Biel]] as [[Vera Miles]]\n*[[Michael Stuhlbarg]] as [[Lew Wasserman]]\n*[[James D'Arcy]] as [[Anthony Perkins]]\n*[[Michael Wincott]] as [[Ed Gein]]\n*[[Kurtwood Smith]] as Geoffrey Shurlock\n*[[Richard Portnow]] as [[Barney Balaban]]\n*[[Ralph Macchio]] as [[Joseph Stefano]]\n*[[Wallace Langham]] as [[Saul Bass]]\n*Paul Schackman as [[Bernard Herrmann]]\n*Richard Chassler as [[Martin Balsam]]\n*Josh Yeo as [[John Gavin]]\n}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nIn 2005, it was reported that [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] would produce a television film or [[miniseries]] based on [[Stephen Rebello]]'s book ''[[Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Denise|title=A&E looks into 'Live'|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117925863?refCatId=14|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=September 17, 2012|date=July 13, 2005}}</ref> Subsequently, the book was optioned as a major motion picture. In 2007, [[The Montecito Picture Company]], owned by [[Ivan Reitman]] and Tom Pollock, set up a [[first-look deal]] with [[Paramount Pictures]], the original distributor of ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. However, after four years of development at Paramount, production moved to [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]].<ref name=\"HelenMirren\">{{cite web|last=Kit|first=Borys|title=Helen Mirren Circling 'Alfred Hitchcock' as Project Moves From Paramount to Fox Searchlight (Exclusive)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/helen-mirren-alfred-hitchcock-271024|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 17, 2012|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn November 20, 2011, [[Sacha Gervasi]] was announced as being in negotiations to direct the dramatic motion picture.

He is known for his complete disdain of [[debt collector]]s, calling them (among other things) \"scum\" and dishonest, and urging his listeners not to deal with them unless necessary, and then to get everything in writing, especially involving offers to reduce debts.\n\nWith a simple, seven-stage \"baby steps\" formula (Baby Step Two is based on the [[debt snowball method]]), Ramsey urges listeners to avoid all [[debt]] except for certain types of home [[mortgages]].\n\nRamsey's Seven Baby Steps are:\n\n1. Save $1,000 for a starter emergency fund.\n\n2. Pay off all debt (except the house) using the debt snowball.\n\n3. Save 3-6 months expenses in a fully funded emergency fund.\n\n4. Invest 15% of household income in retirement.\n\n5. Save for children's college fund.\n\n6. Pay off home early.\n\n7. Build wealth and give.\n\nOne notable difference between his and other financial shows is that Ramsey attempts to go beyond mathematical mechanics and reach his callers on an emotional and spiritual level.<ref name=\"Radio Ink Industry Q&A\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.radioink.com/listingsEntry.asp?ID=468144&PT=industryqa|title=Dave Ramsey: Money in the Bank (10/02/06)|accessdate=2006-12-03|publisher=Radio Ink|year=2006|author=Joe Howard, Editor-In-Chief}}</ref>\n\nThe show has a channel on [[iHeartRadio]].<ref name=iheartdaveramsey>{{cite web|title=Dave Ramsey Channel|url=http://www.iheart.com/live/dave-ramsey-channel-5859/|website=[[iHeartRadio]]|publisher=[[iHeartMedia, Inc.]]|accessdate=20 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nThe program began June 15, 1992, when Ramsey, selling copies of ''Financial Peace'' out of the trunk of his car, was a guest on 99.7 [[WWTN]].<ref name=\"Company History\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.daveramsey.com/etc/cms/index.cfm?intContentID=2797|title=Our Company History|accessdate=2006-12-03|publisher=daveramsey.com|year=2006|author=Dave Ramsey |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018173517/http://www.daveramsey.com/etc/cms/index.cfm?intContentID=2797 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2006-10-18}}</ref>  The station had recently filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy and one of its hosts had quit after not getting paid, which left the station scrambling to fill the gap in its lineup.
