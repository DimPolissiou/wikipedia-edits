They are closely related to the [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]], which include the [[earthworm]]s, and like them have soft, muscular, segmented bodies that can lengthen and contract. Both groups are [[hermaphrodite]]s and have a [[clitellum]], but leeches typically differ from the oligochaetes in having suckers at both ends and in having external annulations that do not correspond with their internal segmentation. The body is relatively solid, and the spacious body cavity found in other annelids, the [[coelom]], is reduced to small channels.\n\nThe majority of leeches live in freshwater environments, while some species can be found in terrestrial and marine environments. The best-known, such as the medicinal leech, ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'', are [[hematophagous]], attaching themselves to a host with a sucker and feeding on blood, having first secreted the peptide [[hirudin]] to prevent the blood from clotting. A minority of leech species are predatory, mostly preying on small invertebrates.\n\nIn aquatic species, the eggs are enclosed in a cocoon which is usually attached to something solid, but terrestrial species often conceal the cocoon under a log or in a crevice. Almost 700 species of leech are currently recognised, of which some 100 are marine, 90 terrestrial and the remainder freshwater.\n\nLeeches were used in medicine from ancient times until the 19th century to [[bloodletting|draw blood]] from patients. In modern times, leeches find medical use in treatment of joint diseases such as [[epicondylitis]] and osteoarthritis, extremity vein diseases, and [[microsurgery]], while [[hirudin]] is a valuable [[anticoagulant]] drug for some blood-clotting disorders.\n\nMarine leeches are superior\n\n==Evolution==\nThe most ancient annelid group is the free-living [[polychaete]]s that evolved in the [[Cambrian]] period, being plentiful in the [[Burgess Shale]] about 500 million years ago. [[Oligochaetes]] evolved from polychaetes and the leeches branched off from the oligochaetes. Both the oligochaetes and the leeches, having no hard parts, do not fossilise well.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Margulis, Lynn |author1link=Lynn Margulis |author2=Chapman, Michael J.|title=Kingdoms and Domains: An Illustrated Guide to the Phyla of Life on Earth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IWaqAOGyt4C&pg=PA308 |year=2009 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-08-092014-6 |page=308}}</ref>  The first leech fossils are found in the [[Jurassic]] period around 150 million years ago, but an annulate fossil found in [[Wisconsin]] in the 1980s, with what appears to be a large sucker, seems to extend the group's evolutionary history back to the [[Silurian]], some 437 million years ago.<ref name=Thorp>{{cite book|author1=Thorp, James H.|author2=Covich, Alan P. |title=Ecology and Classification of North American Freshwater Invertebrates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aj2ZMSekmHEC&pg=PA466 |year=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-690647-9 |page=466}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author1=Mikulic, D.

In leeches, the coelom is reduced to four slender longitudinal channels, and the interior of the body is filled with a solid [[dermis]] in between the various organs. Typically, the body is [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]] flattened and tapers at both ends. Longitudinal and circular muscles in the body wall are supplemented by diagonal muscles, giving the leech the ability to adopt a large range of body shapes and show great flexibility. Most leeches have a sucker at both the anterior (front) and posterior (back) ends, but some primitive leeches have a single sucker at the back.<ref name=Ruppert>{{cite book |title=Invertebrate Zoology |edition=7th |last1=Ruppert |first1=Edward E. |last2=Fox |first2=Richard, S. |last3=Barnes |first3=Robert D. |year=2004 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-81-315-0104-7 |pages=471\u2013482 }}</ref><ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\nLike other annelids, the leech is a segmented animal, but unlike other annelids, the [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]] is masked by the external annulation (ring markings),<ref name=Buchsbaum /> with the body surface being divided into 102 [[Annulus (zoology)|annuli]], whereas its internal structure consists of 32 segments.<ref name=Payton2>{{cite book | author=Payton, Brian | title=Neurobiology of the Leech |editor1=Muller, Kenneth|editor2=Nicholls, John |editor3=Stent, Gunther |publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory | year=1981 | isbn=978-0-87969-146-2 |pages=35\u201350}}</ref> Of these segments, the first five are designated as the head and include the anterior brain, several [[ocelli]] (eyespots) dorsally and the sucker ventrally. The following 21 mid-body segments each contain a nerve [[ganglion]], and between them contain two reproductive organs, a single female [[gonopore]] and nine pairs of [[Testis|testes]]. The last seven segments contain the posterior brain and are fused to form the animal's tail sucker.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe body wall consists of a [[cuticle]], an [[epidermis]] and a thick layer of fibrous [[connective tissue]] in which are embedded the circular muscles, the diagonal muscles and the powerful longitudinal muscles. There are also dorso-ventral muscles. The coelomic channels run the full length of the body, the two main ones being on either side. The coelom has taken over the function of the hemal system (blood vessels) in other annelids. Part of the lining [[epithelium]] consists of [[chloragogen cell]]s which are used for the storage of nutrients and in [[excretion]]. There are ten to seventeen pairs of [[metanephridia]] (excretory organs) in the mid-region of the leech. From these, ducts typically lead to a [[urinary bladder]], which empties to the outside at a [[nephridiopore]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n{{further|Leech embryogenesis}}\n\nLeeches are [[Protandry|protandric]] hermaphrodites, with the male [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]], the [[testicle|testes]], maturing first and the [[ovary|ovaries]] later. In hirudinids, a pair will line up with the clittelar regions in contact, with the anterior end of one leech pointing towards the posterior end of the other; this results in the male gonopore of one leech being in contact with the female gonopore of the other. The penis passes a spermatophore into the female gonopore and sperm is transferred, and probably stored in, the vagina.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome [[Rhynchobdellida|jawless leeches]] (Rhynchobdellida) and [[Arhynchobdellida|proboscisless leeches]] (Arhynchobdellida) lack a penis, and in these, sperm is passed from one individual to another by hypodermic injection. The leeches intertwine and grasp each other with their suckers. A spermatophore is pushed by one through the integument of the other, usually into the clitellar region. The sperm is liberated and passes to the ovisacs, either through the coelomic channels or interstitially through specialist \"target tissue\" pathways.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome time after copulation, the small, relatively yolkless eggs are laid. In most species, an albumin-filled cocoon is secreted by the clitellum and receives one or more eggs as it passes over the female gonopore. The cocoon is fixed to a submerged object, or in the case of terrestrial leeches, deposited under a stone or buried in damp soil. The cocoon of ''[[Hemibdella soleae]]'' is attached to a suitable fish [[Host (biology)|host]],<ref name=Ruppert/> and that of a branchiobdellid, to the shell of a crayfish on which the young will become ectosymbionts.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gelder, Stuart R. |author2=Gagnon, Nicole L. |author3=Nelson, Kerri |year=2002 |title=Taxonomic Considerations and Distribution of the Branchiobdellida (Annelida: Clitellata) on the North American Continent |journal=Northeastern Naturalist |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=451\u2013468 |jstor=3858556 |doi=10.1656/1092-6194(2002)009[0451:TCADOT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> The glossiphoniids brood their eggs, either by attaching the cocoon to the substrate and covering it with their ventral surface, or by securing the cocoon to their ventral surface, and even carrying the newly hatched young to their first meal.<ref name=Rohde>{{cite book|author=Rohde, Klaus |title=Marine Parasitology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktTOf3l66QQC&pg=PT185 |year=2005 |publisher=Csiro Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09927-2 |page=185}}</ref>\n\nWhen breeding, most marine leeches leave their hosts and become free-living in estuaries. Here they produce their cocoons, after which the adults of most species die. When the eggs hatch, the juveniles seek out potential hosts when these approach the shore.<ref name=Rohde/> Leeches mostly have an annual or biannual life cycle.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n===Feeding and digestion===\n[[File:Blutegelmeyer.jpg|thumb|left|Mouthparts and sucker]]\n\nAbout three quarters of leech species feed on blood extracted from a host while the remainder are predators. Leeches either have a protusible pharynx, commonly called a proboscis, or a non-protusible pharynx which may or may not be armed with jaws.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIn the proboscisless leeches, the jaws of Arhynchobdellids are at the front of the mouth, and have three blades set at an angle to each other. In feeding these slice their way through the skin of the host, leaving a Y-shaped incision. Behind the blades is the mouth, located ventrally at the anterior end of the body. It leads successively into the [[pharynx]], a short oesophagus, a [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] (in some species), a stomach and a hindgut, which ends at an anus located just above the posterior sucker. The stomach may be a simple tube, but the crop, when present, is an enlarged part of the midgut with a number of pairs of ceca that stores ingested blood. The leech secretes an anticoagulant, [[hirudin]], in its saliva which prevents the blood from clotting before ingestion.<ref name=Ruppert/> A mature [[medicinal leech]] may feed only twice a year, taking months to digest a blood meal.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n[[File:Leach bite site.jpg|thumb|Leech bites on a cow's udder]]\n\nThe bodies of predatory leeches are similar, though instead of jaws many have a protrusible [[proboscis]], which for most of the time they keep retracted into the mouth. Such leeches are often [[ambush predator]]s that lie in wait till they can strike prey with the proboscises in a spear-like fashion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.invertebrate.us/leech/info/leech.pdf |title=All about leeches |author1=Govedich, Fredric R. |author2=Bain, Bonnie A. |date=14 March 2005 |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> Predatory leeches feed on small invertebrates such as snails, earthworms and insect larvae. The prey is usually sucked in and swallowed whole. Some Rhynchobdellida, however, suck the soft tissues from their prey, making them intermediate between predators and blood-suckers.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n[[File:Egel als Schneckenparasit 04.JPG|thumb|left|Leech attacking a slug]]\nWhen they are hungry, leeches use their anterior suckers to connect to hosts for feeding. Once attached, leeches use a combination of mucus and suction to stay in place while they inject hirudin into the hosts' [[Blood|blood stream]]s. In general, sanguivorous leeches are non host-specific, and do little harm to their host, dropping off after consuming a blood meal. Some marine species, however, remain attached until it is time to reproduce. If present in great numbers on a host, these can be debilitating, and in extreme cases, cause death.<ref name=Rohde/>\n\nLeeches are unusual in that they do not produce [[amylase]]s, [[lipase]]s or [[endopeptidase]]s.<ref name=Ruppert/> This lack of endopeptidases means the mechanism of protein digestion cannot follow the same sequence as it would in all other animals in which endopeptidases first split proteins into [[peptide]]s, and the exopeptidases then degrade the peptides.<ref name=\"Sawyer2\">{{cite web |first=Roy T. |last=Sawyer |title=Leech biology and behaviour |url=http://www.biopharm-leeches.com/pdf/bioandbehav.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910161114/http://www.biopharm-leeches.com/pdf/bioandbehav.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2011 }}</ref> However, they do produce intestinal [[exopeptidase]]s which remove amino acids from the long protein molecules one by one,  possibly aided by [[protease]]s from endosymbiotic bacteria in the intestine.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dzieko\u0144ska-Rynko, Janina |author2=Bielecki, Aleksander |author3=Pali\u0144ska, Katarzyna |year=2009 |title=Activity of selected hydrolytic enzymes from leeches (Clitellata: Hirudinida) with different feeding strategies |journal=Biologia |volume=64 |issue=2 |doi=10.2478/s11756-009-0048-0 }}</ref> This evolutionary choice of exopeptic digestion in Hirudinea distinguishes these carnivorous clitellates from oligochaetes, and may explain why digestion in leeches is so slow.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nDeficiency of [[digestive enzyme]]s and of B complex vitamins is compensated for by enzymes and vitamins produced by [[endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] microflora. In ''Hirudo medicinalis'', these supplementary factors are produced by an obligatory [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with two bacterial species, ''Aeromonas veronii'' and a still-uncharacterised [[Rikenellaceae|''Rikenella'']] species. Nonbloodsucking leeches, such as ''Erpobdella punctata'', are host to three bacterial symbionts, ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Aeromonas]]'', and ''[[Klebsiella]]'' spp. (a slime producer). The bacteria are passed from parent to offspring in the cocoon as it is formed.<ref name=\"Sawyer2\"/>\n\n[[File:PSM V17 D495 The medicinal leech.jpg|thumb|upright|The leech and its nervous system]]\n\n===Nervous system===\n\nThe nervous system of leeches is formed of a small number of large [[nerve cell]]s; this has resulted in leeches being used as [[model organism]]s for the study of invertebrate nervous systems. The main nerve centre consists of the cerebral [[ganglion]] above the gut and another ganglion beneath it, with connecting nerves forming a ring around the pharynx a little way behind the mouth. A nerve cord runs backwards from this in the ventral coelomic channel, with 21 pairs of [[segmental ganglia|ganglia in segments]] 6 to 26. In segments 27 to 33, other paired ganglia fuse to form the caudal ganglion.<ref name=Ruppert/> Several sensory nerves connect directly to the cerebral ganglion; there are sensory and motor nerve cells connected to the ventral nerve cord ganglia in each segment.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\nLeeches have between two and ten [[Pigment spot ocellus|pigment spot ocelli]], arranged in pairs towards the front of the body. There are also sensory papillae arranged in a lateral row in one annulation of each segment. Each papilla contains many sensory cells. Some rhynchobdellids have the ability to change colour dramatically by moving pigment in [[chromatophore]] cells; this process is under the control of the nervous system but its function is unclear as the change in hue seems unrelated to the colour of the surroundings.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nLeeches can detect touch, vibration, movement of nearby objects, and chemicals secreted by their hosts; freshwater leeches crawl or swim towards a potential host standing in their pond within a few seconds. Species that feed on warm-blooded hosts move towards warmer objects. Many leeches avoid light, though some blood feeders move towards light when they are ready to feed, presumably increasing the chances of finding a host.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n===Gas exchange===\nLeeches live in damp surroundings and in general respire through their body wall. The exception to this is in the Piscicolidae, where branching or leaf-like lateral outgrowths from the body wall form [[gill]]s. Some rhynchobdellid leeches have an extracellular [[haemoglobin]] pigment, but this only provides for about half of the leech's oxygen transportation needs.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n[[File:Leech looping locomotion.jpg|thumb|upright|Leech [[Animal locomotion#Peristalsis and looping|moving by looping]] using its front and back suckers]]\n\n==Movement==\n[[File:20100214 Leech climbing door at Lake Leake, Tasmania.ogv|thumb|Leech looping]]\n\nLeeches move using their longitudinal and circular muscles, which other annelids such as earthworms use for [[peristalsis]], with the addition of the use of their posterior and anterior suckers (one on each end of the body) to enable them to [[Animal locomotion#Peristalsis and looping|progress by looping]] or inching along, in the manner of [[geometer moth]] caterpillars. The posterior end is attached to the substrate, and the anterior end is projected forward peristaltically by the circular muscles until it touches down, as far as it can reach, and the anterior end is attached.

They are closely related to the [[Oligochaeta|oligochaetes]], which include the [[earthworm]]s, and like them have soft, muscular, segmented bodies that can lengthen and contract. Both groups are [[hermaphrodite]]s and have a [[clitellum]], but leeches typically differ from the oligochaetes in having suckers at both ends and in having external annulations that do not correspond with their internal segmentation. The body is relatively solid, and the spacious body cavity found in other annelids, the [[coelom]], is reduced to small channels.\n\nThe majority of leeches live in freshwater environments, while some species can be found in terrestrial and marine environments. The best-known, such as the medicinal leech, ''[[Hirudo medicinalis]]'', are [[hematophagous]], attaching themselves to a host with a sucker and feeding on blood, having first secreted the peptide [[hirudin]] to prevent the blood from clotting. A minority of leech species are predatory, mostly preying on small invertebrates.\n\nIn aquatic species, the eggs are enclosed in a cocoon which is usually attached to something solid, but terrestrial species often conceal the cocoon under a log or in a crevice. Almost 700 species of leech are currently recognised, of which some 100 are marine, 90 terrestrial and the remainder freshwater.\n\nLeeches were used in medicine from ancient times until the 19th century to [[bloodletting|draw blood]] from patients. In modern times, leeches find medical use in treatment of joint diseases such as [[epicondylitis]] and osteoarthritis, extremity vein diseases, and [[microsurgery]], while [[hirudin]] is a valuable [[anticoagulant]] drug for some blood-clotting disorders.\n\n==Diversity and phylogeny==\n[[File:Haemadipsa zeylanica japonica.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Haemadipsidae|Haemadipsa zeylanica]]'', a terrestrial leech found in the mountains of Japan]][[File:Parasite180056-fig1 Placobdelloides siamensis (Glossiphoniidae).png|thumb|''[[Placobdelloides siamensis]]'', a parasite of turtles in Thailand; left, dorsal face, right, ventral face]]\n\nSome 700 species of leech have been described, of which some 100 are marine, 90 terrestrial and the remainder freshwater.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Sket, Boris |author2=Trontelj, Peter |year=2008 |title=Global diversity of leeches (Hirudinea) in freshwater |journal=[[Hydrobiologia]] |volume=595 |issue=1 |pages=129\u2013137 |doi=10.1007/s10750-007-9010-8}}</ref><ref name=\"Fogden\">{{Cite journal |author1=Fogden, S. |author2= Proctor, J. | title=Notes on the Feeding of Land Leeches (''Haemadipsa zeylanica'' Moore and ''H. picta'' Moore) in Gunung Mulu National Park, Sarawak |journal=Biotropica |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=172\u2013174 |year=1985 |doi=10.2307/2388511 | jstor=2388511 }}</ref> The name for the subclass, Hirudinea, comes from the Latin ''hirudo, hirudinis'', a leech.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.finedictionary.com/Hirudinea.html |title=Hirudinea etymology |publisher=Fine Dictionary |accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe more primitive [[Acanthobdellidea]] are often included with the leeches, but some authors treat them as a separate [[Clitellata|clitellate]] group.<ref name=\"Siddall Burreson 1996 pp. 277\u2013285\">{{cite journal | last=Siddall | first=Mark E. | last2=Burreson | first2=Eugene M. | title=Leeches (Oligochaeta?: Euhirudinea), their phylogeny and the evolution of life-history strategies | journal=Hydrobiologia | volume=334 | issue=1\u20133 | year=1996 | doi=10.1007/bf00017378 | pages=277\u2013285}}</ref> The [[Branchiobdellida]] include [[cleaning symbiosis|cleaning symbionts]] such as ''[[Xironodrilus appalachius]]'', which lives on the [[crayfish]] ''[[Cambarus chaugaensis]]''.<ref name=\"Skelton2014\">{{cite journal | last=Skelton | first=James | last2=Creed | first2=Robert P. | last3=Brown | first3=Bryan L. | title=Ontogenetic shift in host tolerance controls initiation of a cleaning symbiosis | journal=Oikos | volume=123 | issue=6 | date=February 2014 | doi=10.1111/j.1600-0706.2013.00963.x | pages=677\u2013686| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/cd3528e0f93ed7c28a53df9fe04638a6c4539874 }}</ref> Both groups live in freshwater.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\nTrue leeches of the infraclass [[Euhirudinea]] have both anterior and [[Acetabulum (morphology)|posterior suckers]].

In leeches, the coelom is reduced to four slender longitudinal channels, and the interior of the body is filled with a solid [[dermis]] in between the various organs. Typically, the body is [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventrally]] flattened and tapers at both ends. Longitudinal and circular muscles in the body wall are supplemented by diagonal muscles, giving the leech the ability to adopt a large range of body shapes and show great flexibility.

The following 21 mid-body segments each contain a nerve [[ganglion]], and between them contain two reproductive organs, a single female [[gonopore]] and nine pairs of [[Testis|testes]]. The last seven segments contain the posterior brain and are fused to form the animal's tail sucker.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nThe body wall consists of a [[cuticle]], an [[epidermis]] and a thick layer of fibrous [[connective tissue]] in which are embedded the circular muscles, the diagonal muscles and the powerful longitudinal muscles. There are also dorso-ventral muscles. The coelomic channels run the full length of the body, the two main ones being on either side. The coelom has taken over the function of the hemal system (blood vessels) in other annelids. Part of the lining [[epithelium]] consists of [[chloragogen cell]]s which are used for the storage of nutrients and in [[excretion]]. There are ten to seventeen pairs of [[metanephridia]] (excretory organs) in the mid-region of the leech. From these, ducts typically lead to a [[urinary bladder]], which empties to the outside at a [[nephridiopore]].<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n===Reproduction and development===\n{{further|Leech embryogenesis}}\n\nLeeches are [[Protandry|protandric]] hermaphrodites, with the male [[Sex organ|reproductive organs]], the [[testicle|testes]], maturing first and the [[ovary|ovaries]] later. In hirudinids, a pair will line up with the clittelar regions in contact, with the anterior end of one leech pointing towards the posterior end of the other; this results in the male gonopore of one leech being in contact with the female gonopore of the other. The penis passes a spermatophore into the female gonopore and sperm is transferred, and probably stored in, the vagina.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome [[Rhynchobdellida|jawless leeches]] (Rhynchobdellida) and [[Arhynchobdellida|proboscisless leeches]] (Arhynchobdellida) lack a penis, and in these, sperm is passed from one individual to another by hypodermic injection. The leeches intertwine and grasp each other with their suckers. A spermatophore is pushed by one through the integument of the other, usually into the clitellar region. The sperm is liberated and passes to the ovisacs, either through the coelomic channels or interstitially through specialist \"target tissue\" pathways.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nSome time after copulation, the small, relatively yolkless eggs are laid. In most species, an albumin-filled cocoon is secreted by the clitellum and receives one or more eggs as it passes over the female gonopore. The cocoon is fixed to a submerged object, or in the case of terrestrial leeches, deposited under a stone or buried in damp soil. The cocoon of ''[[Hemibdella soleae]]'' is attached to a suitable fish [[Host (biology)|host]],<ref name=Ruppert/> and that of a branchiobdellid, to the shell of a crayfish on which the young will become ectosymbionts.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gelder, Stuart R. |author2=Gagnon, Nicole L. |author3=Nelson, Kerri |year=2002 |title=Taxonomic Considerations and Distribution of the Branchiobdellida (Annelida: Clitellata) on the North American Continent |journal=Northeastern Naturalist |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=451\u2013468 |jstor=3858556 |doi=10.1656/1092-6194(2002)009[0451:TCADOT]2.0.CO;2 }}</ref> The glossiphoniids brood their eggs, either by attaching the cocoon to the substrate and covering it with their ventral surface, or by securing the cocoon to their ventral surface, and even carrying the newly hatched young to their first meal.<ref name=Rohde>{{cite book|author=Rohde, Klaus |title=Marine Parasitology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktTOf3l66QQC&pg=PT185 |year=2005 |publisher=Csiro Publishing|isbn=978-0-643-09927-2 |page=185}}</ref>\n\nWhen breeding, most marine leeches leave their hosts and become free-living in estuaries. Here they produce their cocoons, after which the adults of most species die. When the eggs hatch, the juveniles seek out potential hosts when these approach the shore.<ref name=Rohde/> Leeches mostly have an annual or biannual life cycle.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n===Feeding and digestion===\n[[File:Blutegelmeyer.jpg|thumb|left|Mouthparts and sucker]]\n\nAbout three quarters of leech species feed on blood extracted from a host while the remainder are predators. Leeches either have a protusible pharynx, commonly called a proboscis, or a non-protusible pharynx which may or may not be armed with jaws.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nIn the proboscisless leeches, the jaws of Arhynchobdellids are at the front of the mouth, and have three blades set at an angle to each other. In feeding these slice their way through the skin of the host, leaving a Y-shaped incision. Behind the blades is the mouth, located ventrally at the anterior end of the body. It leads successively into the [[pharynx]], a short oesophagus, a [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] (in some species), a stomach and a hindgut, which ends at an anus located just above the posterior sucker. The stomach may be a simple tube, but the crop, when present, is an enlarged part of the midgut with a number of pairs of ceca that stores ingested blood. The leech secretes an anticoagulant, [[hirudin]], in its saliva which prevents the blood from clotting before ingestion.<ref name=Ruppert/> A mature [[medicinal leech]] may feed only twice a year, taking months to digest a blood meal.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n[[File:Leach bite site.jpg|thumb|Leech bites on a cow's udder]]\n\nThe bodies of predatory leeches are similar, though instead of jaws many have a protrusible [[proboscis]], which for most of the time they keep retracted into the mouth. Such leeches are often [[ambush predator]]s that lie in wait till they can strike prey with the proboscises in a spear-like fashion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.invertebrate.us/leech/info/leech.pdf |title=All about leeches |author1=Govedich, Fredric R. |author2=Bain, Bonnie A. |date=14 March 2005 |accessdate=19 January 2010}}</ref> Predatory leeches feed on small invertebrates such as snails, earthworms and insect larvae. The prey is usually sucked in and swallowed whole. Some Rhynchobdellida, however, suck the soft tissues from their prey, making them intermediate between predators and blood-suckers.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n[[File:Egel als Schneckenparasit 04.JPG|thumb|left|Leech attacking a slug]]\nWhen they are hungry, leeches use their anterior suckers to connect to hosts for feeding. Once attached, leeches use a combination of mucus and suction to stay in place while they inject hirudin into the hosts' [[Blood|blood stream]]s. In general, sanguivorous leeches are non host-specific, and do little harm to their host, dropping off after consuming a blood meal. Some marine species, however, remain attached until it is time to reproduce. If present in great numbers on a host, these can be debilitating, and in extreme cases, cause death.<ref name=Rohde/>\n\nLeeches are unusual in that they do not produce [[amylase]]s, [[lipase]]s or [[endopeptidase]]s.<ref name=Ruppert/> This lack of endopeptidases means the mechanism of protein digestion cannot follow the same sequence as it would in all other animals in which endopeptidases first split proteins into [[peptide]]s, and the exopeptidases then degrade the peptides.<ref name=\"Sawyer2\">{{cite web |first=Roy T. |last=Sawyer |title=Leech biology and behaviour |url=http://www.biopharm-leeches.com/pdf/bioandbehav.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910161114/http://www.biopharm-leeches.com/pdf/bioandbehav.pdf |archivedate=10 September 2011 }}</ref> However, they do produce intestinal [[exopeptidase]]s which remove amino acids from the long protein molecules one by one,  possibly aided by [[protease]]s from endosymbiotic bacteria in the intestine.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Dzieko\u0144ska-Rynko, Janina |author2=Bielecki, Aleksander |author3=Pali\u0144ska, Katarzyna |year=2009 |title=Activity of selected hydrolytic enzymes from leeches (Clitellata: Hirudinida) with different feeding strategies |journal=Biologia |volume=64 |issue=2 |doi=10.2478/s11756-009-0048-0 }}</ref> This evolutionary choice of exopeptic digestion in Hirudinea distinguishes these carnivorous clitellates from oligochaetes, and may explain why digestion in leeches is so slow.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nDeficiency of [[digestive enzyme]]s and of B complex vitamins is compensated for by enzymes and vitamins produced by [[endosymbiosis|endosymbiotic]] microflora. In ''Hirudo medicinalis'', these supplementary factors are produced by an obligatory [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with two bacterial species, ''Aeromonas veronii'' and a still-uncharacterised [[Rikenellaceae|''Rikenella'']] species. Nonbloodsucking leeches, such as ''Erpobdella punctata'', are host to three bacterial symbionts, ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', ''[[Aeromonas]]'', and ''[[Klebsiella]]'' spp. (a slime producer). The bacteria are passed from parent to offspring in the cocoon as it is formed.<ref name=\"Sawyer2\"/>\n\n[[File:PSM V17 D495 The medicinal leech.jpg|thumb|upright|The leech and its nervous system]]\n\n===Nervous system===\n\nThe nervous system of leeches is formed of a small number of large [[nerve cell]]s; this has resulted in leeches being used as [[model organism]]s for the study of invertebrate nervous systems. The main nerve centre consists of the cerebral [[ganglion]] above the gut and another ganglion beneath it, with connecting nerves forming a ring around the pharynx a little way behind the mouth. A nerve cord runs backwards from this in the ventral coelomic channel, with 21 pairs of [[segmental ganglia|ganglia in segments]] 6 to 26. In segments 27 to 33, other paired ganglia fuse to form the caudal ganglion.<ref name=Ruppert/> Several sensory nerves connect directly to the cerebral ganglion; there are sensory and motor nerve cells connected to the ventral nerve cord ganglia in each segment.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\nLeeches have between two and ten [[Pigment spot ocellus|pigment spot ocelli]], arranged in pairs towards the front of the body. There are also sensory papillae arranged in a lateral row in one annulation of each segment. Each papilla contains many sensory cells. Some rhynchobdellids have the ability to change colour dramatically by moving pigment in [[chromatophore]] cells; this process is under the control of the nervous system but its function is unclear as the change in hue seems unrelated to the colour of the surroundings.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\nLeeches can detect touch, vibration, movement of nearby objects, and chemicals secreted by their hosts; freshwater leeches crawl or swim towards a potential host standing in their pond within a few seconds. Species that feed on warm-blooded hosts move towards warmer objects. Many leeches avoid light, though some blood feeders move towards light when they are ready to feed, presumably increasing the chances of finding a host.<ref name=\"Brusca 2016\"/>\n\n===Gas exchange===\nLeeches live in damp surroundings and in general respire through their body wall. The exception to this is in the Piscicolidae, where branching or leaf-like lateral outgrowths from the body wall form [[gill]]s. Some rhynchobdellid leeches have an extracellular [[haemoglobin]] pigment, but this only provides for about half of the leech's oxygen transportation needs.<ref name=Ruppert/>\n\n[[File:Leech looping locomotion.jpg|thumb|upright|Leech [[Animal locomotion#Peristalsis and looping|moving by looping]] using its front and back suckers]]\n\n==Movement==\n[[File:20100214 Leech climbing door at Lake Leake, Tasmania.ogv|thumb|Leech looping]]\n\nLeeches move using their longitudinal and circular muscles, which other annelids such as earthworms use for [[peristalsis]], with the addition of the use of their posterior and anterior suckers (one on each end of the body) to enable them to [[Animal locomotion#Peristalsis and looping|progress by looping]] or inching along, in the manner of [[geometer moth]] caterpillars. The posterior end is attached to the substrate, and the anterior end is projected forward peristaltically by the circular muscles until it touches down, as far as it can reach, and the anterior end is attached.

In the Greek [[Septuagint]] version of the Bible, and in its Latin translation in the [[Vulgate]], this psalm is '''Psalm 22''' in a slightly different numbering system.

The phrase about \"the valley of the shadow of death\" is often taken as an allusion to the eternal life given by Jesus.\n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]s typically include this Psalm in the prayers of preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] inspired widespread efforts in western Europe to make biblical texts available in vernacular languages. One of the most popular early English versions was the [[Geneva Bible]] (1557). The most widely recognized version of the psalm in English today is undoubtedly the one drawn from the [[King James Bible]] (1611).\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], this psalm is sung as a responsorial in Masses for the dead.\n\nThe psalm is a popular passage for memorization and is often used in sermons.\n\n=== Metrical versions ===\n{{main|Metrical psalter}}\n[[File:Eastman Johnson, The Lord is My Shepherd.jpg|thumbnail|[[Eastman Johnson]]'s 1863 painting ''The Lord is My Shepherd''.]]\n\nAn early metrical version of the psalm in English was made in 1565 by [[Thomas Sternhold]].

Other tunes sometimes used include ''Belmont'', ''Evan'', ''Martyrdom'', ''Orlington'', and ''Wiltshire.''<ref>http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/l/m/lmysheph.htm{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in funerals ===\nIn the twentieth century, Psalm 23 became particularly associated with funeral liturgies in the English-speaking world, and films with funeral scenes often depict a graveside recitation of the psalm.  Official liturgies of English-speaking churches were slow to adopt this practice, though.  The [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Church of England]] has only Psalms [[psalm 39|39]] and [[psalm 90|90]] in its order for the burial of the dead, and in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States, Psalm 23 was not used for funerals until the 1928 revision of the prayer book.\n\n== Shepherd theme ==\n[[File:Corriedale lambs in Tierra del Fuego.JPG|thumb|Psalm 23 is often referred to as the Shepherd's psalm]]\nThe theme of God as a shepherd was common in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia. For example, [[King Hammurabi]], in the conclusion to his famous legal code, wrote: \"I am the shepherd who brings well-being and abundant prosperity; my rule is just.... so that the strong might not oppress the weak, and that even the orphan and the widow might be treated with justice.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165hammurabi.html|title=Hammurabi's Code, circa 1780BC|website=history.hanover.edu|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> This imagery and language was well known to the community that created the Psalm, and was easily imported into its worship. \n\nPsalm 23 portrays God as a good [[shepherd]], feeding (verse 1) and leading (verse 3) his flock. The \"rod and staff\" (verse 4) are also the implements of a shepherd. Some commentators see the shepherd imagery pervading the entire psalm. It is known that the shepherd is to know each sheep by name, thus when God is given the analogy of a shepherd, he is not only a protector but also the caretaker. God, as the caretaker, leads the sheep to green pastures (verse 2) and still waters (verse 2) because he knows that each of his sheep must be personally led to be fed. Thus, without its Shepherd, the sheep would die either by a predator or of starvation, since sheep are known for their helplessness without their shepherd.\n\n[[J. Douglas MacMillan]] argues that verse 5 (\"Thou preparest a table before me\") refers to the \"old oriental shepherding practice\" of using little raised tables to feed sheep.<ref>[[J. Douglas MacMillan]], ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 78.</ref> Similarly, \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" may refer to an ancient form of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|backliner]] \u2013 the oil is poured on wounds, and repels flies. MacMillan also notes that verse 6 (\"Goodness and mercy shall follow me\") reminds him of two loyal [[Herding dog|sheepdogs]] coming behind the flock.<ref> J. Douglas MacMillan, ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 82.</ref>\n\nJohn Ellinwood argues that in verses 4 and 5 King David acknowledges God's protection in expeditions and in battles. \"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies\" refers to the sober raucous dinner before major battles. These were raucous in order to demoralize hostiles camped within earshot, and (only) the king ate from a table. \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" because tomorrow this ceremony might be impossible. After each victory there was no longer a need for sobriety, so \"my cup runneth over.\" The king's lyricist wisely shortened these military verses for balance. Also in Psalm 18 David mentions God's protection in battle.\n\nThe first verse of the Psalm ascribes authorship to [[King David]], said in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] to have been a field shepherd himself as a youth. However, some scholars do not believe that David could have written any of the Psalms.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nTaken together, Psalm 22, 23 and 24, is seen by some as shepherd psalms, where the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep as suffering servant and king.<ref>http://www.plymouthbrethren.org/article/6484</ref>\n\n== Musical settings ==\n\n=== Liturgical and classical ===\n<!-- alphabetical by composer surname -->\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Bach: Cantata No.112 ''[[Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt, BWV 112]]''\n* [[James Leith Macbeth Bain]]: hymn tune ''Brother James' Air''\n* [[Ben Zion Shenker]]: Notable performance by [[Itzhak Perlman]] and Cantor [[Yitzchak Meir Helfgot]] <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExF9-uFmLa8 Itzhak Perlman and Cantor Yitzchak Meir Helfgot perform Ben-Zion Shenker's Mizmor leDavid](YouTube).</ref>\n* [[Lennox Berkeley]]: Op. 91, No. 1 (1975)\n* Bernstein: ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' (Hebrew, in Part 2, together with [[Psalm 2]])\n* Bruckner: [[Psalm 22 (Bruckner)|Psalm 22]] ''Der Herr regieret mich'' WAB 34 ({{circa|1852}})\n* [[Noah Creshevsky]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (2003)\n* [[Paul Creston]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (1945)\n* Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: verses 1\u20134, No. 4 of his ''[[Biblical Songs]]'' (1894)\n* Herbert Howells: ''[[Hymnus Paradisi]]''\n* [[Jessie Seymour Irvine]]: hymn tune ''Crimond''\n* Friedrich Kiel: verse 4 in No. 1 of his [[Six Motets, Op. 82 (Kiel)|Six Motets, Op. 82]]\n* [[Albert Hay Malotte#Songs, sacred and secular (incomplete; published)|Albert Hay Malotte]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9ment Marot]] (in Latin)\n* [[George Rochberg]]<ref>Together with [[Psalm 43]] and [[Psalm 150]] in an a capella setting for mixed chorus written in 1954.

In the Greek [[Septuagint]] version of the Bible, and in its Latin translation in the [[Vulgate]], this psalm is '''Psalm 22''' in a slightly different numbering system.

The writer describes God as his shepherd, in the role of protector and provider. The psalm is read, recited and sung by [[Jews]] and [[Christians]].

The phrase about \"the valley of the shadow of death\" is often taken as an allusion to the eternal life given by Jesus.\n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christian]]s typically include this Psalm in the prayers of preparation for receiving the [[Eucharist]].\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] inspired widespread efforts in western Europe to make biblical texts available in vernacular languages. One of the most popular early English versions was the [[Geneva Bible]] (1557). The most widely recognized version of the psalm in English today is undoubtedly the one drawn from the [[King James Bible]] (1611).\n\nIn the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], this psalm is sung as a responsorial in Masses for the dead.\n\nThe psalm is a popular passage for memorization and is often used in sermons.\n\n=== Metrical versions ===\n{{main|Metrical psalter}}\n[[File:Eastman Johnson, The Lord is My Shepherd.jpg|thumbnail|[[Eastman Johnson]]'s 1863 painting ''The Lord is My Shepherd''.]]\n\nAn early metrical version of the psalm in English was made in 1565 by [[Thomas Sternhold]].

Other tunes sometimes used include ''Belmont'', ''Evan'', ''Martyrdom'', ''Orlington'', and ''Wiltshire.''<ref>http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/l/m/lmysheph.htm{{dead link|date=March 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== Use in funerals ===\nIn the twentieth century, Psalm 23 became particularly associated with funeral liturgies in the English-speaking world, and films with funeral scenes often depict a graveside recitation of the psalm.  Official liturgies of English-speaking churches were slow to adopt this practice, though.  The [[Book of Common Prayer]] of the [[Church of England]] has only Psalms [[psalm 39|39]] and [[psalm 90|90]] in its order for the burial of the dead, and in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] in the United States, Psalm 23 was not used for funerals until the 1928 revision of the prayer book.\n\n== Shepherd theme ==\n[[File:Corriedale lambs in Tierra del Fuego.JPG|thumb|Psalm 23 is often referred to as the Shepherd's psalm]]\nThe theme of God as a shepherd was common in ancient Israel and Mesopotamia. For example, [[King Hammurabi]], in the conclusion to his famous legal code, wrote: \"I am the shepherd who brings well-being and abundant prosperity; my rule is just.... so that the strong might not oppress the weak, and that even the orphan and the widow might be treated with justice.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://history.hanover.edu/courses/excerpts/165hammurabi.html|title=Hammurabi's Code, circa 1780BC|website=history.hanover.edu|access-date=2017-12-12}}</ref> This imagery and language was well known to the community that created the Psalm, and was easily imported into its worship. \n\nPsalm 23 portrays God as a good [[shepherd]], feeding (verse 1) and leading (verse 3) his flock. The \"rod and staff\" (verse 4) are also the implements of a shepherd. Some commentators see the shepherd imagery pervading the entire psalm. It is known that the shepherd is to know each sheep by name, thus when God is given the analogy of a shepherd, he is not only a protector but also the caretaker. God, as the caretaker, leads the sheep to green pastures (verse 2) and still waters (verse 2) because he knows that each of his sheep must be personally led to be fed. Thus, without its Shepherd, the sheep would die either by a predator or of starvation, since sheep are known for their helplessness without their shepherd.\n\n[[J. Douglas MacMillan]] argues that verse 5 (\"Thou preparest a table before me\") refers to the \"old oriental shepherding practice\" of using little raised tables to feed sheep.<ref>[[J. Douglas MacMillan]], ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 78.</ref> Similarly, \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" may refer to an ancient form of [[Glossary of sheep husbandry|backliner]] \u2013 the oil is poured on wounds, and repels flies. MacMillan also notes that verse 6 (\"Goodness and mercy shall follow me\") reminds him of two loyal [[Herding dog|sheepdogs]] coming behind the flock.<ref> J. Douglas MacMillan, ''The Lord of Shepherd''. (Bryntirion: Evangelical Press of Wales, 1988), 82.</ref>\n\nJohn Ellinwood argues that in verses 4 and 5 King David acknowledges God's protection in expeditions and in battles. \"Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies\" refers to the sober raucous dinner before major battles. These were raucous in order to demoralize hostiles camped within earshot, and (only) the king ate from a table. \"Thou anointest my head with oil\" because tomorrow this ceremony might be impossible. After each victory there was no longer a need for sobriety, so \"my cup runneth over.\" The king's lyricist wisely shortened these military verses for balance. Also in Psalm 18 David mentions God's protection in battle. [13].\n\nThe first verse of the Psalm ascribes authorship to [[King David]], said in the [[Hebrew Scriptures]] to have been a field shepherd himself as a youth. However, some scholars do not believe that David could have written any of the Psalms.{{cn|date=June 2018}}\n\nTaken together, Psalm 22, 23 and 24, is seen by some as shepherd psalms, where the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep as suffering servant and king.<ref>http://www.plymouthbrethren.org/article/6484</ref>\n\n== Musical settings ==\n\n=== Liturgical and classical ===\n<!-- alphabetical by composer surname -->\n\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Bach: Cantata No.112 ''[[Der Herr ist mein getreuer Hirt, BWV 112]]''\n* [[James Leith Macbeth Bain]]: hymn tune ''Brother James' Air''\n* [[Ben Zion Shenker]]: Notable performance by [[Itzhak Perlman]] and Cantor [[Yitzchak Meir Helfgot]] <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExF9-uFmLa8 Itzhak Perlman and Cantor Yitzchak Meir Helfgot perform Ben-Zion Shenker's Mizmor leDavid](YouTube).</ref>\n* [[Lennox Berkeley]]: Op. 91, No. 1 (1975)\n* Bernstein: ''[[Chichester Psalms]]'' (Hebrew, in Part 2, together with [[Psalm 2]])\n* Bruckner: [[Psalm 22 (Bruckner)|Psalm 22]] ''Der Herr regieret mich'' WAB 34 ({{circa|1852}})\n* [[Noah Creshevsky]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (2003)\n* [[Paul Creston]]: ''Psalm XXIII'' (1945)\n* Dvo\u0159\u00e1k: verses 1\u20134, No. 4 of his ''[[Biblical Songs]]'' (1894)\n* Herbert Howells: ''[[Hymnus Paradisi]]''\n* [[Jessie Seymour Irvine]]: hymn tune ''Crimond''\n* Friedrich Kiel: verse 4 in No. 1 of his [[Six Motets, Op. 82 (Kiel)|Six Motets, Op. 82]]\n* [[Albert Hay Malotte#Songs, sacred and secular (incomplete; published)|Albert Hay Malotte]]\n* [[Cl\u00e9ment Marot]] (in Latin)\n* [[George Rochberg]]<ref>Together with [[Psalm 43]] and [[Psalm 150]] in an a capella setting for mixed chorus written in 1954.

In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local rule), and [[Permanent Settlement|assumed full sovereignty]] of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the [[British Raj]], Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in [[Bengal]], led to a shift of the capital to [[New Delhi]]. Calcutta was the centre for the [[Indian independence movement]]; it remains a hotbed of [[Politics of West Bengal|contemporary state politics]].

Nawab [[Siraj ud-Daulah]] occupied Calcutta in 1756, and the East India Company retook it the following year. In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat (local rule), and [[Permanent Settlement|assumed full sovereignty]] of the region. Under the company rule, and later under the [[British Raj]], Calcutta served as the capital of British-held territories in India until 1911, when its perceived geographical disadvantages, combined with growing nationalism in [[Bengal]], led to a shift of the capital to [[New Delhi]]. Calcutta was the centre for the [[Indian independence movement]]; it remains a hotbed of [[Politics of West Bengal|contemporary state politics]]. Following Indian independence in 1947, Kolkata, which was once the centre of modern Indian education, science, culture, and politics, suffered several decades of economic stagnation.\n\nAs a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th-century [[Bengal Renaissance]] and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in Bengal and India, Kolkata has local traditions in drama, art, film, theatre, and literature. Many [[List of people from Kolkata|people from Kolkata]]\u2014among them, several Nobel laureates\u2014have contributed to the arts, the sciences, and other areas. [[Kolkata culture]] features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively [[Para (Bengali)|close-knit neighbourhoods]] (''paras'') and [[Adda (South Asian)|freestyle intellectual exchanges]] (''adda''). West Bengal's share of the [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] is based in the city, which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance, such as the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Calcutta|Academy of Fine Arts]], the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]], the [[The Asiatic Society|Asiatic Society]], the [[Indian Museum]] and the [[National Library of India]]. Among professional scientific institutions, Kolkata hosts the [[Agri Horticultural Society of India]], the [[Geological Survey of India]], the [[Botanical Survey of India]], the [[Calcutta Mathematical Society]], the [[Indian Science Congress Association]], the [[Zoological Survey of India]], the [[Institution of Engineers (India)|Institution of Engineers]], the [[Anthropological Survey of India]] and the [[Indian Public Health Association]]. Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises, Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by [[Football in Kolkata|focusing]] on [[association football]] and other sports.\n\n==Etymology==\n{{main|Etymology of Kolkata}}\nThe word ''Kolkata'' derives from ''[[Kalikata|K\u00f4likata]]'' ({{Lang-bn|\u0995\u09b2\u09bf\u0995\u09be\u09a4\u09be}}) [\u02c8k\u0254li\u02cckat\u032aa], the Bengali name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British, in the area where the city was eventually established; the other two villages were [[Sutanuti]] and [[Gobindapur, Kolkata|Govindapur]].<ref name=\"spatialchange\">{{cite book |title= Globalizing cities: a new spatial order?|last=Chakravorty|first=Sanjoy|editor1-last=Marcuse |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Kempen |editor2-first=Ronald van |chapter=From colonial city to global city?

{"title_page": "TCP offload engine", "text_new": "{{Update|inaccurate=y|talksection=Outdated|date=August 2015}}\n'''TCP offload engine''' ('''TOE''') is a technology used in [[network interface card]]s (NIC) to offload processing of the entire [[TCP/IP]] stack to the network controller. It is primarily used with high-speed network interfaces, such as [[gigabit Ethernet]] and [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]], where processing overhead of the network stack becomes significant.\n\nThe term, TOE, is often used to refer to the NIC itself, although circuit board engineers may use it to refer only to the [[integrated circuit]] included on the card which processes the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) headers. TOEs are often suggested<ref>{{cite journal |date=2003-05-18 |author=Jeffrey C.

The TCP software implementations on host systems require extensive computing power. In the early 2000s, full duplex gigabit TCP communication could consume more than 80% of a 2.4&nbsp;GHz [[Pentium 4]] processor (see [[#Freed-up CPU cycles|freed-up CPU cycles]]),{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} resulting in small or no processing resources left for the applications to run on the system.\n\nTCP is a [[Connection-oriented protocol|connection-oriented]] protocol which adds complexity and processing overhead.

This implies that 2 entire cores of a 2.5&nbsp;GHz [[multi-core processor]] will be required to handle the TCP/IP processing associated with 5 Gbit/s of TCP/IP traffic. Since Ethernet (10GE in this example) is bidirectional it is possible to send and receive 10 Gbit/s (for an aggregate throughput of 20 Gbit/s). Using the 1&nbsp;Hz/(bit/s) rule this equates to eight 2.5&nbsp;GHz cores.\n\nMany of the CPU cycles used for TCP/IP processing are \"freed-up\" by TCP/IP offload and may be used by the CPU (usually a [[Server (computing)|server]] CPU) to perform other tasks such as file system processing (in a file server) or indexing (in a backup media server). In other words, a server with TCP/IP offload can do more '''server''' work than a server without TCP/IP offload NICs.\n\n===Reduction of PCI traffic===\nIn addition to the protocol overhead that TOE can address, it can also address some architectural issues that affect a large percentage of host based (server and PC) endpoints.\nMany older end point hosts are [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] bus based, which provides a standard interface for the addition of certain [[peripherals]] such as Network Interfaces to [[Server (computing)|Servers]] and PCs.\nPCI is inefficient for transferring small bursts of data from main memory, across the PCI bus to the network interface ICs, but its efficiency improves as the data burst size increases. Within the TCP protocol, a large number of small packets are created (e.g. acknowledgements) and as these are typically generated on the host CPU and transmitted across the PCI bus and out the network physical interface, this impacts the host computer IO throughput.\n\nA TOE solution, located on the network interface, is located on the other side of the PCI bus from the CPU host so it can address this I/O efficiency issue, as the data to be sent across the TCP connection can be sent to the TOE from the CPU across the PCI bus using large data burst sizes with none of the smaller TCP packets having to traverse the PCI bus.\n\n==History==\nOne of the first patents in this technology, for UDP offload, was issued to [[Auspex Systems]] in early 1990.<ref>\n[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=5355453.PN.&OS=PN/5355453&RS=PN/5355453 United States Patent: 5355453 ''\"Parallel I/O network file server architecture category\"'']</ref> Auspex founder [[Larry Boucher]] and a number of Auspex engineers went on to found [[Alacritech]] in 1997 with the idea of extending the concept of network stack offload to TCP and implementing it in custom silicon.

TCP chimney offload centers on the Alacritech \"Communication Block Passing Patent\". At the same time, Broadcom also obtained a license to build TCP chimney offload chips.\n\n==Types of TCP/IP offload==\n\n===Parallel-stack full offload===\nParallel-stack full offload gets its name from the concept of two parallel TCP/IP Stacks. The first is the main host stack which is included with the host OS. The second or \"parallel stack\" is connected between the [[Internet protocol suite#Application layer|Application Layer]] and the [[Internet protocol suite#Transport layer|Transport Layer (TCP)]] using a \"vampire tap\". The vampire tap intercepts TCP connection requests by applications and is responsible for TCP connection management as well as TCP data transfer. Many of the criticisms in the following section relate to this type of TCP offload.\n\n===HBA full offload===\nHBA (Host Bus Adapter) full offload is found in iSCSI [[host adapter]]s which present themselves as disk controllers to the host system while connecting (via TCP/IP) to an [[iSCSI]] storage device. This type of TCP offload not only offloads TCP/IP processing but it also offloads the iSCSI initiator function. Because the HBA appears to the host as a disk controller, it can only be used with iSCSI devices and is not appropriate for general TCP/IP offload.\n\n===TCP chimney partial offload===\nTCP chimney offload addresses the major security criticism of parallel-stack full offload. In partial offload, the main system stack controls all connections to the host. After a connection has been established between the local host (usually a server) and a foreign host (usually a client) the connection and its state are passed to the TCP offload engine. The heavy lifting of data transmit and receive is handled by the offload device. Almost all TCP offload engines use some type of TCP/IP hardware implementation to perform the data transfer without host CPU intervention. When the connection is closed, the connection state is returned from the offload engine to the main system stack. Maintaining control of TCP connections allows the main system stack to implement and control connection security.\n\n==Support in Linux==\n\nUnlike other kernels,{{Which|date=July 2017}} the Linux kernel does not include support for TOE hardware.<ref>[https://lwn.net/Articles/148697/ \"Linux and TCP offload engines\"],  August 22, 2005, LWN.net</ref> Not to be confused with other similarly named offloads, like [[Large send offload|TCP Segmentation Offload]] which is extensively supported<ref>[https://lwn.net/Articles/150197/ \"Linux and TCP offload engines discussion\"]</ref>. While there are patches from the hardware manufacturers such as [[Chelsio]] or [[Qlogic]] that add support, the Linux kernel developers are opposed to this technology for several reasons, including<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/networking/toe | title = Net:TOE | publisher = Linux Foundation}}.</ref>\n* ''Security'' \u2013 because TOE is implemented in hardware, patches must be applied to the TOE [[firmware]], instead of just software, to address any security vulnerabilities found in a particular TOE implementation. This is further compounded by the newness and vendor-specificity of this hardware, as compared to a well tested TCP/IP stack as is found in an operating system that does not use TOE.\n* ''Limitations'' of hardware \u2013 because connections are buffered and processed on the TOE chip, resource starvation can more easily occur as compared to the generous CPU and memory available to the operating system.\n* ''Complexity'' \u2013 TOE breaks the assumption that kernels make about having access to all resources at all times \u2013 details such as memory used by open connections are not available with TOE. TOE also requires very large changes to a networking stack in order to be supported properly, and even when that is done, features like [[Quality of Service]] and [[packet filtering]] typically do not work.\n* ''Proprietary'' \u2013 TOE is implemented differently by each hardware vendor. This means more code must be rewritten to deal with the various TOE implementations, at a cost of the aforementioned complexity and, possibly, security. Furthermore, TOE firmware cannot be easily modified since it is closed-source.\n* ''Obsolescence'' \u2013 Each TOE NIC has a limited lifetime of usefulness, because system hardware rapidly catches up to TOE performance levels, and eventually exceeds TOE performance levels.\n\n==Suppliers==\nMuch of the current work on TOE technology is by manufacturers of 10 Gigabit Ethernet interface cards, such as [[Broadcom]], [[Chelsio Communications]], [[Emulex]], [[Mellanox Technologies]], [[QLogic]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Large segment offload]] (LSO)\n* [[Large receive offload]] (LRO)\n* [[Scalable Networking Pack]]\n* [[I/O Acceleration Technology]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* Article: [https://web.archive.org/web/20041028124133/http://acmqueue.com/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=154 TCP Offload to the Rescue] by Andy Currid at [http://www.acmqueue.com/ ACM Queue]\n* [http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PG01&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.html&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=%2220040042487%22.PGNR.&OS=DN/20040042487&RS=DN/20040042487 Patent Application 20040042487 ]\n* {{cite conference\n |first= Jeffrey C.\n |last= Mogul\n |title= TCP offload is a dumb idea whose time has come\n |booktitle= Proceedings of HotOS IX: The 9th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems\n |publisher= USENIX Association\n |year=2003\n |url= http://www.usenix.org/events/hotos03/tech/full_papers/mogul/mogul.pdf\n |accessdate= 23 July 2006\n}}\n* {{cite web\n |title= TCP/IP offload Engine (TOE)\n |url= http://line-provider.com/whitepapers/tcpip-offload-engine-toe/\n |publisher= [[10 Gigabit Ethernet Alliance]]\n |date=April 2002\n}}\n\n[[Category:Networking hardware]]\n[[Category:Network acceleration]]\n[[Category:Transmission Control Protocol|Offload Engine]]\n", "text_old": "{{Update|inaccurate=y|talksection=Outdated|date=August 2015}}\n'''TCP offload engine''' ('''TOE''') is a technology used in [[network interface card]]s (NIC) to offload processing of the entire [[TCP/IP]] stack to the network controller.
