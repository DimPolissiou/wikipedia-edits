It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

to Whitehorse's unique urban development objectives and varied topography, neighbourhoods are usually separated from each other by large geographical features. In addition to the city's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] core on the [[Yukon River]]'s west bank, two subdivisions sit at the same elevation as the [[Yukon River]] ({{cvt|640|m||}}). Crossing the bridge to the east bank of the river leads to [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]], one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods. From Riverdale, the road climbing up Grey Mountain leads to Grey Mountain Cemetery and the local FM radio antenna.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBC AM transmitter gets three years' grace|url=http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/cbc-am-transmitter-gets-three-years-grace/|accessdate=2011-03-26|newspaper=[[Whitehorse Star]]|date=14 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Northern Lights (6879315371).jpg|thumb|left|An [[aurora]] over a residential neighbourhood of [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]].

In 1973, the show was moved to the new Bonanza Room at the Whitehorse Travelodge. By 1975, its popularity had grown to such an extent that it became necessary to present two performances per night. In 1975 and again in 1977, the show embarked on cross-Canada tours, on which they performed everywhere from maximum security prisons to the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. Twice the show travelled to Alert, the Canadian Forces Station five hundred miles from the North Pole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1976, the Company undertook to produce not only the Whitehorse show, but the entertainment in Dawson City's Palace Grand Theatre and Diamond Tooth Gertie's Gambling Casino. At the end of the 1980 season they left Dawson City. In January 1981, the show joined the \"Snow Birds\" for a season and moved to St. Petersburg, Florida, for a four-month run. The fall of 1990 saw the Frantic Follies taking to the road again as ambassadors for the Yukon in a whirlwind tour, performing in ten Canadian and American cities in a little over two weeks.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe Frantic Follies was in part replaced by another vaudeville show by the same producer, the Klondike Follies, which hosted two events in the summer of 2017 and 20 shows in the summer of 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/News/curtain-falls-on-performer-s-local-career|title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Curtain falls on performer's local career|work=Whitehorse Daily Star|access-date=2018-11-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nPlays are also performed at the Guild Hall in Porter Creek, and downtown Whitehorse's Wood Street Centre offers smaller local productions.

They will lend assistance to crews in B.C., Alberta, and the other territories as needed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Energy grid===\n[[Yukon Energy]] operates four conventional hydroelectric generating stations: Whitehorse Dam (40 MW), Aishihik Lake (37 MW), Mayo A (5 MW), and Mayo B (10 MW), which provide the bulk of generation for the Yukon Energy grid. An additional 39 MW of diesel generation is maintained for supplemental back-up.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Facilities|url=http://www.yukonenergy.ca/energy/facilities/|publisher=Yukon Energy|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Yukon Energy operates two wind turbines near Whitehorse, which are connected to the Whitehorse-Aishihik-Faro grid. The first turbine is a Bonus Energy 150&nbsp;kW MARK III installed in 1993 that is no longer functional. The second turbine, a [[Vestas]] 660&nbsp;kW V47 LT II was later installed in 2000 and operates only in the summer. These units need to be specially adapted to deal with icing and the northern environment.<ref>[http://www.yukonenergy.ca/ Yukon Energy]. Yukonenergy.ca.

During WWI beds increased to 30, 10 beds were added in 1943, then 20 beds in 1949, and an operating wing was added in 1951. In 1959 the hospital was rebuilt on the other bank of the Yukon River, across from its previous location, but decision making was still based in Ottawa (National Health and Welfare, Medical Services Branch).<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.whitehorsehospital.ca/wghabout/history/|work=About Us|publisher=Yukon Hospital Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> The downtown area has several private medical, dental, and optometry clinics.\n\nIn 1990, the Yukon Hospital Corporation (YHC) was created in order to prepare the transfer of powers regarding the hospital from the Federal Government to the Yukon Territorial Government. In April 1993 management of WGH was officially transferred to the YHC following a collaboration with the Yukon government and Council of Yukon First Nations (CYFN, then CYI). Construction of the present building lasted from 1994 through 1997. Today Whitehorse General hospital counts 49 in-patient beds, 10 day-surgery beds, an ER department, OR suites and several medical imaging technologies.\n\n===Transportation===\n====Air====\nWhitehorse is served by the [[Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport]] and has scheduled service to [[Vancouver]], [[Kelowna]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Yellowknife]], [[Ottawa]] (via [[Yellowknife]]), [[Dawson City]], [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]], [[Inuvik]], as well as  [[Frankfurt]], Germany during the summer months. The airport was developed as part of the Northwest Staging Route in 1941\u201342 and has two long paved runways. A wartime-era hangar served as terminal building from about 1960, and was replaced in December 1985 with a modern terminal. [[Air North]], a scheduled passenger and cargo airline operating [[Boeing 737]] jetliners and [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] turboprops, is based in Whitehorse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air North, Yukon's Airline |url=https://www.flyairnorth.com/default.aspx |website=www.flyairnorth.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 work was completed on a {{convert|340|m|abbr=on}} runway extension and other improvements (concrete turn button, installation of storm and sanitary mains, lighting upgrades, tower access road and blast pad).<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitehorse International Airport Runway Extension|url=http://www.yes-group.ca/index.php/Transportation/view_project/airport_runway_extension/|publisher=YES Group|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> Expansion of the terminal itself was completed in 2010.\n[[File:Alaska Highway Bridge.jpg|thumb|Bridge of the [[Alaska Highway]] crossing over the [[Teslin River]] at [[Johnsons Crossing]].]]\n\n====Roads====\nSurface access to Whitehorse is provided by a network of highways, including the international [[Alaska Highway]] connecting the Yukon with Alaska, British Columbia, and [[Alberta]] highway networks.\n\nWhitehorse has been described as \"pearls on a string\", with its residential, industrial, and service subdivisions located along the main thoroughfares that carry traffic within city limits, with large gaps of undeveloped (often hilly) land between them. The [[Alaska Highway]] is the primary roadway, with branch roads reaching additional subdivisions. One such branch road, signed as \"Highway 1A\" and following Two Mile Hill Road, 4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and Robert Service Way, is the main access to downtown, Riverdale, and the Marwell Industrial Area. Other branch roads (Range Road, Hamilton Boulevard, Mayo Road) access smaller residential areas and recreational facilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe city [[Arterial roads in Whitehorse, Yukon|road]] network is adequate, although it is congested during rush hours and discussions occasionally occur as to how it might better be managed, such as designating one-way streets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Public transit====\n[[File:Trolley with flags (7041438277).jpg|thumb|The [[Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley]] was a [[heritage streetcar]] service that operated from 2000 to 2018.]]\n[[Whitehorse Transit]] provides bus service on weekdays from morning until early evening and Saturdays during business hours.\n\n{{main|Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley}}\nThere was a waterfront tram, known as [[Whitehorse trolley|the \"trolley\"]], which provided transport along a short rail section along the Yukon River; it was chiefly tourist-oriented and is not integrated into the municipal transit system. It runs from the Rotary Peace Park, located on the south end of the city centre, up to the north end of the city centre at Spook Creek Station. Whitehorse presently has no active railway service. The trolley system runs on a small portion of the tracks formerly belonging to [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\nThe last scheduled service to Whitehorse from White Pass Railway occurred in October 1982. The White Pass Railway started scheduled service from [[Skagway, Alaska]] to [[Carcross, Yukon|Carcross]], {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} south of Whitehorse, in the spring of 2007, but this was disrupted by high lake water levels in August 2007. Speculation of a transcontinental rail link to Alaska includes one possible route option through Whitehorse; a report has recommended a hub at [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]], with a spur line to Whitehorse and on to the Inside Passage of Alaska.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Water====\nThe Yukon River is essentially navigable from Whitehorse to the [[Bering Sea]]. At {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the river at Whitehorse is the [[Extreme points of Earth#Highest attainable by transportation|highest point on earth]] that can be reached by watercraft navigating from the sea. Currently, no passenger or freight services use the river at Whitehorse.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Other services===\nWater disposal is mostly done by draining in a septic tank where the sewage is not that well developed. Waste is disposed mostly in areas requiring reclamation.

It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900.

Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

The [[White Horse Rapids|rapids]] which were the namesake of the city have disappeared under [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]] and [[Schwatka Lake]], formed by the construction of a hydroelectricity dam in 1958. Whitehorse is currently the [[List of the 100 largest cities and towns in Canada by area|64th]] largest city in Canada by area.

According to [[Meteorological Service of Canada]], Whitehorse has the distinction of being Canada's driest city, mainly because it lies in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Coast Mountains]]. Whitehorse is in the Cordilleran climate region, the Complex Soils of Mountain Areas soil region, the Cordilleran vegetation region, and the Boreal Cordillera ecozone.\n\nIn 2019, Whitehorse recorded

He loved science and mathematics, collected ore and rock specimens, and as a teenager he built a large chemistry laboratory in the cellar.  He made a radio transmitter at a time when kits were rarely available and qualified as a [[Amateur radio|radio ham]].  He was an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], specializing in [[cryptanalysis]], as well as an outdoorsman, hiking and fly fishing throughout much of his life.  He married Florence Elizabeth Kreager on June 17, 1926 and had two daughters (Suzanne Kay and Elizabeth Ina).\n\nAt 16, he enrolled in the [[University of Denver]] to study [[chemistry]]. His interest in astronomy was aroused through a boyhood friend (Edgar Kettering), through observing the [[solar eclipse of June 8, 1918]], and through observing the eruption of Nova Aquilae 1918 ([[V603 Aquilae]]). He graduated from the University of Denver in 1920 with a degree in chemistry and a master's degree in chemistry and mathematics in 1921. He also found summer positions in 1922, 1923, and 1924 as research assistant to [[Harlow Shapley]] at the [[Harvard College Observatory]]. At [[Princeton University]] he acquired a second master's degree in astronomy in 1923, and in 1924 a Ph.D. in astrophysics for which his advisor was [[Henry Norris Russell]], who inspired his interest in theoretical astronomy. After teaching two years at the [[University of Iowa]] and [[Ohio State University]], in 1926 he was appointed assistant Professor at [[Lick Observatory]] in San Jose CA, where he worked for several years.  In 1932 he moved to [[Harvard University|Harvard]].  During [[World War II]] Menzel was asked to join the [[United States Navy|Navy]] as [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant commander]], to head a division of intelligence, where he used his many-sided talents, including deciphering enemy codes. Even until 1955, he worked with the Navy improving radio-wave propagation by tracking the Sun's emissions and studying the effect of the aurora on radio propagation for the Department of Defense (Menzel & Boyd, p.&nbsp;60<ref name=\"WorldOfFlyingSaucers\">\n{{cite book\n |last1=Menzel |first1=D.

Returning to Harvard after the war, he was appointed acting director of the [[Harvard Observatory]] in 1952, and was the full director from 1954 to 1966.

From 1946-1948 he was the Vice President of the [[American Astronomical Society]], becoming their President from 1954-1956. In 1965, Menzel was given the John Evans Award of the University of Denver. In May 2001, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics hosted \"Donald H. Menzel: Scientist, Educator, Builder,\" a symposium in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Donald H. Menzel.\n\nMenzel travelled with several expeditions to view [[solar eclipse]]s to obtain scientific data. On 19 June 1936, he led the Harvard-MIT expedition to the steppes of Russia (at Ak Bulak in southwestern Siberia) to observe a total eclipse. For the 9 July 1945 eclipse, he directed the Joint U.S.-Canadian expedition to Saskatchewan, although they were clouded out. Menzel observed many total solar eclipses, often leading the expeditions, including [[Catalina, California]] (10 September 1923, cloudy), [[Camptonville, California]] (28 April 1930), [[Fryeburg, Maine]] (31 August 1932), [[Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota]] (30 June 1954), the Atlantic coast of [[Massachusetts]] (2 October 1959), northern [[Italy]] (15 February 1951), [[Orono, Maine]] (20 July 1963, cloudy), [[Athens]]/Sunion Road, [[Greece]] (20 May 1966), [[Arequipa, Peru]] (12 November 1966), [[Miahuatl\u00e1n District|Miahuatlan]], south of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca, Mexico]] (7 March 1970), [[Prince Edward Island]] [[Canada]] (10 July 1972), and western [[Mauritania]] (30 June 1973), in addition to the other three mentioned above.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Pasachoff |first1=J.

Menzel initially performed solar research, but later concentrated on studying gaseous [[nebula]]e. His work with [[Lawrence Aller]] and [[James Gilbert Baker]] defined many of the fundamental principles of the study of [[planetary nebula]]e.

He loved science and mathematics, collected ore and rock specimens, and as a teenager he built a large chemistry laboratory in the cellar.  He made a radio transmitter at a time when kits were rarely available and qualified as a [[Amateur radio|radio ham]].  He was an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], specializing in [[cryptanalysis]], as well as an outdoorsman, hiking and fly fishing throughout much of his life.  He married Florence Elizabeth Kreager on June 17, 1926 and had two daughters (Suzanne Kay and Elizabeth Ina).\n\nAt 16, he enrolled in the [[University of Denver]] to study [[chemistry]]. His interest in astronomy was aroused through a boyhood friend (Edgar Kettering), through observing the [[solar eclipse of June 8, 1918]], and through observing the eruption of Nova Aquilae 1918 ([[V603 Aquilae]]). He graduated from the University of Denver in 1920 with a degree in chemistry and a master's degree in chemistry and mathematics in 1921. He also found summer positions in 1922, 1923, and 1924 as research assistant to [[Harlow Shapley]] at the [[Harvard College Observatory]]. At [[Princeton University]] he acquired a second master's degree in astronomy in 1923, and in 1924 a Ph.D. in astrophysics for which his advisor was [[Henry Norris Russell]], who inspired his interest in theoretical astronomy. After teaching two years at the [[University of Iowa]] and [[Ohio State University]], in 1926 he was appointed assistant Professor at [[Lick Observatory]] in San Jose CA, where he worked for several years.  In 1932 he moved to [[Harvard University|Harvard]].  During [[World War II]] Menzel was asked to join the [[United States Navy|Navy]] as [[Lieutenant commander (United States)|Lieutenant commander]], to head a division of intelligence, where he used his many-sided talents, including deciphering enemy codes. Even until 1955, he worked with the Navy improving radio-wave propagation by tracking the Sun's emissions and studying the effect of the aurora on radio propagation for the Department of Defense (Menzel & Boyd, p.&nbsp;60<ref name=\"WorldOfFlyingSaucers\">\n{{cite book\n |last1=Menzel |first1=D.

Returning to Harvard after the war, he was appointed acting director of the [[Harvard Observatory]] in 1952, and was the full director from 1954 to 1966. The term \"Menzel Gap\" was used to refer to the absence of [[Photographic plate#Astronomy|astronomical photographic plates]] during a brief period in the 1950s when plate-making operations were temporarily halted by Menzel as a cost-cutting measure.<ref>\n{{Cite news\n |last=Johnson |first=G.\n |date=July 10, 2007\n |title=A Trip Back in Time and Space\n |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/10/science/10astro.html?pagewanted=all\n |work=[[The New York Times]]\n |accessdate=2012-04-21\n}}</ref> He retired from Harvard in 1971. From 1964 to his death, Menzel was a [[U.S. State Department]] consultant for [[Latin America]]n affairs.\n\nHe received honorary A.M. and Sc.D. degrees from Harvard University in 1942 and the University of Denver in 1954 respectively. From 1946-1948 he was the Vice President of the [[American Astronomical Society]], becoming their President from 1954-1956. In 1965, Menzel was given the John Evans Award of the University of Denver. In May 2001, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics hosted \"Donald H. Menzel: Scientist, Educator, Builder,\" a symposium in honor of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Donald H. Menzel.\n\nMenzel travelled with several expeditions to view [[solar eclipse]]s to obtain scientific data. On 19 June 1936, he led the Harvard-MIT expedition to the steppes of Russia (at Ak Bulak in southwestern Siberia) to observe a total eclipse. For the 9 July 1945 eclipse, he directed the Joint U.S.-Canadian expedition to Saskatchewan, although they were clouded out. Menzel observed many total solar eclipses, often leading the expeditions, including [[Catalina, California]] (10 September 1923, cloudy), [[Camptonville, California]] (28 April 1930), [[Fryeburg, Maine]] (31 August 1932), [[Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota]] (30 June 1954), the Atlantic coast of [[Massachusetts]] (2 October 1959), northern [[Italy]] (15 February 1951), [[Orono, Maine]] (20 July 1963, cloudy), [[Athens]]/Sunion Road, [[Greece]] (20 May 1966), [[Arequipa, Peru]] (12 November 1966), [[Miahuatl\u00e1n District|Miahuatlan]], south of [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca, Mexico]] (7 March 1970), [[Prince Edward Island]] [[Canada]] (10 July 1972), and western [[Mauritania]] (30 June 1973), in addition to the other three mentioned above.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |last1=Pasachoff |first1=J.

Menzel initially performed solar research, but later concentrated on studying gaseous [[nebula]]e. His work with [[Lawrence Aller]] and [[James Gilbert Baker]] defined many of the fundamental principles of the study of [[planetary nebula]]e.

He has had the rank of [[archbishop]] since 2002. At his retirement in 2012 he was the papal [[nuncio]] to [[Egypt]] and [[Apostolic Delegation to the Arab League|delegate to the Arab League]]. He headed the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] from 2002 to 2006.\n\nFitzgerald is one of the leading experts on [[Islam]], Christian-Muslim relations and interreligious dialogue in the senior hierarchy of the Catholic Church. His publications include ''Dieu r\u00eave d'unit\u00e9. Les catholiques et les religions: les le\u00e7ons du dialogue. Entretiens avec [[Annie Laurent]]'' (Paris, Bayard Presse, 2005) and (with John Borelli) ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', (SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006), both translated into Italian. He is fluent in Arabic.\n\nPope Francis raised him to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] on 5 October 2019.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMichael L. Fitzgerald was born in [[Walsall]], United Kingdom, on 17 August 1937, into a [[Catholic]] family of [[Irish descent]], and attended [[Queen Mary's Grammar School]]. Desiring from an early age to become a priest and a [[missionary]], he joined the junior seminary of the Missionaries of Africa ([[White Fathers]]) at the age of twelve, first in [[Scotland]], then in the [[South of England]]. He studied philosophy for two years, the first in England and the second in Ireland. He made his novitiate in the [[Netherlands]] from 1956 to 1957 and pursued his theological studies from 1957 to 1961 in [[Tunisia]], where he began learning [[Arabic]] and acquiring some knowledge of [[Islam]]. Cardinal [[William Godfrey]], [[Archbishop of Westminster]], ordained him a priest of the Society of Missionaries of Africa ([[White Fathers]]) on 3 February 1961.<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nUpon [[ordination]] in 1961 he was sent to Rome to study [[Dogmatic Theology]] at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. Among his teachers was [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Bernard Lonergan]]. This was the time of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965) which provided the opportunity of attending lectures by theologians such as [[Karl Rahner]] and [[Yves Congar]]. He completed his doctorate in Theology in 1965 on the missionary intention in the writings of the [[List of early Christian writers|Latin apologists]].\n\n==Scholar, teacher, and pastor==\nIn 1965 he started a BA in Arabic at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS), [[University of London]], graduating in 1968, whereupon he became a lecturer at the IPEA (Institut Pontifical d'\u00c9tudes Arabes), later renamed the [[Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies]] (PISAI).<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nAfter one year lecturing at the PISAI, he was appointed lecturer in the Department of Religious Studies at the [[Makerere University|University of Makerere]], Kampala, [[Uganda]], where he taught courses on [[Islam]] to Muslim as well as to Christian students. In 1971 he returned to Rome to pursue his teaching and scholarly interests at the PISAI. From 1972 to 1978 he was Director of the PISAI. During this period Fitzgerald was involved in the creation of ''Encounter, Documents for Christian-Muslim Understanding'', a periodical publication on [[Islam]], and supervised the launch of ''Islamochristiana'', a scholarly journal specialised in Christian-Muslim relations and interreligious dialogue. In 1972 he became consultor of the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]], then known as [[Secretariat for Non-Christians]].\n\nIn 1978 he returned to Africa to carry out parish work in the [[Sudan]], in the town of [[New Halfa]] (Archdiocese of Khartoum). His duties included ministering to the Christian population while also cooperating with the Muslim community. In 1980 he was elected to the General Council of the [[Missionaries of Africa]] in Rome, where he spent six years managing and organising.<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 4\u20138.</ref>\n\n==Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue==\nIn 1987 he was appointed Secretary of the Secretariat for Non-Christians, which was renamed the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] (PCID) in 1988. In that capacity Fitzgerald helped draft ''[[Dialogue and Proclamation]]'', one of the Catholic Church's documents concerning the relationship between dialogue and evangelisation. On 16 December 1991, Fitzgerald was appointed titular bishop of [[Nafta, Tunisia|Nepte]]. He was consecrated at Saint Peter's Basilica by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 6 January 1992.<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue.

He has had the rank of [[archbishop]] since 2002. At his retirement in 2012 he was the papal [[nuncio]] to [[Egypt]] and [[Apostolic Delegation to the Arab League|delegate to the Arab League]]. He headed the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] from 2002 to 2006.\n\nFitzgerald is one of the leading experts on [[Islam]], Christian-Muslim relations and interreligious dialogue in the senior hierarchy of the Catholic Church. His publications include ''Dieu r\u00eave d'unit\u00e9. Les catholiques et les religions: les le\u00e7ons du dialogue. Entretiens avec Annie Laurent'' (Paris, Bayard Presse, 2005) and (with John Borelli) ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', (SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006), both translated into Italian. He is fluent in Arabic.\n\nPope Francis raised him to the rank of [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|cardinal]] on 5 October 2019.\n\n==Early life and education==\nMichael L. Fitzgerald was born in [[Walsall]], United Kingdom, on 17 August 1937, into a [[Catholic]] family of [[Irish descent]], and attended [[Queen Mary's Grammar School]]. Desiring from an early age to become a priest and a [[missionary]], he joined the junior seminary of the Missionaries of Africa ([[White Fathers]]) at the age of twelve, first in [[Scotland]], then in the [[South of England]]. He studied philosophy for two years, the first in England and the second in Ireland. He made his novitiate in the [[Netherlands]] from 1956 to 1957 and pursued his theological studies from 1957 to 1961 in [[Tunisia]], where he began learning [[Arabic]] and acquiring some knowledge of [[Islam]]. Cardinal [[William Godfrey]], [[Archbishop of Westminster]], ordained him a priest of the Society of Missionaries of Africa ([[White Fathers]]) on 3 February 1961.<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 1\u20132.</ref>\n\nUpon [[ordination]] in 1961 he was sent to Rome to study [[Dogmatic Theology]] at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. Among his teachers was [[Jesuit]] theologian [[Bernard Lonergan]]. This was the time of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962\u20131965) which provided the opportunity of attending lectures by theologians such as [[Karl Rahner]] and [[Yves Congar]]. He completed his doctorate in Theology in 1965 on the missionary intention in the writings of the [[List of early Christian writers|Latin apologists]].\n\n==Scholar, teacher, and pastor==\nIn 1965 he started a BA in Arabic at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] (SOAS), [[University of London]], graduating in 1968, whereupon he became a lecturer at the IPEA (Institut Pontifical d'\u00c9tudes Arabes), later renamed the [[Pontifical Institute of Arab and Islamic Studies]] (PISAI).<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 3\u20134.</ref>\n\nAfter one year lecturing at the PISAI, he was appointed lecturer in the Department of Religious Studies at the [[Makerere University|University of Makerere]], Kampala, [[Uganda]], where he taught courses on [[Islam]] to Muslim as well as to Christian students. In 1971 he returned to Rome to pursue his teaching and scholarly interests at the PISAI. From 1972 to 1978 he was Director of the PISAI. During this period Fitzgerald was involved in the creation of ''Encounter, Documents for Christian-Muslim Understanding'', a periodical publication on [[Islam]], and supervised the launch of ''Islamochristiana'', a scholarly journal specialised in Christian-Muslim relations and interreligious dialogue. In 1972 he became consultor of the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]], then known as [[Secretariat for Non-Christians]].\n\nIn 1978 he returned to Africa to carry out parish work in the [[Sudan]], in the town of [[New Halfa]] (Archdiocese of Khartoum). His duties included ministering to the Christian population while also cooperating with the Muslim community. In 1980 he was elected to the General Council of the [[Missionaries of Africa]] in Rome, where he spent six years managing and organising.<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue. A Catholic View'', SPCK, London & Orbis Books, Maryknoll, NY, 2006, pp. 4\u20138.</ref>\n\n==Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue==\nIn 1987 he was appointed Secretary of the Secretariat for Non-Christians, which was renamed the [[Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue]] (PCID) in 1988. In that capacity Fitzgerald helped draft ''[[Dialogue and Proclamation]]'', one of the Catholic Church's documents concerning the relationship between dialogue and evangelisation. On 16 December 1991, Fitzgerald was appointed titular bishop of [[Nafta, Tunisia|Nepte]]. He was consecrated at Saint Peter's Basilica by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 6 January 1992.<ref>Fitzgerald, Michael, and Borelli, John, ''Interfaith Dialogue.
