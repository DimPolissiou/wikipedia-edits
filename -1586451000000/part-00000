In 1977, Wolff published ''Understanding Rawls: A Critique and Reconstruction of A Theory of Justice,'' which takes aim at the extent to which Rawls's theory is cued to existing practice, [[Convention (norm)|convention]] and [[status quo]] social science.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Worland|first=Stephen T.|date=1978|title=Review of Understanding Rawls: A Reconstruction and Critique of \"A Theory of Justice\"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|volume=12|issue=1|pages=207\u2013210|issn=0021-3624|jstor=4224674|doi=10.1080/00213624.1978.11503514}}</ref> Insofar as ''A Theory of Justice'' forecloses critiques of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Social relation|social relations]], [[private property]] and the [[market economy]], Wolff concluded that Rawls's project amounted to a form of apology for the status quo, as according to Wolff, markets and capitalist social relations are founded on exploitation and injustice, and Rawls did not give arguments to defend his theory from these charges.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn ''The Poverty of Liberalism'', Wolff pointed out the inconsistencies rife in twentieth century [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Doctrine|doctrines]].

In 1977, Wolff published ''Understanding Rawls: A Critique and Reconstruction of A Theory of Justice,'' which takes aim at the extent to which Rawls's theory is cued to existing practice, [[Convention (norm)|convention]] and [[status quo]] social science.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Worland|first=Stephen T.|date=1978|title=Review of Understanding Rawls: A Reconstruction and Critique of \"A Theory of Justice\"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|volume=12|issue=1|pages=207\u2013210|issn=0021-3624|jstor=4224674|doi=10.1080/00213624.1978.11503514}}</ref> Insofar as ''A Theory of Justice'' forecloses critiques of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[Social relation|social relations]], [[private property]] and the [[market economy]], Wolff concluded that Rawls's project amounted to a form of apology for the status quo, as according to Wolff, markets and capitalist social relations are founded on exploitation and injustice, and Rawls did not give arguments to defend his theory from these charges.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn ''The Poverty of Liberalism'', Wolff pointed out the inconsistencies rife in twentieth century [[Liberalism|liberal]] and [[Conservatism|conservative]] [[Doctrine|doctrines]]. In this text, Wolff takes [[John Stuart Mill|John Stuart Mill's]] seminal works, ''[[On Liberty]]'' and ''[[Principles of Political Economy]]'' as starting points.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWolff's 1970 book ''[[In Defense of Anarchism]]'' is widely read, and the first two editions sold more than 200,000 copies.

His textbook ''About Philosophy'' is used widely in introductory college philosophy courses.\n\nWolff is also distinguished as a white man who transitioned from the philosophy department to the department of [[African-American studies|Afro-American studies]] of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts-Amherst]], which is chronicled and discussed in his book ''Autobiography of an Ex-White Man: Learning a New Master Narrative for America''.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Autobiography of an Ex-White Man|last=Wolff|first=Robert Paul|publisher=Boydell & Brewer|year=2005|isbn=978-1580461801|location=United States of America|pages=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Wolff founded University Scholarships for South African Students, an organization devoted to promoting opportunities in higher education within [[South Africa]] for disadvantaged South African students.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://culturesofresistance.org/groups-we-support-USSAS|title=University Scholarships for South African Students (USSAS) {{!}} Cultures of Resistance|website=culturesofresistance.org|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> Since its creation, USSAS has assisted in providing funding and educational opportunities for thousands of students in South Africa.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nWolff was born on December 27, 1933 in New York City, and is the son of Walter Harold and Charlotte (Ornstein) Wolff.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.pearson.ch/HigherEducation/Pearson/EAN/9780205194124/About-Philosophy|title=About Philosophy - Robert Paul Wolff - 9780205194124 - Philosophy - Introduction to Philosophy (94)|website=www.pearson.ch|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> He is married to his childhood sweetheart, Susan Gould, and lives in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].<ref name=\":5\" /> He has two sons by his first wife, Professor Emerita Cynthia Griffin Wolff: Patrick Gideon Wolff, a famous international [[Grandmaster (chess)|Chess Grandmaster]], and Tobias Barrington Wolff, a leading [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] legal activist and Jefferson Barnes Fordham Professor of Law at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nWolff is married and currently splits his time between [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]] and [[Paris|Paris, France]].<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=http://seniorscholars.columbia.edu/scholars/robert_paul_wolff/|title=Society of Senior Scholars {{!}} Columbia University {{!}} The Scholars {{!}} Robert Paul Wolff|website=seniorscholars.columbia.edu|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> He maintains a blog, ''The Philosopher's Stone'', in which he discusses both philosophy and political issues.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com/|title=The Philosopher's Stone|website=robertpaulwolff.blogspot.com|access-date=2019-09-27}}</ref> He used this blog to publish an online autobiography in a series of posts, which is archived online.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Selected bibliography==\n* ''Kant's Theory of Mental Activity'' (1963)<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=K\u00f6rner |first1=S. |title=Review of Kant's Theory of Mental Activity: A Commentary on the Transcendental Analytic of the Critique of Pure Reason |journal=[[The Philosophical Review]] |volume=73 |issue=4 |pages=547\u2013549 |date=1964 |doi=10.2307/2183310 |issn=0031-8108 |jstor=2183310 }}</ref>\n* ''[[A Critique of Pure Tolerance]]'' with [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Barrington Moore Jr.]] (1965)<ref>\n* {{Cite journal |last1=R., Jr. |first1=J.
