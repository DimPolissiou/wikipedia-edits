Cam'ron responded with \"Curtis\" and \"Curtis Pt. II\", in which he makes fun of 50 Cent's appearance, calling him \"a gorilla, with rabbit teeth\". 50 Cent responded by releasing \"[[Hold On (Young Buck song)|Hold On]]\" with [[Young Buck]]. Since 2009, the feud slowly died down, and they eventually reconciled in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BI50XSmAoci/|title=50 Cent on Instagram: \"I said Cam I would talk to you like you ain't got money, if I didn't see them big ass knot's in ya pockets.\"|website=Instagram|access-date=May 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Jim Jones===\nCam'ron revealed in 2007 that he was no longer speaking to his fellow Diplomat members Juelz Santana and Jim Jones, leading to speculation that the group had officially broken up. However, despite admitting that he did not want to contact Jim Jones, he said that he had no hard feelings towards him. In an interview with Miss Info, Cam'ron said: \"I still haven't spoken to Jim. But Jim ran with me for over 10 years, he worked hard, and I wish him the best of luck. Everybody thinks I'm mad at Jim. Why am I mad? I told people for years that Jimmy was gonna be a star.

In late 2011, both appeared together on [[Wolfgang Gartner]]'s album [[Weekend in America]], on the track \"Circus Freaks\".\n\n===Stop Snitchin'===\nOn April 22, 2007, Cam'ron was interviewed on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' as part of a piece on the [[Stop Snitchin']] movement.<ref name=\"60min\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/19/60minutes/main2704565.shtml |title=Stop Snitchin' - 60 Minutes |publisher=CBS News |date=2007-08-12 |accessdate=2011-02-27}}</ref> He also stated that he would \"not help the police\" try to locate the shooter saying he is \"not a snitch\" and helping the police would probably hurt his record sales. He stated in the interview, \"Because with the type of business I'm in, it would definitely hurt my business. And the way that I was raised, I just don't do that. I was raised differently, not to tell... It's about business but it's still also a code of ethics\" When asked by [[Anderson Cooper]] if he would tell the police if a [[serial killer]] was living next to him, Cam'ron replied \"I would probably move\" but would not inform the police.\n\nCam'ron later issued an apology for his comments, calling them an \"error in judgement\":<ref name=\"60min\" /> \"Where I come from, once word gets out that you've cooperated with the police that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence. That is a dark reality in so many neighborhoods like mine across America. I'm not saying its right, but its reality. And it's not unfounded. There's a harsh reality around violence and criminal justice in our inner cities.\"  Cam'ron has had contact with the police in the past. According to [[The Smoking Gun]], New York Police Department records indicate that Giles filed a report with police after he was assaulted at a park in Harlem in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0419072giles1.html|title=Rapper's Change Of Face|work=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Kanye West===\nBoth Cam'ron and Jim Jones took out their frustrations on former label-mate Kanye West in defense of former CEO Dame Dash (due to their longtime friendship dating back to growing up in Harlem)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/06/03/camron-fact-interview-diplomats-a-trak-drugs/|title=\"I didn't grow up in a musical family, I grew up in a drug family\": Cam'ron talks Paid in Full, A-Trak and the cult of Dipset - FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|work=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|accessdate=11 March 2015}}</ref> by releasing a song titled \"Toast\" rhyming over Kanye West's song \"[[Runaway (Kanye West song)|Runaway]]\". The feud eventually ended, evidenced by Cam'ron, Jim Jones, and Kanye West collaborating on a song called \"[[G.O.O.D.

While stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of New York and New Jersey Avenue shortly after midnight, a passenger of a nearby car threatened Cam'ron to \"give up\" his 2006 [[Lamborghini]]. Cam'ron resisted, and the man then shot him. Cam'ron was struck at least once as he was holding the steering wheel, but he was able to drive, going the wrong way on streets and flashing his lights, until a fan drove him to Howard University Hospital. The gunman and passenger drove off, crashed into a parked car, and fled the scene. D.C. Metro Police recovered a cell phone from the scene of the crash, which they tried to use to trace the suspects. He stated that he does not know who shot him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/23/AR2005102301334.html|title=Rapper Shot in Alleged Carjacking in D.C.|publisher=|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Cam'ron discography}}\n{{See also|The Diplomats discography}}\n\n;Studio albums \n* ''[[Confessions of Fire]]'' (1998)\n* ''[[S.D.E.

In 2006 Cam'ron released his fifth studio album, ''[[Killa Season]]'', which contained a [[Killa Season (film)|film of the same name]], in which Cam'ron made his director-screenwriter debut and starred as the main character.

Instead, he enrolled in a college in Texas, without even graduating from high school, but soon dropped out and returned to Harlem where he began selling drugs before starting his rap career. Giles was eventually introduced to [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] through his childhood friend Mase.

His debut album, ''Confessions of Fire'', was released a year later in July 1998 and included singles such as \"3-5-7\" (which was also featured in the movie [[Woo (film)|Woo]]), and \"Horse and Carriage\" featuring Mase, which reached the R&B Top Ten.

He stated in the interview, \"Because with the type of business I'm in, it would definitely hurt my business. And the way that I was raised, I just don't do that. I was raised differently, not to tell... It's about business but it's still also a code of ethics\" When asked by [[Anderson Cooper]] if he would tell the police if a [[serial killer]] was living next to him, Cam'ron replied \"I would probably move\" but would not inform the police.\n\nCam'ron later issued an apology for his comments, calling them an \"error in judgement\":<ref name=\"60min\" /> \"Where I come from, once word gets out that you've cooperated with the police that only makes you a bigger target of criminal violence. That is a dark reality in so many neighborhoods like mine across America. I'm not saying its right, but its reality. And it's not unfounded. There's a harsh reality around violence and criminal justice in our inner cities.\"  Cam'ron has had contact with the police in the past.

The service was established in 1791 and chain ferry operations were introduced by [[James Meadows Rendel (engineer)|James Meadows Rendel]] in 1832.\n\n==Current operations==\n[[Image:TorpointFerryNew.jpg|thumb|One of the current ferries in 2005]]\nThe route is currently served by three ferries, named after three rivers in the area:  ''[[River Tamar|Tamar]] II'', ''[[River Lynher|Lynher]] II'' and ''[[River Plym|Plym]] II'', and built by [[Ferguson Marine Engineering|Ferguson Shipbuilders Ltd]] at [[Port Glasgow]]. Each ferry carries 73 cars and operates using its own set of slipways and parallel chains, with a vehicle weight limit of {{convert|18|tonne}} The ferry boats are propelled across the river by pulling themselves on the chains; the chains then sink to the bottom to allow shipping movements in the river. An intensive service is provided, with service frequencies ranging from every 10 minutes (3 ferries in service) at peak times, to half-hourly (1 ferry in service) at night. Services operate 24 hours a day, every day (including throughout Christmas and all other holiday periods), with service frequency never falling below half-hourly.\n\nThe ferries, along with the nearby [[Tamar Bridge]], are operated by the ''Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry Joint Committee'', which is jointly owned by [[Plymouth|Plymouth City Council]] and [[Cornwall Council]].\n\nTolls are payable in the Torpoint to Devonport (eastbound) direction only, except for motorcyclists who pay westbound only. The [[toll (road usage)|toll]] is \u00a32.00 for cars and motorcycle riders are charged 40p; there is no additional charge for a pillion passenger. Frequent users can reduce the fare by half by purchasing top-ups online for a machine-readable windscreen-mounted digital payment tag, called ''Tamar Tag'', which is also usable on the [[Tamar Bridge|bridge]]. The toll increase of 50% in March 2010 was the first rise for nearly 15 years before a further increase in November 2019.\n\nThe ferry takes around 10 minutes as opposed to a 20 mile, 30 minute trip around the mainland; rush hour times will differ.\n\n==History==\nA ferry route between [[Torpoint]] and Plymouth Dock (now called [[Devonport, Devon|Devonport]]) was created by an Act of Parliament in 1790 and the [[George Edgcumbe, 1st Earl of Mount Edgcumbe|Earl of Mount Edgcumbe]] began to run ferries the following year. In 1826 the ferry operations were taken over by the Torpoint Steamboat Company, which built landing piers on both sides of the Tamar. The company also built the steam ferry ''Jemima'' which entered service in 1831. The steamer was unable to hold a course in the strong tidal flow of the [[Hamoaze]], so it was soon withdrawn and the older ferryboats returned to service.<ref name=steamer>{{cite book|first=Alan|last=Kittridge|title=Steamers & Ferries of the River Tamar & Three Towns District|year=2003|isbn=0-906294-54-1}}</ref>\n\nThe steamboat company approached [[James Meadows Rendel (engineer)|James Meadows Rendel]] in 1832 and asked him to design a steam-powered [[cable ferry|floating bridge]] for the route.

The tolls varied between 2d for a horse and 5s for a coach with 4 horses, with a double fare charged on Sundays.<ref name=steamer/>\n\nThe original ferries were replaced by two new ferries built in 1871 and 1878. As a result of increasing traffic, the ferry company investigated twin ferry operations in 1905. Both the Admiralty and Devonport Corporation opposed this as the company would need to expand the landing beach in Devonport. An experimental two ferry service with the existing shore installations had to be abandoned due to the strain on the equipment. A supplementary steamer service was also introduced in 1902, with the ''Volta'' and ''Lady Beatrice'' linking Torpoint to two locations in Devonport on a triangular route.<ref name=steamer/>\n\n[[Image:TorpointFerryLynher.jpg|thumb|Former ferry ''Lynher'' in 2005]]\nCornwall County Council acquired both the ferry and the steamers in 1922 for \u00a342,000. The ''Volta'' was immediately sold for breaking and two new ferries were ordered, which entered service in 1925 and 1926. These were the first ferries on the route designed to carry [[motor vehicles]] and could carry 800 passengers and 16 cars. Land was acquired on both sides of the rivers to lay a second set of chains and expand the landing beaches. A third, reserve, ferry was ordered and modern shore facilities were also built and twin-ferry operation began in July 1932. These changes made the supplementary steamer redundant and the ''Lady Beatrice'' was sold.<ref name=steamer/>\n\nMotor traffic using the route increased rapidly after [[World War II]], and two new ferries with a capacity of 30 cars each were introduced by 1961.

The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.\n\n=== Road ===\nCape Town is the origin of three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]]. The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] and [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] begin in the foreshore area near the City Center.\n\nThe N1 runs East-North-East through [[Edgemead, Cape Town|Edgemead]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], and [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]]. It connects Cape Town to major cities further inland, namely [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], and [[Pretoria]] An older at-grade road, the [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville.\n[[File:Khayelitsha at N2 road, Cape Town (2015).jpg|thumb|[[Khayelitsha]], Township along [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] (2015)]]\nThe N2 runs East-South-Ease through [[Rondebosch]], [[Guguletu]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]] to [[Somerset West]]. It becomes a multiple-carriageway at-grade road from the intersection with the [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] onwards. The N2 continues east along the coast, linking Cape Town to the coastal cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R102 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the suburbs of [[Kuils River]] and [[Eerste River, Western Cape|Eerste River]].\n\nThe [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Edgemead. It runs north, initially as a highway, but becoming an at-grade road from the intersection with the M5 (Potsdam Rd) onwards. It links Cape Town with towns further North and eventually, [[Namibia]].\n\nThere are also a number of [[Provincial route (South Africa)|regional routes]] linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The [[R27 road (South Africa)|R27]] originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Table View, Cape Town|Table View]] and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]] and links the City to the West Coast, ending at the town of [[Velddrif]]. The [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] enters the east of the metro from the north, from [[Stellenbosch]]. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]]. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of [[Betty's Bay]] and [[Kleinmond]].\n\nOf the three-digit routes, the [[R300 road (South Africa)|R300]], is an expressway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near [[Mitchells Plain]] and the [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The [[R302 road (South Africa)|R302]] runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through [[Durbanville]] leaving the metro to [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]. The [[R304 road (South Africa)|R304]] enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at [[Philadelphia, Western Cape|Philadelphia]] to end at [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] at a junction with the\\s[[R307 road (South Africa)|R307]]. This R307 starts north of [[Koeberg]] from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]. The [[R310 road (South Africa)|R310]] originates from [[Muizenberg]] and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.\n\nCape Town, like most South African cities, uses [[Metropolitan Routes in Cape Town|Metropolitan]] or \"M\" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. However, the [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road.\n\nCape Town suffers from the worst traffic congestion in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201021928/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|archive-date=1 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=R750 million to fight traffic in SA's most congested city|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208104036/http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TomTom congestion Index.png|center|500px]]\n\n=== Buses ===\n[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services in the Cape Town metropolitan area.

It offers [[Accessibility#Transportation|universal access]] through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the [[EMV]] compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from 3 mins to 20 mins in peak times to 60 minutes during quiet off-peak periods.\n\n=== Taxis ===\nCape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.\n\nCape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and [[Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]]. There are about one thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre. The larger taxi companies in Cape Town are Excite Taxis, Cabnet and Intercab and single operators are reachable by cellular phone. The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.\n\nMinibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |publisher=CapeTown.org |title=Transport |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184051/http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |archivedate=28 November 2011  }}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy.

They traded tobacco, copper and iron with the [[Khoekhoe language|Khoekhoe]]-speaking clans of the region, in exchange for fresh meat.\n\n=== Dutch period ===\nIn 1652, [[Jan van Riebeeck]] and other employees of the [[Dutch East India Company|United East India Company]] ({{lang-nl|Verenigde Oost-indische Compagnie}}, VOC) were sent to the Cape to establish a way-station for ships travelling to the [[Dutch East Indies]], and the [[Fort de Goede Hoop]] (later replaced by the [[Castle of Good Hope]]). The settlement grew slowly during this period, as it was hard to find adequate labour. This labour shortage prompted the authorities to import slaves from [[Indonesia]] and [[Madagascar]]. Many of these became ancestors of the first [[Cape Coloureds|Cape Coloured]] communities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/2009/05/01/coloured-people-of-the-western-cape-have-the-most-diverse-ancestry-in-the-world/ |title=Cape-Slavery-Heritage \" Coloured People of the Western Cape have the most Diverse Ancestry in the World :: iBlog |publisher=Cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=17 March 2011 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |title=Slavery and early colonisation, South African History Online |publisher=Sahistory.org.za |date=22 September 1927 |accessdate=17 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109130722/http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/slavery/slavery.htm |archive-date=9 January 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref> Under Van Riebeeck and his successors as VOC commanders and later governors at the Cape, an impressive range of useful plants were introduced to the Cape \u2013 in the process changing the natural environment forever.

Britain captured Cape Town in 1795, but the Cape was returned to the Dutch by treaty in 1803. British forces occupied the Cape again in 1806 following the [[Battle of Blaauwberg]]. In the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], Cape Town was permanently ceded to the United Kingdom. It became the capital of the newly formed [[British Cape Colony|Cape Colony]], whose territory expanded very substantially through the 1800s. With expansion came calls for greater independence from the UK, with the Cape attaining [[Parliament of the Cape of Good Hope|its own parliament]] (1854) and a locally accountable Prime Minister (1872).

The Metrorail network consists of 96 stations throughout the suburbs and outskirts of Cape Town.\n\n=== Road ===\nCape Town is the origin of three [[National Roads in South Africa|national roads]]. The [[N1 (South Africa)|N1]] and [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] begin in the foreshore area near the City Center.\n\nThe N1 runs East-North-East through [[Edgemead, Cape Town|Edgemead]], [[Parow, South Africa|Parow]], [[Bellville, Cape Town|Bellville]], and [[Brackenfell, Cape Town|Brackenfell]]. It connects Cape Town to major cities further inland, namely [[Bloemfontein]], [[Johannesburg]], and [[Pretoria]] An older at-grade road, the [[R101 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 from Bellville.\n[[File:Khayelitsha at N2 road, Cape Town (2015).jpg|thumb|[[Khayelitsha]], Township along [[N2 (South Africa)|N2]] (2015)]]\nThe N2 runs East-South-Ease through [[Rondebosch]], [[Guguletu]], [[Khayelitsha]], [[Macassar, Western Cape|Macassar]] to [[Somerset West]]. It becomes a multiple-carriageway at-grade road from the intersection with the [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] onwards. The N2 continues east along the coast, linking Cape Town to the coastal cities of [[Port Elizabeth]], [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Durban]]. An older at-grade road, the [[R102 road (South Africa)|R101]], runs parallel to the N1 initially, before veering south at Bellville, to join the N2 at Somerset West via the suburbs of [[Kuils River]] and [[Eerste River, Western Cape|Eerste River]].\n\nThe [[N7 (South Africa)|N7]] originates from the N1 at Wingfield Interchange near Edgemead. It runs north, initially as a highway, but becoming an at-grade road from the intersection with the M5 (Potsdam Rd) onwards. It links Cape Town with towns further North and eventually, [[Namibia]].\n\nThere are also a number of [[Provincial route (South Africa)|regional routes]] linking Cape Town with surrounding areas. The [[R27 road (South Africa)|R27]] originates from the N1 near the Foreshore and runs north parallel to the N7, but nearer to the coast. It passes through the suburbs of [[Milnerton, Cape Town|Milnerton]], [[Table View, Cape Town|Table View]] and [[Bloubergstrand, Cape Town|Bloubergstrand]] and links the City to the West Coast, ending at the town of [[Velddrif]]. The [[R44 road (South Africa)|R44]] enters the east of the metro from the north, from [[Stellenbosch]]. It connects Stellenbosch to Somerset West, then crosses the N2 to [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]]. It exits the metro heading south hugging the coast, leading to the towns of [[Betty's Bay]] and [[Kleinmond]].\n\nOf the three-digit routes, the [[R300 road (South Africa)|R300]], is an expressway linking the N1 at Brackenfell to the N2 near [[Mitchells Plain]] and the [[Cape Town International Airport]]. The [[R302 road (South Africa)|R302]] runs from the R102 in Bellville, heading north across the N1 through [[Durbanville]] leaving the metro to [[Malmesbury, Western Cape|Malmesbury]]. The [[R304 road (South Africa)|R304]] enters the northern limits of the metro from Stellenbosch, running NNW before veering west to cross the N7 at [[Philadelphia, Western Cape|Philadelphia]] to end at [[Atlantis, Western Cape|Atlantis]] at a junction with the\\s[[R307 road (South Africa)|R307]]. This R307 starts north of [[Koeberg]] from the R27 and, after meeting the R304, continues north to [[Darling, Western Cape|Darling]]. The [[R310 road (South Africa)|R310]] originates from [[Muizenberg]] and runs along the coast, to the south of Mitchell's Plain and Khayelitsha, before veering north-east, crossing the N2 west of Macassar, and exiting the metro heading to Stellenbosch.\n\nCape Town, like most South African cities, uses [[Metropolitan Routes in Cape Town|Metropolitan]] or \"M\" routes for important intra-city routes, a layer below National (N) roads and Regional (R) routes. Each city's M roads are independently numbered. Most are at-grade roads. However, the [[M3 (Cape Town)|M3]] splits from the N2 and runs to the south along the eastern slopes of Table Mountain, connecting the City Bowl with [[Muizenberg]]. Except for a section between Rondebosch and Newlands that has at-grade intersections, this route is a highway. The [[M5 (Cape Town)|M5]] splits from the N1 further east than the M3, and links the Cape Flats to the CBD. It is a highway as far as the interchange with the M68 at Ottery, before continuing as an at-grade road.\n\nCape Town suffers from the worst traffic congestion in [[South Africa]].<ref>{{cite web|title=TomTom Traffic Index|url=http://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151201021928/https://www.tomtom.com/en_gb/trafficindex/#/list|archive-date=1 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=R750 million to fight traffic in SA's most congested city|url=http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|accessdate=29 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208104036/http://businesstech.co.za/news/general/103039/r750-million-to-fight-traffic-in-sas-most-congested-city/|archive-date=8 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:TomTom congestion Index.png|center|500px]]\n\n=== Buses ===\n[[Golden Arrow Bus Services]] operates scheduled bus services in the Cape Town metropolitan area.

It offers [[Accessibility#Transportation|universal access]] through level boarding and numerous other measures, and requires cashless fare payment using the [[EMV]] compliant smart card system, called myconnect. Headway of services (i.e. the time between buses on the same route) range from 3 mins to 20 mins in peak times to 60 minutes during quiet off-peak periods.\n\n=== Taxis ===\nCape Town has two kinds of taxis: [[taxicab|metered taxis]] and [[minibus taxi]]s. Unlike many cities, metered taxis are not allowed to drive around the city to solicit fares and instead must be called to a specific location.\n\nCape Town metered taxi cabs mostly operate in the city bowl, suburbs and Cape Town International Airport areas. Large companies that operate fleets of cabs can be reached by phone and are cheaper than the single operators that apply for hire from taxi ranks and [[Victoria and Alfred Waterfront]]. There are about one thousand meter taxis in Cape Town. Their rates vary from R8 per kilometre to about R15 per kilometre. The larger taxi companies in Cape Town are Excite Taxis, Cabnet and Intercab and single operators are reachable by cellular phone. The seven seated Toyota Avanza are the most popular with larger Taxi companies. Meter cabs are mostly used by tourists and are safer to use than minibus taxis.\n\nMinibus taxis are the standard form of transport for the majority of the population who cannot afford private vehicles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |publisher=CapeTown.org |title=Transport |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111128184051/http://www.cape-town.org/directory.asp?McatId=8 |archivedate=28 November 2011  }}</ref> Although essential, these taxis are often poorly maintained and are frequently not road-worthy.

Esters with low molecular weight are commonly used as fragrances and found in [[essential oil]]s and [[pheromone]]s. [[Phosphoester]]s form the backbone of [[DNA]] molecules. [[Nitrate ester]]s, such as [[nitroglycerin]], are known for their explosive properties, while [[polyester]]s are important [[plastic]]s, with [[monomer]]s linked by ester [[moiety (chemistry)|moieties]].

Ester or oxy-acid ethers.<br />Ethers of the third type.<br /><br />Many mineral and organic acids containing oxygen combine with an alcohol upon elimination of water to [form] neutral, volatile ether compounds, which one can view as coupled compounds of alcohol and acid-water, or, according to the theory of radicals, as salts in which an acid is bonded with an ether. </blockquote></ref> probably as a contraction of the German ''Essig\u00e4ther'', \"[[Ethyl acetate|acetic ether]]\".\n\n=== IUPAC nomenclature ===\n{{Main|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Esters}}\nEster names are derived from the parent alcohol and the parent acid, where the latter may be organic or inorganic. Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called \"[[trivial names]]\" e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix ''-oate''. For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl [[Caprylic acid|caprylate]], has the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n[[Image:EtOAcImp.png|thumb|Ethyl acetate derived from an alcohol (blue) and an [[acyl]] group (yellow) derived from a carboxylic acid]]\n\nThe chemical formulas of organic esters usually take the form RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 are the hydrocarbon parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively. For example, [[butyl acetate]] (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from [[n-Butanol|butanol]] and [[acetic acid]] (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>. Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>.\n\nCyclic esters are called [[lactone]]s, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or an inorganic acid. One example of an organic lactone is [[gamma-valerolactone|\u03b3-valerolactone]].\n\n=== Orthoesters ===\nAn uncommon class of organic esters are the [[orthoester]]s, which have the formula RC(OR\u2032)<sub>3</sub>. Triethylorthoformate (HC(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from [[orthoformic acid]] (HC(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and [[ethanol]].\n\n=== Inorganic esters ===\n[[Image:Phosphate Group.svg|130px|thumb|A phosphoric acid ester]]\nEsters can also be derived from an inorganic acid and an alcohol. Thus, the nomenclature extends to inorganic oxo acids and their corresponding esters: [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphate esters]]/[[organophosphate]]s, [[sulfuric acid]] and sulfate esters/[[organosulfate]]s, [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]], and [[boric acid]] and [[borate#Borate esters|borate]]s. For example, [[triphenyl phosphate]] is the ester derived from [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phenol]]. Organic carbonates are derived from [[carbonic acid]]; for example, [[ethylene carbonate]] is derived from carbonic acid and [[ethylene glycol]].\n\nSo far an alcohol and inorganic acid are linked via oxygen atoms. The definition of inorganic acid ester that feature inorganic chemical elements links between alcohols and the inorganic acid \u2013 the phosphorus atom linking to three [[alkoxy]] functional groups in [[organophosphate]] \u2013 can be extended to the same elements in various combinations of [[covalent bonds]] between carbons and the central inorganic atom and carbon\u2013oxygen bonds to central inorganic atoms. For example, phosphorus features three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and one phosphorus\u2013oxygen ''double bond'' in organophosphates, three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds in [[phosphite ester]]s or organophosphites, two carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but one phosphorus\u2013carbon bond in phosphonites, one carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but two phosphorus\u2013carbon bonds in phosphinites.\n\nIn corollary, [[Organoboron chemistry#Borinic and boronic acids and esters|boron]] features [[borinic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[boronic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and [[borate]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).\n\nAs oxygen is a [[group 16]] chemical element, sulfur atoms can replace some oxygen atoms in carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013central inorganic atom covalent bonds of an ester. As a result, [[thiosulfinate]]s and [[thiosulfonate]]s, with a central inorganic sulfur atom, demonstrate clearly the assortment of [[organosulfur compounds|sulfur]] esters, that also includes [[organosulfate|sulfate]]s, [[sulfite]]s, [[sulfonate]]s, [[sulfinate]]s, [[sulfenate]]s esters.\n\n== Structure and bonding ==\nEsters contain a [[carbonyl]] center, which gives rise to 120\u00b0 C\u2013C\u2013O and O\u2013C\u2013O angles. Unlike [[amide]]s, esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C\u2013O\u2013C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides.<ref name=March>March, J.

The preference for the Z conformation is influenced by the nature of the substituents and solvent, if present.<ref>{{ cite journal | author = Diwakar M. Pawar | author2 = Abdelnaser A.

They participate in [[hydrogen bond]]s as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than [[carboxylic acid]]s of similar molecular weight.<ref name=March/>\n\n=== Characterization and analysis ===\nEsters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]] for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730\u20131750&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> assigned to ''\u03bd''<sub>C=O</sub>. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjugation with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n== Applications and occurrence ==\nEsters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, [[fat]]s are in general triesters derived from [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.<ref>Isolation of triglyceride from nutmeg: G. D. Beal \"Trimyristen\" Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the [[fragrance]] and [[flavoring|flavor]] industry. Ester bonds are also found in many [[polymer]]s.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols===\nThe classic synthesis is the [[Fischer esterification]], which involves treating a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrating]] agent:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H + R\u2032OH {{eqm}} RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe equilibrium constant for such reactions is about 5 for typical esters, e.g., ethyl acetate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Roger J. | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Alton | last3 = Andrews | first3 = Roy C. | year = 1928 | title = The Relation Between the Hydrolysis Equilibrium Constant of Esters and the Strengths of the Corresponding Acids | url = | journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc. | volume = 50 | issue = 5| pages = 1267\u20131271 | doi = 10.1021/ja01392a005 }}</ref> The reaction is slow in the absence of a catalyst. [[Sulfuric acid]] is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as [[Dowex|polymeric sulfonic acids]]. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]:\n* Using the alcohol in large excess (i.e., as a solvent).\n* Using a dehydrating agent: sulfuric acid not only catalyzes the reaction but sequesters water (a reaction product). Other drying agents such as [[molecular sieves]] are also effective.\n* Removal of water by physical means such as [[distillation]] as a low-boiling [[azeotrope]]s with [[toluene]], in conjunction with a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].\n\nReagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the [[Steglich esterification]], which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in [[peptide synthesis]], where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC ([[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]]) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction. [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine]] (DMAP) is used as an acyl-transfer [[catalyst]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = B. Neises | author2 = W.

The method is useful in specialized organic synthetic operations but is considered too hazardous and expensive for large-scale applications.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with epoxides===\nCarboxylic acids are esterified by treatment with epoxides, giving \u03b2-hydroxyesters:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H  + RCHCH<sub>2</sub>O   \u2192   RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(OH)R\nThis reaction is employed in the production of [[vinyl ester resin]] resins from [[acrylic acid]].\n\n=== Alcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides ===\nAlcohols react with [[acyl chloride]]s and [[acid anhydride]]s to give esters:\n: RCOCl + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + HCl\n: (RCO)<sub>2</sub>O + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + RCO<sub>2</sub>H\n\nThe reactions are irreversible simplifying [[work-up (chemistry)|work-up]]. Since acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides also react with water, anhydrous conditions are preferred. The analogous acylations of amines to give [[amide]]s are less sensitive because amines are stronger [[nucleophile]]s and react more rapidly than does water.

The carboxylate salt is often generated ''in situ''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=Kouichi|last2=Shimazaki|first2=Hayato|last3=Miyamoto|first3=Yu|last4=Shimada|first4=Kazuaki|last5=Haga|first5=Fumi|last6=Yamada|first6=Yuki|last7=Miyazawa|first7=Hirotsugu|last8=Nishiwaki|first8=Keiji|last9=Kashimura|first9=Shigenori|date=2014|title=Simple and Convenient Synthesis of Esters from Carboxylic Acids and Alkyl Halides Using Tetrabutylammonium Fluoride|url=http://jlc.jst.go.jp/DN/JST.JSTAGE/jos/ess13199?lang=en&from=CrossRef&type=abstract|journal=Journal of Oleo Science|language=en|volume=63|issue=5|pages=539\u2013544|doi=10.5650/jos.ess13199|issn=1345-8957}}</ref> In difficult cases, the silver carboxylate may be used, since the silver ion coordinates to the halide aiding its departure and improving the reaction rate. This reaction can suffer from anion availability problems and, therefore, can benefit from the addition of [[phase transfer catalyst]]s or highly polar [[aprotic solvent]]s such as [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]].\n\n===Transesterification===\n[[Transesterification]], which involves changing one ester into another one, is widely practiced:\n: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + CH<sub>3</sub>OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + R\u2032OH\nLike the hydrolysation, transesterification is catalysed by acids and bases. The reaction is widely used for degrading [[triglyceride]]s, e.g. in the production of fatty acid esters and alcohols.

The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C\u2013H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms [[adduct]]s.\n\n===Hydrolysis and saponification <!--[[Ester hydrolysis]] redirects here-->===\nEsterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo [[hydrolysis]] under acid and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the [[Fischer esterification]]. Under basic conditions, [[hydroxide]] acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, [[saponification]], is the basis of soap making.\n:[[Image:Ester hydrolysis.png|400px|Ester saponification (basic hydrolysis)]]\n\nThe alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s to give [[amide]]s: (ammonolysis reaction)\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + NH<sub>2</sub>R\u2033 \u2192 RCONHR\u2033 + R\u2032OH\nThis reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to [[isocyanate]]s through intermediate [[hydroxamic acid]]s in the [[Lossen rearrangement]].\n\nSources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., [[Grignard reagent]]s and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.\n\n=== Reduction ===\nCompared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are [[Carbonyl reduction#Trends in carbonyl reactivity|relatively resistant to reduction]]. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to [[fatty alcohol]]s.\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RCH<sub>2</sub>OH + R\u2032OH\nA typical catalyst is [[copper chromite]]. Prior to the development of [[catalytic hydrogenation]], esters were reduced on a large scale using the [[Bouveault\u2013Blanc reduction]]. This method, which is largely obsolete, uses sodium in the presence of proton sources.\n\nEspecially for fine chemical syntheses, [[lithium aluminium hydride]] is used to reduce esters to two primary alcohols. The related reagent sodium borohydride is slow in this reaction. [[DIBAH]] reduces esters to aldehydes.<ref>{{cite web | author = W.

Deprotonation requires relatively strong bases, such as [[alkoxide]]s. Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic [[enolate]], which can further react, e.g., the [[Claisen condensation]] and its intramolecular equivalent, the [[Dieckmann condensation]]. This conversion is exploited in the [[malonic ester synthesis]], wherein the diester of [[malonic acid]] reacts with an electrophile (e.g., [[alkyl halide]]), and is subsequently decarboxylated.

Protecting a carboxylic acid is useful in peptide synthesis, to prevent self-reactions of the bifunctional [[amino acid]]s. Methyl and ethyl esters are commonly available for many amino acids; the ''t''-butyl ester tends to be more expensive. However, ''t''-butyl esters are particularly useful because, under strongly acidic conditions, the ''t''-butyl esters undergo elimination to give the carboxylic acid and [[isobutylene]], simplifying work-up.\n\n== List of ester odorants ==\nMany esters have distinctive fruit-like odors, and many occur naturally in the essential oils of plants.

Esters derived from the simplest carboxylic acids are commonly named according to the more traditional, so-called \"[[trivial names]]\" e.g. as formate, acetate, propionate, and butyrate, as opposed to the IUPAC nomenclature methanoate, ethanoate, propanoate and butanoate. Esters derived from more complex carboxylic acids are, on the other hand, more frequently named using the systematic IUPAC name, based on the name for the acid followed by the suffix ''-oate''. For example, the ester hexyl octanoate, also known under the trivial name hexyl [[Caprylic acid|caprylate]], has the formula CH<sub>3</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>6</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>5</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>.\n\n[[Image:EtOAcImp.png|thumb|Ethyl acetate derived from an alcohol (blue) and an [[acyl]] group (yellow) derived from a carboxylic acid]]\n\nThe chemical formulas of organic esters usually take the form RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032, where R and R\u2032 are the hydrocarbon parts of the carboxylic acid and the alcohol, respectively. For example, [[butyl acetate]] (systematically butyl ethanoate), derived from [[n-Butanol|butanol]] and [[acetic acid]] (systematically ethanoic acid) would be written CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>. Alternative presentations are common including BuOAc and CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>.\n\nCyclic esters are called [[lactone]]s, regardless of whether they are derived from an organic or an inorganic acid. One example of an organic lactone is [[gamma-valerolactone|\u03b3-valerolactone]].\n\n=== Orthoesters ===\nAn uncommon class of organic esters are the [[orthoester]]s, which have the formula RC(OR\u2032)<sub>3</sub>. Triethylorthoformate (HC(OC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>)<sub>3</sub>) is derived, in terms of its name (but not its synthesis) from [[orthoformic acid]] (HC(OH)<sub>3</sub>) and [[ethanol]].\n\n=== Inorganic esters ===\n[[Image:Phosphate Group.svg|130px|thumb|A phosphoric acid ester]]\nEsters can also be derived from an inorganic acid and an alcohol. Thus, the nomenclature extends to inorganic oxo acids and their corresponding esters: [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phosphate esters]]/[[organophosphate]]s, [[sulfuric acid]] and sulfate esters/[[organosulfate]]s, [[nitric acid]] and [[nitrate]], and [[boric acid]] and [[borate#Borate esters|borate]]s. For example, [[triphenyl phosphate]] is the ester derived from [[phosphoric acid]] and [[phenol]]. Organic carbonates are derived from [[carbonic acid]]; for example, [[ethylene carbonate]] is derived from carbonic acid and [[ethylene glycol]].\n\nSo far an alcohol and inorganic acid are linked via oxygen atoms. The definition of inorganic acid ester that feature inorganic chemical elements links between alcohols and the inorganic acid \u2013 the phosphorus atom linking to three [[alkoxy]] functional groups in [[organophosphate]] \u2013 can be extended to the same elements in various combinations of [[covalent bonds]] between carbons and the central inorganic atom and carbon\u2013oxygen bonds to central inorganic atoms. For example, phosphorus features three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and one phosphorus\u2013oxygen ''double bond'' in organophosphates, three carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds and no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds in [[phosphite ester]]s or organophosphites, two carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but one phosphorus\u2013carbon bond in phosphonites, one carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013phosphorus bonds, no phosphorus\u2013oxygen double bonds but two phosphorus\u2013carbon bonds in phosphinites.\n\nIn corollary, [[Organoboron chemistry#Borinic and boronic acids and esters|boron]] features [[borinic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2), [[boronic ester]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1), and [[borate]]s (''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0).\n\nAs oxygen is a [[group 16]] chemical element, sulfur atoms can replace some oxygen atoms in carbon\u2013oxygen\u2013central inorganic atom covalent bonds of an ester. As a result, [[thiosulfinate]]s and [[thiosulfonate]]s, with a central inorganic sulfur atom, demonstrate clearly the assortment of [[organosulfur compounds|sulfur]] esters, that also includes [[organosulfate|sulfate]]s, [[sulfite]]s, [[sulfonate]]s, [[sulfinate]]s, [[sulfenate]]s esters.\n\n== Structure and bonding ==\nEsters contain a [[carbonyl]] center, which gives rise to 120\u00b0 C\u2013C\u2013O and O\u2013C\u2013O angles. Unlike [[amide]]s, esters are structurally flexible functional groups because rotation about the C\u2013O\u2013C bonds has a low barrier. Their flexibility and low polarity is manifested in their physical properties; they tend to be less rigid (lower melting point) and more volatile (lower boiling point) than the corresponding amides.<ref name=March>March, J.

They participate in [[hydrogen bond]]s as hydrogen-bond acceptors, but cannot act as hydrogen-bond donors, unlike their parent alcohols. This ability to participate in hydrogen bonding confers some water-solubility. Because of their lack of hydrogen-bond-donating ability, esters do not self-associate. Consequently, esters are more volatile than [[carboxylic acid]]s of similar molecular weight.<ref name=March/>\n\n=== Characterization and analysis ===\nEsters are generally identified by gas chromatography, taking advantage of their volatility. [[IR spectroscopy|IR spectra]] for esters feature an intense sharp band in the range 1730\u20131750&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> assigned to ''\u03bd''<sub>C=O</sub>. This peak changes depending on the functional groups attached to the carbonyl. For example, a benzene ring or double bond in conjugation with the carbonyl will bring the wavenumber down about 30&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n== Applications and occurrence ==\nEsters are widespread in nature and are widely used in industry. In nature, [[fat]]s are in general triesters derived from [[glycerol]] and [[fatty acid]]s.<ref>Isolation of triglyceride from nutmeg: G. D. Beal \"Trimyristen\" Organic Syntheses, Coll.

Esters are common in organic chemistry and biological materials, and often have a pleasant characteristic, fruity odor. This leads to their extensive use in the [[fragrance]] and [[flavoring|flavor]] industry. Ester bonds are also found in many [[polymer]]s.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with alcohols===\nThe classic synthesis is the [[Fischer esterification]], which involves treating a carboxylic acid with an alcohol in the presence of a [[Dehydration reaction|dehydrating]] agent:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H + R\u2032OH {{eqm}} RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + H<sub>2</sub>O\nThe equilibrium constant for such reactions is about 5 for typical esters, e.g., ethyl acetate.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Roger J. | last2 = Gabriel | first2 = Alton | last3 = Andrews | first3 = Roy C. | year = 1928 | title = The Relation Between the Hydrolysis Equilibrium Constant of Esters and the Strengths of the Corresponding Acids | url = | journal = J.

[[Sulfuric acid]] is a typical catalyst for this reaction. Many other acids are also used such as [[Dowex|polymeric sulfonic acids]]. Since esterification is highly reversible, the yield of the ester can be improved using [[Le Chatelier's principle]]:\n* Using the alcohol in large excess (i.e., as a solvent).\n* Using a dehydrating agent: sulfuric acid not only catalyzes the reaction but sequesters water (a reaction product). Other drying agents such as [[molecular sieves]] are also effective.\n* Removal of water by physical means such as [[distillation]] as a low-boiling [[azeotrope]]s with [[toluene]], in conjunction with a [[Dean-Stark apparatus]].\n\nReagents are known that drive the dehydration of mixtures of alcohols and carboxylic acids. One example is the [[Steglich esterification]], which is a method of forming esters under mild conditions. The method is popular in [[peptide synthesis]], where the substrates are sensitive to harsh conditions like high heat. DCC ([[dicyclohexylcarbodiimide]]) is used to activate the carboxylic acid to further reaction. [[4-Dimethylaminopyridine]] (DMAP) is used as an acyl-transfer [[catalyst]].<ref>{{OrgSynth | author = B. Neises | author2 = W.

The method is useful in specialized organic synthetic operations but is considered too hazardous and expensive for large-scale applications.\n\n===Esterification of carboxylic acids with epoxides===\nCarboxylic acids are esterified by treatment with epoxides, giving \u03b2-hydroxyesters:\n:RCO<sub>2</sub>H  + RCHCH<sub>2</sub>O   \u2192   RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>CH(OH)R\nThis reaction is employed in the production of [[vinyl ester resin]] resins from [[acrylic acid]].\n\n=== Alcoholysis of acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides ===\nAlcohols react with [[acyl chloride]]s and [[acid anhydride]]s to give esters:\n: RCOCl + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + HCl\n: (RCO)<sub>2</sub>O + R\u2032OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + RCO<sub>2</sub>H\n\nThe reactions are irreversible simplifying [[work-up (chemistry)|work-up]]. Since acyl chlorides and acid anhydrides also react with water, anhydrous conditions are preferred. The analogous acylations of amines to give [[amide]]s are less sensitive because amines are stronger [[nucleophile]]s and react more rapidly than does water. This method is employed only for laboratory-scale procedures, as it is expensive.\n\n===Alkylation of carboxylate salts===\nAlthough not widely employed for esterifications, salts of carboxylate anions can be alkylating agent with [[alkyl halide]]s to give esters.<ref name=Ullmann/> In the case that an [[alkyl chloride]] is used, an iodide salt can catalyze the reaction ([[Finkelstein reaction]]). The carboxylate salt is often generated ''in situ''. In difficult cases, the silver carboxylate may be used, since the silver ion coordinates to the halide aiding its departure and improving the reaction rate. This reaction can suffer from anion availability problems and, therefore, can benefit from the addition of [[phase transfer catalyst]]s or highly polar [[aprotic solvent]]s such as [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]].\n\n===Transesterification===\n[[Transesterification]], which involves changing one ester into another one, is widely practiced:\n: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + CH<sub>3</sub>OH \u2192 RCO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub> + R\u2032OH\nLike the hydrolysation, transesterification is catalysed by acids and bases. The reaction is widely used for degrading [[triglyceride]]s, e.g. in the production of fatty acid esters and alcohols. [[Poly(ethylene terephthalate)]] is produced by the transesterification of [[dimethyl terephthalate]] and ethylene glycol:<ref name=Ullmann/> \n: (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)(CO<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2&nbsp;C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 {{frac|''n''}}&nbsp;{(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)(CO<sub>2</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)}<sub>''n''</sub> + 2&nbsp;CH<sub>3</sub>OH\n\nA subset of transesterification is the alcoholysis of [[diketene]].

The reaction is catalyzed by [[sodium methoxide]]:\n:CH<sub>3</sub>OH + CO \u2192 CH<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CH\n\n===Addition of carboxylic acids to alkenes and alkynes===\nIn the presence of [[palladium]]-based catalysts, ethylene, [[acetic acid]], and [[oxygen]] react to give [[vinyl acetate]]:\n:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub> + CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H + {{1/2}}&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>CCH<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\nDirect routes to this same ester are not possible because [[vinyl alcohol]] is unstable.\n\nCarboxylic acids also add across alkynes to give the same products.\n\n[[Silicotungstic acid]] is used to manufacture [[ethyl acetate]] by the [[alkylation]] of [[acetic acid]] by ethylene:\n:C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>  +  CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>H   \u2192   CH<sub>3</sub>CO<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>\n\n===From aldehydes===\nThe [[Tishchenko reaction]] involve [[disproportionation]] of an [[aldehyde]] in the presence of an anhydrous base to give an ester.

The carbonyl is weakly electrophilic but is attacked by strong nucleophiles (amines, alkoxides, hydride sources, organolithium compounds, etc.). The C\u2013H bonds adjacent to the carbonyl are weakly acidic but undergo deprotonation with strong bases. This process is the one that usually initiates condensation reactions. The carbonyl oxygen in esters is weakly basic, less so than the carbonyl oxygen in amides due to resonance donation of an electron pair from nitrogen in amides, but forms [[adduct]]s.\n\n===Hydrolysis and saponification <!--[[Ester hydrolysis]] redirects here-->===\nEsterification is a reversible reaction. Esters undergo [[hydrolysis]] under acid and basic conditions. Under acidic conditions, the reaction is the reverse reaction of the [[Fischer esterification]]. Under basic conditions, [[hydroxide]] acts as a nucleophile, while an alkoxide is the leaving group. This reaction, [[saponification]], is the basis of soap making.\n:[[Image:Ester hydrolysis.png|400px|Ester saponification (basic hydrolysis)]]\n\nThe alkoxide group may also be displaced by stronger nucleophiles such as [[ammonia]] or primary or secondary [[amine]]s to give [[amide]]s: (ammonolysis reaction)\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + NH<sub>2</sub>R\u2033 \u2192 RCONHR\u2033 + R\u2032OH\nThis reaction is not usually reversible. Hydrazines and hydroxylamine can be used in place of amines. Esters can be converted to [[isocyanate]]s through intermediate [[hydroxamic acid]]s in the [[Lossen rearrangement]].\n\nSources of carbon nucleophiles, e.g., [[Grignard reagent]]s and organolithium compounds, add readily to the carbonyl.\n\n=== Reduction ===\nCompared to ketones and aldehydes, esters are [[Carbonyl reduction#Trends in carbonyl reactivity|relatively resistant to reduction]]. The introduction of catalytic hydrogenation in the early part of the 20th century was a breakthrough; esters of fatty acids are hydrogenated to [[fatty alcohol]]s.\n:: RCO<sub>2</sub>R\u2032 + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RCH<sub>2</sub>OH + R\u2032OH\nA typical catalyst is [[copper chromite]]. Prior to the development of [[catalytic hydrogenation]], esters were reduced on a large scale using the [[Bouveault\u2013Blanc reduction]]. This method, which is largely obsolete, uses sodium in the presence of proton sources.\n\nEspecially for fine chemical syntheses, [[lithium aluminium hydride]] is used to reduce esters to two primary alcohols. The related reagent sodium borohydride is slow in this reaction. [[DIBAH]] reduces esters to aldehydes.<ref>{{cite web | author = W.

Deprotonation requires relatively strong bases, such as [[alkoxide]]s. Deprotonation gives a nucleophilic [[enolate]], which can further react, e.g., the [[Claisen condensation]] and its intramolecular equivalent, the [[Dieckmann condensation]]. This conversion is exploited in the [[malonic ester synthesis]], wherein the diester of [[malonic acid]] reacts with an electrophile (e.g., [[alkyl halide]]), and is subsequently decarboxylated.
