Bunny was never accepted by Lincoln Sr. and was not allowed in the family's house.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nAlexander went to [[Earl Grey Public School]] where he was the only Black in his kindergarten class. He noted in his memoir that he \"never raced home from school and cried\" but earned the respect of his classmates, sometimes by fighting. This taught him \"to always walk tall, and with a certain bearing, so people knew I meant business\".<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> In his 2006 memoir, ''Go to School, You're a Little Black Boy'', Alexander recalled: \"Blacks at that time made up a sliver-thin portion of the city's population, and racial prejudice abounded.\" When the family moved to the east end of Toronto, and he attended [[Riverdale Collegiate]], Alexander knew only three Black families. \"The scene in Toronto at that time wasn't violent, though you had to know your place and govern yourself accordingly.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nHis family was religious and enjoyed a social life centred on regularly attending a Baptist church in downtown Toronto. His father was a stern disciplinarian who wanted his son to play the piano. Alexander preferred various sports, including track, soccer, hockey, softball and boxing; he never learned to swim. His size made him uncoordinated so he was not a natural athlete.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nAs a teen Alexander's mother moved to [[Harlem]] with his half-brother Ridley after his father beat her violently. Lincoln and his brother Hughie were cared for by Sadie and Rupert Downes until his mother could send for one of them. She chose Lincoln; Hughie remained with the Downes family and the brothers grew apart.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn New York he attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], the only member of his family to do so. He recalled in his memoir, \"[G]iven the message about education that had been pounded into my head since I was a young child, the fact those kids didn\u2019t go to school was an eye-opener for me.\" As a black community, Harlem allowed him to find role models who worked at jobs that did not involve manual labour.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\n==War record==\nIn 1939, after Canada declared war on Germany, his mother sent him back to Toronto to live with his father. Lincoln met Yvonne (Tody) Harrison at a dance in Toronto. The youngest of four daughters of Robert, a railway porter, and his wife Edythe (n\u00e9e Lewis), Harrison lived in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Alexander was smitten by her and resolved to marry her. Because he was too young to enlist in the armed forces, he took a job as a machinist making anti-aircraft guns at a factory in Hamilton to be close to her.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nHe first distinguished himself in service to [[Canada]] in 1942 as a corporal and wireless operator in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He served in many parts of the country including [[Rural Municipality of Portage la Prairie|Portage La Prairie]].

He reported the incident to a superior officer who refused to take action.  Alexander quit the Air Force in 1945 and was granted an honourable discharge. Of that incident, he said: \"[A]t that time they didn't know how to deal with race relations of this sort of thing; they just turned a blind eye to it.\"<ref name=\"GovOnLa\"/>\n\n==Early life and education==\nAfter the war Alexander completed his studies at Hamilton's Central Collegiate and then entered [[McMaster University]] in 1946 to study economics and history, receiving a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1949.<ref name=globeobit>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Sandra|title=Obituary: Former lieutenant-governor took discrimination as personal challenge|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/obituary-former-lieutenant-governor-took-discrimination-as-personal-challenge/article4623578/?page=all|accessdate=October 27, 2012|newspaper=Globe and Mail|date=October 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023161925/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/obituary-former-lieutenant-governor-took-discrimination-as-personal-challenge/article4623578/?page=all|archivedate=October 23, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"CELA\"/>\n\nAt age 25, on September 10, 1948, he married Yvonne \"Tody\" Harrison, five years his senior. Upon graduating in 1949, he applied for a sales job at [[Stelco]], a steel plant in Hamilton, Ontario. Although he had references, the support of McMaster and the mayor of Hamilton, Stelco was unwilling to have a black man on its sales force. He declined their offer of his old summer job working in the plant.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nIn 1948, Alexander's mother died at age 49, suffering from dementia; his father committed suicide four years later.<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> He married his first wife, Yvonne Harrison, in 1948;<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> their only child, a son Keith, was born in 1949.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> In 1986, Alexander said in a ''Chatelaine'' magazine interview: \"My mother was the single biggest influence on me\u2013before my wife, I\u2019ve always regretted that she didn\u2019t live to see me graduate from university.\"<ref name=globeobit/>\n\nAlexander then attended [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in Toronto. While there, he suggested to the Dean during a lecture that he was using inappropriate language: \"[[nigger]]\".<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Challenging the Dean he said: \"But you can't say that because you have to show leadership. You're in a position of authority, a leader in the community. A leader has to lead and not be using such disrespectful comments without even thinking about them.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> Of the incident he recalled: \"I don't know what ever made me stand up and ask him that in a class of 200 people.&nbsp;... But I will tell you one thing, that day made me a man.\"<ref name=\"GovOnLa\"/> His actions did not end his career as he feared and Alexander graduated from Osgoode Hall in 1953.<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/>\n\nAfter [[Articled clerk|articling]] for Sam Gotfrid, Q.C., the only job offer he received was from Helen and Edward Okuloski, a brother and sister who had started their own practice in Hamilton when they were unable to find jobs with existing firms. Here he practiced real estate and commercial law and established a political base in the German and Polish communities in Hamilton. Two years later Alexander partnered with Dave Duncan, forming the firm Duncan & Alexander, which he claimed was the first inter-racial law partnership in Canada.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/><ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander  bought his own home on Proctor Blvd in the east end of Hamilton in 1958 and was able to move his family out of his in-laws' house. He lived there for nearly four decades.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nIn 1960, he and his wife visited twenty-three countries in Africa as volunteers with [[Operation Crossroads Africa]], a trip he said that made him realize: \"In Africa I was a black man and I was somebody.\"<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander wrote in his memoir:\n\n<blockquote>\"The experience was an eye-opener for me not only as a lawyer, but also as a human being, because I began to realize what black people could do. I saw that, unlike the Hollywood version, these Africans were men and women of significant talents. I became conscious of my blackness. I had come from a white world. Now we were in Africa, and I realized we are people of skill and creativity. I was a black man and I was a somebody. I started standing tall.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1962, Alexander's partnership with Duncan was dissolved. He joined former McMaster classmate Jack Millar in the firm Millar, Alexander, Tokiwa and Isaacs, which eventually became known as \"the United Nations law firm\". In his memoir, Alexander recalls: \"A Caucasian, a black, Japanese and a Native Canadian. We were white, black, yellow and red, we used to laugh.\" He was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1965.<ref name=\"CELA\">{{cite web|title=Lincoln Alexander|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lincoln-maccauley-alexander|website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica Canada]]|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nIn 1965, Alexander ran in the Canadian [[1965 Canadian federal election|federal election]] as the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] candidate in the [[Hamilton West (electoral district)|Hamilton West]] [[electoral district]] but was defeated.<ref name=\"CELA\"/> He ran again in the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968 federal election]] and on June 25, 1968, he won the seat, becoming Canada's first [[Black Canadians|black]] [[Member of Parliament]].<ref name=\"CELA\"/>\n\nOn September 20, 1968 he made his maiden speech in the House of Commons saying:<blockquote>I am not the spokesman for the Negro; that honour has not been given to me.

As an example, he threatened to break ranks with his own party to vote in favour of anti-hate legislation, saying \"screw you\" to his party's argument that it would curtail freedom of speech. \"Are you saying that you can call my son or daughter a nigger and that is free speech?\" he asked during debate on the bill. [[Heath MacQuarrie]], then a Tory MP from Prince Edward Island, stood up and said, \"I'm not going to let Linc stand alone on this.\" Together they led 17 members of their caucus in support of the government's legislation.<ref name=\"School\"/>\n\nIt was Alexander and Newfoundland MP [[John Lundrigan]] who provoked Trudeau into mouthing an obscenity in the House of Commons during a discussion of training programs for the unemployed in February 1971.

Bunny was never accepted by Lincoln Sr. and was not allowed in the family's house.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nAlexander went to [[Earl Grey Public School]] where he was the only Black in his kindergarten class. He noted in his memoir that he \"never raced home from school and cried\" but earned the respect of his classmates, sometimes by fighting. This taught him \"to always walk tall, and with a certain bearing, so people knew I meant business\".<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> In his 2006 memoir, ''Go to School, You're a Little Black Boy'', Alexander recalled: \"Blacks at that time made up a sliver-thin portion of the city's population, and racial prejudice abounded.\" When the family moved to the east end of Toronto, and he attended [[Riverdale Collegiate]], Alexander knew only three Black families. \"The scene in Toronto at that time wasn't violent, though you had to know your place and govern yourself accordingly.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nHis family was religious and enjoyed a social life centred on regularly attending a Baptist church in downtown Toronto. His father was a stern disciplinarian who wanted his son to play the piano. Alexander preferred various sports, including track, soccer, hockey, softball and boxing; he never learned to swim. His size made him uncoordinated so he was not a natural athlete.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nAs a teen Alexander's mother moved to [[Harlem]] with his half-brother Ridley after his father beat her violently. Lincoln and his brother Hughie were cared for by Sadie and Rupert Downes until his mother could send for one of them. She chose Lincoln; Hughie remained with the Downes family and the brothers grew apart.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn New York he attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]], the only member of his family to do so. He recalled in his memoir, \"[G]iven the message about education that had been pounded into my head since I was a young child, the fact those kids didn\u2019t go to school was an eye-opener for me.\" As a black community, Harlem allowed him to find role models who worked at jobs that did not involve manual labour.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\n==War record==\nIn 1939, after Canada declared war on Germany, his mother sent him back to Toronto to live with his father. Lincoln met Yvonne (Tody) Harrison at a dance in Toronto. The youngest of four daughters of Robert, a railway porter, and his wife Edythe (n\u00e9e Lewis), Harrison lived in [[Hamilton, Ontario]]. Alexander was smitten by her and resolved to marry her. Because he was too young to enlist in the armed forces, he took a job as a machinist making anti-aircraft guns at a factory in Hamilton to be close to her.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nHe first distinguished himself in service to [[Canada]] in 1942 as a corporal and wireless operator in the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].

Although he had references, the support of McMaster and the mayor of Hamilton, Stelco was unwilling to have a black man on its sales force. He declined their offer of his old summer job working in the plant.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nIn 1948, Alexander's mother died at age 49, suffering from dementia; his father committed suicide four years later.<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> He married his first wife, Yvonne Harrison, in 1948;<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> their only child, a son Keith, was born in 1949.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> In 1986, Alexander said in a ''Chatelaine'' magazine interview: \"My mother was the single biggest influence on me\u2013before my wife, I\u2019ve always regretted that she didn\u2019t live to see me graduate from university.\"<ref name=globeobit/>\n\nAlexander then attended [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] in Toronto. While there, he suggested to the Dean during a lecture that he was using inappropriate language: \"[[nigger]]\".<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Challenging the Dean he said: \"But you can't say that because you have to show leadership. You're in a position of authority, a leader in the community. A leader has to lead and not be using such disrespectful comments without even thinking about them.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/> Of the incident he recalled: \"I don't know what ever made me stand up and ask him that in a class of 200 people.&nbsp;... But I will tell you one thing, that day made me a man.\"<ref name=\"GovOnLa\"/> His actions did not end his career as he feared and Alexander graduated from Osgoode Hall in 1953.<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/>\n\nAfter [[Articled clerk|articling]] for Sam Gotfrid, Q.C., the only job offer he received was from Helen and Edward Okuloski, a brother and sister who had started their own practice in Hamilton when they were unable to find jobs with existing firms. Here he practiced real estate and commercial law and established a political base in the German and Polish communities in Hamilton. Two years later Alexander partnered with Dave Duncan, forming the firm Duncan & Alexander, which he claimed was the first inter-racial law partnership in Canada.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/><ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander  bought his own home on Proctor Blvd in the east end of Hamilton in 1958 and was able to move his family out of his in-laws' house. He lived there for nearly four decades.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/>\n\nIn 1960, he and his wife visited twenty-three countries in Africa as volunteers with [[Operation Crossroads Africa]], a trip he said that made him realize: \"In Africa I was a black man and I was somebody.\"<ref name=\"Star Obit\"/> Alexander wrote in his memoir:\n\n<blockquote>\"The experience was an eye-opener for me not only as a lawyer, but also as a human being, because I began to realize what black people could do. I saw that, unlike the Hollywood version, these Africans were men and women of significant talents. I became conscious of my blackness. I had come from a white world. Now we were in Africa, and I realized we are people of skill and creativity. I was a black man and I was a somebody. I started standing tall.\"<ref name=\"globeobit\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1962, Alexander's partnership with Duncan was dissolved. He joined former McMaster classmate Jack Millar in the firm Millar, Alexander, Tokiwa and Isaacs, which eventually became known as \"the United Nations law firm\". In his memoir, Alexander recalls: \"A Caucasian, a black, Japanese and a Native Canadian. We were white, black, yellow and red, we used to laugh.\" He was appointed [[Queen's Counsel]] in 1965.<ref name=\"CELA\">{{cite web|title=Lincoln Alexander|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lincoln-maccauley-alexander|website=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|publisher=[[Historica Canada]]|accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nIn 1965, Alexander ran in the Canadian [[1965 Canadian federal election|federal election]] as the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] candidate in the [[Hamilton West (electoral district)|Hamilton West]] [[electoral district]] but was defeated.<ref name=\"CELA\"/> He ran again in the [[1968 Canadian federal election|1968 federal election]] and on June 25, 1968, he won the seat, becoming Canada's first [[Black Canadians|black]] [[Member of Parliament]].<ref name=\"CELA\"/>\n\nOn September 20, 1968 he made his maiden speech in the House of Commons saying:<blockquote>I am not the spokesman for the Negro; that honour has not been given to me.

However, I want the record to show that I accept the responsibility of speaking for him and all others in this great nation who feel that they are the subjects of discrimination because of race, creed or colour.<ref name=\"globeobit\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1970, Alexander voted in favour of the ''[[October Crisis|War Measures Act]]'' invoked by then Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] but later felt he had erred in this decision, saying: \"[T]he issue of limiting rights has far more serious implications than I thought at the time.

As an example, he threatened to break ranks with his own party to vote in favour of anti-hate legislation, saying \"screw you\" to his party's argument that it would curtail freedom of speech. \"Are you saying that you can call my son or daughter a nigger and that is free speech?\" he asked during debate on the bill. [[Heath MacQuarrie]], then a Tory MP from Prince Edward Island, stood up and said, \"I'm not going to let Linc stand alone on this.\" Together they led 17 members of their caucus in support of the government's legislation.<ref name=\"School\"/>\n\nIt was Alexander and Newfoundland MP [[John Lundrigan]] who provoked Trudeau into mouthing an obscenity in the House of Commons during a discussion of training programs for the unemployed in February 1971.
