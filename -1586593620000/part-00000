He considered himself a link between the [[Beat Generation]] of the 1950s and the [[hippie]]s of the 1960s.\n\nKesey was born in [[La Junta, Colorado]], and grew up in [[Springfield, Oregon]], graduating from the [[University of Oregon]] in 1957. He began writing ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' in 1960 following the completion of a graduate fellowship in creative writing at [[Stanford University]]; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later. During this period, Kesey participated in government studies involving [[hallucinogenic drugs]] (including [[mescaline]] and [[LSD]]) to supplement his income.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oneflewovercucko00kese_0|title=One flew over the cuckoo's nest : a novel|last=Ken.|first=Kesey|date=1962|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=9780451163967|location=New York|oclc=189375}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the publication of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'', he moved to nearby [[La Honda, California]], and began hosting [[happenings]] with former colleagues from Stanford, miscellaneous bohemian and literary figures (most notably [[Neal Cassady]]), and other friends collectively known as the [[Merry Pranksters]]; these parties, known as [[Acid Tests]], integrated the consumption of [[LSD]] with multimedia performances. He mentored the [[Grateful Dead]] (the ''de facto'' \"house band\" of the Acid Tests) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their long career. ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion]]''&mdash;an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the [[modernist]] grandeur of [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha]] saga&mdash;was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964, although Kesey regarded the novel as his magnum opus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=38411|title=Stanford Magazine - Article|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, following an arrest for [[marijuana]] possession and subsequent faked suicide, Kesey was imprisoned for five months. Shortly thereafter, he returned home to the [[Willamette Valley]] and settled in [[Pleasant Hill, Oregon]], where he maintained a secluded, family-oriented lifestyle for the rest of his life. In addition to teaching at the University of Oregon&mdash;an experience that culminated in ''[[Caverns (novel)|Caverns]]'' (1989), a collaborative novel written by Kesey and his graduate workshop students under the pseudonym of \"O.U. Levon\"&mdash;he continued to regularly contribute fiction and reportage to such publications as ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'', ''Running'', and ''[[The Whole Earth Catalog]]''; various iterations of these pieces were collected in ''Kesey's Garage Sale'' (1973) and ''Demon Box'' (1986).\n\nBetween 1974 and 1980, Kesey published six issues of ''Spit in the Ocean'', a [[literary magazine]] that featured excerpts from an unfinished novel (''Seven Prayers by Grandma Whittier'', an account of Kesey's grandmother's struggle with [[Alzheimer's disease]]) and contributions from such luminaries as [[Margo St. James]], [[Kate Millett]], [[Stewart Brand]], [[Saul-Paul Sirag]], [[Jack Sarfatti]], [[Paul Krassner]], and [[William S.

He considered himself a link between the [[Beat Generation]] of the 1950s and the [[hippie]]s of the 1960s.\n\nKesey was born in [[La Junta, Colorado]], and grew up in [[Springfield, Oregon]], graduating from the [[University of Oregon]] in 1957. He began writing ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' in 1960 following the completion of a graduate fellowship in creative writing at [[Stanford University]]; the novel was an immediate commercial and critical success when published two years later. During this period, Kesey participated in government studies involving [[hallucinogenic drugs]] (including [[mescaline]] and [[LSD]]) to supplement his income.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/oneflewovercucko00kese_0|title=One flew over the cuckoo's nest : a novel|last=Ken.|first=Kesey|date=1962|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=9780451163967|location=New York|oclc=189375}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the publication of ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'', he moved to nearby [[La Honda, California]], and began hosting [[happenings]] with former colleagues from Stanford, miscellaneous bohemian and literary figures (most notably [[Neal Cassady]]), and other friends collectively known as the [[Merry Pranksters]]; these parties, known as [[Acid Tests]], integrated the consumption of [[LSD]] with multimedia performances. He mentored the [[Grateful Dead]] (the ''de facto'' \"house band\" of the Acid Tests) throughout their incipience and continued to exert a profound influence upon the group throughout their long career. ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion]]''&mdash;an epic account of the vicissitudes of an Oregon logging family that aspired to the [[modernist]] grandeur of [[William Faulkner]]'s [[Yoknapatawpha]] saga&mdash;was a commercial success that polarized critics and readers upon its release in 1964, although Kesey regarded the novel as his magnum opus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=38411|title=Stanford Magazine - Article|publisher=|accessdate=6 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1965, following an arrest for [[marijuana]] possession and subsequent faked suicide, Kesey was imprisoned for five months.

The series was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The series went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe series was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Siguenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Siguenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him).

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the series was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the series' \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe series won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

The show was put on hiatus by the WB Network after two episodes due to poor ratings. It returned to the WB in the summer of 2000 but was canceled after four additional episodes. The show went on to develop a [[cult following]], thanks to repeated airings of all 13 episodes on [[Teletoon]]'s Teletoon Unleashed block; [[Cartoon Network]]'s popular late night programming block [[Adult Swim]]; and Too Funny To Sleep, a late night programming block on [[TBS (TV Network)|TBS]]. ''Mission Hill'' was formerly known as ''The Downtowners'', although [[MTV]]'s production of the similarly titled ''[[Downtown (TV series)|Downtown]]'' forced a name change.\n\nIt has also been popular outside of the United States and Canada, receiving broadcasts in Australia, [[Eastern Europe]], [[Latin America]], Spain and [[New Zealand]].\nStylistically, the series is recognizable for its bright, [[neon]] color palette, and features a peculiar mixture of modern animation and traditional \"cartoonish\" drawings (dashed lines coming from eyes to indicate line of vision, red bolts of lightning around a spot in pain). The style was made to be reminiscent of Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1930s to 1950s, as well as 1960's [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons. The designs were done by [[Lauren MacMullan]], who cites the comic series ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' as her source of inspiration for her overall design.\n\nThe show was created in 1997<ref>https://www.polygon.com/2017/9/6/16256458/mission-hill-simpsons-bill-oakley-josh-weinstein-matt-groening</ref> by [[Bill Oakley]] and [[Josh Weinstein]], former executive producers of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and the artistic designer was [[Lauren MacMullan]]. It features the [[voice actor|voices]] of [[Wallace Langham]], [[Scott Menville]], [[Brian Posehn]], [[Vicki Lewis]], [[Nick Jameson]], [[Tom Kenny]], [[Herbert Siguenza]], [[Jane Wiedlin]], [[Tress MacNeille]] and [[Lisa Arch|Lisa Kushell]]. The [[theme music|theme song]] is a faster, instrumental version of \"Italian Leather Sofa\" by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].\n\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005.\n\n==Premise==\nSet in the world of teens and 20-somethings, this series follows hip 24-year-old Andy French, whose sheltered suburban teenage brother Kevin moves in with him and his roommates in a big-city loft.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n* Andrew \"Andy\" French ([[Wallace Langham]]) \u2013 A 24-year-old in his third consecutive \"post-college slump year.\" Andy is an aspiring cartoonist. From the pilot episode to \"Unemployment, Part 1,\" Andy worked at a waterbed store where his boss was a lecherous, short, ill-tempered, foul-mouthed man who frequented strip clubs. From \"Unemployment, Part 2\" to \"Plan 9 from Mission Hill\" (and including the unproduced episodes \"Supertool\" and \"Pretty in Pink\"), Andy works as an artist at the same advertising agency as Jim. Often bored and mellow, Andy is easily annoyed by his younger brother, Kevin, though it has been shown that Andy does indeed care about him. However, he often has a habit of calling him and others \"douchebag\".\n* Kevin French ([[Scott Menville]]) \u2013 Andy's 17-year-old nerd brother. Kevin moved in with Andy when his parents left for [[Wyoming]], bringing his sheltered, suburban mindset to Mission Hill.  He hopes to attend [[Yale University]], and prides himself on his SAT scores.  He has a habit of \"bling-blonging,\" saying \"bling blong\" over and over again while doing homework to drown out any/all distractions and is prone to heavily overreact to trivial matters.\n* James \"Jim\" Kuback ([[Brian Posehn]]) \u2013 In his mid-20s, loftmate Jim has been Andy's best friend since high school. He is extremely tall and lanky, with red hair and a beard much like his voice actor, and speaks in a deep, monotone voice. Jim is a genius at all things electronic, whether it's electronic music or computers. He is mellow and able to express a wide variety of sentiments by nuancing the word \"Okay.\" Jim is a high-powered advertising agent who is paid vast amounts of money to alter marketing campaigns to appeal to [[Millennial Generation|Generation Y]].\n* Posey Tyler ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 In her mid 20s, Posey, the fourth hippie loftmate, is somewhat a flower child, and very concerned about the health and well-being of her plants. She often gives her vegetables to charity, but gets upset when they are damaged. She often speaks quickly and in a nervous tone.\n* Stogie \u2013 Andy's pet [[Golden Retriever]], who can apparently stomach anything from alcohol drinks to remote controls. At one point in the series his primary source of food was eating the couch cushions. Posey has stated that \"there are dark forces at work within him\", in the first episode.\n\n===Supporting===\n* Gus Duncz ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A [[homosexual|gay]] man in his late 60s, he owns a diner in Mission Hill. He is a very large, burly man with a short temper and is married to Wally.  According to [[audio commentary]] by the producers, Gus is based on [[Broderick Crawford]], though according to the audio commentary for ''[[The Simpsons]]'' seventh season episode, \"[[Marge Be Not Proud]],\" Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein claim the inspiration for the character was [[Lawrence Tierney]] (who voiced the Try-N-Save store detective who catches Bart shoplifting).\n* Wally Langford ([[Tom Kenny]]) \u2013 A gay man in his late 60s, Wally is a [[movie projector|projectionist]] at the local [[art film|art movie]] house.  He is based on [[David Niven]]. He enjoys cinema and ragtime music. In the episode \"I Married a Gay Man from Outer Space\", it is revealed that he directed a film in the 1950s entitled ''The Man from Pluto'' (which parodied ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]''). It starred his partner Gus in the title role.\n* Natalie Leibowitz-Hernandez ([[Vicki Lewis]]) \u2013 Late 20s. Politically correct and intellectually well-endowed, Natalie is a professor of Women's Studies at the local college. Sensitive to biases in our culture, Natalie and her husband have yet to name their baby as they want it to have cultural significance reflective of their own respective cultures. She is of Jewish religion. She is a working mother who supports both \"Baby Nameless\" and her non-working \"marital partner\" Carlos. The character of Natalie was based and modeled on the writer and educator [[Lois M. Leveen]], a longtime friend of the show's creators. She auditioned for the voice of her own character, but the actress Vicki Lewis was determined to be even more \"Lois-y\" than Lois Leveen herself, and she was cast in the role instead.<ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150587298750464 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/thatbilloakley/status/2150853913870336 {{dead link|date=December 2017|url=|bot=TweetCiteBot}}</ref>\n* Carlos Hernandez ([[Herbert Siguenza]]) \u2013 Late 20s. He is a struggling Latino artist and [[stay-at-home dad]] for Baby Nameless. Unlike his wife Natalie, Carlos is a [[Christians|Christian]], his work is, at times, reminiscent of [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Bob Ross]]. He prides himself on having no discernible style. Carlos and Natalie have a pet snake as a result of an episode involving a raid on an animal testing lab.\n* Gwen ([[Jane Wiedlin]]) \u2013 Early 20s. Andy's on-and-off girlfriend, Gwen completed two years of community college before settling in Mission Hill. She met Andy working at Ron's [[Waterbed]] World. Someday she'd like to be an accomplished person who achieves her goals and makes a serious contribution to society. She likes [[The Go-Go's]].\n* Toby Mundorf ([[Josh Weinstein]]) \u2013 In his late teens and one of Kevin's best friends in Mission Hill. His overprotective mother worries a great deal about him, as he frequently suffers from allergies, asthma, and hunger. Despite his large size, he is a born coward.\n*  George Bang ([[Bill Oakley]]) \u2013 Kevin's other best friend. George works long hours after school in his father's market. George is extremely competitive in everything from taking tests to playing [[video game]]s. He shares all the same interests as his best friends and is particularly proud of owning the complete [[Babylon 5 Collectible Card Game]]. Unlike his friends Toby and Kevin, his parents don't seem to be overprotective, so he is more sarcastic and aggressive than either of them. George has an older sister named Tina who goes to Polytech. George is of Korean descent.\n* Ron ([[Nick Jameson]]) \u2013 A sleazy, immoral Armenian (though the commentary described Ron as being from a country that used to be a part of the [[Soviet Union]], which does include Armenia, but could also be any number of countries from Eastern Europe and Central Asia) man and former boss of Andy (who loathes him).

Mission Hill is a diverse neighborhood in a much larger city called '''Cosmopolis'''. Cosmopolis is depicted as a large modern urban [[metropolis]] similar to New York City or Chicago. The official website states Mission Hill is a mix of [[Mission Hill, Boston|Mission Hill]] in [[Boston]] (only miles away from where creator Bill Oakley went to college), Mission District in San Francisco, [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[Wicker Park, Chicago|Wicker Park]] in [[Chicago]], and [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. The exact location of Cosmopolis has never been revealed, as it is a mix of [[East Coast of the United States|East]] and [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] cities. Most of the series takes place in the neighborhood of Mission Hill, although the skyscrapers of Downtown Cosmopolis are seen in the background. In the DVD commentaries, Josh Weinstein says that a large portion of the development of the show was spent developing Mission Hill into a functional, albeit fictional, city. Writers and animators worked together to create fictional advertisements, bands, foods, and even bus schedules. Boston, MA has a neighborhood called Mission Hill in the Roxbury section of the city which bears many similarities to its fictional counterpart.\n\n==Home release==\n[[Image:missionhill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|DVD cover]]\n[[Warner Home Video]] released all 13 completed episodes on [[DVD]], on November 29, 2005. The collection replaced some of the original soundtracks with stock music, most glaringly \"Everybody Hurts\" by R.E.M. in the episode \"Andy vs. The Real World.\" The DVD collection also dubbed over some of the original voice tracks to remove any references to the replaced music, for example changing Andy's voice track from saying \"Gordon Lightfoot\" to \"Scott Joplin\" in the episode \"Unemployment - Part 1.\"\n\n==Awards==\n''Mission Hill'' received the 2000 Pulcinella Award for \"Best Series for All Audiences\"; the award cited the show's \"stylized design and honest approach to sexual and moral issues.\"\n\nThe show won an award from [[GLAAD]] for its positive portrayal of a gay relationship.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Animation|Comedy}}\n* [[Cult following#Cult television|Cult television]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0197148}}\n\n{{The WB Television Network}}\n\n[[Category:1990s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American LGBT-related television series]]\n[[Category:1990s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American adult animated television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American LGBT-related comedy television series]]\n[[Category:2000s American sitcoms]]\n[[Category:2002 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American adult animated comedy television series]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Film Roman television series]]\n[[Category:The WB original programming]]\n[[Category:LGBT-related animated series]]\n[[Category:American television series revived after cancellation]]\n[[Category:Animated television series about families]]\n[[Category:Television series by Castle Rock Entertainment]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

Examination of a [[peripheral blood smear]] and some other laboratory studies can contribute to the diagnosis. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include those that can occur in all anemias as well as the specific consequences of hemolysis. All anemias can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased ability to exercise when severe. Symptoms specifically related to hemolysis include [[jaundice]] and dark colored urine due to the presence of [[hemoglobin]] ([[hemoglobinuria]]). When restricted to the morning hemoglobinuria may suggest [[paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria]]. Direct examination of blood under a microscope in a [[peripheral blood smear]] may demonstrate red blood cell fragments called [[schistocytes]], red blood cells that look like spheres ([[spherocytes]]), and/or red blood cells missing small pieces ([[bite cell]]s). An increased number of newly made red blood cells ([[reticulocytes]]) may also be a sign of [[bone marrow]] compensation for anemia. Laboratory studies commonly used to investigate hemolytic anemia include blood tests for breakdown products of red blood cells, [[bilirubin]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase]], a test for the free hemoglobin binding protein [[haptoglobin]], and the direct [[Coombs test]] to evaluate [[antibody]] binding to red blood cells suggesting [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]].\n\n==Treatment==\n\nDefinitive therapy depends on the cause:\n*Symptomatic treatment can be given by [[blood transfusion]], if there is marked anemia. A positive Coombs test is a relative contraindication to transfuse the patient. In cold hemolytic anemia there is advantage in transfusing warmed blood. \n*In severe immune-related hemolytic anemia, [[steroid]] therapy is sometimes necessary.\n*In steroid resistant cases, consideration can be given to rituximab or addition of an immunosuppressant (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide).\n*Association of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin  can control hemolysis in acute severe cases.\n*Sometimes [[splenectomy]] can be helpful where extravascular hemolysis, or [[hereditary spherocytosis]], is predominant (i.e., most of the red blood cells are being removed by the spleen).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/hemolytic-anemias/ |title=Hemolytic Anemias, F.

The heme is ultimately converted to bilirubin and removed in stool and urine.<ref name=hillman1/> Hemoglobin may be cleared directly by the kidneys resulting in fast clearance of free hemoglobin but causing the continued loss of hemosiderin loaded renal tubular cells for many days.\n\nAdditional effects of free hemoglobin seem to be due to specific reactions with NO.<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Boretti FS, Buehler PW, D'Agnillo F, etal |title=Sequestration of extracellular hemoglobin within a haptoglobin complex decreases its hypertensive and oxidative effects in dogs and guinea pigs |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=119 |issue=8 |pages=2271\u201380 |date=August 2009 |pmid=19620788 |pmc=2719941 |doi=10.1172/JCI39115|url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/20201/1/Boretti_2009_JVIM_Comparison1.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThe diagnosis of hemolytic anemia can be suspected on the basis of a constellation of symptoms and is largely based on the presence of anemia, an increased proportion of immature red cells (reticulocytes) and a decrease in the level of haptoglobin, a protein that binds free hemoglobin. Examination of a [[peripheral blood smear]] and some other laboratory studies can contribute to the diagnosis. Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include those that can occur in all anemias as well as the specific consequences of hemolysis. All anemias can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, decreased ability to exercise when severe. Symptoms specifically related to hemolysis include [[jaundice]] and dark colored urine due to the presence of [[hemoglobin]] ([[hemoglobinuria]]). When restricted to the morning hemoglobinuria may suggest [[paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria]]. Direct examination of blood under a microscope in a [[peripheral blood smear]] may demonstrate red blood cell fragments called [[schistocytes]], red blood cells that look like spheres ([[spherocytes]]), and/or red blood cells missing small pieces ([[bite cell]]s). An increased number of newly made red blood cells ([[reticulocytes]]) may also be a sign of [[bone marrow]] compensation for anemia. Laboratory studies commonly used to investigate hemolytic anemia include blood tests for breakdown products of red blood cells, [[bilirubin]] and [[lactate dehydrogenase]], a test for the free hemoglobin binding protein [[haptoglobin]], and the direct [[Coombs test]] to evaluate [[antibody]] binding to red blood cells suggesting [[autoimmune hemolytic anemia]].\n\n==Treatment==\n\nDefinitive therapy depends on the cause:\n*Symptomatic treatment can be given by [[blood transfusion]], if there is marked anemia. A positive Coombs test is a relative contraindication to transfuse the patient. In cold hemolytic anemia there is advantage in transfusing warmed blood. \n*In severe immune-related hemolytic anemia, [[steroid]] therapy is sometimes necessary.\n*In steroid resistant cases, consideration can be given to rituximab or addition of an immunosuppressant (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide).\n*Association of methylprednisolone and intravenous immunoglobulin  can control hemolysis in acute severe cases.\n*Sometimes [[splenectomy]] can be helpful where extravascular hemolysis, or [[hereditary spherocytosis]], is predominant (i.e., most of the red blood cells are being removed by the spleen).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalassistantonlineprograms.org/hemolytic-anemias/ |title=Hemolytic Anemias, F.

The mansion was constructed  during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During [[World War II]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]. The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"[[Ultra]]\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.<ref name=\"HinsleyLecture\">{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}</ref> The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the  development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.{{efn|Colossus itself was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London, to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the GC&CS. From there, it (and nine more) were installed and operated in Bletchley.}} Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations.

Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.<ref>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13\u201334}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese signals===\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB).

The mansion was constructed  during the years following 1883 for the English financier and politician Sir [[Herbert Leon]] in the Victorian Gothic, Tudor, and Dutch Baroque styles, on the site of older buildings of the same name. During [[World War II]], the estate housed the British [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS), which regularly penetrated the secret communications of the [[Axis Powers]]{{snd}}most importantly the German [[Enigma (machine)|Enigma]] and [[Lorenz cipher|Lorenz]] ciphers; among its most notable early personnel the GC&CS team of codebreakers included [[Alan Turing]], [[Gordon Welchman]], [[Conel Hugh O'Donel Alexander|Hugh Alexander]] and [[Stuart Milner-Barry]]. The nature of the work there was secret until many years after the war.\n\nAccording to the official historian of British Intelligence, the \"[[Ultra]]\" intelligence produced at Bletchley shortened the war by two to four years, and without it the outcome of the war would have been uncertain.<ref name=\"HinsleyLecture\">{{Harvnb|Hinsley|1996}}</ref> The team at Bletchley Park devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, culminating in the  development of [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer.{{efn|Colossus itself was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]] in London, to solve a problem posed by mathematician [[Max Newman]] at the GC&CS. From there, it (and nine more) were installed and operated in Bletchley.}} Codebreaking operations at Bletchley Park came to an end in 1946 and all information about the wartime operations was classified until the mid 1970s. After the war, the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] took over the site and used it as a management school, but by 1990 the huts in which the codebreakers worked were being considered for demolition and redevelopment. The Bletchley Park Trust was formed in 1991 to save large portions of the site from developers. More recently, Bletchley Park has been open to the public and houses interpretive exhibits and rebuilt huts as they would have appeared during their wartime operations. It receives hundreds of thousands of visitors annually.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|title=Bletchley Park Welcomes 2015'S 200,000th Visitor|publisher=Bletchley Park|date=26 August 2015|accessdate=25 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202043901/https://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/news/v.rhtm/Bletchley_Park_welcomes_2015s_200000th_visitor-908901.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The separate [[The National Museum of Computing|National Museum of Computing]], which includes a working replica [[Bombe]] machine and a rebuilt [[Colossus computer]], is housed in Block H on the site.\n\n==History==\nThe site appears in the [[Domesday Book]] as part of the [[Water Eaton, Milton Keynes|Manor of Eaton]].

They devised automatic machinery to help with decryption, which culminated in [[Colossus computer|Colossus]], the world's first programmable digital electronic computer. This was designed and built by [[Tommy Flowers]] and his team at the [[Post Office Research Station]] at [[Dollis Hill]]. The prototype first worked in December 1943, was delivered to Bletchley Park in January and first worked operationally on 5 February 1944.

Two Russian high-grade army and navy systems were broken early in 1940. Tiltman spent two weeks in Finland, where he obtained Russian traffic from Finland and Estonia in exchange for radio equipment. In June 1941, when the Soviet Union became an ally, Churchill ordered a halt to intelligence operations against it. In December 1941, the Russian section was closed down, but in late summer 1943 or late 1944, a small GC&CS Russian cypher section was set up in London overlooking Park Lane, then in Sloane Square.<ref>{{Citation |last=Smith |first=Michael | author-link = Michael Smith (newspaper reporter) |title=The Government Code and Cypher School and the First Cold War |year=2011 |pages=13\u201334}} in {{Harvnb|Erskine|Smith|2011}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese signals===\nAn outpost of the Government Code and Cypher School had been set up in Hong Kong in 1935, the [[Far East Combined Bureau]] (FECB).

Police units were under the rule of the district magistrates.\n\n===1825 \u2013 NSW Mounted Police===\nAfter the conflict in 1824 with the [[Wiradjuri]] people around [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and [[Mudgee]], British authorities recognised the need for a mounted force to maintain control in frontier areas. As a result, the NSW Mounted Police was formed in the following year. Up until 1850, this force operated as ''de facto'' cavalry unit as the troopers were soldiers requisitioned from the [[British Army]]. Their main task in this period was to subjugate resisting groups of Aboriginals and capture bushrangers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=John|title=Mounted Police in NSW|date=1979|publisher=Rigby|pages=1\u201334}}</ref> From 1850 the Mounted Police took on a more civilian role.

A new frontier police consisting of mounted convict troopers, called the [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]], was therefore established. The convicts assigned were mostly soldiers who had run foul of the law. The Border Police was funded by a levy placed on the squatters who had brought livestock into the areas beyond the borders of settlement. In addition to controlling the Aboriginal and bushranger threats, the Border Police were also tasked with resolving land disputes with the squatters.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=John|title=Mounted Police in NSW|date=1979|publisher=Rigby|pages=35\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===1848 \u2013 Native Police===\nWith the end of convict transportation approaching, the Border Police was dissolved and replaced with another low cost frontier force called the [[Native Police]]. This force consisted of Aboriginal troopers under the command of British officers. Exploiting intertribal hostility, the duty of this force was mostly to crush any Aboriginal resistance to the spread of British settlement. From 1859, the responsibility of the Native Police passed from the NSW government to the newly formed Queensland government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=John|title=Mounted Police in NSW|date=1979|publisher=Rigby|pages=145\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n===Police Regulation Act, 1862===\nAs the colony expanded, a more sophisticated form of crime management was called for; this involved unifying all the police units into a single cohesive police force with the centralisation of authority. After a failed attempt made by Act No. 38 of 1850, unified control of the police eventuated in 1862 when the Police Regulation Act (1862) was passed, establishing the New South Wales Police Force. The first inspector general of police, [[John McLerie]], was appointed to assume overall authority and responsibility. The Police Regulation (Amendment) Act, passed in 1935, changed the official title to commissioner of police, with its role clearly defined.

The rank of probationary constable is held for the first twelve months of service. Following 12 months of satisfactory service and on completion of the associate degree of policing practice via distance education, the probationary constable is confirmed to the rank of constable. Within the force, probationary constables are often referred to as \"probies\".\n\nPromotion to the rank of senior constable can be obtained after five years service and requires the officer to pass an examination which can cover a broad area of policing knowledge. Incremental senior constable is obtained after ten years of service. Senior constables of all grades are referred to as either \"senior constable\" or \"senior\". \n\nLeading Senior Constable is a rank that primarily sees an officer in a training role and belongs to a specific unit or duty type of which there is a limited number with progression to such being competitive and non-transferable. If an LSC transfers from a unit or duty type (such as from highway patrol to general duties or vice versa) they revert to their original senior constable rank. To be eligible for LSC an officer must have a minimum of 7 years service, be of the rank of senior constable and undergo a number of tests and selection processes in competition with other applicants.\n\n===Non-commissioned officers===\n\nPromotion to the rank of sergeant and beyond is achieved by way of a \"merit based\" promotion system, whereby officers undertake a series of \"pre-qualification assessments\" and are placed on a ranked list before gaining promotion. Officers who qualify for a promotion list are given an eligibility mark and are ranked according to order of merit from the highest mark to the lowest. This means that the highest-ranked member on the promotions list will be considered first for the rank and position concerned. Members seeking placement on a promotion list must have spent the requisite time at the rank below, which is at least two years, and must have successfully completed the relevant pre-qualifying assessment examinations, an applicant evaluation and must meet the eligibility program.  A new promotion list for each rank or grade is prepared each year, and an applicant who does not accept promotion can remain on a list only for three years before having to requalify for the list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LA20060906 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 December 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102121438/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LA20060906 |archivedate=2 January 2008  }}</ref>\n\nOn promotion to sergeant and senior sergeant, members are issued a warrant of appointment under the commissioner's hand and seal.\n\nA sergeant normally supervises a team of constables during a shift. A detective sergeant is normally in charge of a team in a specific part of either a local area command detectives office or a specialist squad in the State Crime Command.\n\nSenior sergeants are generally attached to \"regions\" as region training coordinators, region traffic coordinators, region operations coordinator positions or in legal services, professional standards, protocol, education services and perform middle-management duties.\n\nSergeants and incremental sergeants are referred to as \"sergeant\"; senior sergeants are referred to as \"senior sergeant\".\n\n===Commissioned officers===\nOn completing at least three years as a sergeant (but usually more), and the relevant pre-qualification assessments, an officer may be elevated to the rank of \"inspector\" and issued a certificate of commission under the commissioner's hand and seal. Commissioned officers may be acknowledged by the rank they hold or more commonly as \"sir\", \"ma'am\" or \"boss\" (\"boss\" is usually used as a term of endearment for officers that are respected by the subordinate rank).\n\nAn inspector oversees sergeants and teams of constables and traditionally performs more administrative work, coordination of policing operations or specialist work. At local area commands, an inspector is allocated to each shift as a \"duty officer\" and oversees the general running of the police station.\n\nSuperintendents are usually \"commanders\" of local area commands or specialist units.\n\nAssistant commissioners are generally \"commanders\" of regions or corporate portfolios.\n\nAs of 2010, the rank of senior assistant commissioner has been dispensed with. Officers currently holding this rank will retain it until retiring or upon promotion to a higher rank.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Designations===\nIf a New South Wales Police Force officer elects to undertake criminal investigation duties, after a period of exams and assignments, and given experience in a criminal investigation office that officer is given the designation of \"detective\". As it is a designation and not a rank, the designation comes prior to the rank, i.e. detective constable, or detective senior constable etc. Returning to general duties (uniform) is common for detectives, and many detectives do seek promotion in the general duties arena. However, while they do not lose their detective's designation if they leave full-time investigation duties, it is customary not to use their designation while performing general or other duties which are not an authorised investigative position. On returning to an authorised position they can use their designation again without having to requalify. There has been some consideration given by the police force in recent years to identify designated detectives performing uniform duties by way of a distinctive badge or uniform embellishment, but this has not been adopted.\n\n==Uniform and equipment==\n[[File:NSW Police Force Command Post @ Operation EXERT - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images.jpg|thumb|Officers in operational uniforms]]\n[[File:Eglintontruck20060703 4.jpg|thumb|Officers in [[High-visibility clothing|high-visibility]] jackets at an accident]]\n\n===Field and service dress===\nNew South Wales Police Force has two uniforms for general duties police officers, one operational (field dress) and one ceremonial (service dress).\n\nField dress consists of navy blue cargo pants with map pockets, ballooned at the bottom, light blue marle short or long sleeve shirt, navy blue baseball cap with blue and white [[Sillitoe Tartan]], and black general purpose boots. During winter a navy blue polartec-fleece jacket or leather jacket is worn. Ranks are worn on the shoulders by both NCOs and commissioned ranks.\n\nService dress consists of general purpose boots, straight leg navy blue trousers, blue marle shirt, antron cap/hat and leather duty jacket. Depending on rank, members may be issued with high-shine polishable lace-up leather boots for ceremonial occasions, similar to that worn by military personnel.\n\nOfficers wear a similar uniform when attending court proceedings, this is usually the full service dress both during summer and winter.\n\nDuring ceremonial occasions, NSW Police Force College staff, New South Wales Police Force protocol and NSW Police Force field protocol officers generally wear a navy blue ceremonial tunic during official occasions such as attestation parades (passing out parades), medal ceremonies and funerals, etc.\n\nField protocol officers are issued with a light blue/navy blue lanyard to be worn over the right shoulder and tucked into the right pocket during ceremonial occasions.\n\nFull-time protocol officers and members of the [[New South Wales Police Force#Volunteering and NSW Police|VIP]] cyclists are entitled to wear a black basketweave Sam Browne belt during ceremonial occasions.\n\nIn line with the name change of the organisation back to \"NSW Police Force\", the current shoulder patch for uniform reads New South Wales Police Force, and has a redesigned and recoloured eagle.\n\n===Specialist groups and special events===\nNew South Wales Police Force officers are also entitled to wear [[mess dress]] with mess kit for black tie or formal dinners/dances. The dark navy blue trousers and mess jacket with cobalt blue cuffs, epaulettes (with ranks) and lapels clearly identify them as being members of the police.\n\nSpecialist units such as the [[Public Order and Riot Squad]], Homicide Squad, Marine Area Command and the [[State Protection Group]] Tactical Operations Unit all have different uniform needs and are outfitted accordingly such as [[State Protection Group|Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit]] with their white overalls, [[State Protection Group|Tactical Operations Unit]] (TOU) with black and Dog Squad with subdued blue. Detectives wear plain clothes.\n\nDuring [[ANZAC day]] marches and United Nations Day marches in Sydney, police officers can be seen alongside their Australian Federal Police counterparts wearing the distinctive United Nations blue beret and full sized medals, if they have served with the Australian Federal Police in United Nations sanctioned peacekeeping operations.\n\n===Arms and appointments===\n\n====Firearms====\n\nMembers of the NSW Police are issued with the [[Glock 22]] [[.40 S&W|.40-calibre]] semi-automatic pistol.

The primary function is to educate and train police officers from the newly recruited to the senior executive level.\n\nLocated in the Memorial & Honour Precincts, the Academy has a number of memorials dedicated to the proud traditions of the New South Wales Police Force, namely the Walls of Remembrance at the College Chapel (which feature those who have died on duty on the northern side, and those who have served in war and peacekeeping operations on the southern side); the Rose Garden and Eternal Flame; the NSW Police Force Horse & Dog Memorial; and Heroes' Walk (featuring 15 bravery banners including George Cross, Cross of Valour, Star of Courage and George Medal police recipients).\n\nThe latest aspect to the \"proud traditions project\" was the installation of the NSW Police Academy Peacekeeping display. The display features a range of memorabilia and photographs from peacekeeping missions which NSW Police Force members have contributed to. The display also features the Dag Hammerskjold Medal belonging to the late Sergeant Ian Ward, on loan from the AFP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peacekeepingmemorial.org.au/news/news52.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218112320/http://www.peacekeepingmemorial.org.au/news/news52.php|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 February 2011|title=Australian Peacekeeping Memorial Project \u2013 News|first=Australian Peacekeeping Memorial|last=Project|website=www.peacekeepingmemorial.org.au}}</ref><ref>[http://www.pfa.org.au/files/uploads/True_Blue_Autumn_2009.pdf]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Students===\nThe Academy has a constant stream of recruits. On 30 January 2007 the largest class of police recruits, numbering 799, in Australia were attested on the parade ground. In May 2007, a further 284 recruits were attested. Students are identified by a light blue hat band and light blue epaulettes with the word STUDENT (in block capitals, as here) as opposed to rank.<ref>[https://archive.is/20131117080039/https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/q71/s720x720/1384101_471521642961814_2143276702_n.jpg]</ref>\n\n===Qualification===\nThe 'Associate Degree of Policing Practice' is awarded to a graduate of the college by its university provider, [[Charles Sturt University]] (CSU).<ref>[http://www.csu.edu.au/about/goulb.html Goulburn \u2013 School of Policing Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012005427/http://www.csu.edu.au/about/goulb.html |date=12 October 2006 }}.

Examples are: the three-year Bachelor of Policing course (offered by the [[University of Western Sydney]], or the Bachelor of Justice Studies (Policing) course of the same length offered also by [[Charles Sturt University]] (Bathurst Campus). Both of these courses require the final portion to be completed at the Goulburn Police College, alongside common-entry recruits, for the practical components of policing education.\n\n===Charles Sturt University campus===\nCharles Sturt University has a campus on the grounds of the Academy. The School of Policing Practice forms part of the Faculty of Business, Justice and Behavioural Studies. The School also offers the Bachelor of Policing and the Bachelor of Policing (Investigations).\n\n==Symbols and tradition==\n'''NSW Police Force Banner'''\n[[Image:NSW Police flag.jpg|thumb|300px|Flag of the NSW Police Force]]\nOn 29 September 2006, [[Governor of New South Wales]] [[Marie Bashir]] presented the NSW Police Banner to the New South Wales Police Force at a ceremony adjacent to the NSW Police Force Roll of Honour at [[the Domain]] in Sydney, Australia. Later that day, the banner led the NSW Police Force marching contingent at the dedication of the [[National Police Memorial Australia|National Police Memorial]] in Canberra.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-99231568.html]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Flag and pennants'''\n\nThe Force has an official flag, with the 'Nemesis' logo on a light blue over white bicolour.\n\nThe Mounted Police unit carries a swallowtailed navy blue and white pennant on lances, without the nemesis logo.\n\nThe commissioner and the [[New South Wales Police Force#Volunteering and NSW Police|VIP]] cyclists have a nemesis logo on a light blue over white bicolour pennant on their transportation. The pennant is swallowtailed.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nRecognition for the bravery and sacrifice of members of the New South Wales Police Force is expressed through honours and awards. The New South Wales Police Force was the first Australian Police jurisdiction to have one of its members awarded the Imperial Honour,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} namely the [[George Cross]] and the Australian Honour the [[Cross of Valour (Australia)|Cross of Valour]]. Sergeant 3rd Class [[Eric Bailey (GC)|Eric George Bailey]] GC was awarded the [[George Cross]] posthumously on 12 January 1945.\n\nNew South Wales Police Force also has the distinction in having one of its members being awarded the highest civilian bravery award, namely the [[Cross of Valour (Australia)|Cross of Valour]]. In its history, only five people have been awarded that award, with a New South Wales Police Officer being the first Australian Police Officer to receive it. On 3 May 1996, the then Detective Senior Constable Sparkes rescued a boy trapped in a flooded underground storm water drain following record rainfalls at Coffs Harbour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honoured/sparkes.cfm|title=It's an Honour \u2013 Honours \u2013 Honoured Australians \u2013 Allan Sparkes|work=itsanhonour.gov.au|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504022759/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honoured/sparkes.cfm|archivedate=4 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Australian honours and awards===\nNew South Wales Police Force Officers are eligible for the following National Honours and Awards:\n* Australian Bravery Decorations, namely the [[Cross of Valour (Australia)|Cross of Valour]] (CV), [[Star of Courage (Australia)|Star of Courage]] (SC), [[Bravery Medal (Australia)|Bravery Medal]] (BM) and the [[Commendation for Brave Conduct]].\n* [[Australian Police Medal]] (APM) (Rarely awarded to non commissioned officers)\n* [[Police Overseas Service Medal (Australia)|Police Overseas Service Medal]];\n* [[National Police Service Medal]]\n* [[National Medal (Australia)|National Medal]];\n* Campaign Medals such as [[United Nations Medal|United Nations Medal For Service]].\n\n===Internal New South Wales Police honours and awards===\nNew South Wales Police Force also has a number of inservice Honours and Awards, awarded by the Commissioner of New South Wales Police Force. Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police commissioner)|Peter Ryan]] [[Queen's Police Medal|QPM]] implemented the New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Olympic Commendation and the New South Wales Police Force Olympic Citation. This award is significant as the New South Wales Police Force is the only police force in the world to be permitted the Olympic Rings to be attached. It has been widely reported and accepted that the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]] was the \"Safest Games in modern Olympic history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media%2Fpressrel%2FHAL26%22 |title=ParlInfo \u2013 Commonwealth contributes to safety of best games ever |publisher=Parlinfo.aph.gov.au |date=9 October 2000}}</ref>\n\nFormer commissioner [[Ken Moroney]] [[Order of Australia|AO]] [[Australian Police Medal|APM]] implemented the Commissioners Community Service Commendation and Community Service Citation in 2002.\n\nPolice honours and awards are highly prized partly because they are only awarded to members in small numbers and are rarely issued to general duties police.  The only award that was given out in large numbers was the Commissioner's Olympic Citation due to the massive contribution by all members of the force. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Commendations and medals===\n* New South Wales Police Force Valour Award (VA);\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Commendation (Courage);\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Commendation (Service);\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Olympic Commendation;\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Community Service Commendation;\n* [[Police Diligent and Ethical Service Medal|New South Wales Police Force Medal for Diligent and Ethical Service]] (awarded after 10 years' service, with clasps awarded for every five years thereafter).\nThe above in-service decorations are worn 5&nbsp;mm below the officer's name plate and are right-sided decorations.\n\n===Citations===\nThe following in-service decorations are worn 5&nbsp;mm above the officer's name plate and are right-sided decorations.\n* '''New South Wales Police Force Unit Citation''' (maximum three further awards are indicated by silver stars) \u2013 metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with light blue enamel centre;\n* '''New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Community Service Citation''' (maximum one further award indicated by one silver star) \u2013 metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with white enamel centre.\n* '''New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Olympic Citation''' \u2013 metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with navy blue enamel centre and silver Olympic rings ;\n* '''[[New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Sesquicentenary Citation]]''' \u2013 metal device, with thin silver surround, with navy blue and light blue striped enamel centre and silver numerals of '1862' '150' '2012' with a depiction of the State of NSW and silitoe tartan.\n\n==Peacekeeping==\nIn [[peacekeeping]] operations, officers are seconded to the Australian Federal Police and take an oath or affirmation of the AFP. They are then appointed to the rank of senior sergeant, station sergeant, superintendent or commander. Following their service, UN peacekeeping veterans are awarded the [[United Nations Medal]] for their particular mission. In addition, under the Australian system of honours and awards, police officers serving with peacekeeping organisations are awarded the Police Overseas Service Medal with the relevant clasp for the prescribed area of service. As of 2008, two clasps to that medal were awarded to members for operations in [[Cyprus]] and [[East Timor]].\n\n===Cyprus (UNFICYP)===\nMembers were among the first Australian police sent to Cyprus in May 1964 as the first UN police contingent. The UN Civilian Police (now known as [[UNPOL]] or United Nations Police) was established with a three-month mandate to end hostilities between the Greek and Turkish communities and promote peace on the island. The operation is ongoing.\n\nMembers were subsequently withdrawn from Cyprus in 1976, along with all other state and territory police following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] on 20 July 1974. During the invasion and preceding it the Australian police were subject to machine gun and mortar fire and Turkish air attack. Some of their personal motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal items at that time were destroyed, lost or stolen. Fortunately, there was no loss of Australian lives at that time. Australian police continued to negotiate between the invading Turkish army, other warring parties and escorted refugees to safety from both sides.<ref>Denis Percy. President of the United Nations Police Association of Australia. 2007.</ref> Since [[UNFICYP]] commenced, a large number of the NSW Police has served in Cyprus alongside other Australian police jurisdictions.\n\n===East Timor (UNTAET and UNMISET)===\nFrom 2000 to 2005, 45 NSW Police Force officers were involved in the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET) and the [[United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor]] (UNMISET) seconded to the Australian Federal Police for their Tour of Duty in [[East Timor]] with the United Nations. There have only been three female NSWP officers to serve.\n\nIn addition, two New South Wales Police Force officers have been commended for courage for peacekeeping in East Timor, one by the Australian government, and the Australian Federal Police Commissioners Commendation for Bravery (station sergeant David McCann OAM \u2013 UNMISET<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/36828/PlatAprilforWeb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026051732/http://www.afp.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/36828/PlatAprilforWeb.pdf |archivedate=26 October 2009  }}</ref> and one by the commissioner (senior sergeant Mark Aubrey Gilpin \u2013 UNTAET). McCann was awarded the Commendation for Brave Conduct for his part in the rescue of 110 vulnerable persons from a village in East Timor after it suffered major flooding. Gilpin was awarded the New South Wales Police Commendation (courage) for his part in protecting a member of the community who was being subjected to [[mob justice]]. He placed his body in front of the mob, who were armed with machettes and other weapons and managed to extract the victim to safety.\n\nOut of the ten Australian peacekeepers who have died on peacekeeping missions, two were from NSW Police Force while serving with UNFICYP. Sergeant Ian Ward and Inspector Patrick Hackett died in separate incidents in UNFCYP. A total of 124 soldiers and police gave their lives while serving with the UN in Cyprus.<ref>NSW Police Force Honour Roll.

Police units were under the rule of the district magistrates.\n\n===1825 \u2013 NSW Mounted Police===\nAfter the conflict in 1824 with the [[Wiradjuri]] people around [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]] and [[Mudgee]], British authorities recognised the need for a mounted force to maintain control in frontier areas. As a result, the NSW Mounted Police was formed in the following year. Up until 1850, this force operated as ''de facto'' cavalry unit as the troopers were soldiers requisitioned from the [[British Army]]. Their main task in this period was to subjugate resisting groups of Aboriginals and capture bushrangers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=John|title=Mounted Police in NSW|date=1979|publisher=Rigby|pages=1\u201334}}</ref> From 1850 the Mounted Police took on a more civilian role.

A new frontier police consisting of mounted convict troopers, called the [[Border Police of New South Wales|Border Police]], was therefore established. The convicts assigned were mostly soldiers who had run foul of the law. The Border Police was funded by a levy placed on the squatters who had brought livestock into the areas beyond the borders of settlement. In addition to controlling the Aboriginal and bushranger threats, the Border Police were also tasked with resolving land disputes with the squatters.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=John|title=Mounted Police in NSW|date=1979|publisher=Rigby|pages=35\u201345}}</ref>\n\n===1848 \u2013 Native Police===\nWith the end of convict transportation approaching, the Border Police was dissolved and replaced with another low cost frontier force called the [[Native Police]]. This force consisted of Aboriginal troopers under the command of British officers. Exploiting intertribal hostility, the duty of this force was mostly to crush any Aboriginal resistance to the spread of British settlement. From 1859, the responsibility of the Native Police passed from the NSW government to the newly formed Queensland government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=John|title=Mounted Police in NSW|date=1979|publisher=Rigby|pages=145\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n===Police Regulation Act, 1862===\nAs the colony expanded, a more sophisticated form of crime management was called for; this involved unifying all the police units into a single cohesive police force with the centralisation of authority. After a failed attempt made by Act No. 38 of 1850, unified control of the police eventuated in 1862 when the Police Regulation Act (1862) was passed, establishing the New South Wales Police Force. The first inspector general of police, [[John McLerie]], was appointed to assume overall authority and responsibility. The Police Regulation (Amendment) Act, passed in 1935, changed the official title to commissioner of police, with its role clearly defined.

[[Constable Byrne]] almost single-handedly fought off the [[Ben Hall gang]] when they attacked a gold escort at Major's Creek on 13 March 1865. Constable O'Grady was taken ill with cholera when, on 9 April 1866, he left his sick-bed to confront the Clarke gang, who were renowned as being the \"bloodiest bushrangers\" of the colony of NSW and of Australia. Constable Walker was one of the earliest Australian-born mounted [[Trooper (police rank)|troopers]] to gain fame. He brought [[Captain Thunderbolt]]'s enduring \"bushranging\" career to an end by shooting him near Uralla in [[New England (Australia)|New England]], NSW.\n\nConstable Ernest Charles Day (later the [[Inspector General of Police]]) showed courage under fire when he shot and captured bushranger Hobson, who was later hanged.

The rank of probationary constable is held for the first twelve months of service. Following 12 months of satisfactory service and on completion of the associate degree of policing practice via distance education, the probationary constable is confirmed to the rank of constable. Within the force, probationary constables are often referred to as \"probies\".\n\nPromotion to the rank of senior constable can be obtained after five years service and requires the officer to pass an examination which can cover a broad area of policing knowledge. Incremental senior constable is obtained after ten years of service. Senior constables of all grades are referred to as either \"senior constable\" or \"senior\". \n\nLeading Senior Constable is a rank that primarily sees an officer in a training role and belongs to a specific unit or duty type of which there is a limited number with progression to such being competitive and non-transferable. If an LSC transfers from a unit or duty type (such as from highway patrol to general duties or vice versa) they revert to their original senior constable rank. To be eligible for LSC an officer must have a minimum of 7 years service, be of the rank of senior constable and undergo a number of tests and selection processes in competition with other applicants.\n\n===Non-commissioned officers===\n\nPromotion to the rank of sergeant and beyond is achieved by way of a \"merit based\" promotion system, whereby officers undertake a series of \"pre-qualification assessments\" and are placed on a ranked list before gaining promotion. Officers who qualify for a promotion list are given an eligibility mark and are ranked according to order of merit from the highest mark to the lowest. This means that the highest-ranked member on the promotions list will be considered first for the rank and position concerned. Members seeking placement on a promotion list must have spent the requisite time at the rank below, which is at least two years, and must have successfully completed the relevant pre-qualifying assessment examinations, an applicant evaluation and must meet the eligibility program.  A new promotion list for each rank or grade is prepared each year, and an applicant who does not accept promotion can remain on a list only for three years before having to requalify for the list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LA20060906 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=31 December 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102121438/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hanstrans.nsf/V3ByKey/LA20060906 |archivedate=2 January 2008  }}</ref>\n\nOn promotion to sergeant and senior sergeant, members are issued a warrant of appointment under the commissioner's hand and seal.\n\nA sergeant normally supervises a team of constables during a shift. A detective sergeant is normally in charge of a team in a specific part of either a local area command detectives office or a specialist squad in the State Crime Command.\n\nSenior sergeants are generally attached to \"regions\" as region training coordinators, region traffic coordinators, region operations coordinator positions or in legal services, professional standards, protocol, education services and perform middle-management duties.\n\nSergeants and incremental sergeants are referred to as \"sergeant\"; senior sergeants are referred to as \"senior sergeant\".\n\n===Commissioned officers===\nOn completing at least three years as a sergeant (but usually more), and the relevant pre-qualification assessments, an officer may be elevated to the rank of \"inspector\" and issued a certificate of commission under the commissioner's hand and seal. Commissioned officers may be acknowledged by the rank they hold or more commonly as \"sir\", \"ma'am\" or \"boss\" (\"boss\" is usually used as a term of endearment for officers that are respected by the subordinate rank).\n\nAn inspector oversees sergeants and teams of constables and traditionally performs more administrative work, coordination of policing operations or specialist work. At local area commands, an inspector is allocated to each shift as a \"duty officer\" and oversees the general running of the police station.\n\nSuperintendents are usually \"commanders\" of local area commands or specialist units.\n\nAssistant commissioners are generally \"commanders\" of regions or corporate portfolios.\n\nAs of 2010, the rank of senior assistant commissioner has been dispensed with. Officers currently holding this rank will retain it until retiring or upon promotion to a higher rank.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n===Designations===\nIf a New South Wales Police Force officer elects to undertake criminal investigation duties, after a period of exams and assignments, and given experience in a criminal investigation office that officer is given the designation of \"detective\". As it is a designation and not a rank, the designation comes prior to the rank, i.e. detective constable, or detective senior constable etc. Returning to general duties (uniform) is common for detectives, and many detectives do seek promotion in the general duties arena. However, while they do not lose their detective's designation if they leave full-time investigation duties, it is customary not to use their designation while performing general or other duties which are not an authorised investigative position. On returning to an authorised position they can use their designation again without having to requalify. There has been some consideration given by the police force in recent years to identify designated detectives performing uniform duties by way of a distinctive badge or uniform embellishment, but this has not been adopted.\n\n==Uniform and equipment==\n[[File:NSW Police Force Command Post @ Operation EXERT - Flickr - Highway Patrol Images.jpg|thumb|Officers in operational uniforms]]\n[[File:Eglintontruck20060703 4.jpg|thumb|Officers in [[High-visibility clothing|high-visibility]] jackets at an accident]]\n\n===Field and service dress===\nNew South Wales Police Force has two uniforms for general duties police officers, one operational (field dress) and one ceremonial (service dress).\n\nField dress consists of navy blue cargo pants with map pockets, ballooned at the bottom, light blue marle short or long sleeve shirt, navy blue baseball cap with blue and white [[Sillitoe Tartan]], and black general purpose boots. During winter a navy blue polartec-fleece jacket or leather jacket is worn. Ranks are worn on the shoulders by both NCOs and commissioned ranks.\n\nService dress consists of general purpose boots, straight leg navy blue trousers, blue marle shirt, antron cap/hat and leather duty jacket. Depending on rank, members may be issued with high-shine polishable lace-up leather boots for ceremonial occasions, similar to that worn by military personnel.\n\nOfficers wear a similar uniform when attending court proceedings, this is usually the full service dress both during summer and winter.\n\nDuring ceremonial occasions, NSW Police Force College staff, New South Wales Police Force protocol and NSW Police Force field protocol officers generally wear a navy blue ceremonial tunic during official occasions such as attestation parades (passing out parades), medal ceremonies and funerals, etc.\n\nField protocol officers are issued with a light blue/navy blue lanyard to be worn over the right shoulder and tucked into the right pocket during ceremonial occasions.\n\nFull-time protocol officers and members of the [[New South Wales Police Force#Volunteering and NSW Police|VIP]] cyclists are entitled to wear a black basketweave Sam Browne belt during ceremonial occasions.\n\nIn line with the name change of the organisation back to \"NSW Police Force\", the current shoulder patch for uniform reads New South Wales Police Force, and has a redesigned and recoloured eagle.\n\n===Specialist groups and special events===\nNew South Wales Police Force officers are also entitled to wear [[mess dress]] with mess kit for black tie or formal dinners/dances. The dark navy blue trousers and mess jacket with cobalt blue cuffs, epaulettes (with ranks) and lapels clearly identify them as being members of the police.\n\nSpecialist units such as the [[Public Order and Riot Squad]], Homicide Squad, Marine Area Command and the [[State Protection Group]] Tactical Operations Unit all have different uniform needs and are outfitted accordingly such as [[State Protection Group|Rescue and Bomb Disposal Unit]] with their white overalls, [[State Protection Group|Tactical Operations Unit]] (TOU) with black and Dog Squad with subdued blue. Detectives wear plain clothes.\n\nDuring [[ANZAC day]] marches and United Nations Day marches in Sydney, police officers can be seen alongside their Australian Federal Police counterparts wearing the distinctive United Nations blue beret and full sized medals, if they have served with the Australian Federal Police in United Nations sanctioned peacekeeping operations.\n\n===Arms and appointments===\n\n====Firearms====\n\nMembers of the NSW Police are issued with the [[Glock 22]] [[.40 S&W|.40-calibre]] semi-automatic pistol. After the work of Task Force ALPHA 1992 and the research testing and report done by senior constable Darren Stewart recommending the introduction of the Glock 22 superseding the Smith & Wesson .38 calbre model 10 with some specialist sections and plain clothes officers having either the smaller [[Glock 23]] or [[Glock 27]] models available in lieu of the standard model. Members are also issued with a spare magazine for their pistol due to the murder of two officers at Crescent Head in 1995 when officers carried the [[Smith & Wesson Model 10]] in [[.38 Special]]. Specialist tactical units such as the full-time [[State Protection Group#Tactical Operations Unit (TOU)|Tactical Operations Unit]] (and part-time regional [[State Protection Group#State Protection Support Units (SPSU)|State Protection Support Units]]) are equipped with a variety of specialised firearms for their duties.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://images.smh.com.au/2011/09/07/2608619/vd-police-408x264.jpg|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=(Untitled)|accessdate=5 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073817/http://images.smh.com.au/2011/09/07/2608619/vd-police-408x264.jpg|archivedate=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://transform.fairfaxregional.com.au/transform/v1/resize/frm/storypad-xhi9gmXHj93h4bBH6YrLKD/acd2260f-acf2-4772-9c19-94b741ce816a.jpg/w1200_h678_fcrop.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 November 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006074355/http://transform.fairfaxregional.com.au/transform/v1/resize/frm/storypad-xhi9gmXHj93h4bBH6YrLKD/acd2260f-acf2-4772-9c19-94b741ce816a.jpg/w1200_h678_fcrop.jpg |archivedate=6 October 2014  }}</ref> The [[Public Order and Riot Squad]] are issued with a variety of specialist equipment for their roles including Colt M4 Carbine rifles.<ref>https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-18/nsw-police-with-new-colt-m4-carbine-guns-to-protect-sydney/9268084</ref>\n\n====Equipment and holsters====\n\nIn addition to the standard issue firearm, officers are issued with Saflock (mark IV & V) handcuffs, [[Pepper spray|OC]] (capsicum spray), [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable baton]], Motorola XTS3000/XTS5000/XTS2500 (Digital UHF) or Tait Orca (VHF) portable radio, and a first-aid kit.

Later that day, the banner led the NSW Police Force marching contingent at the dedication of the [[National Police Memorial Australia|National Police Memorial]] in Canberra.<ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-99231568.html]{{dead link|date=April 2018}}</ref>\n\n'''Flag and pennants'''\n\nThe Force has an official flag, with the 'Nemesis' logo on a light blue over white bicolour.\n\nThe Mounted Police unit carries a swallowtailed navy blue and white pennant on lances, without the nemesis logo.\n\nThe commissioner and the [[New South Wales Police Force#Volunteering and NSW Police|VIP]] cyclists have a nemesis logo on a light blue over white bicolour pennant on their transportation. The pennant is swallowtailed.\n\n==Honours and awards==\nRecognition for the bravery and sacrifice of members of the New South Wales Police Force is expressed through honours and awards. The New South Wales Police Force was the first Australian Police jurisdiction to have one of its members awarded the Imperial Honour,{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} namely the [[George Cross]] and the Australian Honour the [[Cross of Valour (Australia)|Cross of Valour]]. Sergeant 3rd Class [[Eric Bailey (GC)|Eric George Bailey]] GC was awarded the [[George Cross]] posthumously on 12 January 1945.\n\nNew South Wales Police Force also has the distinction in having one of its members being awarded the highest civilian bravery award, namely the [[Cross of Valour (Australia)|Cross of Valour]]. In its history, only five people have been awarded that award, with a New South Wales Police Officer being the first Australian Police Officer to receive it. On 3 May 1996, the then Detective Senior Constable Sparkes rescued a boy trapped in a flooded underground storm water drain following record rainfalls at Coffs Harbour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honoured/sparkes.cfm|title=It's an Honour \u2013 Honours \u2013 Honoured Australians \u2013 Allan Sparkes|work=itsanhonour.gov.au|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504022759/http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honoured/sparkes.cfm|archivedate=4 May 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Australian honours and awards===\nNew South Wales Police Force Officers are eligible for the following National Honours and Awards:\n* Australian Bravery Decorations, namely the [[Cross of Valour (Australia)|Cross of Valour]] (CV), [[Star of Courage (Australia)|Star of Courage]] (SC), [[Bravery Medal (Australia)|Bravery Medal]] (BM) and the [[Commendation for Brave Conduct]].\n* [[Australian Police Medal]] (APM) (Rarely awarded to non commissioned officers)\n* [[Police Overseas Service Medal (Australia)|Police Overseas Service Medal]];\n* [[National Police Service Medal]]\n* [[National Medal (Australia)|National Medal]];\n* Campaign Medals such as [[United Nations Medal|United Nations Medal For Service]].\n\n===Internal New South Wales Police honours and awards===\nNew South Wales Police Force also has a number of inservice Honours and Awards, awarded by the Commissioner of New South Wales Police Force. Commissioner [[Peter Ryan (police commissioner)|Peter Ryan]] [[Queen's Police Medal|QPM]] implemented the New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Olympic Commendation and the New South Wales Police Force Olympic Citation. This award is significant as the New South Wales Police Force is the only police force in the world to be permitted the Olympic Rings to be attached. It has been widely reported and accepted that the [[Sydney 2000 Olympics]] was the \"Safest Games in modern Olympic history\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22media%2Fpressrel%2FHAL26%22 |title=ParlInfo \u2013 Commonwealth contributes to safety of best games ever |publisher=Parlinfo.aph.gov.au |date=9 October 2000}}</ref>\n\nFormer commissioner [[Ken Moroney]] [[Order of Australia|AO]] [[Australian Police Medal|APM]] implemented the Commissioners Community Service Commendation and Community Service Citation in 2002.\n\nPolice honours and awards are highly prized partly because they are only awarded to members in small numbers and are rarely issued to general duties police.  The only award that was given out in large numbers was the Commissioner's Olympic Citation due to the massive contribution by all members of the force. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Commendations and medals===\n* New South Wales Police Force Valour Award (VA);\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Commendation (Courage);\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Commendation (Service);\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Olympic Commendation;\n* New South Wales Police Force Commissioners Community Service Commendation;\n* [[Police Diligent and Ethical Service Medal|New South Wales Police Force Medal for Diligent and Ethical Service]] (awarded after 10 years' service, with clasps awarded for every five years thereafter).\nThe above in-service decorations are worn 5&nbsp;mm below the officer's name plate and are right-sided decorations.\n\n===Citations===\nThe following in-service decorations are worn 5&nbsp;mm above the officer's name plate and are right-sided decorations.\n* '''New South Wales Police Force Unit Citation''' (maximum three further awards are indicated by silver stars) \u2013 metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with light blue enamel centre;\n* '''New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Community Service Citation''' (maximum one further award indicated by one silver star) \u2013 metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with white enamel centre.\n* '''New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Olympic Citation''' \u2013 metal device, with silver laurel leaf surround, with navy blue enamel centre and silver Olympic rings ;\n* '''[[New South Wales Police Force Commissioner's Sesquicentenary Citation]]''' \u2013 metal device, with thin silver surround, with navy blue and light blue striped enamel centre and silver numerals of '1862' '150' '2012' with a depiction of the State of NSW and silitoe tartan.\n\n==Peacekeeping==\nIn [[peacekeeping]] operations, officers are seconded to the Australian Federal Police and take an oath or affirmation of the AFP. They are then appointed to the rank of senior sergeant, station sergeant, superintendent or commander. Following their service, UN peacekeeping veterans are awarded the [[United Nations Medal]] for their particular mission. In addition, under the Australian system of honours and awards, police officers serving with peacekeeping organisations are awarded the Police Overseas Service Medal with the relevant clasp for the prescribed area of service. As of 2008, two clasps to that medal were awarded to members for operations in [[Cyprus]] and [[East Timor]].\n\n===Cyprus (UNFICYP)===\nMembers were among the first Australian police sent to Cyprus in May 1964 as the first UN police contingent. The UN Civilian Police (now known as [[UNPOL]] or United Nations Police) was established with a three-month mandate to end hostilities between the Greek and Turkish communities and promote peace on the island. The operation is ongoing.\n\nMembers were subsequently withdrawn from Cyprus in 1976, along with all other state and territory police following the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] on 20 July 1974. During the invasion and preceding it the Australian police were subject to machine gun and mortar fire and Turkish air attack. Some of their personal motor vehicles, motorcycles and personal items at that time were destroyed, lost or stolen. Fortunately, there was no loss of Australian lives at that time. Australian police continued to negotiate between the invading Turkish army, other warring parties and escorted refugees to safety from both sides.<ref>Denis Percy. President of the United Nations Police Association of Australia. 2007.</ref> Since [[UNFICYP]] commenced, a large number of the NSW Police has served in Cyprus alongside other Australian police jurisdictions.\n\n===East Timor (UNTAET and UNMISET)===\nFrom 2000 to 2005, 45 NSW Police Force officers were involved in the [[United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor]] (UNTAET) and the [[United Nations Mission of Support in East Timor]] (UNMISET) seconded to the Australian Federal Police for their Tour of Duty in [[East Timor]] with the United Nations. There have only been three female NSWP officers to serve.\n\nIn addition, two New South Wales Police Force officers have been commended for courage for peacekeeping in East Timor, one by the Australian government, and the Australian Federal Police Commissioners Commendation for Bravery (station sergeant David McCann OAM \u2013 UNMISET<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afp.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/36828/PlatAprilforWeb.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=7 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026051732/http://www.afp.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/36828/PlatAprilforWeb.pdf |archivedate=26 October 2009  }}</ref> and one by the commissioner (senior sergeant Mark Aubrey Gilpin \u2013 UNTAET). McCann was awarded the Commendation for Brave Conduct for his part in the rescue of 110 vulnerable persons from a village in East Timor after it suffered major flooding. Gilpin was awarded the New South Wales Police Commendation (courage) for his part in protecting a member of the community who was being subjected to [[mob justice]]. He placed his body in front of the mob, who were armed with machettes and other weapons and managed to extract the victim to safety.\n\nOut of the ten Australian peacekeepers who have died on peacekeeping missions, two were from NSW Police Force while serving with UNFICYP. Sergeant Ian Ward and Inspector Patrick Hackett died in separate incidents in UNFCYP. A total of 124 soldiers and police gave their lives while serving with the UN in Cyprus.<ref>NSW Police Force Honour Roll.

She grew up in the Eastlands, a densely populated area in Nairobi inhabited by generally low income residents, and from a very young age was exposed to a diverse range of music styles including R&B, Reggae, Rap, Benga, Lingala and other African blends of music.\n\nHenrie Mutuku's love affair with music was evident quite early in life when at the age of 5 she would sing in family gatherings, church, and nursery school. Later, when she was slightly older, it was the church choir where her talents for music were obvious and enhanced.\n\nHer Christian upbringing in the Eastlands suburb of Nairobi has influenced her style of music as she uses Swahili, English, her mother tongue Kamba and Sheng (a concurrence of English, Swahili and local, vernacular dialects) to express herself and communicate to her audience.\u00a0 Since then, she has grown to use basic Amharic and French, mainly due to the influence of Ethiopian and Congolese refugees living in her environs.\n\nIn upper primary school she toyed with the idea of making music her career choice and as an active member of the Drama Club and Choir mistress in Loreto Limuru High School, her love and interest in music was solidified.\n\nShe is fluent in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], English, [[Kikamba language|Kamba]] (her mother-tongue) and [[Sheng (linguistics)|Sheng]].<ref>[http://www.henriemutuku.com/aboutme.htm Official Biography]</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\nHenrie started working in music with local Christian artists like [[Izzo (musician)|Izzo]] and [[Pete Odera]] as a background vocalist.

She grew up in the Eastlands, a densely populated area in Nairobi inhabited by generally low income residents, and from a very young age was exposed to a diverse range of music styles including R&B, Reggae, Rap, Benga, Lingala and other African blends of music.\n\nHenrie Mutuku's love affair with music was evident quite early in life when at the age of 5 she would sing in family gatherings, church, and nursery school. Later, when she was slightly older, it was the church choir where her talents for music were obvious and enhanced.\n\nHer Christian upbringing in the Eastlands suburb of Nairobi has influenced her style of music as she uses Swahili, English, her mother tongue Kamba and Sheng (a concurrence of English, Swahili and local, vernacular dialects) to express herself and communicate to her audience.\u00a0 Since then, she has grown to use basic Amharic and French, mainly due to the influence of Ethiopian and Congolese refugees living in her environs.\n\nIn upper primary school she toyed with the idea of making music her career choice and as an active member of the Drama Club and Choir mistress in Loreto Limuru High School, her love and interest in music was solidified.\n\nShe is fluent in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], English, [[Kikamba language|Kamba]] (her mother-tongue) and [[Sheng (linguistics)|Sheng]].<ref>[http://www.henriemutuku.com/aboutme.htm Official Biography]</ref>\n\n==Music career==\n\nHenrie started working in music with local Christian artists like [[Izzo (musician)|Izzo]] and [[Pete Odera]] as a background vocalist.

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.\n\nThe character is a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control [[magnetic field]]s. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as ''homo superior'', to replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]] whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants. He is a friend of [[Professor X]], the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times. Magneto's role in comics has varied from [[supervillain]] to [[antihero]] to [[superhero]], having served as an occasional ally and even a member of the X-Men at times.\n\nHis character's early history has been compared with the [[civil rights]] leader [[Malcolm X]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Godoski |first=Andrew |url=http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |title=Professor X And Magneto: Allegories For Martin Luther King, Jr. And Malcolm X |publisher=Screened |date=2011-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110618141805/http://www.screened.com/news/professor-x-and-magneto-allegories-for-martin-luther-king-jr-and-malcolm-x/2316/ |archivedate=2011-06-18 |accessdate=2016-05-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last = Shutt | first= Craig | date = August 1997 | title = Bad is Good | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | page = 38}}</ref> and [[Jewish Defense League]] founder [[Meir Kahane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forward.com/articles/7470/ |title='&#39;(Orthodo)X-Men, On Screen and Off'&#39;, Irving Greenberg, Jewish Daily Forward, 13 June 2003 |publisher=Forward.com |date=2003-06-13 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/8878/orthodo-x-men-/|title=(Orthodo)X-Men|author=Ami Eden|date=2003-05-23|publisher=Jewish Daily Forward}}</ref> Magneto opposes the pacifist attitude of [[Professor X]] and pushes for a more aggressive approach to achieving civil rights.

His first solo title was a [[one shot (comic)|one-shot]] special, ''Magneto: The Twisting of a Soul'' #0 (September 1993), published when the character returned from a brief absence; it reprinted Magneto-based stories from ''Classic X-Men'' #12 & 19 (August 1987 & March 1988), by writer [[Chris Claremont]] and artist [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]].\n\nIn a 2008 interview, Stan Lee said he \"did not think of Magneto as a bad guy.

Later, Magneto became ruler of the nation [[Genosha]]. Later, Magneto appeared in two miniseries; ''Magneto Rex'' (written by Joe Pruett and drawn by Brandon Peterson) and ''Magneto: Dark Seduction'' (written by Fabian Nicieza and drawn by Roger Cruz).\n\nA trade paperback novel detailing Magneto's childhood, ''X-Men: Magneto Testament'' was written by [[Greg Pak]] and released in September 2008.

Escaping from the mass grave, he was ultimately captured yet again<ref name=\"mutants1\">New Mutants #49</ref> and sent to [[Auschwitz]], where he eventually became a ''[[Sonderkommando]]''.<ref name=\"mutants1\"/><ref>Uncanny X-Men #274</ref><ref>Excalibur vol.3 #14</ref> While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunited with a [[Romani people|Romani]] girl named Magda, whom he had fallen in love with when he was younger, and with whom he would escape the concentration camp during the [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Birkenau revolt|October 7, 1944 revolt]].\n\nFollowing the war, he and Magda moved to the Ukrainian city of [[Vinnytsia]], and Max adopted the name \"'''Magnus'''\". Magda and Magnus had a daughter named Anya, and lived uneventfully until an angry mob, spurred on by the first manifestation of Magnus' powers, burned down their home with Anya still inside. Magnus was enraged at the mob for preventing him from rescuing Anya, and his powers were unleashed, killing the mob and destroying a part of the city. Magda, terrified at Magnus' power, left him and later gave birth to the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] before she died. Wanted by the authorities for the deaths and destruction in Vinnytsia, and while searching for Magda, Magnus paid a Romanian forger, Georg Odekirk, to create the cover identity of \"'''Erik Lehnsherr''', the [[Sinte]] gypsy\".<ref name=\"xmen72\" /> \"Erik\" relocated to [[Israel]], where he met and befriended [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] while working at a psychiatric hospital near [[Haifa]] where [[Gabrielle Haller]] resided. There, the two debated the consequences humanity faced with the rise of mutants, though neither revealed to the other that they were mutants. However, they were forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another while facing [[Baron Strucker]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Following the battle, Erik, realizing that his and Xavier's views were incompatible, left with a cache of hidden [[Nazi gold]], which provided him with the finances to pursue his goals.<ref name=\"uncanny1\"/>\n\n===Rise of Magneto===\n[[File:Xavmags.png|thumb|Magneto and Xavier would eventually part ways because of the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]\nMagneto's experiences surviving [[Nazi Germany]], [[Auschwitz]], and [[Vinnytsia]] would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He would believe that mutants (\"''Homo superior''\") will become the dominant life form on the planet and would set about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants could live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.\n\nMagneto's first villainous act is attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel after bringing down missiles. He is driven off by Charles Xavier's mutant students, the [[X-Men]], in their first mission.<ref>''X-Men'' #1</ref> He creates [[Asteroid M]], an orbital base of operations in a hollowed out asteroid. He then gathers a group of angry and disillusioned mutants including his own, albeit at the time unbeknown to him, son and daughter [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] and formed the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] to further his goals. Magneto briefly conquers the South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but is again foiled by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> He tries to make the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] infiltrate the X-Men. When that failed, he captures the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and tries to force him to tell the secrets of the X-Men. However, the other X-Men rescue their member and destroy Asteroid M.<ref>''X-Men'' #5</ref>\n\nMagneto is captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], a powerful alien being, whom he initially thought was another powerful mutant. The Stranger encases Magneto and Toad in a special cocoon and spirits them away to another planet, the Stranger's laboratory world. Back on Earth, Magneto's Brotherhood splinters, and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch desert him.<ref>''X-Men'' #11</ref> Magneto escapes to Earth by repairing a spaceship on the Stranger's planet, but leaves the Toad behind. He captures nearly all the X-Men and takes over the Mansion, hoping to use the Angel's parents to create a race of mutants, but is recaptured by the Stranger.<ref>''X-Men'' #17-18</ref> Magneto remains on the Stranger's world for a time, but escapes again, makes his way back to Earth, and reassembles the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the exception of the mutant [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].<ref>''Avengers'' #47-49</ref> He then captures the X-Men, but with the help of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood, Toad, Magneto is defeated again.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nMagneto then creates the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. With the Savage Land Mutates, he clashes with the X-Men and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>''X-Men'' #62-63</ref> Along with [[Namor]], Magneto later attacks New York City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #102-104</ref> He later fights the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10</ref> and battles the Avengers once more.<ref>''Avengers'' #110-111</ref>\n\nMagneto later reorganizes the Brotherhood, and fights Professor X and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Using ancient and advanced alien technology he found near the core of the earth, Magneto creates the artificial humanoid \"[[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]\". Alpha rebels against his creator and reduces him to infancy.<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref> Magneto is then placed in the care of Xavier's former love interest, Professor [[Moira MacTaggert]] at [[Muir Island]]. At Muir Island, MacTaggert discovers that the prolonged and extensive use of Magneto's powers has a disruptive effect on his nervous system and psyche, causing him to become increasingly paranoid and irrational the more he uses them.  In an attempt to cure him of this flaw she manipulates the infant Magneto's genetic code, so that when he grows older he will be able to safely use his powers while still remaining rational, in order to prevent him from becoming \"evil\" in adulthood.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> However, her genetic tampering soon loses its effect when Magneto reactivates his powers, as the very use of his powers causes his genetic sequence to realign and \"reset\" to its original state. Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood, but to his physical prime rather than his older, chronological age, by the alien [[Shi'ar]] agent [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]].<ref>''X-Men'' #104</ref>\n\nMagneto later gathers a new [[Resistants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], and with them battles [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref> He then successfully opposes [[Doctor Doom]]'s conquest of Earth.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #14; ''Champions'' #16</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\n[[File:uncanny200.png|thumb|Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200. Art by [[John Romita Jr]].|left]]\n\nMagneto's first steps towards a change in character begin during an encounter with the X-Men, when he lashes out in anger and nearly kills [[Kitty Pryde]], stopping short when he sees that the X-Man that he attacked is a Jewish child \u2014 precisely the kind of person he claimed he was fighting to make a better world for.  Realizing that he has come to regard the lives of those who oppose him to be as worthless as the Nazis considered his people to be, Magneto stands down and leaves the scene; though most of the X-Men are dismayed that he escaped, Xavier expresses hope that the encounter might prove a turning point for his former friend.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (Aug. 1981)</ref>\n\nMagneto later discovers that former Brotherhood members the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] are actually his children, simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. He reveals to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father.<ref name=\"VSW4\">''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 1, #4 (February 1983).</ref> He also discovers his granddaughter, Quicksilver's human child [[Luna Maximoff]].<ref name=\"VSW4\" /> Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected, Magneto tries to reach out to his children. Angered by his rejection of them and their mother, they push him away and refuse to forgive him.<ref name=\"VSW4\" />\n\nMagneto finds himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains are abducted by the [[Beyonder]], a nearly omnipotent alien being. This entity took them to a planet he created called the [[Battleworld]] to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would later be known as the [[Secret Wars]]. The characters were sorted according to their desires; Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the other villains. This surprises many of the other heroes, who still believe him to be a villain, although eventually they come to accept him as an ally. [[Captain America]] even speaks in his defense on some occasions, and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] develops a certain affection for him, although it is tempered by her knowledge of his past.<ref>''[[Secret Wars]]'' vol. 1 #3 (July 1984)</ref>\n\nAfter the Secret Wars, Magneto is transported back to his base, Asteroid M. The alien [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], traveling to Earth, collides into the asteroid, breaking it to pieces.<ref>''New Mutants'' #21 (November 1984)</ref> Magneto falls towards Earth and into the Atlantic Ocean, sustaining serious injuries.

A special tribunal dismisses all charges against Magneto from prior to his \"rebirth\", deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto. However, the tribunal is interrupted by an attack from [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], the twin children of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. [[Professor X]], brought to near-death due to the strain of the battle and previously sustained injuries, asks Magneto to take over his school and the X-Men. Magneto agrees and chooses not to return to the courtroom. Instead, he takes over Xavier's school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier's cousin.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #200 (December 1985).</ref> Seeing him try to reform, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver begin accepting him as their father.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nThough Magneto makes a substantial effort as the headmaster of the [[New Mutants]] and an ally to the X-Men, his tenure is disastrous.

To win the support of the other Club members against Shaw, he claims that his reformation was all a pretense in order to use the X-Men and New Mutants as pawns in a long-term scheme to take over the world. In response, the New Mutants, who had already decided to leave Magneto's tutelage, declare themselves his enemies.<ref name=\"NM75\"/>\n\nSeeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous, Magneto begins seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity. He participates in the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' alongside such established villains as [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and the [[Red Skull]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} His temporary alliance with the Red Skull \u2014 an unrepentant Nazi war criminal \u2014 is a highly uneasy one.

Enraged, he kidnaps Moira and subjects her to torture, later forcing her to use the same procedure that was used on him to alter the minds of some of the X-Men. However, when the remaining X-Men attack Asteroid M to rescue Moira and stop Magneto's plans, the Soviets launch a particle beam satellite which destroys Asteroid M and the procedure wears off; Moira had learned long ago that her procedure didn't work as a mutant's natural physiology relied on their bodies operating in a precise manner, with use of their powers restoring them to normal, and so Magneto had genuinely reformed. Betrayed and abandoned by Cortez, who had revealed Moira's actions to him to try and provoke Magneto into bringing mutants together to serve as a martyr for Cortez's own cause.

In response, Magneto generates an [[electromagnetic pulse]] not only destroying the satellites, but deactivating every electric device on Earth within minutes.

Magneto tends to Wanda, increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry. He allows only Xavier to visit, in the belief that Xavier can help Wanda. After months of failed attempts, the X-Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done.

In the new reality, where the New Avengers, the X-Men, and the members of Wanda's family all received their 'heart's desires', Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979, and revealed an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard Nixon]]. This resulted in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world's much larger and much faster growing mutant population.

They band together and attack Magneto in Genosha, believing him to be the one responsible. During the battle Layla is able to restore Magneto's memories, and he confronts his son. Enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name, Magneto kills him.

Xorn reveals that he, of his own free will, impersonated Magneto in order to rally mutantkind against humanity but failed due to the quality of his impersonation.

He had chosen to focus on ways to restore the powers of mutants, but memorized the metals of the bullet allowing him to keep a trace on it. Magneto brings the bullet back to Earth, drawing Kitty out of it and levitating her safely to the ground.

The series has been cancelled with issue #21 being its last issue which saw Magneto failing to stop the Ultimate Marvel Earth from colliding with the 616 Earth and thus resulting in the deaths of Magneto and his daughter Polaris.\n\n===\"AXIS\"===\nDuring the 2014 \"[[AXIS (comics)|AXIS]]\" storyline, Magneto enters the island of Genosha to find that it has turned into a concentration camp for mutants. He frees two mutant girls who tell him that Red Skull is responsible and possesses Professor X's brain. Magneto attacks Red Skull, but is quickly stopped by his [[S-Men]].<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto is captured and mind-tortured by Red Skull. He is given visions of those closest to him suffering while being unable to do anything to stop it. After being freed by Scarlet Witch, Rogue, and Havok, he bites down on a vial beneath his skin of Mutant Growth Hormone, giving himself enough power to fight.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Havok, Rogue, and Scarlet Witch want to leave the island and alert the rest of the Avengers and X-Men of what Red Skull is doing, Magneto says he's going to stay and fight. Before they can do anything, Red Skull appears.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #24. Marvel Comics.</ref> Red Skull now has the group mind-controlled. He plans on using Scarlet Witch's power to shape reality in his image. He tells Magneto to bow if he wants his daughter to remain alive, but Magneto performs a sneak attack enough to break Red Skull's control over the others. In a fit of rage over finding mutants being used for freak medical experiments, Magneto kills the entire S-Men team. Magneto then attacks Red Skull, all while Red Skull tells Magneto that Professor X's greatest fear was him leading the X-Men. Magneto kills Red Skull while the others look on in horror. Magneto believes everything is over only for Red Skull to reappear as a giant called Red Onslaught.<ref>''Uncanny Avengers'' #25. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nIn order to combat Red Skull's Red Onslaught form, Magneto forms an unnamed group consisting of [[Absorbing Man]], [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], [[Deadpool]], [[Doctor Doom]], [[Enchantress (Marvel Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]], [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]] V, Mystique, and Sabretooth.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> After the villains were inverted by the spell cast by Scarlet Witch and Doctor Doom, the group was soon named the Astonishing Avengers.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Quicksilver and Magneto try to talk the inverted Wanda down, Wanda attacks them with a curse designed to punish her blood relatives, but when only Quicksilver reacts, Wanda realizes that Magneto is not their biological father.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men: AXIS'' #7</ref> After [[Daniel Drumm]]'s ghost possesses Scarlet Witch and works with Doctor Doom to reverse the inversion spell, Magneto was affected by it and stopped being a threat to mankind.<ref>''Avengers & X-Men'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\nWhen Magneto arrives on Genosha and is confronted by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Magneto surrenders to them.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Secret Wars\"===\nDuring the \"Last Days\" part of the \"[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]\" storyline,  Magneto had to make a choice during the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610. To save the mutant race, he must attempt to destroy the world colliding with his own. To save the mutant race, he must also protect the humans, who are currently celebrating him as a hero and look on with fascination at what he attempts to do when Earth-1610 throws Sentinels against him.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #18. Marvel Comics.</ref> As the energies of Earth-616 and Earth-1610 inched closer to impact cascade and send chaos through the streets, Magneto (aided by his daughter Polaris) are taking the fight to this \"other\" Earth, battling the parallel Sentinels sent after them. Polaris is shocked to see the energy levels her father is exhibiting, all the while trying to protect the people caught in the crossfire of Magneto and the Sentinels. Magneto clearly has one goal in mind, as he rips a building to pieces to use against the killer robots, not caring much for the collateral damage, or the human lives at risk, as people in the building fall to the ground below. Polaris chides him for so reckless an action as she goes to the rescue while Magneto reminisces the reason he's currently exhibiting this level of power. Magneto and his current right hand Briar worked with a [[chemist]] under Magneto's employ to pump him up with a new cocktail of various drugs to amplify his powers, but Magneto needed further assistance. Months before the final Incursion happened, Briar established at least initial contact with several scientists which included Doctor Doom, Mister Fantastic, the High Evolutionary, Mister Sinister, [[Doctor Nemesis]], and Dark Beast. However, Magneto instead picked out of the lineup the Sugar Man. From him, Magneto acquires the means to initiate his plan, and thanks him in true Magneto style where he leaves Sugar Man barely alive. In the present time, Magneto continues to use the very magnetic forces of the planet to aid him, yet that's more power than he could ever channel and very quickly began taking a deadly toll on him.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> As Polaris tries getting him to take a break because his plan is killing him too quickly, Magneto began thinking that he doesn't believe in resting even for a minute in his eternal war to protect everything he cares about. He recalls picking up the Sugar Man's power amplifiers and his powers go into hyper-drive and he starts having brain aneurysms. Flip to present day, Magneto sees the S.H.I.E.L.D. coming to his aid and grins. Magneto tells Polaris that their help won't be needed for much longer and she says she doesn't understand but quickly figures it out what her father meant as Magneto absorbs her power and says that it is his responsibility alone and that he couldn't let her die alongside him and that she still has something to offer the world. Magneto's powers then go nova as all the powers of the Earth's North and South Magnetic poles and all the bio-electric energies of the Earth are channeled through him and he reflects on his life role.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #20. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===All-New, All-Different Marvel===\nAs part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' branding, Magneto has been returned to life with no memories of his apparent demise. In the wake of the massive anti-mutant uprising, combined with the discovery that the Terrigen Mists that were spread in the atmosphere are harmful to mutants, Magneto has gathered together a team of mutants (consisting of Archangel, M, Psylocke, and Sabretooth) as his own X-Men in order to defend mutants at any cost.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Civil War II\"===\nDuring the 2016 \"[[Civil War II]]\" storyline an Inhuman named Ulysses emerges who can \"foresee the future\". This divides the superhero community, including the X-Men, with one faction led by [[Carol Danvers]] believing that the perpetrators of future crimes indicated by Ulysses' visions should be arrested to prevent said crimes, while an opposing faction led by [[Iron Man]] believes this would violate individual civil liberties. Magneto and some of the X-Men side with Iron Man, while Storm and the other X-Men side with Danvers.<ref>''Civil War II: X-Men'' #1-3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''Civil War II'' #4-5. Marvel Comics.</ref> After reaching Ulysses, Magneto asks him why he should not kill or capture him, and Ulysses shows him visions that lead to Magneto leaving Ulysses and New Attilan.{{issue|date=January 2017}} It is later shown to be a ploy by [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] to avoid conflict.{{issue|date=January 2017}}\n\n===\"Inhumans vs. X-Men\"===\nFollowing the 2016 \"[[Inhumans vs. X-Men]]\" storyline, Magneto is killed by Psylocke per their agreement that she do this if he was to ever regress back his previous megalomaniacal approach to protecting mutantkind. Upon being left for dead in the Savage Land, his body was found by Exodus and healed by Elixir.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 4 #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> Following the conclusion of the war between Inhumans and X-Men, with Medusa unleashing the device to destroy the Terrigen Cloud permanently, he was temporarily beaten by a maddened Emma, who lied to the rest of the mutants about Cyclops' true death to trigger the war. He is later saved by Medusa and about to best Emma for her traitorous act, but Havok prevents him and Medusa from executing Emma for the sake of his late older brother.<ref>''IVX'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Secret Empire\"===\nIn the 2017 \"[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]\" storyline, it is revealed that Magneto wants to help the time-displaced original X-Men back to their home timeline.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto was approached by Captain America whose memories were altered by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[Kobik]] to cause Captain America to think that he was a Hydra sleeper agent. Captain America pitched an idea to Magneto that involved a piece of land in the western United States be granted to the mutants that would be their independent nation with the condition being that no inhabitant there would set foot on US soil. When Hydra takes over the United States, Magneto gives in to Captain America's deal. As a result, New Tian is formed somewhere in California and Magneto fakes his death so that he can hide out in Madripoor.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #17. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the time when Emma Frost meets with Hydra Supreme Steve Rogers the same time the resistances are fighting back Hydra, Magneto flies outside the Hydra Helicarrier and uses giant shards of metal to attack it.<ref>''Secret Empire'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===\"Hunt for Wolverine\"===\nDuring the \"[[Hunt for Wolverine]]\" storyline, Kitty Pryde leads Domino, Jubilee, Psylocke, Rogue, and Storm to Madripoor when they suspect that Magneto has excavated Wolverine's body. When they meet with Magneto at the King's Impresario Restaurant in Hightown, they discover that Magneto is actually Mindblast in disguise as it was part of an ambush by Viper and the [[Femme Fatales (comics)|Femme Fatales]].<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Magneto is shown to be a prisoner of Viper and the Femme Fatales where Mindblast and [[Sapphire Styx]] put Magneto in a weakened state.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Kitty Pryde destroyed the psychic-enhancement equipment on Mindblast's back, Magneto recovers and starts to take revenge on Mindblast until Kitty suggests he leaves her and helps to stop the rocket that will be sent to Soteira.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to Magneto still recovering from what Mindblast put him through, Kitty Pryde was able to evacuate Rogue and Storm from the rocket. Then Kitty and Domino persuaded Magneto not to take revenge on Mindblast. Magneto spares Mindblast's life and leaves her as a gift for helping him to escape. While Magneto denied any knowledge of taking Wolverine's body, he works to destroy the launch site and purge Madripoor of Viper's criminal empire while also pursuing Viper.<ref>''Hunt for Wolverine: Mystery in Madripoor'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>\n\n===House of X===\nWorking with Charles Xavier and Moira X, Magneto helps establish the new sovereign mutant nation known as Krakoa. He is first seen at the Jerusalem Habitat, welcoming several ambassadors from several countries as the newly appointed Krakoan ambassador. He guides the group through several Habitats, then reveals that he is aware of their true nature of being potential plants within Krakoa. Although he claims that he is not threatening them, he tells them that they \"have new gods now.\"<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMagneto is a mutant with the power to manipulate [[magnetic field]]s to achieve a wide range of effects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/characters/35/magneto | title=Magneto | publisher=Marvel | accessdate=May 31, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary application of his power is control over magnetism and the manipulation of both [[ferrous]] and [[nonferrous metal]].{{Citation Needed|date=March 2019}} While the maximum amount of mass he can manipulate at one time is unknown, he has moved large asteroids several times and effortlessly levitated a 30,000 ton [[nuclear submarine]].{{issue|date=September 2015}} His powers extend into the atomic level (insofar as the electromagnetic force is responsible for chemical bonding), allowing him to manipulate chemical structures and rearrange matter, although this is often a strenuous task. He can manipulate a large number of individual objects simultaneously and has assembled complex machinery with his powers. He can also affect non-metallic and non-magnetic objects to a lesser extent and frequently wears metal bracelets on his ankles and wrists allowing him to levitate. He can also generate [[electromagnetic pulse]]s of great strength and generate and manipulate electromagnetic energy down to photons. He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4 (February 1983)</ref> Another way in which Magneto frequently uses his power is the projection of force-fields which selectively block out matter and energy. These fields are strong enough to withstand the simultaneous detonation of multiple thermonuclear weapons, hence Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when surrounded by his shield and can survive in deep space thanks to it. He can also channel his powers through his own body to increase his strength and durability far beyond human limits and has a baseline reaction time 15 times faster than those of regular humans. On occasion he has altered the behavior of gravitational fields around him, which has been suggested as evidence of the existence of a [[Unified field theory|unified field]] which he can manipulate. He has demonstrated the capacity to produce a [[wormhole]] and to safely teleport himself and others via the wormhole.<ref>''Excalibur'' v.3, #8 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nMagneto has been frequently depicted as able to resist all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks.  A number of explanations have been proposed for his unusually strong resistance to telepathy, among them: (a) technology wired into his helmet (the explanation given in several comic plotlines{{issue|date=May 2016}}), (b) some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy (he once used the Earth's magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach), (c) latent telepathic powers of his own or (d) sheer force of will (cf. ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2).  The theme of latent telepathic powers has been explored in a number of stories, among them the [[Secret Wars]] limited series.  In some of his earliest appearances, Magneto was depicted as capable of engaging in [[astral projection]].  He has used Cerebro to locate mutants at great distances while leading the [[New Mutants]]. {{issue|date=March 2015}}  He has also, on rare occasions, been shown reading others' dreams, issuing telepathic commands, and probing the minds of others.<ref>''The X-Men'', v.1, #5-7 (May\u2013September 1964), ''New Mutants'' Vol. 1 #38 (1986), ''X-Men vs. Avengers'' miniseries (1987), ''Marvel Fanfare'' #33 (1987)</ref>  He has demonstrated the ability to shield his mind, while in intense meditation, so completely that even [[Emma Frost]] was not able to read his thoughts, despite being directly in front of him and actively attempting to do so.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men #521\"/>\n\nIn addition to his powers, Magneto has many other skills. He is a [[genius]] with competence in various fields of advanced science, especially in [[genetic engineering|genetic manipulation]], particle physics, [[engineering]], and other fields of technology. He has engineered advanced weaponry, space stations, superpowered humanoid lifeforms, devices that generate volcanoes and earthquakes, that block telepathy, and that can nullify all mutant powers across a few miles except for his own.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men' 1981\">''Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (October 1981)</ref>  He has promptly reconstructed such computerized devices from memory.<ref name=\"Uncanny X-Men' 1981\"/> He has bio-engineered new species including the [[Savage Land Mutates]],{{issue|date=March 2015}} and, using [[Deviant (comics)|Deviant]] technology, [[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]].{{issue|date=March 2015}} He is fluent in many human languages and once single-handedly deciphered the unknown language of a lost civilization.<ref>''Defenders'' #15 (September 1974)</ref> He possesses extraordinary skill in \"reading\" the microexpressions on others' faces and sensing what they are thinking and feeling, whether they are lying, fearful, etc. a skill which he refers to as \"taking your enemy's measure\".<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #6 (January 2011)</ref> He also is a master strategist and tactician with extensive combat experience, and has often been successful in single-handed combat against entire groups of superhuman adversaries. He also has some military training in hand-to-hand combat and has been shown to be effective with his fists, but he prefers to use his powers when in combat situations.\n\n==Reception==\nMagneto was ranked number 1 by [[IGN]]'s Top 100 Comic Book Villains list,<ref>IGN.com, Top 100 Comic Book Villains, [http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/1.html \"Magneto is Number 1\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090518101954/http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/1.html |date=2009-05-18 }}</ref> was listed number 17 in ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard's]]'' Top 100 Greatest Villains Ever list,<ref>''Wizard'', #177, July 2006</ref> and was ranked as the 9th Greatest Comic Book Character Ever in ''Wizard'''s list of the 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time, the second highest villain on that list.<ref>Wizarduniverse.com, [http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05240810thgreatestcharacters2.html \"The 200 Greatest Comic Characters of All Time\"], Numbers 20 Through 1, 2008-05-23  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080527233124/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05240810thgreatestcharacters2.html |date=May 27, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Collected editions==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appears in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #1 ([[cover-date]]d Sept. 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.\n\nThe character is a powerful [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]], one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control [[magnetic field]]s. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as ''homo superior'', to replace humans as the dominant species. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a [[Holocaust survivors|Holocaust survivor]] whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes mutants. He is a friend of [[Professor X]], the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies cause a rift in their friendship at times.

Max's father, Jakob Eisenhardt, was a decorated [[World War I]] veteran.<ref name=\"testament1\"/> Surviving discrimination and hardship during the [[Nazism|Nazi rise to power]], the passing of the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935, and [[Kristallnacht]], Max and his family fled to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] where they were captured during the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]] and sent to the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].<ref name=\"testament1\"/><ref name=\"classicxmen12\">''Classic X-Men'' #12</ref> Max and his family escaped the ghetto, only to be betrayed and captured again. His mother, father, and sister were executed and buried in a mass grave, but Max survived, possibly due to the manifestation of his mutant powers. Escaping from the mass grave, he was ultimately captured yet again<ref name=\"mutants1\">New Mutants #49</ref> and sent to [[Auschwitz]], where he eventually became a ''[[Sonderkommando]]''.<ref name=\"mutants1\"/><ref>Uncanny X-Men #274</ref><ref>Excalibur vol.3 #14</ref> While at Auschwitz, Eisenhardt reunited with a [[Romani people|Romani]] girl named Magda, whom he had fallen in love with when he was younger, and with whom he would escape the concentration camp during the [[Auschwitz concentration camp#Birkenau revolt|October 7, 1944 revolt]].\n\nFollowing the war, he and Magda moved to the Ukrainian city of [[Vinnytsia]], and Max adopted the name \"'''Magnus'''\". Magda and Magnus had a daughter named Anya, and lived uneventfully until an angry mob, spurred on by the first manifestation of Magnus' powers, burned down their home with Anya still inside. Magnus was enraged at the mob for preventing him from rescuing Anya, and his powers were unleashed, killing the mob and destroying a part of the city. Magda, terrified at Magnus' power, left him and later gave birth to the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]] before she died. Wanted by the authorities for the deaths and destruction in Vinnytsia, and while searching for Magda, Magnus paid a Romanian forger, Georg Odekirk, to create the cover identity of \"'''Erik Lehnsherr''', the [[Sinte]] gypsy\".<ref name=\"xmen72\" /> \"Erik\" relocated to [[Israel]], where he met and befriended [[Professor X|Charles Xavier]] while working at a psychiatric hospital near [[Haifa]] where [[Gabrielle Haller]] resided. There, the two debated the consequences humanity faced with the rise of mutants, though neither revealed to the other that they were mutants. However, they were forced to reveal their inherent abilities to one another while facing [[Baron Strucker]] and [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]. Following the battle, Erik, realizing that his and Xavier's views were incompatible, left with a cache of hidden [[Nazi gold]], which provided him with the finances to pursue his goals.<ref name=\"uncanny1\"/>\n\n===Rise of Magneto===\n[[File:Xavmags.png|thumb|Magneto and Xavier would eventually part ways because of the differences in their beliefs on how to help mutants. Art by [[Carlos Pacheco]].]]\nMagneto's experiences surviving [[Nazi Germany]], [[Auschwitz]], and [[Vinnytsia]] would shape his outlook on the situation that mutants face in the [[Marvel Universe]]. Determined to keep such atrocities from ever being committed against mutantkind, he is willing to use deadly force to protect mutants. He would believe that mutants (\"''Homo superior''\") will become the dominant life form on the planet and would set about either creating a homeland on Earth where mutants could live peacefully, or conquering and enslaving humanity in the name of mutantkind.\n\nMagneto's first villainous act is attacking a United States military base called Cape Citadel after bringing down missiles. He is driven off by Charles Xavier's mutant students, the [[X-Men]], in their first mission.<ref>''X-Men'' #1</ref> He creates [[Asteroid M]], an orbital base of operations in a hollowed out asteroid. He then gathers a group of angry and disillusioned mutants including his own, albeit at the time unbeknown to him, son and daughter [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and the [[Scarlet Witch]] and formed the [[Brotherhood of Mutants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] to further his goals. Magneto briefly conquers the South American nation of San Marco in the hopes of establishing a mutant homeland there, but is again foiled by the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men'' #4</ref> He tries to make the [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] infiltrate the X-Men. When that failed, he captures the [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]] and tries to force him to tell the secrets of the X-Men. However, the other X-Men rescue their member and destroy Asteroid M.<ref>''X-Men'' #5</ref>\n\nMagneto is captured by the [[Stranger (comics)|Stranger]], a powerful alien being, whom he initially thought was another powerful mutant. The Stranger encases Magneto and Toad in a special cocoon and spirits them away to another planet, the Stranger's laboratory world. Back on Earth, Magneto's Brotherhood splinters, and Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch desert him.<ref>''X-Men'' #11</ref> Magneto escapes to Earth by repairing a spaceship on the Stranger's planet, but leaves the Toad behind. He captures nearly all the X-Men and takes over the Mansion, hoping to use the Angel's parents to create a race of mutants, but is recaptured by the Stranger.<ref>''X-Men'' #17-18</ref> Magneto remains on the Stranger's world for a time, but escapes again, makes his way back to Earth, and reassembles the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants with the exception of the mutant [[Mastermind (Jason Wyngarde)|Mastermind]].<ref>''Avengers'' #47-49</ref> He then captures the X-Men, but with the help of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] and a rebellious member of the Brotherhood, Toad, Magneto is defeated again.{{issue|date=July 2013}}\n\nMagneto then creates the [[Savage Land Mutates]]. With the Savage Land Mutates, he clashes with the X-Men and [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]].<ref>''X-Men'' #62-63</ref> Along with [[Namor]], Magneto later attacks New York City.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #102-104</ref> He later fights the [[Inhumans]] Royal Family,<ref>''Amazing Adventures'' #9-10</ref> and battles the Avengers once more.<ref>''Avengers'' #110-111</ref>\n\nMagneto later reorganizes the Brotherhood, and fights Professor X and the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]. Using ancient and advanced alien technology he found near the core of the earth, Magneto creates the artificial humanoid \"[[Alpha the Ultimate Mutant]]\". Alpha rebels against his creator and reduces him to infancy.<ref>''Defenders'' #15-16</ref> Magneto is then placed in the care of Xavier's former love interest, Professor [[Moira MacTaggert]] at [[Muir Island]]. At Muir Island, MacTaggert discovers that the prolonged and extensive use of Magneto's powers has a disruptive effect on his nervous system and psyche, causing him to become increasingly paranoid and irrational the more he uses them.  In an attempt to cure him of this flaw she manipulates the infant Magneto's genetic code, so that when he grows older he will be able to safely use his powers while still remaining rational, in order to prevent him from becoming \"evil\" in adulthood.<ref>''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2</ref> However, her genetic tampering soon loses its effect when Magneto reactivates his powers, as the very use of his powers causes his genetic sequence to realign and \"reset\" to its original state. Magneto is eventually restored to adulthood, but to his physical prime rather than his older, chronological age, by the alien [[Shi'ar]] agent [[Erik the Red (comics)|Erik the Red]].<ref>''X-Men'' #104</ref>\n\nMagneto later gathers a new [[Resistants|Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]], and with them battles [[Captain America]].<ref>''Captain America Annual'' #4</ref> He then successfully opposes [[Doctor Doom]]'s conquest of Earth.<ref>''Super-Villain Team-Up'' #14; ''Champions'' #16</ref>\n\n===Reformation===\n[[File:uncanny200.png|thumb|Magneto goes on trial for his crimes in ''Uncanny X-Men'' #200. Art by [[John Romita Jr]].|left]]\n\nMagneto's first steps towards a change in character begin during an encounter with the X-Men, when he lashes out in anger and nearly kills [[Kitty Pryde]], stopping short when he sees that the X-Man that he attacked is a Jewish child \u2014 precisely the kind of person he claimed he was fighting to make a better world for.  Realizing that he has come to regard the lives of those who oppose him to be as worthless as the Nazis considered his people to be, Magneto stands down and leaves the scene; though most of the X-Men are dismayed that he escaped, Xavier expresses hope that the encounter might prove a turning point for his former friend.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #150 (Aug. 1981)</ref>\n\nMagneto later discovers that former Brotherhood members the [[Scarlet Witch]] and [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] are actually his children, simultaneously learning about their recent marriages to the [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]]. He reveals to Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch that he is their father.<ref name=\"VSW4\">''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' Vol. 1, #4 (February 1983).</ref> He also discovers his granddaughter, Quicksilver's human child [[Luna Maximoff]].<ref name=\"VSW4\" /> Seeing Luna as a bond to the human race he has rejected, Magneto tries to reach out to his children. Angered by his rejection of them and their mother, they push him away and refuse to forgive him.<ref name=\"VSW4\" />\n\nMagneto finds himself allied with Professor Xavier and the X-Men when a group of heroes and villains are abducted by the [[Beyonder]], a nearly omnipotent alien being. This entity took them to a planet he created called the [[Battleworld]] to participate in a personal experiment of his to observe the concept of the battle between good and evil which would later be known as the [[Secret Wars]]. The characters were sorted according to their desires; Magneto was placed with the heroes as his desires were based on a wish to help mutants rather than the more selfish drives of the other villains. This surprises many of the other heroes, who still believe him to be a villain, although eventually they come to accept him as an ally. [[Captain America]] even speaks in his defense on some occasions, and the [[Wasp (comics)|Wasp]] develops a certain affection for him, although it is tempered by her knowledge of his past.<ref>''[[Secret Wars]]'' vol. 1 #3 (July 1984)</ref>\n\nAfter the Secret Wars, Magneto is transported back to his base, Asteroid M. The alien [[Warlock (New Mutants)|Warlock]], traveling to Earth, collides into the asteroid, breaking it to pieces.<ref>''New Mutants'' #21 (November 1984)</ref> Magneto falls towards Earth and into the Atlantic Ocean, sustaining serious injuries. He is rescued by [[Lee Forrester]], the captain of a fishing trawler.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #188 (December 1984)</ref> Lee takes him to the same island in the Bermuda Triangle where he'd once held her captive; there she helps him recuperate from his injuries, and the two become lovers.<ref>''New Mutants'' #23, 24, 26, 28, 29 (January, February, April, June, July 1985)</ref>\n\nAfter recuperating from his injuries, Magneto is asked to aid the X-Men in battling the returned Beyonder.<ref>''New Mutants'' #29 (July 1985)</ref> Magneto stays with the X-Men even after the Beyonder is defeated.{{Issue|date=June 2009}} His association with the team softens his views on humanity, and Magneto surrenders himself to the law to stand trial for his crimes. A special tribunal dismisses all charges against Magneto from prior to his \"rebirth\", deeming that this had constituted a figurative death of the old Magneto. However, the tribunal is interrupted by an attack from [[Fenris (comics)|Fenris]], the twin children of [[Baron Strucker|Baron Wolfgang von Strucker]]. [[Professor X]], brought to near-death due to the strain of the battle and previously sustained injuries, asks Magneto to take over his school and the X-Men. Magneto agrees and chooses not to return to the courtroom. Instead, he takes over Xavier's school under the assumed identity of Michael Xavier, Charles Xavier's cousin.<ref>''[[Uncanny X-Men]]'' #200 (December 1985).</ref> Seeing him try to reform, the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver begin accepting him as their father.{{Issue|date=June 2009}}\n\nThough Magneto makes a substantial effort as the headmaster of the [[New Mutants]] and an ally to the X-Men, his tenure is disastrous.

To win the support of the other Club members against Shaw, he claims that his reformation was all a pretense in order to use the X-Men and New Mutants as pawns in a long-term scheme to take over the world. In response, the New Mutants, who had already decided to leave Magneto's tutelage, declare themselves his enemies.<ref name=\"NM75\"/>\n\nSeeing conditions for mutants grow progressively more perilous, Magneto begins seeking allies to protect mutants from humanity. He participates in the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'' alongside such established villains as [[Doctor Doom]], the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]], the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], and the [[Red Skull]].{{Issue|date=June 2009}} His temporary alliance with the Red Skull \u2014 an unrepentant Nazi war criminal \u2014 is a highly uneasy one.

Enraged, he kidnaps Moira and subjects her to torture, later forcing her to use the same procedure that was used on him to alter the minds of some of the X-Men. However, when the remaining X-Men attack Asteroid M to rescue Moira and stop Magneto's plans, the Soviets launch a particle beam satellite which destroys Asteroid M and the procedure wears off; Moira had learned long ago that her procedure didn't work as a mutant's natural physiology relied on their bodies operating in a precise manner, with use of their powers restoring them to normal, and so Magneto had genuinely reformed. Betrayed and abandoned by Cortez, who had revealed Moira's actions to him to try and provoke Magneto into bringing mutants together to serve as a martyr for Cortez's own cause.

In response, Magneto generates an [[electromagnetic pulse]] not only destroying the satellites, but deactivating every electric device on Earth within minutes.

In Genosha, Magneto hears Wanda's psychic cry for help and creates a [[wormhole]], whisking her away before the Avengers are able to stop her. Magneto tends to Wanda, increasingly becoming more withdrawn and angry. He allows only Xavier to visit, in the belief that Xavier can help Wanda. After months of failed attempts, the X-Men and the Avengers meet to decide what should be done. When some of the members suggest killing Wanda, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] informs Magneto of this development, before convincing Wanda to warp reality into the [[House of M]]. In the new reality, where the New Avengers, the X-Men, and the members of Wanda's family all received their 'heart's desires', Magneto was attacked by Sentinels over Manhattan in 1979, and revealed an alleged international anti-mutant conspiracy involving [[Richard Nixon]]. This resulted in Magneto being granted sovereignty over Genosha as leader of the world's much larger and much faster growing mutant population. Magneto then turned Genosha into the most powerful, technologically advanced country on Earth, which he used as a base to dominate the world and place mutantkind above humanity.{{issue|date=February 2011}}\n\nA group of heroes is brought together by Wolverine \u2014 who alone remembers the way the world is supposed to be because his 'heart's desire' was to regain all the memories stolen from him by the Weapon X Program \u2014 and have their own memories of the \"real world\" restored by [[Layla Miller]]. They band together and attack Magneto in Genosha, believing him to be the one responsible. During the battle Layla is able to restore Magneto's memories, and he confronts his son. Enraged that Quicksilver had done all of this in his name, Magneto kills him. Sensing her brother's death, Wanda resurrects him and retaliates with the phrase \"No more mutants\", changing the world back to its original form and [[Decimation (comics)|causing ninety-eight percent of the mutant population to lose their powers]], including Magneto. Magneto is left a broken man.<ref>''House of M'' #8</ref>\n\n====''Son of M''====\nIn the 2006 miniseries ''[[Son of M]]'', which follows up \"House of M\", when Quicksilver comes to Genosha to restore the mutants' powers with the [[Inhumans]]' [[Terrigen Mist]]s, Magneto condemns his actions, pointing out the disastrous effects the Mists have on non-Inhumans.

A powerless Magneto is attacked by Xorn, who has somehow evolved into a being of pure energy and merged with both an energy absorbing mutant named [[Michael Pointer (comics)|Michael Pointer]] and free floating mutant power energy that manifested after Scarlet Witch depowered the bulk of the mutant population. Xorn reveals that he, of his own free will, impersonated Magneto in order to rally mutantkind against humanity but failed due to the quality of his impersonation. He possesses Magneto and briefly reactivates his powers before being defeated by the New Avengers and a cadre of heroes, including Magneto's former son-in-law Vision and Inhuman S.H.I.E.L.D. agent [[Daisy Johnson]]. [[Iron Man]], [[Ms. Marvel]], and the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]] combine their powers and send Xorn into the Sun. Michael Pointer and Magneto are freed as a result, though Magneto is arrested and loaded into a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicopter.

Polaris is shocked to see the energy levels her father is exhibiting, all the while trying to protect the people caught in the crossfire of Magneto and the Sentinels. Magneto clearly has one goal in mind, as he rips a building to pieces to use against the killer robots, not caring much for the collateral damage, or the human lives at risk, as people in the building fall to the ground below. Polaris chides him for so reckless an action as she goes to the rescue while Magneto reminisces the reason he's currently exhibiting this level of power. Magneto and his current right hand Briar worked with a [[chemist]] under Magneto's employ to pump him up with a new cocktail of various drugs to amplify his powers, but Magneto needed further assistance. Months before the final Incursion happened, Briar established at least initial contact with several scientists which included Doctor Doom, Mister Fantastic, the High Evolutionary, Mister Sinister, [[Doctor Nemesis]], and Dark Beast. However, Magneto instead picked out of the lineup the Sugar Man. From him, Magneto acquires the means to initiate his plan, and thanks him in true Magneto style where he leaves Sugar Man barely alive.

Marvel Comics.</ref> As Polaris tries getting him to take a break because his plan is killing him too quickly, Magneto began thinking that he doesn't believe in resting even for a minute in his eternal war to protect everything he cares about. He recalls picking up the Sugar Man's power amplifiers and his powers go into hyper-drive and he starts having brain aneurysms. Flip to present day, Magneto sees the S.H.I.E.L.D. coming to his aid and grins. Magneto tells Polaris that their help won't be needed for much longer and she says she doesn't understand but quickly figures it out what her father meant as Magneto absorbs her power and says that it is his responsibility alone and that he couldn't let her die alongside him and that she still has something to offer the world. Magneto's powers then go nova as all the powers of the Earth's North and South Magnetic poles and all the bio-electric energies of the Earth are channeled through him and he reflects on his life role.<ref>''Magneto'' Vol. 3 #20.

Captain America pitched an idea to Magneto that involved a piece of land in the western United States be granted to the mutants that would be their independent nation with the condition being that no inhabitant there would set foot on US soil. When Hydra takes over the United States, Magneto gives in to Captain America's deal.

He is first seen at the Jerusalem Habitat, welcoming several ambassadors from several countries as the newly appointed Krakoan ambassador. He guides the group through several Habitats, then reveals that he is aware of their true nature of being potential plants within Krakoa. Although he claims that he is not threatening them, he tells them that they \"have new gods now.\"<ref>''House of X'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> \n\n==Powers and abilities==\nMagneto is a mutant with the power to manipulate [[magnetic field]]s to achieve a wide range of effects.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://marvel.com/characters/35/magneto | title=Magneto | publisher=Marvel | accessdate=May 31, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe primary application of his power is control over magnetism and the manipulation of both [[ferrous]] and [[nonferrous metal]].{{Citation Needed|date=March 2019}} While the maximum amount of mass he can manipulate at one time is unknown, he has moved large asteroids several times and effortlessly levitated a 30,000 ton [[nuclear submarine]].{{issue|date=September 2015}} His powers extend into the atomic level (insofar as the electromagnetic force is responsible for chemical bonding), allowing him to manipulate chemical structures and rearrange matter, although this is often a strenuous task. He can manipulate a large number of individual objects simultaneously and has assembled complex machinery with his powers. He can also affect non-metallic and non-magnetic objects to a lesser extent and frequently wears metal bracelets on his ankles and wrists allowing him to levitate. He can also generate [[electromagnetic pulse]]s of great strength and generate and manipulate electromagnetic energy down to photons. He can turn invisible by warping visible light around his body.<ref>''Vision and the Scarlet Witch'' #4 (February 1983)</ref> Another way in which Magneto frequently uses his power is the projection of force-fields which selectively block out matter and energy. These fields are strong enough to withstand the simultaneous detonation of multiple thermonuclear weapons, hence Magneto is invulnerable to most harm when surrounded by his shield and can survive in deep space thanks to it. He can also channel his powers through his own body to increase his strength and durability far beyond human limits and has a baseline reaction time 15 times faster than those of regular humans. On occasion he has altered the behavior of gravitational fields around him, which has been suggested as evidence of the existence of a [[Unified field theory|unified field]] which he can manipulate. He has demonstrated the capacity to produce a [[wormhole]] and to safely teleport himself and others via the wormhole.<ref>''Excalibur'' v.3, #8 (February 2005)</ref>\n\nMagneto has been frequently depicted as able to resist all but the strongest or most unexpected of telepathic attacks.  A number of explanations have been proposed for his unusually strong resistance to telepathy, among them: (a) technology wired into his helmet (the explanation given in several comic plotlines{{issue|date=May 2016}}), (b) some physical aspect of his electromagnetic powers that can interfere with telepathy (he once used the Earth's magnetic field to dampen the powers of all telepaths within his reach), (c) latent telepathic powers of his own or (d) sheer force of will (cf. ''X-Men'' Vol. 2 #2).  The theme of latent telepathic powers has been explored in a number of stories, among them the [[Secret Wars]] limited series.  In some of his earliest appearances, Magneto was depicted as capable of engaging in [[astral projection]].
