The movement of dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as ''glide'' or [[Slip (materials science) |slip]]. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a ''glide dislocation'' but the atoms on one side have moved by one position. The crystalline order is not fully restored with a ''partial dislocation''. A dislocation defines the boundary between ''slipped'' and ''unslipped'' regions of material and as a result, must either form a complete loop or extend to the edges of the crystal.<ref name=\"hull01\">{{cite book |first1=D. |last1=Hull |first2=D.

The two main types of mobile dislocations are ''edge'' and ''screw '' dislocations. \n\nEdge dislocations can be visualized as being caused by the termination of a plane of [[atom]]s in the middle of a [[crystal]]. In such a case, the surrounding [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] are not straight, but instead bend around the edge of the terminating plane so that the crystal structure is perfectly ordered on either side. This phenomenon is analogous to half of a piece of paper inserted into a stack of paper, where the defect in the stack is noticeable only at the edge of the half sheet.\n\nThe theory describing the elastic fields of the defects was originally developed by [[Vito Volterra]] in 1907. In 1934, [[Egon Orowan]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I.

Taylor}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1930s, one of the enduring challenges of materials science was to explain [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] in microscopic terms. A simplistic attempt to calculate the [[shear stress]] at which neighbouring atomic planes ''slip'' over each other in a perfect crystal suggests that, for a material with [[shear modulus]] <math>G</math>, shear strength <math>\\tau_m</math> is given approximately by:\n\n::<math> \\tau_m = \\frac {G} {2 \\pi}.</math>\n\nThe shear modulus in [[metal]]s is typically within the range 20 000 to 150 000 [[MPa]] indicating a predicted shear stress of 3 000 to 24 000 MPa. This was difficult to reconcile with measured shear stresses in the range of 0.5 to 10 MPa.\n\nIn 1934, [[Egon Orowan]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]], independently proposed that plastic deformation could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations. Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge. In effect, a half plane of atoms is moved in response to shear stress by breaking and reforming a line of bonds, one (or a few) at a time. The energy required to break a row of bonds is far less than that required to break all the bonds on an entire plane of atoms at once. Even this simple model of the force required to move a dislocation shows that plasticity is possible at much lower stresses than in a perfect crystal. In many materials, particularly ductile materials, dislocations are the \"carrier\" of plastic deformation, and the energy required to move them is less than the energy required to fracture the material. \n\n== Mechanisms ==\nA dislocation is a linear crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure which contains an abrupt change in the arrangement of atoms. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a dislocation but the atoms on one side have moved or slipped. Dislocations define the boundary between slipped and unslipped regions of material and cannot end within a lattice and must either extend to a free edge or form a loop within the crystal.<ref name=\"hull01\"/> A dislocation can be characterised by the distance and direction of movement it causes to atoms in the lattice which is called the Burgers vector. The Burgers vector of a dislocation remains constant even though the shape of the dislocation may change.\n\nA variety of dislocation types exist, with mobile dislocations known as ''glissile'' and immobile dislocations called ''sessile''. The movement of mobile dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as glide or slip. The movement of dislocations may be enhanced or hindered by the presence other elements within the crystal and over time, these elements may diffuse to the dislocation forming a [[Cottrell atmosphere]]. The pinning and breakaway from these elements explains some of the unusual yielding behavior seen with steels. The interaction of hydrogen with dislocations is one of the mechanisms proposed to explain [[hydrogen embrittlement]].\n\nDislocations behave as though they are a distinct entity within a crystalline material where some types of dislocation can move through the material bending, flexing and changing shape and interacting with other dislocations and features within the crystal. Dislocations are generated by deforming a crystalline material such as metals, which can cause them to initiate from surfaces, particularly at [[stress concentrations]] or within the material at defects and [[grain boundaries]]. The number and arrangement of dislocations give rise to many of the properties of metals such as [[ductility]], [[hardness]] and [[yield strength]]. [[Heat treating |Heat treatment]], [[alloy]] content and [[cold working]] can change the number and arrangement of the dislocation population and how they move and interact in order to create useful properties.\n\n[[File:Simulation of dislocations in aluminium.webm|thumb|Simulation of dislocations in aluminium. Only non-crystalline atoms are shown.]]\n\n=== Generating dislocations ===\nWhen metals are subjected to [[cold forming|cold working]] (deformation at temperatures which are relatively low as compared to the material's absolute melting temperature, <math>T_m</math> i.e., typically less than <math>0.4T_m</math>) the dislocation density increases due to the formation of new dislocations. The consequent increasing overlap between the strain fields of adjacent dislocations gradually increases the resistance to further dislocation motion. This causes a hardening of the metal as deformation progresses. This effect is known as [[strain hardening]] or work hardening. \n\nDislocation density <math>\\rho</math> in a material can be increased by plastic deformation by the following relationship: \n\n::<math>\\tau \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}</math>.\n\nSince the dislocation density increases with plastic deformation, a mechanism for the creation of dislocations must be activated in the material.  Three mechanisms for dislocation formation are homogeneous nucleation, grain boundary initiation, and interfaces between the lattice and the surface, precipitates, dispersed phases, or reinforcing fibers.\n\n==== Homogeneous nucleation ====\nThe creation of a dislocation by ''homogeneous nucleation'' is a result of the rupture of the atomic bonds along a line in the lattice.  A plane in the lattice is sheared, resulting in 2 oppositely faced half planes or dislocations.  These dislocations move away from each other through the lattice.  Since homogeneous nucleation forms dislocations from perfect crystals and requires the simultaneous breaking of many bonds, the energy required for homogeneous nucleation is high.  For instance, the stress required for homogeneous nucleation in copper has been shown to be <math> \\frac {\\tau_{\\text{hom}}}{G}=7.4\\times10^{-2}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the shear modulus of copper (46 GPa).  Solving for <math>\\tau_{\\text{hom}} \\,\\!</math>, we see that the required stress is 3.4 GPa, which is very close to the theoretical strength of the crystal.  Therefore, in conventional deformation homogeneous nucleation requires a concentrated stress, and is very unlikely.  Grain boundary initiation and interface interaction are more common sources of dislocations.\n\nIrregularities at the grain boundaries in materials can produce dislocations which propagate into the grain.  The steps and ledges at the grain boundary are an important source of dislocations in the early stages of plastic deformation.\n\n==== Frank\u2013Read source ====\nThe [[Frank\u2013Read source]] is a mechanism that is able to produce a stream of dislocations from a pinned segment of a dislocation. Stress bows the dislocation segment, expanding until it creates a dislocation loop that breaks free from the source.\n\n==== Surfaces ====\nThe surface of a crystal can produce dislocations in the crystal.  Due to the small steps on the surface of most crystals, stress in some regions on the surface is much larger than the average stress in the lattice.  This stress leads to dislocations.  The dislocations are then propagated into the lattice in the same manner as in grain boundary initiation.  In single crystals, the majority of dislocations are formed at the surface.  The dislocation density 200 micrometres into the surface of a material has been shown to be six times higher than the density in the bulk.  However, in polycrystalline materials the surface sources do not have a major effect because most grains are not in contact with the surface.\n\n==== Interfaces ====\nThe interface between a metal and an oxide can greatly increase the number of dislocations created.  The oxide layer puts the surface of the metal in tension because the oxygen atoms squeeze into the lattice, and the oxygen atoms are under compression.  This greatly increases the stress on the surface of the metal and consequently the amount of dislocations formed at the surface.  The increased amount of stress on the surface steps results in an increase in dislocations formed and emitted from the interface.<ref>[[Marc A. Meyers|Marc Andr\u00e9 Meyers]], Krishan Kumar Chawla (1999) ''Mechanical Behaviors of Materials.''

This occurs when the lattice spacing of the two crystals do not match, resulting in a misfit of the lattices at the interface. The stress caused by the lattice misfit is released by forming regularly spaced misfit dislocations. Misfit dislocations are edge dislocations with the dislocation line in the interface plane and the Burgers vector in the direction of the interface normal. Interfaces with misfit dislocations may form e.g. as a result of [[Epitaxy|epitaxial crystal growth]] on a substrate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schober|first=T.|last2=Balluffi|first2=R.

In most metals, prismatic dislocation loops are the energetically most preferred clusters of self-interstitial atoms.\n\n=== Interaction and arrangement ===\n==== Geometrically necessary dislocations ====\n[[Geometrically necessary dislocations]] are arrangements of dislocations that can accommodate a limited degree of plastic bending in a crystalline material.\nTangles of dislocations are found at the early stage of deformation and appear as non well-defined boundaries; the process of dynamic [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] leads eventually to the formation of a cellular structure containing boundaries with misorientation lower than 15\u00b0 (low angle grain boundaries). \n\n==== Pinning ====\nAdding pinning points that inhibit the motion of dislocations, such as alloying elements, can introduce stress fields that ultimately strengthen the material by requiring a higher applied stress to overcome the pinning stress and continue dislocation motion.\n\nThe effects of strain hardening by accumulation of dislocations and the grain structure formed at high strain can be removed by appropriate heat treatment ([[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]) which promotes the [[recovery (metallurgy)|recovery]] and subsequent [[Recrystallization (metallurgy)|recrystallization]] of the material.\n\nThe combined processing techniques of work hardening and [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] allow for control over dislocation density, the degree of dislocation entanglement, and ultimately the [[yield strength]] of the material.\n\n==== Persistent slip bands ====\nRepeated cycling of a material can lead to the generation and bunching of dislocations surrounded by regions that are relatively dislocation free. This pattern forms a ladder like structure known as a ''persistent slip band'' (PSB).<ref name=\"suresh04\">{{cite book |last1=Suresh |first1=S. |year=2004  |title=Fatigue of Materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57046-6}}</ref> PSB's are so-called, because they leave marks on the surface of metals that even when removed by polishing, return at the same place with continued cycling.\n\nPSB walls are predominately made up of edge dislocations. In between the walls, plasticity is transmitted by screw dislocations.<ref name=\"suresh04\"/>\n\nWhere PSB's meet the surface, extrusions and intrusions form, which under repeated cyclic loading, can lead to the initiation of a [[fatigue]] crack.<ref name=\"forsythe\">{{cite journal |year=1953 |last=Forsythe |first=P.

For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so there is one plane in which the dislocation can slip.\n\n==== Climb ====\n''Dislocation climb'' is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion that allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane. The driving force for dislocation climb is the movement of vacancies through a crystal lattice.  If a vacancy moves next to the boundary of the extra half plane of atoms that forms an edge dislocation, the atom in the half plane closest to the vacancy can ''jump'' and fill the vacancy.  This atom shift ''moves'' the vacancy in line with the half plane of atoms, causing a shift, or positive climb, of the dislocation.  The process of a vacancy being absorbed at the boundary of a half plane of atoms, rather than created, is known as negative climb.  Since dislocation climb results from individual atoms ''jumping'' into vacancies, climb occurs in single atom diameter increments.\n\nDuring positive climb, the crystal shrinks in the direction perpendicular to the extra half plane of atoms because atoms are being removed from the half plane.  Since negative climb involves an addition of atoms to the half plane, the crystal grows in the direction perpendicular to the half plane.  Therefore, compressive stress in the direction perpendicular to the half plane promotes positive climb, while tensile stress promotes negative climb.  This is one main difference between slip and climb, since slip is caused by only shear stress.\n\nOne additional difference between dislocation slip and climb is the temperature dependence.  Climb occurs much more rapidly at high temperatures than low temperatures due to an increase in vacancy motion.  Slip, on the other hand, has only a small dependence on temperature.\n\n==== Dislocation avalanches ====\n[[Dislocation avalanches]] occur when multiple simultaneous movement of dislocations occur.\n\n==Geometry==\nTwo main types of mobile dislocations exist: edge and screw. Dislocations found in real materials are typically ''mixed'', meaning that they have characteristics of both.\n\n===Edge===\n[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.svg|right|thumb|Schematic diagram (lattice planes) showing an edge dislocation. Burgers vector in black, dislocation line in blue.]]\n\nA crystalline material consists of a regular array of atoms, arranged into lattice planes. An edge dislocation is a defect where an extra half-plane of atoms is introduced midway through the crystal, distorting nearby planes of atoms. When enough force is applied from one side of the crystal structure, this extra plane passes through planes of atoms breaking and joining bonds with them until it reaches the grain boundary.  The dislocation has two properties, a line direction, which is the direction running along the bottom of the extra half plane, and the [[Burgers vector]] which describes the magnitude and direction of distortion to the lattice. In an edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line direction.\n\nThe stresses caused by an edge dislocation are complex due to its inherent asymmetry. These stresses are described by three equations:<ref name=\"rhill\">{{cite book|first=R.E.|last=Reed-Hill|first2=Reza|last2=Abbaschian|date=1994|title=Physical Metallurgy Principles|location=Boston|publisher=PWS Publishing Company|isbn=0-534-92173-6}}</ref>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(3x^2 +y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{xy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {x(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the [[Burgers vector]], <math>\\nu</math> is [[Poisson's ratio]] and <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are coordinates.\n\nThese equations suggest a vertically oriented dumbbell of stresses surrounding the dislocation, with compression experienced by the atoms near the \"extra\" plane, and tension experienced by those atoms near the \"missing\" plane.<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n===Screw===\n[[Image:Vector de Burgers.PNG|thumb|Top right: edge dislocation.<br>Bottom right: screw dislocation.]]\n\nA ''screw dislocation'' can be visualized by cutting a crystal along a plane and slipping one half across the other by a lattice vector, the halves fitting back together without leaving a defect. If the cut only goes part way through the crystal, and then slipped, the boundary of the cut is a screw dislocation. It comprises a structure in which a [[Helix|helical]] path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes in the crystal lattice. In pure screw dislocations, the Burgers vector is parallel to the line direction.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Shackelford|title=Introduction to Materials Science for Engineers|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-601260-3|pages=110\u201311|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\nThe stresses caused by a screw dislocation are less complex than those of an edge dislocation and need only one equation, as symmetry allows one radial coordinate to be used:<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{r} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi r} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the Burgers vector, and <math>r</math> is a radial coordinate.\nThis equation suggests a long cylinder of stress radiating outward from the cylinder and decreasing with distance. This simple model results in an infinite value for the core of the dislocation at <math>r=0</math> and so it is only valid for stresses outside of the core of the dislocation.<ref name=\"rhill\"/> If the Burgers vector is very large, the core may actually be empty resulting in a [[micropipe]], as commonly observed in [[silicon carbide]].\n\n===Mixed===\nIn many materials, dislocations are found where the line direction and Burgers vector are neither perpendicular nor parallel and these dislocations are called ''mixed dislocations'', consisting of both screw and edge character. They are characterized by  <math>\\varphi</math>, the angle between the line direction and Burgers vector, where <math>\\varphi=\\pi/2</math> for pure edge dislocations and  <math>\\varphi=0</math> for screw dislocations.\n\n===Partial===\n[[Partial dislocations]] leave behind a stacking fault. Two types of partial dislocation are the ''Frank partial dislocation'' which is sessile and the ''Shockley partial dislocation'' which is glissile.<ref name=\"radwan\"/> \n\nA Frank partial dislocation is formed by inserting or removing a layer of atoms on the {111} plane which is then bounded by the Frank partial. Removal of a close packed layer is known as an ''intrinsic'' stacking fault and inserting a layer is known as an ''extrinsic'' stacking fault. The Burgers vector is normal to the {111} glide plane so the dislocation cannot glide and can only move through ''climb''.<ref name=\"hull01\"/>\n\nIn order to lower the overall energy of the lattice, edge and screw dislocations typically disassociate into a [[stacking fault]] bounded by two Shockley partial dislocations.<ref name=F\u00f6ll>{{cite web|title=Defects in Crystals|first=Helmut|last=F\u00f6ll|url=http://dtrinkle.matse.illinois.edu/MatSE584/index.html |access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The width of this stacking-fault region is proportional to the [[stacking-fault energy]] of the material. The combined effect is known as an ''extended dislocation'' and is able to glide as a unit. However, dissociated screw dislocations must recombine before they can [[cross slip]], making it difficult for these dislocations to move around barriers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stacking Fault Energy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/stacking-fault-energy|website=Science Direct|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Materials with low stacking-fault energies have the greatest dislocation dissociation and are therefore more readily cold worked.\n\n=== Stair-rod and the Lomer\u2013Cottrell junction ===\nIf two glide dislocations that lie on different {111} planes split into Shockley partials and intersect, they will produce a stair-rod dislocation with a [[Lomer-Cottrell junction |Lomer-Cottrell dislocation]] at its apex.<ref> {{cite web |title=Reaction Forming a Stair-Rod Dislocation |url=https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_5/illustr/i5_4_2.html |access-date=26 Nov 2019}}</ref> It is called a ''stair-rod'' because it is analogous to the rod that keeps carpet in-place on a stair.\n\n=== Jog ===\n[[File:Jog-Kink.gif|thumb|right|Geometrical differences between jogs and kinks]]\nA '''Jog''' describes the steps of a dislocation line that are not in the [[glide plane]] of a [[crystal structure]].<ref name=F\u00f6ll/> A dislocation line is rarely uniformly straight, often containing many curves and steps that can impede or facilitate dislocation movement by acting as pinpoints or nucleation points respectively. Because jogs are out of the glide plane, under shear they cannot move by glide (movement along the glide plane). They instead must rely on vacancy diffusion facilitated climb to move through the lattice.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.|last1=Cai|first2=W. D.|last2=Nix|title=Imperfections in crystalline solids|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016}}</ref>. Away from the melting point of a material, vacancy diffusion is a slow process, so jogs act as immobile barriers at room temperature for most metals.<ref name=\"courtney00\">{{cite book|first=T. H.|last=Courtney|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|location=Long Grove, IL|publisher=Waveland|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nJogs typically form when two non-parallel dislocations cross during slip. The presence of jogs in a material increases its [[yield strength]] by preventing easy glide of dislocations. A pair of immobile jogs in a dislocation will act as a [[Frank\u2013Read source]] under shear, increasing the overall dislocation density of a material.<ref name=\"courtney00\" /> When a material's yield strength is increased via dislocation density increase, particularly when done by mechanical work, it is called [[work hardening]]. At high temperatures, vacancy facilitated movement of jogs becomes a much faster process, diminishing their overall effectiveness in impeding dislocation movement.\n\n=== Kink ===\n[[Kink (dislocation)|Kinks]] are steps in a dislocation line parallel to glide planes. Unlike jogs, they facilitate glide by acting as a nucleation point for dislocation movement. The lateral spreading of a kink from the nucleation point allows for forward propagation of the dislocation while only moving a few atoms at a time, reducing the overall energy barrier to slip.\n\n== Example in two dimensions (2D) ==\n\n[[File:Dislokation Dissoziation.svg|thumb|Dissociation of a pair of dislocations due to shearing (red arrows) of an hexagonal crystal in 2D.

If a lot of dislocations are e.&nbsp;g. thermally excited, the discrete translational order of the crystal is destroyed. Simultaneously, the [[shear modulus]] and the [[Young's modulus]] disappear, which implies that the crystal is molten to a fluid phase. The orientational order is not yet destroyed (as indicated by lattice lines in one direction) and one finds - very similar to liquid crystals - a fluid phase with typically a six-folded director field. This so-called [[hexatic phase]] still has an orientational stiffness.

Taylor}}</ref>\n\nPrior to the 1930s, one of the enduring challenges of materials science was to explain [[plasticity (physics)|plasticity]] in microscopic terms. A simplistic attempt to calculate the [[shear stress]] at which neighbouring atomic planes ''slip'' over each other in a perfect crystal suggests that, for a material with [[shear modulus]] <math>G</math>, shear strength <math>\\tau_m</math> is given approximately by:\n\n::<math> \\tau_m = \\frac {G} {2 \\pi}.</math>\n\nThe shear modulus in [[metal]]s is typically within the range 20 000 to 150 000 [[MPa]] indicating a predicted shear stress of 3 000 to 24 000 MPa. This was difficult to reconcile with measured shear stresses in the range of 0.5 to 10 MPa.\n\nIn 1934, [[Egon Orowan]], [[Michael Polanyi]] and [[Geoffrey Ingram Taylor|G. I. Taylor]], independently proposed that plastic deformation could be explained in terms of the theory of dislocations. Dislocations can move if the atoms from one of the surrounding planes break their bonds and rebond with the atoms at the terminating edge. In effect, a half plane of atoms is moved in response to shear stress by breaking and reforming a line of bonds, one (or a few) at a time. The energy required to break a row of bonds is far less than that required to break all the bonds on an entire plane of atoms at once. Even this simple model of the force required to move a dislocation shows that plasticity is possible at much lower stresses than in a perfect crystal. In many materials, particularly ductile materials, dislocations are the \"carrier\" of plastic deformation, and the energy required to move them is less than the energy required to fracture the material. \n\n== Mechanisms ==\nA dislocation is a linear crystallographic defect or irregularity within a crystal structure which contains an abrupt change in the arrangement of atoms. The crystalline order is restored on either side of a dislocation but the atoms on one side have moved or slipped. Dislocations define the boundary between slipped and unslipped regions of material and cannot end within a lattice and must either extend to a free edge or form a loop within the crystal.<ref name=\"hull01\"/> A dislocation can be characterised by the distance and direction of movement it causes to atoms in the lattice which is called the Burgers vector. The Burgers vector of a dislocation remains constant even though the shape of the dislocation may change.\n\nA variety of dislocation types exist, with mobile dislocations known as ''glissile'' and immobile dislocations called ''sessile''. The movement of mobile dislocations allow atoms to slide over each other at low stress levels and is known as glide or slip. The movement of dislocations may be enhanced or hindered by the presence other elements within the crystal and over time, these elements may diffuse to the dislocation forming a [[Cottrell atmosphere]]. The pinning and breakaway from these elements explains some of the unusual yielding behavior seen with steels. The interaction of hydrogen with dislocations is one of the mechanisms proposed to explain [[hydrogen embrittlement]].\n\nDislocations behave as though they are a distinct entity within a crystalline material where some types of dislocation can move through the material bending, flexing and changing shape and interacting with other dislocations and features within the crystal. Dislocations are generated by deforming a crystalline material such as metals, which can cause them to initiate from surfaces, particularly at [[stress concentrations]] or within the material at defects and [[grain boundaries]]. The number and arrangement of dislocations give rise to many of the properties of metals such as [[ductility]], [[hardness]] and [[yield strength]]. [[Heat treating |Heat treatment]], [[alloy]] content and [[cold working]] can change the number and arrangement of the dislocation population and how they move and interact in order to create useful properties.\n\n[[File:Simulation of dislocations in aluminium.webm|thumb|Simulation of dislocations in aluminium. Only non-crystalline atoms are shown.]]\n\n=== Generating dislocations ===\nWhen metals are subjected to [[cold forming|cold working]] (deformation at temperatures which are relatively low as compared to the material's absolute melting temperature, <math>T_m</math> i.e., typically less than <math>0.4T_m</math>) the dislocation density increases due to the formation of new dislocations. The consequent increasing overlap between the strain fields of adjacent dislocations gradually increases the resistance to further dislocation motion. This causes a hardening of the metal as deformation progresses. This effect is known as [[strain hardening]] or work hardening. \n\nDislocation density <math>\\rho</math> in a material can be increased by plastic deformation by the following relationship: \n\n::<math>\\tau \\propto \\sqrt{\\rho}</math>.\n\nSince the dislocation density increases with plastic deformation, a mechanism for the creation of dislocations must be activated in the material.  Three mechanisms for dislocation formation are homogeneous nucleation, grain boundary initiation, and interfaces between the lattice and the surface, precipitates, dispersed phases, or reinforcing fibers.\n\n==== Homogeneous nucleation ====\nThe creation of a dislocation by ''homogeneous nucleation'' is a result of the rupture of the atomic bonds along a line in the lattice.  A plane in the lattice is sheared, resulting in 2 oppositely faced half planes or dislocations.  These dislocations move away from each other through the lattice.  Since homogeneous nucleation forms dislocations from perfect crystals and requires the simultaneous breaking of many bonds, the energy required for homogeneous nucleation is high.  For instance, the stress required for homogeneous nucleation in copper has been shown to be <math> \\frac {\\tau_{\\text{hom}}}{G}=7.4\\times10^{-2}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the shear modulus of copper (46 GPa).  Solving for <math>\\tau_{\\text{hom}} \\,\\!</math>, we see that the required stress is 3.4 GPa, which is very close to the theoretical strength of the crystal.  Therefore, in conventional deformation homogeneous nucleation requires a concentrated stress, and is very unlikely.  Grain boundary initiation and interface interaction are more common sources of dislocations.\n\nIrregularities at the grain boundaries in materials can produce dislocations which propagate into the grain.  The steps and ledges at the grain boundary are an important source of dislocations in the early stages of plastic deformation.\n\n==== Frank\u2013Read source ====\nThe [[Frank\u2013Read source]] is a mechanism that is able to produce a stream of dislocations from a pinned segment of a dislocation. Stress bows the dislocation segment, expanding until it creates a dislocation loop that breaks free from the source.\n\n==== Surfaces ====\nThe surface of a crystal can produce dislocations in the crystal.  Due to the small steps on the surface of most crystals, stress in some regions on the surface is much larger than the average stress in the lattice.  This stress leads to dislocations.  The dislocations are then propagated into the lattice in the same manner as in grain boundary initiation.  In single crystals, the majority of dislocations are formed at the surface.  The dislocation density 200 micrometres into the surface of a material has been shown to be six times higher than the density in the bulk.  However, in polycrystalline materials the surface sources do not have a major effect because most grains are not in contact with the surface.\n\n==== Interfaces ====\nThe interface between a metal and an oxide can greatly increase the number of dislocations created.  The oxide layer puts the surface of the metal in tension because the oxygen atoms squeeze into the lattice, and the oxygen atoms are under compression.  This greatly increases the stress on the surface of the metal and consequently the amount of dislocations formed at the surface.  The increased amount of stress on the surface steps results in an increase in dislocations formed and emitted from the interface.<ref>[[Marc A. Meyers|Marc Andr\u00e9 Meyers]], Krishan Kumar Chawla (1999) ''Mechanical Behaviors of Materials.''

This occurs when the lattice spacing of the two crystals do not match, resulting in a misfit of the lattices at the interface. The stress caused by the lattice misfit is released by forming regularly spaced misfit dislocations. Misfit dislocations are edge dislocations with the dislocation line in the interface plane and the Burgers vector in the direction of the interface normal. Interfaces with misfit dislocations may form e.g. as a result of [[Epitaxy|epitaxial crystal growth]] on a substrate.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schober|first=T.|last2=Balluffi|first2=R.

This pattern forms a ladder like structure known as a ''persistent slip band'' (PSB).<ref name=\"suresh04\">{{cite book |last1=Suresh |first1=S. |year=2004  |title=Fatigue of Materials |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-57046-6}}</ref> PSB's are so-called, because they leave marks on the surface of metals that even when removed by polishing, return at the same place with continued cycling.\n\nPSB walls are predominately made up of edge dislocations.

For an edge dislocation, the dislocation and the Burgers vector are perpendicular, so there is one plane in which the dislocation can slip.\n\n==== Climb ====\n''Dislocation climb'' is an alternative mechanism of dislocation motion that allows an edge dislocation to move out of its slip plane. The driving force for dislocation climb is the movement of vacancies through a crystal lattice.  If a vacancy moves next to the boundary of the extra half plane of atoms that forms an edge dislocation, the atom in the half plane closest to the vacancy can ''jump'' and fill the vacancy.  This atom shift ''moves'' the vacancy in line with the half plane of atoms, causing a shift, or positive climb, of the dislocation.  The process of a vacancy being absorbed at the boundary of a half plane of atoms, rather than created, is known as negative climb.  Since dislocation climb results from individual atoms ''jumping'' into vacancies, climb occurs in single atom diameter increments.\n\nDuring positive climb, the crystal shrinks in the direction perpendicular to the extra half plane of atoms because atoms are being removed from the half plane.  Since negative climb involves an addition of atoms to the half plane, the crystal grows in the direction perpendicular to the half plane.  Therefore, compressive stress in the direction perpendicular to the half plane promotes positive climb, while tensile stress promotes negative climb.  This is one main difference between slip and climb, since slip is caused by only shear stress.\n\nOne additional difference between dislocation slip and climb is the temperature dependence.  Climb occurs much more rapidly at high temperatures than low temperatures due to an increase in vacancy motion.  Slip, on the other hand, has only a small dependence on temperature.\n\n==== Dislocation avalanches ====\n[[Dislocation avalanches]] occur when multiple simultaneous movement of dislocations occur.\n\n==Geometry==\nTwo main types of mobile dislocations exist: edge and screw. Dislocations found in real materials are typically ''mixed'', meaning that they have characteristics of both.\n\n===Edge===\n[[Image:Dislocation edge d2.svg|right|thumb|Schematic diagram (lattice planes) showing an edge dislocation. Burgers vector in black, dislocation line in blue.]]\n\nA crystalline material consists of a regular array of atoms, arranged into lattice planes. An edge dislocation is a defect where an extra half-plane of atoms is introduced midway through the crystal, distorting nearby planes of atoms. When enough force is applied from one side of the crystal structure, this extra plane passes through planes of atoms breaking and joining bonds with them until it reaches the grain boundary.  The dislocation has two properties, a line direction, which is the direction running along the bottom of the extra half plane, and the [[Burgers vector]] which describes the magnitude and direction of distortion to the lattice. In an edge dislocation, the Burgers vector is perpendicular to the line direction.\n\nThe stresses caused by an edge dislocation are complex due to its inherent asymmetry. These stresses are described by three equations:<ref name=\"rhill\">{{cite book|first=R.E.|last=Reed-Hill|first2=Reza|last2=Abbaschian|date=1994|title=Physical Metallurgy Principles|location=Boston|publisher=PWS Publishing Company|isbn=0-534-92173-6}}</ref>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{xx} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(3x^2 +y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\sigma_{yy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {y(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{xy} = \\frac {\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi (1-\\nu)} \\frac {x(x^2 -y^2)} {(x^2 +y^2)^2}</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the [[Burgers vector]], <math>\\nu</math> is [[Poisson's ratio]] and <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are coordinates.\n\nThese equations suggest a vertically oriented dumbbell of stresses surrounding the dislocation, with compression experienced by the atoms near the \"extra\" plane, and tension experienced by those atoms near the \"missing\" plane.<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n===Screw===\n[[Image:Vector de Burgers.PNG|thumb|Top right: edge dislocation.<br>Bottom right: screw dislocation.]]\n\nA ''screw dislocation'' can be visualized by cutting a crystal along a plane and slipping one half across the other by a lattice vector, the halves fitting back together without leaving a defect. If the cut only goes part way through the crystal, and then slipped, the boundary of the cut is a screw dislocation. It comprises a structure in which a [[Helix|helical]] path is traced around the linear defect (dislocation line) by the atomic planes in the crystal lattice. In pure screw dislocations, the Burgers vector is parallel to the line direction.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Shackelford|title=Introduction to Materials Science for Engineers|year=2009|publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|isbn=978-0-13-601260-3|pages=110\u201311|edition=7th}}</ref>\n\nThe stresses caused by a screw dislocation are less complex than those of an edge dislocation and need only one equation, as symmetry allows one radial coordinate to be used:<ref name=\"rhill\"/>\n\n::<math> \\tau_{r} = \\frac {-\\mu \\mathbf{b}} {2 \\pi r} </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mu</math> is the [[shear modulus]] of the material, <math>\\mathbf{b}</math> is the Burgers vector, and <math>r</math> is a radial coordinate.\nThis equation suggests a long cylinder of stress radiating outward from the cylinder and decreasing with distance.

Removal of a close packed layer is known as an ''intrinsic'' stacking fault and inserting a layer is known as an ''extrinsic'' stacking fault. The Burgers vector is normal to the {111} glide plane so the dislocation cannot glide and can only move through ''climb''.<ref name=\"hull01\"/>\n\nIn order to lower the overall energy of the lattice, edge and screw dislocations typically disassociate into a [[stacking fault]] bounded by two Shockley partial dislocations.<ref name=F\u00f6ll>{{cite web|title=Defects in Crystals|first=Helmut|last=F\u00f6ll|url=http://dtrinkle.matse.illinois.edu/MatSE584/index.html |access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> The width of this stacking-fault region is proportional to the [[stacking-fault energy]] of the material. The combined effect is known as an ''extended dislocation'' and is able to glide as a unit. However, dissociated screw dislocations must recombine before they can [[cross slip]], making it difficult for these dislocations to move around barriers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stacking Fault Energy|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/chemistry/stacking-fault-energy|website=Science Direct|access-date=2019-11-09}}</ref> Materials with low stacking-fault energies have the greatest dislocation dissociation and are therefore more readily cold worked.\n\n=== Stair-rod and the Lomer\u2013Cottrell junction ===\nIf two glide dislocations that lie on different {111} planes split into Shockley partials and intersect, they will produce a stair-rod dislocation with a [[Lomer-Cottrell junction |Lomer-Cottrell dislocation]] at its apex.<ref> {{cite web |title=Reaction Forming a Stair-Rod Dislocation |url=https://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/kap_5/illustr/i5_4_2.html |access-date=26 Nov 2019}}</ref> It is called a ''stair-rod'' because it is analogous to the rod that keeps carpet in-place on a stair.\n\n=== Jog ===\n[[File:Jog-Kink.gif|thumb|right|Geometrical differences between jogs and kinks]]\nA '''Jog''' describes the steps of a dislocation line that are not in the [[glide plane]] of a [[crystal structure]].<ref name=F\u00f6ll/> A dislocation line is rarely uniformly straight, often containing many curves and steps that can impede or facilitate dislocation movement by acting as pinpoints or nucleation points respectively. Because jogs are out of the glide plane, under shear they cannot move by glide (movement along the glide plane). They instead must rely on vacancy diffusion facilitated climb to move through the lattice.<ref>{{cite book|first=W.|last1=Cai|first2=W. D.|last2=Nix|title=Imperfections in crystalline solids|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2016}}</ref>. Away from the melting point of a material, vacancy diffusion is a slow process, so jogs act as immobile barriers at room temperature for most metals.<ref name=\"courtney00\">{{cite book|first=T. H.|last=Courtney|title=Mechanical behavior of materials|location=Long Grove, IL|publisher=Waveland|year=2000}}</ref>\n\nJogs typically form when two non-parallel dislocations cross during slip. The presence of jogs in a material increases its [[yield strength]] by preventing easy glide of dislocations. A pair of immobile jogs in a dislocation will act as a [[Frank\u2013Read source]] under shear, increasing the overall dislocation density of a material.<ref name=\"courtney00\" /> When a material's yield strength is increased via dislocation density increase, particularly when done by mechanical work, it is called [[work hardening]]. At high temperatures, vacancy facilitated movement of jogs becomes a much faster process, diminishing their overall effectiveness in impeding dislocation movement.\n\n=== Kink ===\n[[Kink (dislocation)|Kinks]] are steps in a dislocation line parallel to glide planes. Unlike jogs, they facilitate glide by acting as a nucleation point for dislocation movement. The lateral spreading of a kink from the nucleation point allows for forward propagation of the dislocation while only moving a few atoms at a time, reducing the overall energy barrier to slip.\n\n== Example in two dimensions (2D) ==\n\n[[File:Dislokation Dissoziation.svg|thumb|Dissociation of a pair of dislocations due to shearing (red arrows) of an hexagonal crystal in 2D. A dislocation in 2D consists of a bound pair of five-folded (green) and seven-folded (orange) coordination number.]]\nIn two dimensions (2D) only the edge dislocations exist, which play a central role in melting of 2D crystals, but not the screw dislocation.\nThose dislocations are [[Topology|topological]] point defects which implies that they cannot be created isolated by an [[affine transformation]] without cutting the hexagonal crystal up to infinity (or at least up to its boarder). They can only be created in pairs with antiparallel [[Burgers_vector |Burgers vector]]. If a lot of dislocations are e.&nbsp;g. thermally excited, the discrete translational order of the crystal is destroyed. Simultaneously, the [[shear modulus]] and the [[Young's modulus]] disappear, which implies that the crystal is molten to a fluid phase. The orientational order is not yet destroyed (as indicated by lattice lines in one direction) and one finds - very similar to liquid crystals - a fluid phase with typically a six-folded director field. This so-called [[hexatic phase]] still has an orientational stiffness. The isotropic fluid phase appears, if the dislocations dissociate into isolated five-folded and seven-folded [[Disclination|disclinations]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Gasser | first=U. | last2=Eisenmann | first2=C. | last3=Maret | first3=G. | last4=Keim | first4=P. | title=Melting of crystals in two dimensions | journal=ChemPhysChem | volume=11 |issue=5 | date=2010 | doi=10.1002/cphc.200900755 | pmid=20099292 | pages=963\u2013970| url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-112435 }}</ref> This two step melting is described within the so-called Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young-theory ([[KTHNY theory]]), based on two transitions of [[Kosterlitz\u2013Thouless_transition|Kosterlitz-Thouless-type]].\n\n==Observation==\n=== Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) ===\n[[Image:TEM micrograph dislocations precipitate stainless steel 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[Transmission electron micrograph]] of dislocations]]\n[[Image:TEM micrograph dislocations precipitate stainless steel 2.jpg|right|thumb|Transmission electron micrograph of dislocations]]\n\n[[Transmission electron microscopy]] can be used to observe dislocations within the [[microstructure]] of the material.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=J.C.H.|authorlink1 = John C.

The [[electron]] beam undergoes [[diffraction]] by the regular crystal lattice planes into a diffraction pattern and contrast is generated in the image by this diffraction (as well as by thickness variations, varying strain, and other mechanisms). Dislocations have different local atomic structure and produce a strain field, and therefore will cause the electrons in the microscope to scatter in different ways. Note the characteristic 'wiggly' contrast of the dislocation lines as they pass through the thickness of the material in the figure (also note that dislocations cannot end in a crystal, and these dislocations are terminating at the surfaces since the image is a 2D projection).\n\nDislocations do not have random structures, the local atomic structure of a dislocation is determined by the Burgers vector. One very useful application of the TEM in dislocation imaging is the ability to experimentally determine the Burgers vector. Determination of the Burgers vector is achieved by what is known as <math>\\vec{g} \\cdot \\vec{b}</math> (\"g dot b\") analysis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Transmission electron microscopy : a textbook for materials science|first=David B. |last=Williams |first2=C. Barry |last2=Carter |date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780387765020|oclc=660999227}}</ref> When performing [[dark field microscopy]] with the TEM, a diffracted spot is selected to form the image (as mentioned before, lattice planes diffract the beam into spots), and the image is formed using only electrons that were diffracted by the plane responsible for that diffraction spot. The vector in the diffraction pattern from the transmitted spot to the diffracted spot is the <math>\\vec{g}</math> vector. The contrast of a dislocation is scaled by a factor of the dot product of this vector and the Burgers vector (<math>\\vec{g} \\cdot \\vec{b}</math>). As a result, if the Burgers vector and <math>\\vec{g}</math> vector are perpendicular, there will be no signal from the dislocation and the dislocation will not appear at all in the image. Therefore, by examining different dark field images formed from spots with different g vectors, the Burgers vector can be determined.\n\n=== Other methods ===\n[[Image:Silicon_dislocation_orientation_111_mag_500x.png|right|thumb|Etch Pits formed on the ends of dislocations in silicon, orientation (111)]]\n\n[[Field ion microscopy]] and [[atom probe]] techniques offer methods of producing much higher magnifications (typically 3 million times and above) and permit the observation of dislocations at an atomic level. Where surface relief can be resolved to the level of an atomic step, screw dislocations appear as distinctive spiral features \u2013 thus revealing an important mechanism of crystal growth: where there is a surface step, atoms can more easily add to the crystal, and the surface step associated with a screw dislocation is never destroyed no matter how many atoms are added to it.\n\n==== Chemical etching ====\nWhen a dislocation line intersects the surface of a metallic material, the associated strain field locally increases the relative susceptibility of the material to acid [[industrial etching|etching]] and an [[etch pit density|etch pit]] of regular geometrical format results. In this way, dislocations in silicon, for example, can be observed ''indirectly'' using an interference microscope. Crystal orientation can be determined by the shape of the etch pits associated with the dislocations.\n\nIf the material is deformed and repeatedly re-etched, a series of etch pits can be produced which effectively trace the movement of the dislocation in question.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|40em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|dislocation}}\n{{Commons category|Dislocations in crystals}}\n* [http://www.tf.uni-kiel.de/matwis/amat/def_en/index.html Defects in Crystals/ Prof. Dr. Helmut F\u00f6ll website] Chapter 5 contains a wealth of information on dislocations;\n* [http://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/dislocations/ DoITPoMS] Online tutorial on dislocations, including movies of dislocations in [[bubble raft]]s;\n* [https://www.enggstudy.com/2019/10/difference-between-edge-dislocation-and-screw-dislocation.html Difference between Edge dislocation and Screw dislocation] Difference between Edge dislocation and Screw dislocation in detail;\n* [http://www.iap.tuwien.ac.at/www/surface/STM_Gallery/ Scanning Tunneling Microscope \u2013 Gallery] Image gallery, including a dislocations page, seen at the atomic level of metal surfaces, by the surface physics group at the Faculty of Physics, Vienna University of Technology, Austria.\n* [http://neo-classical-physics.info/uploads/3/0/6/5/3065888/volterra_-_equilibrium_of_multiply_connected_bodies.pdf Volterra, V., \"On the equilibrium of multiply-connected bodies,\" trans. by D.

It is a word play on ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', used in some [[economic theories]] and in [[pedagogy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6QrvmNo2qD4C&pg=PA158|title=Moral Markets: The Critical Role of Values in the Economy|last=Zak|first=Paul J.|date=2010-12-16|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400837366|page=158|accessdate=22 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn [[game theory]], ''homo economicus'' is often modelled through the assumption of '''perfect rationality'''. It assumes that agents always act in a way that [[Utility maximization problem|maximize utility]] as a [[Consumption (economics)|consumer]] and [[economic profit|profit]] as a [[Production (economics)|producer]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Principles of Microeconomics|author=Rittenberg and Tregarthen|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|page=2|pages=|chapter=Chapter 6|access-date=June 20, 2012|chapter-url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/ECON101-3.1.pdf}}</ref> and are capable of arbitrarily complex deductions towards that end. They will always be capable of thinking through all possible outcomes and choosing that course of action which will result in the best possible result.\n\nThe rationality implied in ''homo economicus'' does not restrict what sort of preferences are admissible. Only na\u00efve applications of the ''homo economicus'' model assume that agents know what is best for their long-term physical and mental health. For example, an agent's utility function could be linked to the perceived utility of other agents (such as one's wife or children), making ''homo economicus'' compatible with other models such as ''[[homo reciprocans]],'' which emphasizes human [[Cooperation#In humans|cooperation]].\n\nAs a theory on human conduct, it contrasts to the concepts of [[behavioral economics]], which examines [[cognitive biases]] and other [[irrationalities]], and to [[bounded rationality]], which assumes that practical elements such as cognitive and time limitations restrict the rationality of agents.\n\n== History of the term ==\nThe term \"economic man\" was used for the first time in the late nineteenth century by critics of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s work on political economy.<ref name=persky>Persky, Joseph. \"Retrospectives: The Ethology of Homo Economicus.\" ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), pp. 221\u2013231</ref> Below is a passage from Mill's work that critics referred to:\n\n<blockquote>\"[Political economy] does not treat the whole of man\u2019s nature as modified by the social state, nor of the whole conduct of man in society. It is concerned with him solely as a being who desires to possess wealth, and who is capable of judging the comparative efficacy of means for obtaining that end.\"<ref>Mill, John Stuart. \"On the Definition of Political Economy, and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It,\" London and Westminster Review, October 1836. ''Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy'', 2nd ed. London: Longmans, Green, Reader & Dyer, 1874, essay 5, paragraphs 38 and 48.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLater in the same work, Mill stated that he was proposing \"an arbitrary definition of man, as a being who inevitably does that by which he may obtain the greatest amount of necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial with which they can be obtained.\"\n\n[[Adam Smith]], in ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'', had claimed that individuals have sympathy for the well-being of others. On the other hand, in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\"<ref>Smith, Adam. \u201cOn the Division of Labour,\u201d The Wealth of Nations, Books I\u2013III. New York: Penguin Classics, 1986, p. 119</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis comment now suggests the same sort of rational, self-interested, labor-averse individual that Mill proposed.\n\nEconomists in the late 19th century\u2014such as [[Francis Edgeworth]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], [[L\u00e9on Walras]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]\u2014built mathematical models on these economic assumptions.  In the 20th century, the [[rational choice theory]] of [[Lionel Robbins]] came to dominate mainstream economics. The term \"economic man\" then took on a more specific meaning: a person who acted rationally on complete knowledge out of self-interest and the desire for wealth.\n\n==Model==\n''Homo economicus'' is a term used for an approximation or [[Economic model|model]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' that acts to obtain the highest possible well-being for him or herself given available information about opportunities and other constraints, both natural and [[institution]]al, on his ability to achieve his predetermined goals. This approach has been formalized in certain [[social sciences]] models, particularly in [[economics]].\n\n''Homo economicus'' is seen as \"rational\" in the sense that well-being as defined by the [[utility function]] is optimized given perceived opportunities. That is, the individual seeks to attain very specific and predetermined goals to the greatest extent with the least possible cost. Note that this kind of \"rationality\" does not say that the individual's actual goals are \"rational\" in some larger ethical, social, or human sense, only that he tries to attain them at minimal cost. Only na\u00efve applications of the ''homo economicus'' model assume that this hypothetical individual knows what is best for his long-term physical and mental health and can be relied upon to always make the right decision for himself. See [[rational choice theory]] and [[rational expectations]] for further discussion; the article on [[rationality]] widens the discussion.\n\nAs in social science, these assumptions are at best approximations. The term is often used derogatorily in academic literature, perhaps most commonly by [[sociology|sociologists]], many of whom tend to prefer structural explanations to ones based on rational action by individuals.\n\nThe use of the Latin form ''homo economicus'' is certainly long established; Persky<ref name=persky/> traces it back to [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] (1906)<ref>Pareto, Vilfredo (1906). \"Manual of political economy\".</ref> but notes that it may be older. The English term ''economic man'' can be found even earlier, in [[John Kells Ingram]]'s ''A History of Political Economy'' (1888).<ref>Zabieglik, Stefan (2002). \"The Origins of the Term ''Homo Oeconomicus''\", Gdansk, 123\u2013130.</ref>  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (O.E.D.)'' cites the use of ''homo oeconomicus'' by [[Charles Stanton Devas|C. S. Devas]] in his 1883 work ''The Groundwork of Economics'' in reference to Mill's writings, as one of a number of phrases that imitate the scientific name for the human species:\n\n{{quote|Mill has only examined the ''homo oeconomicus'', or dollar-hunting animal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/87988#eid215918154|title=homo oeconomicus|url-access=subscription |work=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'', the human genus name ''homo'' is\n\n{{quote|Used with [[Latin|L.]] or mock-L. adjs. in names imitating ''Homo sapiens,'' ''etc.,'' and intended to personify some aspect of human life or behaviour (indicated by the adj.). ''Homo faber'' (\"feIb@(r)) [H. Bergson L'Evolution Cr\u00e9atrice (1907) ii. 151], a term used to designate man as a maker of tools.) Variants are often comic: ''Homo insipiens;'' ''Homo turisticus.''<ref>This is from the CD edition of 2002.</ref>}}\n\nNote that such forms should logically keep the capital for the \"genus\" name\u2014''i.e.,'' ''<u>H</u>omo economicus'' rather than ''<u>h</u>omo economicus.'' Actual usage is inconsistent.\n\n[[Amartya Sen]] has argued there are grave pitfalls in assuming that rationality is limited to selfish rationality. Economics should build into its assumptions the notion that people can give credible commitments to a course of conduct. He demonstrates the absurdity with the narrowness of the assumptions by some economists with the following example of two strangers meeting on a street.<ref>AK Sen, \u2018Rational Fools: A Critique of the Behavioural Foundations of Economic Theory\u2019 (1977) 6 Philosophy and Public Affairs 317, 332</ref>\n\n{{Cquote|\"Where is the railway station?\" he asks me. \"There,\" I say, pointing at the post office, \"and would you please post this letter for me on the way?\" \"Yes,\" he says, determined to open the envelope and check whether it contains something valuable.}}\n\n== Criticisms ==\n''Homo economicus'' bases its choices on a consideration of its own personal \"utility function\".\n\nConsequently, the ''homo economicus'' assumptions have been criticized not only by economists on the basis of logical arguments, but also on empirical grounds by cross-cultural comparison. Economic anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]],<ref>Marshall Sahlins: ''[http://www.eco-action.org/dt/affluent.html The Original Affluent Society],'' in: Marshall Sahlins (1972''): Stone Age Economics.'' London: Routledge 2003</ref> [[Karl Polanyi]],<ref>Karl Polanyi (1944): ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]].'' Beacon Press 2001</ref> [[Marcel Mauss]]<ref>Marcel Mauss (1924): ''[[The Gift (Mauss book)|The Gift]]. The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.'' London: Routledge 2006</ref> and [[Maurice Godelier]]<ref>Maurice Godelier: ''The Enigma of the Gift.'' University Of Chicago Press 1999</ref> have demonstrated that in traditional societies, choices people make regarding production and exchange of goods follow patterns of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] which differ sharply from what the ''homo economicus'' model postulates. Such systems have been termed [[gift economy]] rather than market economy. Criticisms of the ''homo economicus'' model put forward from the standpoint of ethics usually refer to this traditional ethic of kinship-based reciprocity that held together traditional societies.\n\n{{more citations needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nEconomists [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and many of the [[Austrian School]] criticise ''homo economicus'' as an actor with too great an understanding of macroeconomics and economic forecasting in his decision making. They stress [[uncertainty]] and [[bounded rationality]] in the making of economic decisions, rather than relying on the rational man who is fully informed of all circumstances impinging on his decisions. They argue that perfect knowledge never exists, which means that all economic activity implies risk. Austrian economists rather prefer to use as a model tool the ''[[homo agens]]''.\n\nEmpirical studies by [[Amos Tversky]] questioned the assumption that investors are rational. In 1995, Tversky demonstrated the tendency of investors to make risk-averse choices in gains, and risk-seeking choices in losses. The investors appeared as very risk-averse for small losses but indifferent for a small chance of a very large loss. This violates economic rationality as usually understood. Further research on this subject, showing other deviations from conventionally defined economic rationality, is being done in the growing field of experimental or [[behavioral economics]]. Some of the broader issues involved in this criticism are studied in [[decision theory]], of which [[rational choice theory]] is only a subset.\n\nBehavioral economists [[Richard Thaler]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] have criticized the notion of economic agents possessing stable and well-defined preferences that they consistently act upon in a self-interested manner. Using insights from psychological experiments found explanations for anomalies in economic decision-making that seemed to violate rational choice theory. Writing a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives under the title ''Anomalies'', Thaler wrote features on the many ways observed economic behavior in markets deviated from theory. One such anomaly was the endowment effect by which individual preferences are framed based on reference positions (Kahneman et al., 1990). In an experiment in which one group was given a mug and the other was asked how much they were [[willingness to pay]] (WTP) for the mug, it was found that the price that those endowed with the mug where willingness to accept (WTA) greatly exceeded that of the WTP. This was seen as falsifying the [[Coase theorem]] in which for every person the WTA equals the WTP that is the basis of the efficient market hypothesis. From this they argued the endowment effect acts on us by making it painful for us to give up the endowment. Kahneman also argued against the rational-agent model in which agents make decisions with all of the relevant context including weighing all possible future opportunities and risks. Evidence supports the claim that decisions are often made by \u201cnarrow framing\u201d with investors making portfolio decisions in isolation from their entire portfolio (Nicholas Barberis et al., 2003). [[Shlomo Benartzi]] and Thaler found that investors also tended to use unreasonable time periods in evaluating their investments.<ref>Benartzi and Thaler, [https://doi.org/10.2307/2118511 \"Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Premium Puzzle\"], 1995</ref>\n\nOther critics of the ''homo economicus'' model of humanity, such as [[Bruno Frey]], point to the excessive emphasis on [[extrinsic motivation]] (rewards and punishments from the social environment) as opposed to [[intrinsic motivation]]. For example, it is difficult if not impossible to understand how ''homo economicus'' would be a hero in war or would get inherent pleasure from [[artisan|craftsmanship]]. Frey and others argue that too much emphasis on rewards and punishments can \"crowd out\" (discourage) intrinsic motivation: paying a boy for doing household tasks may push him from doing those tasks \"to help the family\" to doing them simply for the reward.\n\nAnother weakness is highlighted by economic sociologists and anthropologists, who argue that ''homo economicus'' ignores an extremely important question, i.e. the origins of tastes and the parameters of the utility function by social influences, training, education, and the like. The exogeneity of tastes (preferences) in this model is the major distinction from ''[[homo sociologicus]],'' in which tastes are taken as partially or even totally determined by the societal environment (see below).\n\nFurther critics{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=March 2019}}, learning from the broadly defined [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] tradition, criticize the ''homo economicus'' model as ignoring the inner conflicts that real-world individuals suffer, as between short-term and long-term goals (''e.g.,'' eating chocolate cake and losing weight) or between individual goals and societal values. Such conflicts may lead to \"irrational\" behavior involving inconsistency, psychological paralysis, neurosis, and psychic pain. Further irrational human behaviour can occur as a result of habit, laziness, mimicry and simple obedience.\n\nThe emerging science of \"[[neuroeconomics]]\" suggests that there are serious shortcomings in the conventional theories of economic rationality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitz | first1 = Sigrid | last2 = K\u00f6eszegi | first2 = Sabine T. | last3 = Enzenhofer | first3 = Bettina | last4 = Harrer | first4 = Christine | author-link1 = Sigrid Schmitz | title = Quo vadis homo economicus?

Others argue that we need to understand the consequences of such narrow-minded greed even if only a small percentage of the population embraces such motives. [[Free rider problem|Free riders]], for example, would have a major negative impact on the provision of [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s. However, economists' supply and demand predictions might obtain even if only a significant minority of market participants act like ''homo economicus''. In this view, the assumption of ''homo economicus'' can and should be simply a preliminary step on the road to a more sophisticated model.\n\nYet others argue that ''homo economicus'' is a reasonable approximation for behavior within market institutions, since the individualized nature of human action in such social settings encourages individualistic behavior. Not only do market settings encourage the application of a simple cost-benefit calculus by individuals, but they reward and thus attract the more individualistic people. It can be difficult to apply social values (as opposed to following self-interest) in an extremely competitive market; a company that refuses to pollute, for example, may find itself bankrupt.\n\nDefenders of the ''homo economicus'' model see many critics of the dominant school as using a [[straw man]] technique. For example, it is common for critics to argue that real people do not have cost-less access to infinite information and an innate ability to instantly process it. However, in advanced-level theoretical economics, scholars have found ways of addressing these problems, modifying models enough to more realistically depict real-life decision-making. For example, models of individual behavior under [[bounded rationality]] and of people suffering from [[envy]] can be found in the literature.<ref>Geoffrey Brennan: \"[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Culture-Social-Norms-and-Economics/Mark-Casson/e/9781858986173 Pareto Desirable Redistribution: The case of Malice and Envy]\" in: ''Culture, Social Norms and Economics'' (1997)</ref> It is primarily when targeting the limiting assumptions made in constructing undergraduate models that the criticisms listed above are valid. These criticisms are especially valid to the extent that the professor asserts that the simplifying assumptions are true or uses them in a propagandistic way.\n\nThe more sophisticated economists are quite conscious of the empirical limitations of the ''homo economicus'' model. In theory, the views of the critics can be combined with the ''homo economicus'' model to attain a more accurate model.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Perspectives ==\nAccording to Sergio Caruso, when talking of ''Homo economicus'', one should distinguish between the purely \u201cmethodological\u201d versions, aimed at practical use in the economic sphere (e.g. economic calculus), and the\u201d anthropological\u201d versions, more ambitiously aimed at depicting a certain type of man (supposed to be actually existing), or even human nature in general. The former, traditionally founded on a merely speculative psychology, have proved unrealistic and frankly wrong as descriptive models of economic behaviour (therefore not applicable for normative purposes either); however, they are liable to be corrected resorting to the new empirically based [[economic psychology]], which turns quite other than the philosophers\u2019 psychology that economists have used until yesterday. Among the latter (i.e. the anthropological versions), one can make a further distinction between the weak versions, more plausible, and the strong ones, irreparably ideological. Depicting different types of \u201ceconomic man\u201d (each depending on the social context) is in fact possible with the help of [[cultural anthropology]], and [[social psychology]] (a branch of psychology economists have strangely ignored), if only those types are contrived as socially and/or historically determined abstractions (such as [[Max Weber|Weber's]], [[Karl Korsch|Korsch's]], and [[Erich Fromm|Fromm's]] concepts of ''Idealtypus'', \u201chistorical specification\u201d, and \u201csocial character\u201d). Even a Marxist theoretician such as [[Antonio Gramsci|Gramsci]]\u2014reminds Caruso\u2014admitted of the ''homo economicus'' as a useful abstraction on the ground of economic theory, provided that we grant there be as many ''homines oeconomici'' as the modes of production. On the contrary, when one concept of ''homo economicus'' claims to grasp the eternal essence of what is human, at the same time putting aside all other aspects of human nature (such as ''homo faber'', ''homo loquens'', ''homo ludens'', ''homo reciprocans'', and so on), then the concept leaves the field of good philosophy, not to speak of social science, and is ready to enter a political doctrine as the most dangerous of its ideological ingredients.<ref>Caruso, Sergio: ''Homo oeconomicus.

They will always be capable of thinking through all possible outcomes and choosing that course of action which will result in the best possible result.  \n\nThe rationality implied in ''homo economicus'' does not restrict what sort of preferences are admissible. Only na\u00efve applications of the ''homo economicus'' model assume that agents know what is best for their long-term physical and mental health. For example, an agent's utility function could be linked to the perceived utility of other agents (such as one's wife or children), making ''homo economicus'' compatible with other models such as ''[[homo reciprocans]],'' which emphasizes human [[Cooperation#In humans|cooperation]]. \n\nAs a theory on human conduct, it contrasts to the concepts of [[behavioral economics]], which examines [[cognitive biases]] and other [[irrationalities]], and to [[bounded rationality]], which assumes that practical elements such as cognitive and time limitations restrict the rationality of agents. \n\n== History of the term ==\nThe term \"economic man\" was used for the first time in the late nineteenth century by critics of [[John Stuart Mill]]'s work on political economy.<ref name=persky>Persky, Joseph. \"Retrospectives: The Ethology of Homo Economicus.\" ''The Journal of Economic Perspectives'', Vol. 9, No. 2 (Spring, 1995), pp. 221\u2013231</ref> Below is a passage from Mill's work that critics referred to:\n\n<blockquote>\"[Political economy] does not treat the whole of man\u2019s nature as modified by the social state, nor of the whole conduct of man in society. It is concerned with him solely as a being who desires to possess wealth, and who is capable of judging the comparative efficacy of means for obtaining that end.\"<ref>Mill, John Stuart. \"On the Definition of Political Economy, and on the Method of Investigation Proper to It,\" London and Westminster Review, October 1836. ''Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy'', 2nd ed. London: Longmans, Green, Reader & Dyer, 1874, essay 5, paragraphs 38 and 48.</ref></blockquote>\n\nLater in the same work, Mill stated that he was proposing \"an arbitrary definition of man, as a being who inevitably does that by which he may obtain the greatest amount of necessaries, conveniences, and luxuries, with the smallest quantity of labour and physical self-denial with which they can be obtained.\"\n\n[[Adam Smith]], in ''[[The Theory of Moral Sentiments]]'', had claimed that individuals have sympathy for the well-being of others. On the other hand, in ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', Smith wrote:\n\n<blockquote>\"It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest.\"<ref>Smith, Adam. \u201cOn the Division of Labour,\u201d The Wealth of Nations, Books I\u2013III. New York: Penguin Classics, 1986, p. 119</ref></blockquote>\n\nThis comment now suggests the same sort of rational, self-interested, labor-averse individual that Mill proposed. \n\nEconomists in the late 19th century\u2014such as [[Francis Edgeworth]], [[William Stanley Jevons]], [[L\u00e9on Walras]], and [[Vilfredo Pareto]]\u2014built mathematical models on these economic assumptions.  In the 20th century, the [[rational choice theory]] of [[Lionel Robbins]] came to dominate mainstream economics. The term \"economic man\" then took on a more specific meaning: a person who acted rationally on complete knowledge out of self-interest and the desire for wealth.\n\n==Model==\n''Homo economicus'' is a term used for an approximation or [[Economic model|model]] of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' that acts to obtain the highest possible well-being for him or herself given available information about opportunities and other constraints, both natural and [[institution]]al, on his ability to achieve his predetermined goals. This approach has been formalized in certain [[social sciences]] models, particularly in [[economics]].\n\n''Homo economicus'' is seen as \"rational\" in the sense that well-being as defined by the [[utility function]] is optimized given perceived opportunities. That is, the individual seeks to attain very specific and predetermined goals to the greatest extent with the least possible cost. Note that this kind of \"rationality\" does not say that the individual's actual goals are \"rational\" in some larger ethical, social, or human sense, only that he tries to attain them at minimal cost. Only na\u00efve applications of the ''homo economicus'' model assume that this hypothetical individual knows what is best for his long-term physical and mental health and can be relied upon to always make the right decision for himself. See [[rational choice theory]] and [[rational expectations]] for further discussion; the article on [[rationality]] widens the discussion.\n\nAs in social science, these assumptions are at best approximations. The term is often used derogatorily in academic literature, perhaps most commonly by [[sociology|sociologists]], many of whom tend to prefer structural explanations to ones based on rational action by individuals.\n\nThe use of the Latin form ''homo economicus'' is certainly long established; Persky<ref name=persky/> traces it back to [[Vilfredo Pareto|Pareto]] (1906)<ref>Pareto, Vilfredo (1906). \"Manual of political economy\".</ref> but notes that it may be older. The English term ''economic man'' can be found even earlier, in [[John Kells Ingram]]'s ''A History of Political Economy'' (1888).<ref>Zabieglik, Stefan (2002). \"The Origins of the Term ''Homo Oeconomicus''\", Gdansk, 123\u2013130.</ref>  The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]] (O.E.D.)'' cites the use of ''homo oeconomicus'' by [[Charles Stanton Devas|C. S. Devas]] in his 1883 work ''The Groundwork of Economics'' in reference to Mill's writings, as one of a number of phrases that imitate the scientific name for the human species:\n\n{{quote|Mill has only examined the ''homo oeconomicus'', or dollar-hunting animal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/87988#eid215918154|title=homo oeconomicus|url-access=subscription |work=Oxford English Dictionary}}</ref>}}\n\nAccording to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]]'', the human genus name ''homo'' is\n\n{{quote|Used with [[Latin|L.]] or mock-L. adjs. in names imitating ''Homo sapiens,'' ''etc.,'' and intended to personify some aspect of human life or behaviour (indicated by the adj.).

Variants are often comic: ''Homo insipiens;'' ''Homo turisticus.''<ref>This is from the CD edition of 2002.</ref>}}\n\nNote that such forms should logically keep the capital for the \"genus\" name\u2014''i.e.,'' ''<u>H</u>omo economicus'' rather than ''<u>h</u>omo economicus.'' Actual usage is inconsistent.\n\n[[Amartya Sen]] has argued there are grave pitfalls in assuming that rationality is limited to selfish rationality. Economics should build into its assumptions the notion that people can give credible commitments to a course of conduct. He demonstrates the absurdity with the narrowness of the assumptions by some economists with the following example of two strangers meeting on a street.<ref>AK Sen, \u2018Rational Fools: A Critique of the Behavioural Foundations of Economic Theory\u2019 (1977) 6 Philosophy and Public Affairs 317, 332</ref>\n\n{{Cquote|\"Where is the railway station?\" he asks me. \"There,\" I say, pointing at the post office, \"and would you please post this letter for me on the way?\" \"Yes,\" he says, determined to open the envelope and check whether it contains something valuable.}}\n\n== Criticisms ==\n''Homo economicus'' bases its choices on a consideration of its own personal \"utility function\".\n\nConsequently, the ''homo economicus'' assumptions have been criticized not only by economists on the basis of logical arguments, but also on empirical grounds by cross-cultural comparison. Economic anthropologists such as [[Marshall Sahlins]],<ref>Marshall Sahlins: ''[http://www.eco-action.org/dt/affluent.html The Original Affluent Society],'' in: Marshall Sahlins (1972''): Stone Age Economics.'' London: Routledge 2003</ref> [[Karl Polanyi]],<ref>Karl Polanyi (1944): ''[[The Great Transformation (book)|The Great Transformation]].'' Beacon Press 2001</ref> [[Marcel Mauss]]<ref>Marcel Mauss (1924): ''[[The Gift (Mauss book)|The Gift]]. The Form and Reason for Exchange in Archaic Societies.'' London: Routledge 2006</ref> and [[Maurice Godelier]]<ref>Maurice Godelier: ''The Enigma of the Gift.'' University Of Chicago Press 1999</ref> have demonstrated that in traditional societies, choices people make regarding production and exchange of goods follow patterns of [[reciprocity (cultural anthropology)|reciprocity]] which differ sharply from what the ''homo economicus'' model postulates. Such systems have been termed [[gift economy]] rather than market economy. Criticisms of the ''homo economicus'' model put forward from the standpoint of ethics usually refer to this traditional ethic of kinship-based reciprocity that held together traditional societies.\n\n{{refimprove|date=April 2018}}\n\nEconomists [[Thorstein Veblen]], [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and many of the [[Austrian School]] criticise ''homo economicus'' as an actor with too great an understanding of macroeconomics and economic forecasting in his decision making. They stress [[uncertainty]] and [[bounded rationality]] in the making of economic decisions, rather than relying on the rational man who is fully informed of all circumstances impinging on his decisions. They argue that perfect knowledge never exists, which means that all economic activity implies risk. Austrian economists rather prefer to use as a model tool the ''[[homo agens]]''.\n\nEmpirical studies by [[Amos Tversky]] questioned the assumption that investors are rational. In 1995, Tversky demonstrated the tendency of investors to make risk-averse choices in gains, and risk-seeking choices in losses. The investors appeared as very risk-averse for small losses but indifferent for a small chance of a very large loss. This violates economic rationality as usually understood. Further research on this subject, showing other deviations from conventionally defined economic rationality, is being done in the growing field of experimental or [[behavioral economics]]. Some of the broader issues involved in this criticism are studied in [[decision theory]], of which [[rational choice theory]] is only a subset.\n\nBehavioral economists [[Richard Thaler]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]] have criticized the notion of economic agents possessing stable and well-defined preferences that they consistently act upon in a self-interested manner. Using insights from psychological experiments found explanations for anomalies in economic decision-making that seemed to violate rational choice theory. Writing a column in the Journal of Economic Perspectives under the title ''Anomalies'', Thaler wrote features on the many ways observed economic behavior in markets deviated from theory. One such anomaly was the endowment effect by which individual preferences are framed based on reference positions (Kahneman et al., 1990). In an experiment in which one group was given a mug and the other was asked how much they were [[willingness to pay]] (WTP) for the mug, it was found that the price that those endowed with the mug where willingness to accept (WTA) greatly exceeded that of the WTP. This was seen as falsifying the [[Coase theorem]] in which for every person the WTA equals the WTP that is the basis of the efficient market hypothesis. From this they argued the endowment effect acts on us by making it painful for us to give up the endowment. Kahneman also argued against the rational-agent model in which agents make decisions with all of the relevant context including weighing all possible future opportunities and risks. Evidence supports the claim that decisions are often made by \u201cnarrow framing\u201d with investors making portfolio decisions in isolation from their entire portfolio (Nicholas Barberis et al., 2003). [[Shlomo Benartzi]] and Thaler found that investors also tended to use unreasonable time periods in evaluating their investments<ref>Benartzi and Thaler, [https://doi.org/10.2307/2118511 \"Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Premium Puzzle\"], 1995</ref>.\n\nOther critics of the ''homo economicus'' model of humanity, such as [[Bruno Frey]], point to the excessive emphasis on [[extrinsic motivation]] (rewards and punishments from the social environment) as opposed to [[intrinsic motivation]]. For example, it is difficult if not impossible to understand how ''homo economicus'' would be a hero in war or would get inherent pleasure from [[artisan|craftsmanship]]. Frey and others argue that too much emphasis on rewards and punishments can \"crowd out\" (discourage) intrinsic motivation: paying a boy for doing household tasks may push him from doing those tasks \"to help the family\" to doing them simply for the reward.\n\nAnother weakness is highlighted by economic sociologists and anthropologists, who argue that ''homo economicus'' ignores an extremely important question, i.e. the origins of tastes and the parameters of the utility function by social influences, training, education, and the like. The exogeneity of tastes (preferences) in this model is the major distinction from ''[[homo sociologicus]],'' in which tastes are taken as partially or even totally determined by the societal environment (see below).\n\nFurther critics{{Citation needed|reason=Who?|date=March 2019}}, learning from the broadly defined [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] tradition, criticize the ''homo economicus'' model as ignoring the inner conflicts that real-world individuals suffer, as between short-term and long-term goals (''e.g.,'' eating chocolate cake and losing weight) or between individual goals and societal values. Such conflicts may lead to \"irrational\" behavior involving inconsistency, psychological paralysis, neurosis, and psychic pain. Further irrational human behaviour can occur as a result of habit, laziness, mimicry and simple obedience.\n\nThe emerging science of \"[[neuroeconomics]]\" suggests that there are serious shortcomings in the conventional theories of economic rationality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Schmitz | first1 = Sigrid | last2 = K\u00f6eszegi | first2 = Sabine T. | last3 = Enzenhofer | first3 = Bettina | last4 = Harrer | first4 = Christine | author-link1 = Sigrid Schmitz | title = Quo vadis homo economicus?

Others argue that we need to understand the consequences of such narrow-minded greed even if only a small percentage of the population embraces such motives. [[Free rider problem|Free riders]], for example, would have a major negative impact on the provision of [[Public good (economics)|public good]]s. However, economists' supply and demand predictions might obtain even if only a significant minority of market participants act like ''homo economicus''. In this view, the assumption of ''homo economicus'' can and should be simply a preliminary step on the road to a more sophisticated model.\n\nYet others argue that ''homo economicus'' is a reasonable approximation for behavior within market institutions, since the individualized nature of human action in such social settings encourages individualistic behavior. Not only do market settings encourage the application of a simple cost-benefit calculus by individuals, but they reward and thus attract the more individualistic people. It can be difficult to apply social values (as opposed to following self-interest) in an extremely competitive market; a company that refuses to pollute, for example, may find itself bankrupt.\n\nDefenders of the ''homo economicus'' model see many critics of the dominant school as using a [[straw man]] technique. For example, it is common for critics to argue that real people do not have cost-less access to infinite information and an innate ability to instantly process it. However, in advanced-level theoretical economics, scholars have found ways of addressing these problems, modifying models enough to more realistically depict real-life decision-making. For example, models of individual behavior under [[bounded rationality]] and of people suffering from [[envy]] can be found in the literature.<ref>Geoffrey Brennan: \"[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/Culture-Social-Norms-and-Economics/Mark-Casson/e/9781858986173 Pareto Desirable Redistribution: The case of Malice and Envy]\" in: ''Culture, Social Norms and Economics'' (1997)</ref> It is primarily when targeting the limiting assumptions made in constructing undergraduate models that the criticisms listed above are valid. These criticisms are especially valid to the extent that the professor asserts that the simplifying assumptions are true or uses them in a propagandistic way.\n\nThe more sophisticated economists are quite conscious of the empirical limitations of the ''homo economicus'' model. In theory, the views of the critics can be combined with the ''homo economicus'' model to attain a more accurate model.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n== Perspectives ==\nAccording to Sergio Caruso, when talking of ''Homo economicus'', one should distinguish between the purely \u201cmethodological\u201d versions, aimed at practical use in the economic sphere (e.g. economic calculus), and the\u201d anthropological\u201d versions, more ambitiously aimed at depicting a certain type of man (supposed to be actually existing), or even human nature in general. The former, traditionally founded on a merely speculative psychology, have proved unrealistic and frankly wrong as descriptive models of economic behaviour (therefore not applicable for normative purposes either); however, they are liable to be corrected resorting to the new empirically based [[economic psychology]], which turns quite other than the philosophers\u2019 psychology that economists have used until yesterday.

In 1077 the governorship of the province, which since 1042/1043 belonged to the [[Seljuqs]], fell into the hands of [[Anush Tigin Gharchai]], a former [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] slave of the Seljuq sultan. In 1141, the Seljuq Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar]] was defeated by the [[Qara Khitai]] at the [[battle of Qatwan]], and Anush Tigin's grandson [[Atsiz|Ala ad-Din Atsiz]] became a vassal to [[Yel\u00fc Dashi]] of the [[Qara Khitan]].<ref>Biran, Michel, ''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History'', (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.</ref>\n\nSultan Ahmed Sanjar died in 1156.

In 1194, the last Sultan of the Great Seljuq Empire, [[Toghrul III]], was defeated and killed by the Khwarezm ruler [[Ala ad-Din Tekish]], who conquered parts of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and western Iran. In 1200, Tekish died and was succeeded by his son, [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]], who initiated a conflict with the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] and was defeated by them at Amu Darya (1204).<ref>Rene, Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', (Rutgers University Press, 1991), 168.</ref> Following the sack of Khwarizm, Muhammad appealed for aid from his suzerain, the Qara Khitai who sent him an army.<ref>Rene, Grousset, 168.</ref> With this reinforcement, Muhammad won a victory over the Ghorids at Hezarasp (1204) and forced them out of Khwarizm.\n\nAla ad-Din Muhammad's alliance with his suzerain was short-lived.

Genghis Khan demanded reparations, which the Shah refused to pay. Genghis retaliated with a force of 200,000 men, launching a multi-pronged invasion. In February 1220 the [[Mongol]]ian army crossed the [[Syr Darya]]. The Mongols stormed [[Bukhara]], [[Kunya Urgench|Gurganj]] and the Khwarezmid capital [[Samarkand]]. The Shah fled and died some weeks later on an island in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe son of Ala ad-Din Muhammad, [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]] became the new Sultan (he rejected the title Shah). He attempted to flee to [[India]], but the Mongols caught up with him before he got there, and he was defeated at the [[Battle of Indus]]. He escaped and sought asylum in the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]. [[Iltumish]] however denied this to him in deference to the relationship with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphs]]. Returning to [[Persia]], he gathered an army and re-established a kingdom. He never consolidated his power, however, spending the rest of his days struggling against the Mongols, the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Seljuks of Rum]], and pretenders to his own throne. He lost his power over Persia in a battle against the Mongols in the [[Alborz]] Mountains. Escaping to the [[Caucasus]], he captured [[Azerbaijan]] in 1225, setting up his capital at [[Tabriz]]. In 1226 he attacked [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and sacked [[Tbilisi]]. Following on through the [[Armenia]]n highlands he clashed with the [[Ayyubids]], capturing the town [[Ahlat]] along the western shores of the [[Lake Van]], who sought the aid of the Seljuk [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Sultan [[Kayqubad I]] defeated him at [[Erzincan|Arzinjan]] on the Upper [[Euphrates]] at the [[Battle of Yass\u0131\u00e7emen]] in 1230.

Sultan Jalal ad-Din's followers remained loyal to him even after his death in 1231, and raided the Seljuk lands of [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] and [[Syria]] for the next several years, calling themselves the ''Khwarezmiyya''. [[Ayyubid]] Sultan [[as-Salih Ayyub]], in Egypt, later hired their services against his uncle [[As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus|as-Salih Ismail]]. The ''Khwarezmiyya'', heading south from Iraq towards Egypt, invaded [[Crusades|Crusader]]-held [[Jerusalem]] along the way, on 11 July 1244. The city's citadel, the [[Tower of David]], surrendered on August 23, and the Christian population of the city was expelled. This triggered a call from Europe for the [[Seventh Crusade]], but the Crusaders would never again be successful in retaking Jerusalem. After being conquered by the Khwarezmian forces, the city stayed under Muslim control until 1917, [[Battle of Jerusalem|when it was taken]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] by the [[British Empire|British]].\n\nAfter taking Jerusalem, the Khwarezmian forces continued south, and on October 17 fought on the side of the Ayyubids at the [[Battle of La Forbie]], as the Crusaders used to call [[Hiribya|Harbiyah]], a village northeast of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], destroying the remains of the Crusader army there, with some 1,200 knights killed.

In 1141, the Seljuq Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar]] was defeated by the [[Qara Khitai]] at the [[battle of Qatwan]], and Anush Tigin's grandson [[Atsiz|Ala ad-Din Atsiz]] became a vassal to [[Yel\u00fc Dashi]] of the [[Qara Khitan]].<ref>Biran, Michel, ''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History'', (Cambridge University Press, 2005), 44.</ref>\n\nSultan Ahmed Sanjar died in 1156. As the Seljuk state fell into chaos, the Khwarezm-Shahs expanded their territories southward. In 1194, the last Sultan of the Great Seljuq Empire, [[Toghrul III]], was defeated and killed by the Khwarezm ruler [[Ala ad-Din Tekish]], who conquered parts of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] and western Iran. In 1200, Tekish died and was succeeded by his son, [[Muhammad II of Khwarezm|Ala ad-Din Muhammad]], who initiated a conflict with the [[Ghurid dynasty|Ghurids]] and was defeated by them at Amu Darya (1204).<ref>Rene, Grousset, ''The Empire of the Steppes:A History of Central Asia'', (Rutgers University Press, 1991), 168.</ref> Following the sack of Khwarizm, Muhammad appealed for aid from his suzerain, the Qara Khitai who sent him an army.<ref>Rene, Grousset, 168.</ref> With this reinforcement, Muhammad won a victory over the Ghorids at Hezarasp (1204) and forced them out of Khwarizm.\n\nAla ad-Din Muhammad's alliance with his suzerain was short-lived.

Thus incorporating nearly the whole of [[Transoxania]]{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} and present-day [[Afghanistan]] into his empire, which after further conquests in western Persia (by 1217) stretched from the [[Syr Darya]] to the [[Zagros Mountains]], and from the northern parts of the [[Hindu Kush]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. By 1218, the empire had a population of 5 million people.<ref>John Man, \"Genghis Khan: Life, Death, and Resurrection\", Feb. 6 2007.

Genghis Khan demanded reparations, which the Shah refused to pay. Genghis retaliated with a force of 200,000 men, launching a multi-pronged invasion. In February 1220 the [[Mongol]]ian army crossed the [[Syr Darya]]. The Mongols stormed [[Bukhara]], [[Kunya Urgench|Gurganj]] and the Khwarezmid capital [[Samarkand]]. The Shah fled and died some weeks later on an island in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe son of Ala ad-Din Muhammad, [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]] became the new Sultan (he rejected the title Shah). He attempted to flee to [[India]], but the Mongols caught up with him before he got there, and he was defeated at the [[Battle of Indus]]. He escaped and sought asylum in the [[Sultanate of Delhi]]. [[Iltumish]] however denied this to him in deference to the relationship with the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphs]]. Returning to [[Persia]], he gathered an army and re-established a kingdom. He never consolidated his power, however, spending the rest of his days struggling against the Mongols, the [[Seljuk Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Seljuks of Rum]], and pretenders to his own throne. He lost his power over Persia in a battle against the Mongols in the [[Alborz]] Mountains. Escaping to the [[Caucasus]], he captured [[Azerbaijan]] in 1225, setting up his capital at [[Tabriz]]. In 1226 he attacked [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and sacked [[Tbilisi]]. Following on through the [[Armenia]]n highlands he clashed with the [[Ayyubids]], capturing the town [[Ahlat]] along the western shores of the [[Lake Van]], who sought the aid of the Seljuk [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Sultan [[Kayqubad I]] defeated him at [[Erzincan|Arzinjan]] on the Upper [[Euphrates]] at the [[Battle of Yass\u0131\u00e7emen]] in 1230. He escaped to [[Diyarbakir]], while the Mongols conquered Azerbaijan in the ensuing confusion. He was murdered in 1231 by [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] highwaymen.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=90001012&ct=107&rqs=68&rqs=491&rqs=893 |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 March 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006044631/http://persian.packhum.org/persian/pf?file=90001012&ct=107&rqs=68&rqs=491&rqs=893 |archive-date=6 October 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Mercenaries==\n[[File:Premongol.png|thumb|left|180px|[[Eurasia]] c. 1200, on the eve of the Mongol invasions.]]\n\nThough the Mongols had destroyed the Khwarezmian Empire in 1220, many Khwarezmians survived by working as mercenaries in northern [[Iraq]]. Sultan Jalal ad-Din's followers remained loyal to him even after his death in 1231, and raided the Seljuk lands of [[Al Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] and [[Syria]] for the next several years, calling themselves the ''Khwarezmiyya''. [[Ayyubid]] Sultan [[as-Salih Ayyub]], in Egypt, later hired their services against his uncle [[As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus|as-Salih Ismail]]. The ''Khwarezmiyya'', heading south from Iraq towards Egypt, invaded [[Crusades|Crusader]]-held [[Jerusalem]] along the way, on 11 July 1244. The city's citadel, the [[Tower of David]], surrendered on August 23, and the Christian population of the city was expelled. This triggered a call from Europe for the [[Seventh Crusade]], but the Crusaders would never again be successful in retaking Jerusalem. After being conquered by the Khwarezmian forces, the city stayed under Muslim control until 1917, [[Battle of Jerusalem|when it was taken]] from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] by the [[British Empire|British]].\n\nAfter taking Jerusalem, the Khwarezmian forces continued south, and on October 17 fought on the side of the Ayyubids at the [[Battle of La Forbie]], as the Crusaders used to call [[Hiribya|Harbiyah]], a village northeast of [[Gaza City|Gaza]], destroying the remains of the Crusader army there, with some 1,200 knights killed. It was the largest battle involving the Crusaders since the [[Battle of Hattin|Battle of the Horns of Hattin]] in 1187.<ref>Riley-Smith ''The Crusades'', p. 191</ref>\n\nThe remains of the Muslim Khwarezmians served in Egypt as [[Mamluk]] mercenaries until they were finally beaten by [[al-Mansur Ibrahim]] some years later.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nKhwarizmi war captives assimilated into the Mongols, forming the modern Mongolian clan [[Sartuul]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\n==Rulers of Khwarezm==\n\n===Mamunid Governors of Khwarezm===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The format of the show is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and is based on the original [[Dragons' Den#Japan|Japanese programme]], which has been sold around the world. The programme has been produced by [[BBC Manchester]] since its inception and was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 4 January 2005.\n\nThe show allows several [[entrepreneurs]] an opportunity to present their varying business ideas to a panel of five wealthy investors, the \"Dragons\" of the show's title, and pitch for financial investment while offering a stake of the company in return.\n\n==Programme==\n\n===Format===\nContestants have what they believe to be a viable and potentially profitable business idea but lack funding, or are already operating their business, but need additional funds for promotion or expansion. As part of their opening pitch, they are required to specify the amount of money they require from the Dragons. The rules stipulate that if they do not raise at least this amount from one or more Dragons, then they would leave with nothing. In exchange for the investment, the contestants offer [[Stock|equity]] in their business, the percentage of which is also stipulated at the beginning of the pitch. If the Dragons see potential in the business idea or product, negotiations then take place around the amount of equity on offer, with the contestant having the opportunity to negotiate further, accept any offers, or simply walk away. Dragons can also offer a percentage of the money requested if they do not wish to commit the full amount, leaving the other Dragons free to do the same. This can lead to the contestant receiving the financial backing of more than one Dragon, with the benefit of a broader range of expertise. However, for this to occur, the contestant usually has to agree to relinquish a larger share in their business than they had first planned.\n\nA Dragon who, having heard the pitch, does not wish to invest, must declare themselves \"out\", implying that they leave the discussion. (However, on one occasion in series 4, [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]] continued to question an entrepreneur after his own declaration.) This concluding phase may range from a few minutes if the Dragons do not perceive the business plan as credible, to much longer when complex conditions are negotiated. The Dragons often ridicule contestants, on grounds that vary widely, but especially for over-valuation of their respective enterprises.\n\nThere is no legal commitment for the Dragons or producers of the show to fulfil their offers. All deals undergo [[due diligence]] before contracts are signed. It is claimed that half of deals are not completed after filming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/02/11/half-of-dragons-den-investments-fall-through-after-the-show/|title=Half of Dragons' Den investments fall through after the show|first=Rebecca|last=Burn-Callander|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=18 February 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Set and theme===\nThe opening sequence was shot in [[Ancoats]], [[Manchester]], an area transformed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] which helped give the city its nickname [[Cottonopolis]].<ref name=\"ancoats\">{{cite web |title=New lair for Dragon's Den? |last=Bourne |first=Dianne |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1268619_new_lair_for_dragons_den |publisher=Manchester Evening News Media |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> The sequence features shots of [[Brunswick Mill, Ancoats|Brunswick Mill]], [[Murrays' Mills]] and [[McConnel & Kennedy mills]] \u2013 all three are Manchester's most famous [[cotton mills]] in production at the time of the Industrial Revolution and keeps in line with the programme's [[warehouse]] theme.<ref name=\"ancoats\" /> The location at which the pitches are filmed has varied over the years. It was originally filmed inside a furniture depository in [[Stoke Newington]]. The production were forced to move after the first series owing to building work next door. For the second series shooting took place in a disused warehouse, [[Wool House]]. It was then that the first set was created by production designer Laurence Williams, requiring the construction of a section of the window wall and the staircase down to the lower floor. The owner of this warehouse converted it into flats necessitating a further move to Tanner Street for the next few series. Here another more extensive set was created including cutting a hole in the floor and again creating the stairs down to the lower floor. Building work required yet again a move to Pinewood Studios only two weeks before a series was due to be shot and the production designer had to create a complete set on the film stage including a staircase which descended down into the underfloor tank. After several more series were shot at Pinewood, the production was moved to the [[BBC]]'s new home in [[Salford Quays]] at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]]. A brand new set was created for the move and was screened in the latter part of 2012 for Series 10.<ref name=\"newhome\">{{cite web |title=Dragons, we've moved your chairs ... |last=Lewens |first=Sam |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/2012/01/dragons-weve-moved-your-chairs.shtml |publisher=BBC |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Space Studios Manchester]], in Gorton, was also used to film the programme from 2015 to 2017.<ref name=SpaceProj /> From 2018 onwards, the show has been filmed at [[Granada Studios|Old Granada Studios]].<ref name=OldGranada />\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:18px; width:100%;\"\n|- \n!

Cameras followed Charles Ejogo, who planned to put umbrella vending machines in [[London Underground]] stations, jewellery designer Elizabeth Galton, magazine publisher Huw Gwyther and Rachel Lowe, whose London-based board game caught their eye. Following this, another one-off two part special was broadcast on 28 September \u2013 8 October 2006. Later, two full series of the show were commissioned, with series one, of four episodes, being broadcast between 18 July and 2 August 2007.\n\nSeries two, of five episodes, each following a respective dragon and their investments, was broadcast between 17 September and 24 October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tvb0v |title=BBC Two \u2013 Dragons' Den, What Happened Next, Peter Jones |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> Peter Jones' episode followed him meeting with Kirsty Henshaw, who made an emotional pitch in the Den when she came in with her frozen dessert business, and was determined to get her product on the supermarket shelves as soon as possible, and also meeting up with condiment king Levi Roots. Duncan Bannatyne's episode followed him as he travelled to the south of France to oversee his daughter's wedding, and then went back to work to follow up on some of his investments. Theo Paphitis' episode followed him as he took 90 employees to Greece for a week of team-building exercises, and also visited two companies he invested in to see how they were getting on. Series five, episode nine also featured at a look back at deals from the series, in a similar vein to ''Where Are They Now?''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/h2nj/dragons-den--series-5---episode-9|title=Dragons' Den|work=RadioTimes}}</ref>\n\n===''Outside the Den''===\n''Outside the Den'' takes a step back from the world of Dragons' Den, to take a personal look at the Dragons themselves, including personal and intimate interviews, a look behind their business credentials, and taking the cameras into their personal lives. Six episodes of the series have been produced \u2013 with the first set of five episodes airing between 27 October and 23 November 2008, and following Theo Paphitis, James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne in their own respective programmes. A further episode, focusing on new dragon Hilary Devey, was broadcast over three years later on 29 December 2011.\n\n===''The Best of Dragons' Den''===\n''The Best of Dragons' Den'' focuses on presenter Evan Davis taking a look back at the best and worst pitches from the past series of the show, as well as revealing some unseen pitches that were so bad, they didn't make it to broadcast, and talking candidly with the Dragons involved. Two series of the show were produced, the first accompanying series two, with three episodes being broadcast between 19 January and 2 February 2006, and the second accompanying series six, with three episodes being broadcast between 23 February and 9 March 2009.\n\n===''Dragons' Den: On Tour''===\n''Dragons' Den: On Tour'' was a series of five episodes which aired between 6 September and 7 October 2009. Each episode follows the Dragons (James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones, Theo Paphitis and Duncan Bannatyne) as they travel by bus around the United Kingdom to find out what some of the budding entrepreneurs who had appeared on the show have been up to since, including success stories, awful failures, and some very obvious missed opportunities.\n\n===''Dragons' Den: Online''===\n''Dragons' Den: Online'' was a special, online version of the show, which follows the same format as the main show, but is presented by [[Dominic Byrne]], and features Shaf Rasul and [[Julie Meyer]] as the Dragons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/onlineden/ |title=Dragons' Den \u2013 The Dragons |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> Instead of being set inside a Den, entrepreneurs pitch to the two Dragons via online video pitches, and subsequent interaction through webcam chat. The highest amount of money on offer is \u00a350,000, which the Dragons can only individually invest in any one business. Episodes were posted weekly, for six weeks from 16 September 2009 to 7 October 2009, and viewers could participate by rating business plans before the two dragons offered their verdict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |title=Ariadne's Julie Meyer Becomes Dragon for New Online-Only Den |accessdate=18 March 2009 |last=Andrews |first=Robert |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716153956/http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |archivedate=16 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Other programmes===\nA number of one-off specials accompanying the broadcast of the main show have also been produced, often as Christmas specials or charity specials.

She put her leaving down to a need to focus on her new role at the [[The Prince's Trust|Prince\u2019s Trust]] Enterprise Fellowship Programme, as well as helping her sons Rik and Tom develop as entrepreneurs. She was replaced in series 17 by [[Sara Davies]].\n\n==Spoofs==\n[[Duncan Bannatyne]] appeared as himself in a recurring sketch in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television show ''[[Al Murray's Multiple Personality Disorder]]'' titled \"Duncan's Den\", a parody of ''Dragons' Den'', where Duncan is the only Dragon. [[Al Murray]] plays the role of [[Evan Davis]], and in each successive sketch there is only one applicant, the hopelessly nervous and commercially inept, recent divorcee Carole Price, played by [[Laura Solon]].\n\n[[Kayvan Novak]] created a parody of the show called \"Lizard's Lair\" for his character Terry Tibbs on an episode of his show ''[[Facejacker]]'' where unsuspecting entrepreneurs were led to believe they could receive an investment from Terry in a very similar style to ''Dragons' Den''.\n\n[[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]], [[Deborah Meaden]], and [[Duncan Bannatyne]] appear as themselves in a satirical dream sequence in a series 6 episode titled \"Conned Out of Luck\" of the BBC show, ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]''.\n\nThe sketch show ''[[Harry & Paul]]'' has featured a series of parodies by [[Harry Enfield]] and [[Paul Whitehouse]], where through careful editing the pair portray all the characters, including Davis (Whitehouse), the contestants unsuccessfully pitching various bizarre ideas (e.g. a '[[kitten]] stomper' device) and a parodied cast of the Dragons. The emphasis is particularly on the entrepreneurs' names (e.g. 'Duncan [[Guillotine]]') and personalities (Meaden is simply 'The Grumpy Woman' \u2013 Enfield in drag). In one sketch parodying the [[banking crisis]], Enfield's old character [[Harry Enfield and Chums|Tim Nice-But-Dim]] made an appearance and was revealed to be \"obviously\" the brother of 'Peter Jones (John Lewis)'. Enfield and Whitehouse brought back their portrayals of the characters for three [[Comic Relief]] sketches, where they play Victorian counterparts of the Dragons, and in each sketch, the entrepreneurs are in fact played by the actual Dragons presenting a modern item as an invention, with Jones presenting the toothbrush, Bannatyne and Caan presenting the toilet (or 'the Crapper'), and Meaden and Paphitis presenting the television.\n\n''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' parodied the show with strange investments such as a tramp wanting investment in tea and a sketch where a man wants \u00a3100,000 and his pitch is a gun. They also parodied Dragon responses with Rachel Elnaugh seeing a product which turns base metal to gold and saying \"How do you make any money out of this?\".\n\nThe [[Talksport]] weekday afternoon show presented by [[Paul Hawksbee]] and [[Andy Jacobs]] has recently begun a weekly spoof slot wherein \"Hilary Devey\" (Jacobs) makes obvious comments to (absent) sporting personalities who have recently been in the news for making poor decisions. These comments usually deride said personality, ending with the Dragons' common final phrase, \"I'm out!\"\n\nThe British sitcom ''[[The IT Crowd]]'' features a brief parody of the show in episode 5 of series 2.\n\nIn one episode of the CBBC comedy series, [[Hotel Trubble]], a man who is a spoof of Duncan Bannatyne, named Duncan Banana-Time, hosts an episode of Dragon's Den in the hotel. The other dragons are also spoofed: Peter Bones (Jones), Deborah Sneezed-In (Meaden) & Theo Profiterole (Pathitis), who was depicted as having a balloon with a face drawn on.\n\n[[Ricky Gervais]] referenced the show and impersonated Evan Davis and Duncan Bannatyne in his live stand-up show ''Fame''. Gervais had also previously performed a sketch in the show ''[[Extras (TV series)|Extras]]'', which featured the current line-up of Dragons.\n\nDisney Channel's ''[[I Didn't Do It (TV series)|I Didn't Do It]]'' based their [[I Didn't Do It (TV series)#Episode List|5th episode]] on the concept featuring a show called ''Boardroom Barracudas'' where the characters demo their vegetable flavor enhancer.\n\nPeter Jones, Deborah Meaden, Nick Jenkins, Touker Suleyman and Sarah Willingham appeared as themselves in the first episode of the [[mockumentary]] series ''[[People Just Do Nothing]]'' when the protagonists visit the Dragons' Den to seek funding for their illegal [[pirate radio]] station. Jenkins offers them \u00a350 to get out of the room.\n\nIn the summer of 2015, ''[[The Scott Mills Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]] began a segment known as 'Instant Dragon's Den', where a caller is put through to the personal phone of [[Deborah Meaden]], one of the TV show's current Dragons, with the caller then pitching their idea to Meaden, who always starts by asking how the caller got her number.\n\nIn 2018, the American TV series ''[[Great News]]'' aired a scene in which there was a comparison to the American version, ''[[Shark Tank]]'' and a show named ''Pond Scum'', a play on ''Dragon's Den''.\n\n==DVD release==\nThe first two series of the show are available to buy on DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001DLUC5I|title=Dragons' Den Complete BBC Series 1 & 2 [DVD]|work=amazon.co.uk}}</ref> It is unknown whether the remaining series of the show will also be released.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{BBC programme}}\n*{{IMDb title|id=0443370|title=Dragons' Den UK}}\n*{{tv.com show|dragons-den|Dragons' Den UK}}\n*{{epguides|DragonsDen|Dragons' Den UK}}\n*{{UKGameshow|Dragons%27_Den|Dragons' Den UK}}\n*[https://www.tigermobiles.com/dragons-den/ Dragons' Den \u2013 Where Are They Now?] Full breakdown of successful pitches, investments, accounts and statistics from Series 1 \u2013 11\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100413114828/http://www.dragons-den.org.uk/list.html Dragons' Den UK] fan site \u2013 lists all pitches on the UK version\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100909221534/http://www.promotionalcodes.org.uk/17758/dragons-den-facts-the-dragons-pitchers-investments-statistics-infographic/ ''Dragons Den'' Facts:] The Dragons, Pitchers, Investments & Statistics (Infographic)\n*[https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=dragons%20den%20series%2010&sm=1 ''Dragon's Den'' UK] \u2013 series 10 on [[YouTube]]\n\n{{Dragons' Den}}\n{{DragonsDenUK}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dragons' Den (Uk)}}\n[[Category:2005 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:2010s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:2020s British reality television series]]\n[[Category:BBC high definition programmes]]\n[[Category:BBC Television programmes]]\n[[Category:Business-related television series]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:Television series by Sony Pictures Television]]\n[[Category:Business mass media in the United Kingdom]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British television series}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}} \n{{Infobox television\n| show_name                = Dragons' Den\n| image                    = DragonsDenUK17.png\n| genre                    = [[Reality television|Reality show]]\n| creator                  = \n| director                 = \n| presenter                = [[Evan Davis]]\n| composer                 = John Watt\n| country                  = [[United Kingdom]]\n| language                 = [[English language|English]]\n| num_series               = 17\n| num_episodes             = 175+12 specials<br>(as of 20 December 2019 -

The format of the show is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]] and is based on the original [[Dragons' Den#Japan|Japanese programme]], which has been sold around the world. The programme has been produced by [[BBC Manchester]] since its inception and was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] on 4 January 2005.\n\nThe show allows several [[entrepreneurs]] an opportunity to present their varying business ideas to a panel of five wealthy investors, the \"Dragons\" of the show's title, and pitch for financial investment while offering a stake of the company in return.\n\n==Programme==\n\n===Format===\nContestants have what they believe to be a viable and potentially profitable business idea but lack funding, or are already operating their business, but need additional funds for promotion or expansion. As part of their opening pitch, they are required to specify the amount of money they require from the Dragons. The rules stipulate that if they do not raise at least this amount from one or more Dragons, then they would leave with nothing. In exchange for the investment, the contestants offer [[Stock|equity]] in their business, the percentage of which is also stipulated at the beginning of the pitch. If the Dragons see potential in the business idea or product, negotiations then take place around the amount of equity on offer, with the contestant having the opportunity to negotiate further, accept any offers, or simply walk away. Dragons can also offer a percentage of the money requested if they do not wish to commit the full amount, leaving the other Dragons free to do the same. This can lead to the contestant receiving the financial backing of more than one Dragon, with the benefit of a broader range of expertise. However, for this to occur, the contestant usually has to agree to relinquish a larger share in their business than they had first planned.\n\nA Dragon who, having heard the pitch, does not wish to invest, must declare themselves \"out\", implying that they leave the discussion. (However, on one occasion in series 4, [[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]] continued to question an entrepreneur after his own declaration.) This concluding phase may range from a few minutes if the Dragons do not perceive the business plan as credible, to much longer when complex conditions are negotiated. The Dragons often ridicule contestants, on grounds that vary widely, but especially for over-valuation of their respective enterprises.\n\nThere is no legal commitment for the Dragons or producers of the show to fulfil their offers. All deals undergo [[due diligence]] before contracts are signed. It is claimed that half of deals are not completed after filming.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/02/11/half-of-dragons-den-investments-fall-through-after-the-show/|title=Half of Dragons' Den investments fall through after the show|first=Rebecca|last=Burn-Callander|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=18 February 2016|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Set and theme===\nThe opening sequence was shot in [[Ancoats]], [[Manchester]], an area transformed by the [[Industrial Revolution]] which helped give the city its nickname [[Cottonopolis]].<ref name=\"ancoats\">{{cite web |title=New lair for Dragon's Den? |last=Bourne |first=Dianne |url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1268619_new_lair_for_dragons_den |publisher=Manchester Evening News Media |date=24 June 2010 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}</ref> The sequence features shots of [[Brunswick Mill, Ancoats|Brunswick Mill]], [[Murrays' Mills]] and [[McConnel & Kennedy mills]] - all three are Manchester's most famous [[cotton mills]] in production at the time of the Industrial Revolution and keeps in line with the programme's [[warehouse]] theme.<ref name=\"ancoats\" /> The location at which the pitches are filmed has varied over the years. It was originally filmed inside a furniture depository in [[Stoke Newington]]. The production were forced to move after the first series owing to building work next door. For the second series shooting took place in a disused warehouse, [[Wool House]]. It was then that the first set was created by production designer Laurence Williams, requiring the construction of a section of the window wall and the staircase down to the lower floor. The owner of this warehouse converted it into flats necessitating a further move to Tanner Street for the next few series. Here another more extensive set was created including cutting a hole in the floor and again creating the stairs down to the lower floor. Building work required yet again a move to Pinewood Studios only two weeks before a series was due to be shot and the production designer had to create a complete set on the film stage including a staircase which descended down into the underfloor tank. After several more series were shot at Pinewood, the production was moved to the [[BBC]]'s new home in [[Salford Quays]] at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10]], [[MediaCityUK]]. A brand new set was created for the move and was screened in the latter part of 2012 for Series 10.<ref name=\"newhome\">{{cite web |title=Dragons, we've moved your chairs ... |last=Lewens |first=Sam |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/aboutthebbc/2012/01/dragons-weve-moved-your-chairs.shtml |publisher=BBC |date=5 January 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Space Studios Manchester]], in Gorton, was also used to film the programme from 2015 to 2017.<ref name=SpaceProj /> From 2018 onwards, the show has been filmed at [[Granada Studios|Old Granada Studios]].<ref name=OldGranada />\n\n===Awards===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%; line-height:18px; width:100%;\"\n|- \n!

Cameras followed Charles Ejogo, who planned to put umbrella vending machines in [[London Underground]] stations, jewellery designer Elizabeth Galton, magazine publisher Huw Gwyther and Rachel Lowe, whose London-based board game caught their eye. Following this, another one-off two part special was broadcast on 28 September \u2013 8 October 2006. Later, two full series of the show were commissioned, with series one, of four episodes, being broadcast between 18 July and 2 August 2007.\n\nSeries two, of five episodes, each following a respective dragon and their investments, was broadcast between 17 September and 24 October 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00tvb0v |title=BBC Two - Dragons' Den, What Happened Next, Peter Jones |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> Peter Jones' episode followed him meeting with Kirsty Henshaw, who made an emotional pitch in the Den when she came in with her frozen dessert business, and was determined to get her product on the supermarket shelves as soon as possible, and also meeting up with condiment king Levi Roots. Duncan Bannatyne's episode followed him as he travelled to the south of France to oversee his daughter's wedding, and then went back to work to follow up on some of his investments. Theo Paphitis' episode followed him as he took 90 employees to Greece for a week of team-building exercises, and also visited two companies he invested in to see how they were getting on. Series five, episode nine also featured at a look back at deals from the series, in a similar vein to ''Where Are They Now?''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/h2nj/dragons-den--series-5---episode-9|title=Dragons' Den|work=RadioTimes}}</ref>\n\n===''Outside the Den''===\n''Outside the Den'' takes a step back from the world of Dragons' Den, to take a personal look at the Dragons themselves, including personal and intimate interviews, a look behind their business credentials, and taking the cameras into their personal lives. Six episodes of the series have been produced - with the first set of five episodes airing between 27 October and 23 November 2008, and following Theo Paphitis, James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones and Duncan Bannatyne in their own respective programmes. A further episode, focusing on new dragon Hilary Devey, was broadcast over three years later on 29 December 2011.\n\n===''The Best of Dragons' Den''===\n''The Best of Dragons' Den'' focuses on presenter Evan Davis taking a look back at the best and worst pitches from the past series of the show, as well as revealing some unseen pitches that were so bad, they didn't make it to broadcast, and talking candidly with the Dragons involved. Two series of the show were produced, the first accompanying series two, with three episodes being broadcast between 19 January and 2 February 2006, and the second accompanying series six, with three episodes being broadcast between 23 February and 9 March 2009.\n\n===''Dragons' Den: On Tour''===\n''Dragons' Den: On Tour'' was a series of five episodes which aired between 6 September and 7 October 2009. Each episode follows the Dragons (James Caan, Deborah Meaden, Peter Jones, Theo Paphitis and Duncan Bannatyne) as they travel by bus around the United Kingdom to find out what some of the budding entrepreneurs who had appeared on the show have been up to since, including success stories, awful failures, and some very obvious missed opportunities.\n\n===''Dragons' Den: Online''===\n''Dragons' Den: Online'' was a special, online version of the show, which follows the same format as the main show, but is presented by [[Dominic Byrne]], and features Shaf Rasul and [[Julie Meyer]] as the Dragons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/onlineden/ |title=Dragons' Den - The Dragons |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=25 November 2012}}</ref> Instead of being set inside a Den, entrepreneurs pitch to the two Dragons via online video pitches, and subsequent interaction through webcam chat. The highest amount of money on offer is \u00a350,000, which the Dragons can only individually invest in any one business. Episodes were posted weekly, for six weeks from 16 September 2009 to 7 October 2009, and viewers could participate by rating business plans before the two dragons offered their verdict.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |title=Ariadne's Julie Meyer Becomes Dragon for New Online-Only Den |accessdate=18 March 2009 |last=Andrews |first=Robert |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716153956/http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-ariadnes-julie-meyer-becomes-dragon-for-new-online-only-den/ |archivedate=16 July 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Other programmes===\nA number of one-off specials accompanying the broadcast of the main show have also been produced, often as Christmas specials or charity specials.

She was replaced in series 17 by [[Sara Davies]].\n\n==Spoofs==\n[[Duncan Bannatyne]] appeared as himself in a recurring sketch in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] television show ''[[Al Murray's Multiple Personality Disorder]]'' titled \"Duncan's Den\", a parody of ''Dragons' Den'', where Duncan is the only Dragon. [[Al Murray]] plays the role of [[Evan Davis]], and in each successive sketch there is only one applicant, the hopelessly nervous and commercially inept, recent divorcee Carole Price, played by [[Laura Solon]].\n\n[[Kayvan Novak]] created a parody of the show called \"Lizard's Lair\" for his character Terry Tibbs on an episode of his show ''[[Facejacker]]'' where unsuspecting entrepreneurs were led to believe they could receive an investment from Terry in a very similar style to ''Dragons' Den''.\n\n[[Peter Jones (entrepreneur)|Peter Jones]], [[Deborah Meaden]], and [[Duncan Bannatyne]] appear as themselves in a satirical dream sequence in a series 6 episode titled \"Conned Out of Luck\" of the BBC show, ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]''.\n\nThe sketch show ''[[Harry & Paul]]'' has featured a series of parodies by [[Harry Enfield]] and [[Paul Whitehouse]], where through careful editing the pair portray all the characters, including Davis (Whitehouse), the contestants unsuccessfully pitching various bizarre ideas (e.g. a '[[kitten]] stomper' device) and a parodied cast of the Dragons. The emphasis is particularly on the entrepreneurs' names (e.g. 'Duncan [[Guillotine]]') and personalities (Meaden is simply 'The Grumpy Woman' \u2013 Enfield in drag). In one sketch parodying the [[banking crisis]], Enfield's old character [[Harry Enfield and Chums|Tim Nice-But-Dim]] made an appearance and was revealed to be \"obviously\" the brother of 'Peter Jones (John Lewis)'. Enfield and Whitehouse brought back their portrayals of the characters for three [[Comic Relief]] sketches, where they play Victorian counterparts of the Dragons, and in each sketch, the entrepreneurs are in fact played by the actual Dragons presenting a modern item as an invention, with Jones presenting the toothbrush, Bannatyne and Caan presenting the toilet (or 'the Crapper'), and Meaden and Paphitis presenting the television.\n\n''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' parodied the show with strange investments such as a tramp wanting investment in tea and a sketch where a man wants \u00a3100,000 and his pitch is a gun. They also parodied Dragon responses with Rachel Elnaugh seeing a product which turns base metal to gold and saying \"How do you make any money out of this?\".\n\nThe [[Talksport]] weekday afternoon show presented by [[Paul Hawksbee]] and [[Andy Jacobs]] has recently begun a weekly spoof slot wherein \"Hilary Devey\" (Jacobs) makes obvious comments to (absent) sporting personalities who have recently been in the news for making poor decisions. These comments usually deride said personality, ending with the Dragons' common final phrase, \"I'm out!\"\n\nThe British sitcom ''[[The IT Crowd]]'' features a brief parody of the show in episode 5 of series 2.\n\nIn one episode of the CBBC comedy series, [[Hotel Trubble]], a man who is a spoof of Duncan Bannatyne, named Duncan Banana-Time, hosts an episode of Dragon's Den in the hotel.
