The bird is also known as the '''American mourning dove''' or the '''rain dove''', and erroneously as the '''turtle dove''', and was once known as the '''Carolina pigeon''' or '''Carolina turtledove'''.<ref>Torres, J.K. (1982) ''The Audubon Society Encyclopedia of North American Birds'', Alfred A. Knopf, New York, p. 730, {{ISBN|0517032880}}</ref> It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds. It is also a leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70&nbsp;million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six [[Offspring|broods]] of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of [[sonation]]. The bird is a strong [[Bird flight|flier]], capable of speeds up to {{Convert|88|kph|abbr = on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Bastin, E.W.|year = 1952|title = Flight-speed of the Mourning Dove|journal = Wilson Bulletin|volume = 64|issue = 1|page = 47|url = http://sora.unm.edu/node/127141}}</ref> It is the [[national bird]] of the [[British Virgin Islands]].\n\nMourning doves are light grey and brown and generally muted in color. Males and females are similar in appearance. The species is generally [[monogamous]], with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate and care for the young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed [[crop milk]] by their parents.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=[[Cladogram]] showing the position of the mourning dove in the genus ''[[Zenaida]]''.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1=Banks | first1=R.C. | last2=Weckstein | first2=J.D. | last3=Remsen Jr | first3=J.V. | last4=Johnson | first4=K.P. | year=2013 | title=Classification of a clade of New World doves (Columbidae: Zenaidini) | journal=Zootaxa | volume=3669 | issue=2 | pages=184\u2013188 | doi=10.11646/zootaxa.3669.2.11 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256980440 }}</ref>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:220px;\n|label1=''Zenaida''&nbsp; \n|1={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Mourning dove]]\n            |2=[[Socorro dove]]\n            }}\n         |2=[[Eared dove]]\n         }}\n      |2=[[Zenaida dove]]\n      }}\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[White-winged dove]]\n      |2=[[West Peruvian dove]]\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\n\nIn 1731 the English naturalists [[Mark Catesby]] described and illustrated the [[passenger pigeon]] and the mourning dove on successive pages of his ''The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands''.

Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males.<ref name=\"NRCS p2\" /> Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained by the presence of [[bird feeder]]s.\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nMourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by lying on the ground or on a flat tree limb, leaning over, stretching one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. [[Dust bath|Dustbathing]] is common as well.\n[[File:Zenaida macroura pair.jpg|thumb|Pair of doves in late winter in Minnesota]]\nOutside the breeding season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, close to the body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers as in many other species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Doucette, D.R. |author2=Reebs, S.G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1994|title = Influence of temperature and other factors on the daily roosting times of Mourning Doves in winter|journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume = 72|pages = 1287\u201390|doi = 10.1139/z94-171|issue = 7}}</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Zenaida macroura MWNH 0568.JPG|thumb|Mourning dove egg, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]|alt=]]\n[[Courtship#Courtship in the animal kingdom|Courtship]] begins with a noisy flight by the male, followed by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down.

It often gathers at drinking spots around dawn and dusk.\n\nMourning doves eat almost exclusively [[seed]]s, which make up more than 99% of their diet.<ref name = \"Cornell\"/> Rarely, they will eat [[snail]]s or [[insect]]s. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their [[Crop (anatomy)|crops]] and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine [[gravel]] or [[sand]] to assist with [[digestion]]. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for rapeseed, corn, [[millet]], [[safflower]], and [[sunflower]] seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible.<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" /><ref name = \"Cornell\"/> They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\nMourning doves show a preference for the seeds of certain species of plant over others.

It is also a leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70&nbsp;million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six [[Offspring|broods]] of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of [[sonation]].

Males and females are similar in appearance. The species is generally [[monogamous]], with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate and care for the young.

It avoids [[swamp]]s and thick [[forest]].<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> The species has adapted well to areas altered by humans. They commonly nest in trees in cities or near farmsteads.\n[[File:Mother Dove and Squabs Nesting.jpg|right|thumb|Adult and squabs in cactus-protected nest, [[High Desert (California)]]]]\n\n=== Migration ===\nMost mourning doves [[Bird migration|migrate]] along [[flyway]]s over land. On rare occasions, mourning doves have been seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this appears to be exceptional. Mourning doves (Z. m. carolinensis) are native to the [[North Atlantic]] archipelago of [[Bermuda]], approximately {{convert|1070|km|0|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]] (the nearest landfall); {{convert|1236|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Cape Sable Island]], [[Nova Scotia]]; and {{convert|1538|km|0|abbr=on}} due north of the [[British Virgin Islands]], from which they had been migratory, but since the 1950s have become year-round ''residents''. <ref>[http://www.audubon.bm/birding/bermuda-birds/118-mourning-dove The Bermuda [[Audubon Society]]: ''Mourning Dove '' </ref>\n\nSpring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males.<ref name=\"NRCS p2\" /> Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained by the presence of [[bird feeder]]s.\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nMourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by lying on the ground or on a flat tree limb, leaning over, stretching one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. [[Dust bath|Dustbathing]] is common as well.\n[[File:Zenaida macroura pair.jpg|thumb|Pair of doves in late winter in Minnesota]]\nOutside the breeding season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, close to the body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers as in many other species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Doucette, D.R. |author2=Reebs, S.G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1994|title = Influence of temperature and other factors on the daily roosting times of Mourning Doves in winter|journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume = 72|pages = 1287\u201390|doi = 10.1139/z94-171|issue = 7}}</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Zenaida macroura MWNH 0568.JPG|thumb|Mourning dove egg, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]|alt=]]\n[[Courtship#Courtship in the animal kingdom|Courtship]] begins with a noisy flight by the male, followed by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down. After landing, the male will approach the female with a puffed-out breast, bobbing head, and loud calls. Mated pairs will often [[preening (bird)|preen]] each other's feathers.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\nThe male then leads the female to potential nest sites, and the female will choose one. The female dove builds the nest. The male will fly about, gather material, and bring it to her. The male will stand on the female's back and give the material to the female, who then builds it into the nest.<ref name=\"Cornell\">{{cite web|url = http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/Mourning_Dove_dtl.html|title = Mourning Dove|publisher = [[Cornell University|Cornell]] Lab of Ornithology|accessdate = 2006-10-18}}</ref> The nest is constructed of twigs, [[Pinophyta#Foliage|conifer needles]], or [[Poaceae#Structure and growth|grass blades]], and is of flimsy construction.<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" /> Mourning doves will sometimes requisition the unused nests of other mourning doves, other birds, or arboreal mammals such as [[squirrel]]s.<ref name=\"NRCS p4\">NRCS p. 4</ref>\n\nMost nests are in [[trees]], both deciduous and coniferous. Sometimes, they can be found in [[shrub]]s, [[vine]]s, or on artificial constructs like [[buildings]],<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" /> or hanging flower pots.<ref name=\"Cornell\" /> When there is no suitable elevated object, mourning doves will nest on the ground.<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" />\n\nThe clutch size is almost always two [[Egg (biology)|eggs]].<ref name=\"Cornell\" /> Occasionally, however, a female will lay her eggs in the nest of another pair, leading to three or four eggs in the nest.<ref name=\"NRCS p1\">NRCS p. 1</ref> The eggs are white, {{Convert|6.6|ml|abbr = on}}, {{Convert|2.57|-|2.96|cm|abbr = on}} long, {{Convert|2.06|-|2.30|cm|abbr = on}} wide, {{Convert|6|-|7|g|abbr = on}} at laying (5\u20136% of female body mass).

In warmer areas, these birds may raise up to six broods in a season.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> This fast breeding is essential because mortality is high. Each year, mortality can reach 58% a year for adults and 69% for the young.<ref name=\"NRCS p1\" />\n\nThe mourning dove is monogamous and forms strong pair bonds.<ref name=\"NRCS p1\" /> Pairs typically reconvene in the same area the following breeding season, and sometimes may remain together throughout the winter.

Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their [[Crop (anatomy)|crops]] and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine [[gravel]] or [[sand]] to assist with [[digestion]]. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for rapeseed, corn, [[millet]], [[safflower]], and [[sunflower]] seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible.<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" /><ref name = \"Cornell\"/> They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\nMourning doves show a preference for the seeds of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include [[pine]] nuts, [[Liquidambar|sweetgum]] seeds, and the seeds of [[pokeberry]], [[amaranth]], [[canary grass]], [[Maize|corn]], [[Sesame seed|sesame]], and [[wheat]].<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" /> When their favorite foods are absent, mourning doves will eat the seeds of other plants, including [[buckwheat]], [[rye]], [[goosegrass]] and [[smartweed]].<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" />\n\n==Predators and parasites==\nThe primary predators of this species are diurnal [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]], such as [[falcon]]s and [[hawk]]s.

Over time, fierce rivalry with the LO turned to co-operation, and the federation also worked with the [[Danish Confederation of Professional Associations]] (AC).<ref>{{cite news |last1=Redder |first1=Gitte |title=Efter 66 \u00e5r p\u00e5 arbejdsmarkedet: Farvel til FTF |url=https://www.avisen.dk/efter-66-aar-paa-arbejdsmarkedet-nu-begraves-ftf_525343.aspx |accessdate=25 February 2020 |work=Avisen |date=14 November 2018}}</ref>  By 2009, the FTF had a membership of 450,000.\n\nFrom 2015, FTF engaged in negotiations with LO about a potential merger.  This occurred on 1 January 2019, and the LO became part of the new [[Danish Trade Union Confederation]] (FH).<ref name=\"prelsler\">{{cite news |last1=Prelsler |first1=Marle |title=Danish trade union movement gathers the troops |url=http://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/nyheter/news-2019/article.2019-02-11.8228050863 |accessdate=31 January 2020 |work=Nordic Labour Journal |date=11 February 2019}}</ref>  However, the federation's largest affiliate, the [[Finance Federation]], along with the Danish Physiotherapists, and the Association of Designers, voted against joining FH, and instead became independent.\n\nThe FTF was affiliated with the [[International Trade Union Confederation|International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC)]], the [[European Trade Union Confederation|European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC)]], the [[Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD|Trade Union Advisory Committee to the OECD (TUAC)]] and the [[Council of Nordic Trade Unions|Council of Nordic Trade Unions (NFS)]].\n\n==Membership==\nMembers of the 86 trade unions of the FTF were typically [[employee]]s with a [[higher education]] and an [[academic degree]] (e.g. a [[bachelor's degree]] or a [[master's degree]]) or a [[first professional degree]]. Some members didn't have a higher education but a [[vocational education]] (\"[[white-collar worker]]s\"). A typical FTF-member occupids a [[Middle class|middle]] or [[Upper middle class|upper middle]] [[Social class|position in society]] as regarded [[salary]] and [[pension]] benefits. Many FTF-members were [[Leadership|leaders]].\n\nFTF-members were e.g. [[pharmaconomist]]s, [[journalist]]s, [[Medical Laboratory Scientist|medical laboratory scientists]], [[teacher]]s, [[Bank|bank employees]], [[Physical therapy|physical therapists]], [[businessperson]]s, [[actor]]s, [[dental hygienist]]s, [[police officer]]s, [[Podiatry|podiatrists]], [[engineer]]s, [[nurse]]s, [[Theatre director|stage directors]], [[social work]]ers, [[Radiologic technologist|radiographers]] etc.\n\n==Affiliates==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
