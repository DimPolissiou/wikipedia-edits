Owned and operated by [[Cedar Fair]], it originally opened in 1976 as one of two parks built by the [[Marriott Corporation]]. The park has appeared in 1994 films ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' and ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' and features over 40 rides and attractions. One of its most notable attractions, [[Gold Striker]], has been featured as a top-ranked wooden roller coaster in ''[[Amusement Today|Amusement Today's]]'' annual Golden Ticket Awards publication. Also featured is [[RailBlazer]], one of the first Raptor roller coasters by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]] in the world, and Flight Deck, a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster.\n\n==History==\n\n===Marriott & KECO Era (1976\u20131992)===\nMarriott's Great America, built by hotel and restaurant operator [[Marriott Corporation]], opened to the public on March 20, 1976.<ref>{{cite news |title=Photos: A look back at 40 years of California's Great America |date=March 27, 2015 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/27/photos-a-look-back-at-40-years-of-californias-great-america/}}</ref> Less than two months later on May 29, the company opened a second Marriott's Great America&nbsp;\u2013 later known as [[Six Flags Great America]]&nbsp;\u2013 north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Six Flags purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/marriott-to-sell-park-to-bally.html|title=Marriott to Sell Park to Bally|date=April 27, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Marriott's Great America (Maryland\u2013Virginia)|A third park]] was initially planned for the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]], but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition.<ref name=\"3rd Great America\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19770819&id=j95NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ooDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5660,2451015|title=Marriott's high-powered approach|last=Flattau|first=Edward|date=August 19, 1977|work=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Great america.jpg|thumb|left|View of California's Great America from above]]\nThe park, though profitable, was still an earnings disappointment for Marriott, leading the company in 1983 to explore options to sell. An interested party, '''Caz Development Co.''', appraised the land value at US$800,000 to $1 million per acre. Marriott also involved the city of Santa Clara in negotiations, which was already leasing {{convert|55|acre}} of parking space for the amusement park. Fearing homebuilding on the land by Caz Development would lower home values of existing homeowners, the city council approved a $101 million purchasing agreement on January 31, 1984, by a 4\u20133 vote that also had to be approved by city residents. The citywide vote passed, approving the sale by a margin of 3 to 1. Caz Development then sued the city and Marriott in the [[Superior Court of Santa Clara County]] to block the transaction. The court nullified the sale, forcing the city to attempt to salvage the deal through negotiations with the other parties. Unable to broker a timely agreement, the city council voted 6\u20131 to scuttle the sale on February 5, 1985, though the city was still interested in owning the park. After Marriott refunded a $20 million down payment back to the city, negotiations were restarted. All parties were able to agree on a compromise, which was signed in marathon sessions taking place in early June 1985. The city acquired the park for $93.5 million from Marriott, which retained {{convert|20|acre}} from the sale for development. Caz Development settled and was allowed to build a hotel and office near the park, which the city renamed Great America.\n\n[[Kings Entertainment Company]], who owned and operated other amusement parks, was hired in 1985 to manage Great America for the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19850620&id=KNZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aB0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1152,5468771|title=A New Start At Great America|date=June 20, 1985|work=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Modesto, CA}}</ref> In 1989, the city decided to return the park to the private sector and sold it to Kings Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&dat=19890606&id=W5VcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5086,1057726|title=Firm Acquires Big Theme Park|date=June 6, 1989|work=Merced Sun-Star|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Merced, California}}</ref> In the agreement, the city would earn 5% of all revenue that exceeds $56 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Paramount Parks Era (1992\u20132006)===\n[[Image:Paramountgreatamerica.jpg|thumb|right|Logo used from 2003 until its sale to Cedar Fair.]]\nThree years later Paramount Communications (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]), the owners of [[Paramount Pictures]], sought to join other entertainment companies as a theme park owner. The company acquired Kings Entertainment, owner of three parks including Great America, and one other park for $400 million and created [[Paramount Parks]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], the parent of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] (including [[Nickelodeon]]), then bought Paramount in 1994, allowing Nickelodeon theming and merchandise into the park as well. During the Paramount era, attractions from the Action FX Theatre, Nickelodeon Splat City (later Nickelodeon Central), Drop Zone Stunt Tower, Invertigo, and many more modern thrill ride attractions were added in. Because the park is landlocked in the center of Silicon Valley, several rides including the classic train ride and the [[Sky Whirl]], a Marriott's Great America signature attraction, were removed to make way for newer attractions.\n\nIn its last years as a Paramount Park, Great America was co-owned with several broadcasting stations in the Bay Area, including [[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]].\n\n===Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:Great America 2007.PNG|thumb|right|Logo used in 2006.

He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' came in, Paramount ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million.\n\nSome modifications were made to the Columbia Carousel and Vortex roller coaster. Most of the Sky Whirl/Triple Wheel stunts (renamed \"The Spider\" for the film) were filmed in a studio. To film the exterior scenes, the motors of the Triple Wheel were left unpowered; instead, to ensure the ride did not move too quickly, some cages were loaded with sandbags to unbalance the mechanism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/10/eddie-murphys-dangerous-ride/ |title=Eddie Murphy's dangerous ride |author=Mannes, George |date=June 10, 1994 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> In this scene, [[George Lucas]] has a small part as the man Axel cuts in front of to get on the ride, also known as 'disappointed man' (this can be seen in the credits).

Also, the carousel at the back of the park (the Ameri-Go-Round, not the Columbia Carousel) was altered. The Ameri-Go-Round carousel has since been removed and Drop Zone is now in its place. The tunnels that supposedly ran under the park are a myth as well. No tunnels run under the park, as many thought after this was released.\n\nThe Alien Attack ride featured in the Wonder World theme park was in fact the \"Earthquake: The Big One attraction\" from the [[Universal Studios Florida]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]].

Owned and operated by [[Cedar Fair]], it originally opened in 1976 as one of two parks built by the [[Marriott Corporation]]. The park has appeared in 1994 films ''[[Beverly Hills Cop III]]'' and ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' and features over 40 rides and attractions. One of its most notable attractions, [[Gold Striker]], has been featured as a top-ranked wooden roller coaster in ''[[Amusement Today|Amusement Today's]]'' annual Golden Ticket Awards publication. Also featured is [[Railblazer]], one of the first Raptor roller coasters by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]] in the world, and Flight Deck, a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] inverted coaster.\n\n==History==\n\n===Marriott & KECO Era (1976\u20131992)===\nMarriott's Great America, built by hotel and restaurant operator [[Marriott Corporation]], opened to the public on March 20, 1976.<ref>{{cite news |title=Photos: A look back at 40 years of California's Great America |date=March 27, 2015 |newspaper=San Jose Mercury News |url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2015/03/27/photos-a-look-back-at-40-years-of-californias-great-america/}}</ref> Less than two months later on May 29, the company opened a second Marriott's Great America&nbsp;\u2013 later known as [[Six Flags Great America]]&nbsp;\u2013 north of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] in [[Gurnee, Illinois]].<ref name=\"Six Flags purchase\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/27/business/marriott-to-sell-park-to-bally.html|title=Marriott to Sell Park to Bally|date=April 27, 1984|newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref> [[Marriott's Great America (Maryland\u2013Virginia)|A third park]] was initially planned for the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area]], but the idea was later abandoned after several failed attempts to sway local opposition.<ref name=\"3rd Great America\">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=19770819&id=j95NAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-ooDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5660,2451015|title=Marriott's high-powered approach|last=Flattau|first=Edward|date=August 19, 1977|work=The Free Lance-Star|accessdate=January 24, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Great america.jpg|thumb|left|View of California's Great America from above]]\nThe park, though profitable, was still an earnings disappointment for Marriott, leading the company in 1983 to explore options to sell. An interested party, '''Caz Development Co.''', appraised the land value at US$800,000 to $1 million per acre. Marriott also involved the city of Santa Clara in negotiations, which was already leasing {{convert|55|acre}} of parking space for the amusement park. Fearing homebuilding on the land by Caz Development would lower home values of existing homeowners, the city council approved a $101 million purchasing agreement on January 31, 1984, by a 4\u20133 vote that also had to be approved by city residents. The citywide vote passed, approving the sale by a margin of 3 to 1. Caz Development then sued the city and Marriott in the [[Superior Court of Santa Clara County]] to block the transaction. The court nullified the sale, forcing the city to attempt to salvage the deal through negotiations with the other parties. Unable to broker a timely agreement, the city council voted 6\u20131 to scuttle the sale on February 5, 1985, though the city was still interested in owning the park. After Marriott refunded a $20 million down payment back to the city, negotiations were restarted. All parties were able to agree on a compromise, which was signed in marathon sessions taking place in early June 1985. The city acquired the park for $93.5 million from Marriott, which retained {{convert|20|acre}} from the sale for development. Caz Development settled and was allowed to build a hotel and office near the park, which the city renamed Great America.\n\n[[Kings Entertainment Company]], who owned and operated other amusement parks, was hired in 1985 to manage Great America for the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1948&dat=19850620&id=KNZJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=aB0NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1152,5468771|title=A New Start At Great America|date=June 20, 1985|work=The Modesto Bee|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Modesto, CA}}</ref> In 1989, the city decided to return the park to the private sector and sold it to Kings Entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1992&dat=19890606&id=W5VcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IlgNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5086,1057726|title=Firm Acquires Big Theme Park|date=June 6, 1989|work=Merced Sun-Star|accessdate=July 10, 2012|location=Merced, California}}</ref> In the agreement, the city would earn 5% of all revenue that exceeds $56 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\n===Paramount Parks Era (1992\u20132006)===\n[[Image:Paramountgreatamerica.jpg|thumb|right|Logo used from 2003 until its sale to Cedar Fair.]]\nThree years later Paramount Communications (formerly [[Gulf+Western]]), the owners of [[Paramount Pictures]], sought to join other entertainment companies as a theme park owner. The company acquired Kings Entertainment, owner of three parks including Great America, and one other park for $400 million and created [[Paramount Parks]]. [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]], the parent of [[Viacom Media Networks|MTV Networks]] (including [[Nickelodeon]]), then bought Paramount in 1994, allowing Nickelodeon theming and merchandise into the park as well. During the Paramount era, attractions from the Action FX Theatre, Nickelodeon Splat City (later Nickelodeon Central), Drop Zone Stunt Tower, Invertigo, and many more modern thrill ride attractions were added in. Because the park is landlocked in the center of Silicon Valley, several rides including the classic train ride and the [[Sky Whirl]], a Marriott's Great America signature attraction, were removed to make way for newer attractions.\n\nIn its last years as a Paramount Park, Great America was co-owned with several broadcasting stations in the Bay Area, including [[KPIX-TV]] and [[KBCW (TV)|KBCW]].\n\n===Cedar Fair Entertainment Company (2006\u2013present)===\n[[Image:Great America 2007.PNG|thumb|right|Logo used in 2006.

He was told that each of the rides he had designed would cost about $10 million to build and the whole film would cost about $70 million. When box office results for ''[[The Distinguished Gentleman]]'' came in, Paramount ordered the budget to be cut to $55 million.\n\nSome modifications were made to the Columbia Carousel and Vortex roller coaster. Most of the Sky Whirl/Triple Wheel stunts (renamed \"The Spider\" for the film) were filmed in a studio. To film the exterior scenes, the motors of the Triple Wheel were left unpowered; instead, to ensure the ride did not move too quickly, some cages were loaded with sandbags to unbalance the mechanism.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://ew.com/article/1994/06/10/eddie-murphys-dangerous-ride/ |title=Eddie Murphy's dangerous ride |author=Mannes, George |date=June 10, 1994 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> In this scene, [[George Lucas]] has a small part as the man Axel cuts in front of to get on the ride, also known as 'disappointed man' (this can be seen in the credits).

Also, the carousel at the back of the park (the Ameri-Go-Round, not the Columbia Carousel) was altered. The Ameri-Go-Round carousel has since been removed and Drop Zone is now in its place. The tunnels that supposedly ran under the park are a myth as well. No tunnels run under the park, as many thought after this was released.\n\nThe Alien Attack ride featured in the Wonder World theme park was in fact the \"Earthquake: The Big One attraction\" from the [[Universal Studios Florida]] theme park in [[Orlando, Florida]]. The \"aliens\" featured in the ride are suited actors (and not animatronic as suggested in the film) that closely resembled the Cylons from the original Battlestar Galactica.<ref name=TPI-131116>{{cite web |url=https://www.themeparkinsider.com/flume/201311/3778/ |title=Theme Park History: 10 top movies or TV shows filmed in theme parks |author=Potter, Derek |date=November 16, 2013 |website=Theme Park Insider |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Other film and television===\n* Paramount's Great America was also used as the theme park [[Macaulay Culkin]] visits in the 1994 film ''[[Getting Even with Dad]]'' (not released by Paramount Pictures but rather [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://greatamericanthrills.net/2014/08/24/getting-even-with-dad-filmed-at-californias-great-america/ |title=Getting Even With Dad Filmed at California's Great America |author=Rowberry, Kris |date=August 24, 2014 |website=Great American Thrills |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n* The park's inverted steel coaster \"Top Gun\" (later renamed to \"Flight Deck\") was featured in a 2007 [[Excedrin]] commercial with music from [[The Stremes]].<ref>{{youtube |id=Nw-d5OZOWA0 |title=Excedrin TV Advert - Music by The Stremes}}</ref>\n* Marriott's Great America was used in the 1983 George Lucas and [[John Korty]] animated feature [[Twice Upon a Time (1983 film)|''Twice Upon A Time'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/58153 |title=Twice Upon a Time (1983) |publisher=AFI Catalog of Feature Films |accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref> It was used both as a background for animated scenes and for a short live-action shot at the end of the film.\n\n==Incidents==\n{{Main|Incidents at Cedar Fair parks}}\n* In 1980, a 13-year-old boy was killed and several others injured on the [[Whizzer (roller coaster)|Willard's Whizzer]] roller coaster. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2015/06/13/previous-accidents-at-great-america/|title=Previous accidents at Great America|last=Kaplan|first=Tracy|date=June 13, 2015|work=San Jose Mercury News|access-date=March 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* In 1989, two boys intentionally jumped out of the Loggers' Run ride.

There is however general consensus among Austronesianists that Enggano belongs to the Austronesian language family.{{sfnp|Lafeber|1922}}<ref>Nothofer 1986.</ref><ref>Blust, R. A. (2013).

The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world. m.s.</ref>\n\nWhen first contacted by Europeans, the [[Enggano people]] had more cultural commonalities with indigenous peoples of the [[Nicobar Islands]] than those of with Austronesian Sumatra. For instance, beehive houses were typical of both Enggano Island and the Nicobar Islands. However, there are no apparent linguistic connections with [[Nicobarese language|Nicobarese]] or other [[Austroasiatic languages]].\n\n==Classification==\nThe classification of Enggano is controversial,{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=54\u201355}} ranging from proposals that negate its inclusion in the Austronesian family all the way to classifications that place Enggano in the [[Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands languages|Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands]] subgroup together with other [[Austronesian languages]] of the area (e.g. [[Nias language|Nias]]). \n\nBased on the low number of apparent Austronesian cognates, Capell (1982) concludes that Enggano is a [[language isolate]] rather than Austronesian as previously assumed.<ref name=Capell/> Blench (2014)<ref name=Blench/> considers Enggano to be a [[language isolate]] that has picked up Austronesian loanwords, and notes many basic vocabulary items in Enggano are of non-Austronesian origin. Based on lexical evidence from the Enggano language, he considers the Enggano people to be descendants of [[Pleistocene]] (pre-Neolithic) [[hunter-gatherer]]s that had preceded the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]].\n\nEdwards (2015) demonstrates that pronouns, numerals and many affixes in Enggano can be directly derived from [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language|Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=70\u201379}} Based on this evidence, together with regular sound changes from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian to Enggano, Edwards concludes that Enggano clearly belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the Austronesian languages. Within Malayo-Polynesian, he considers Enggano to be a primary branch.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=93}}\n\nEdwards thus rejects Capell's and Blench's proposal that Enggano is a non-Austronesian language with Austronesian loanwords, and considers it to be clearly Austronesian. While a large portion of its lexicon obviously cannot be derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it remains unclear whether this represents a non-Austronesian [[substratum]] from an unknown source language, or the result of internal lexical replacement.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=91\u201392}}. He notes that Enggano possesses many aberrant phonological features (such as a small phonological inventory) and a low lexical retention rate, which is more typical of Austronesian languages spoken in eastern Indonesia and Melanesia than rather than those of western Indonesia. Enggano's lexical retention rate (i.e., percentage of lexical items that are cognate with reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] forms) is only 21% (46 out of 217 words), while the lexical retention rate for [[Malay language|Malay]] is 59% (132.5 out of 223 words).{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}} Some non-Austronesian languages in Southeast Asia, such as [[Nancowry language|Nancowry]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and [[Abui language|Abui]] also have low lexical retention rates.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}}\n\n==Evolution==\nEnggano has historically undergone [[nasal harmony]] in its identifiable Austronesian vocabulary, where all [[stop consonant|stop consonants]] and vowels in a word became nasal after a nasal vowel, and oral after an oral vowel, so that there is no longer a phonemic distinction between them. For example, *e\u0169\u2019ada\u2019a became ''e\u0169\u2019\u00e3n\u00e3\u2019\u00e3'', while nasal consonants are no longer found in ''\u2019ub'' 'house' or ''\u2019a-rib'' 'five' (cf. Malay ''rumah, lima'').\n\nEnggano is the only western Austronesian language in which *t shifted to {{IPA|/k/}}, an unusual change that occurred independently several times in [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] after *k shifted to [[glottal stop]].{{sfnp|Blust|2004|p=383}}\n\n== Phonology ==\nThe only major linguistic treatment of Enggano was conducted by Hans K\u00e4hler in 1937; he published a grammar (1940), texts, and a dictionary (1987). However, phonology is limited to a simple inventory and a short paragraph of basic features; the grammar and dictionary disagree with each other, the dictionary is not consistent, some words are not legible, and doubts have been raised about the accuracy of the transcriptions. Nothofer (1992) discusses loanwords and also lists phonemes.<ref name=\"Nothofer\">Nothofer, 1986, p. 97, after K\u00e4hler (1940).</ref> Yoder (2011) is a thesis on Enggano vowels, with some comments on consonants; it will be followed here.<ref>[http://www.und.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2011Yoder.PDF Yoder, 2011.]</ref>\n\nStress was once reported to be penultimate but appears to occur on the final syllable. Alternating syllables preceding it have secondary stress.\n\nYoder and Nothofer report seven oral and seven nasal vowels:<ref>K\u00e4hler's dictionary is similar, but lacks {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0268\u0303/}}.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\" \n|- align=\"center\" \n!\n! front\n! central\n! back\n|- align=\"center\"\n! close\n| i \u0129\n| \u0268 \u0268\u0303\n| u \u0169\n|- align=\"center\"\n! mid\n| e \u1ebd\n| \u0258 \u0258\u0303\n| o \u00f5\n|- align=\"center\"\n! open\n| colspan=2| a \u00e3 \n|  \n|}\nDiphthongs are {{IPA|/ai, a\u0268, au, ei, \u0258i, oi/}}.\n\nVowels do not occur word-initially in Enggano apart from what Yoder analyzes as {{IPA|/i u/}} before another vowel; these are then pronounced as semivowels {{IPA|[j w]}}. (Nothofer counts these as consonants {{IPA|/j, w/}} restricted to initial position, which avoids the problem of not uncommon {{IPA|[ji]}} being analyzed as {{IPA|/ii/}}, when sequences of the same vowel are  otherwise quite rare.) The vowels {{IPA|/i \u0268 u e o/}} are all pronounced as semivowels in vowel sequences after medial glottal consonants {{IPA|/\u0294 h/}}, as in {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u0294\u0129\u00e3/ [k\u00f5\u0294j\u00e3]}} (a sp. tree) and {{IPA|/bohoe/ [boho\u032fe]}} 'wild'; otherwise, apart from diphthongs, vowel sequences are disyllabic, as in {{IPA|/\u0294a-piah/ [\u0294api.ah]}} 'to graze'. {{IPA|/i/}} optionally triggers a glide after a following glottal consonant, as in {{IPA|/ki-\u0294u/ [ki\u0294u ~ ki\u0294ju]}} 'to say'. Diphthongs lower to {{IPA|[a\u026a, a\u028a]}} etc. before a coda stop, as in {{IPA|/kipa\u0294\u00e3\u0169p/ [k\u0129p\u00e3\u0294\u00e3\u028a\u0303p]}} 'ten', and undergo metathesis when that stop is glottal, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 kak/ [kaha\u0294\u026akak]}} 'twenty'. An [[intrusive vowel]] {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306]}} appears between glottal stop and another consonant (though not semivowels), as in {{IPA|/ka\u0294h\u0268\u0258/ [ka\u0294.\u0259\u0306.h\u0268.\u0258]}} 'female leader'; this does not affect the pattern of stress.\n\nIn many words, a final vowel transcribed by K\u00e4hler is not found in Yoder.\n\nThe offglide of diphthongs lowers before glottal consonants, and a glottal stop may intrude when another word follows, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 m\u0258h/}} {{IPA|[kaha\u0294\u026am\u0258\u0303h]}} 'another'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! \n!

Approximant\n| \n| (l) \n| j ?\n| w ?\n|  \n|}\nYoder notes that the voiced stops {{IPA|[b~m, d~n]}} are in [[complementary distribution]], depending on whether the word has nasal vowels, but lists them separately. Voiced oral consonants, {{IPA|[b d l r]}}, do not occur in words with nasal consonants or vowels. Nasal consonants nasalize all vowels in a word, and there is therefore no contrast between {{IPA|[m n]}} and {{IPA|[b d]}} apart from the contrast between nasal and oral vowels. For example, with the oral stem ''tax'' 'bag', the possessive forms are ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' and ''tahib'' 'your bag', but with the nasal stem 'age', the forms are ''\u2019umunu\u2019'' 'my age' and ''\u2019umunum'' 'your age'.\n\n{{IPA|/l/}} occurs in only a few native words. {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} are infrequent and apparently a single phoneme; they only occur word finally, where they contrast with {{IPA|/h/}}: {{IPA|[x]}} occurs after the non-front vowels {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0259 u/}}, {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} after the front vowels {{IPA|/i a \u00e3/}}, and {{IPA|[s]}} after vowel sequences ending in {{IPA|/i/}} (including {{IPA|/ii, ui/}}). The resulting {{IPA|[a\u00e7 \u00e3\u00e7]}} may actually be {{IPA|/aix \u00e3\u0129x/}}, as most such words are attested with alternation like {{IPA|[ka\u00e7 ~ kais]}} 'box'. When a suffix is added, so that this consonant is no longer word-final, it becomes {{IPA|/h/}}, as in ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' above.\n\nNothofer is similar, but does not list the uncommon consonants {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} and counts {{IPA|[j w]}} as consonants rather than allophones of vowels. K\u00e4hler's dictionary adds {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, as well as {{IPA|/f t\u0283 d\u0292/}} as marginal phonemes, and claims that {{IPA|/t r/}} are only found in southern villages. However, Yoder states that at the time of his research in 2010 there were no differences among the six villages on Enggano Island, and that initial {{IPA|/t r/}} and final {{IPA|/t d/}} are rare in native words. Medial {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are in free variation in a few words, with older people preferring {{IPA|/d/}} and younger speakers {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==Grammar==\nThe main reference on the syntax and morphology of the Enggano language is the grammar produced by the German scholar Hans K\u00e4hler, which was published in 1940.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} There are also some references to syntax and morphology in more recent work, such as Yoder (2011) and Edwards (2015). This section compares some of the findings in K\u00e4hler (1940) with those of Yoder (2011), where the language appears to have undergone some changes.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nThe pronouns listed in K\u00e4hler (1940) are as follows:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=106}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is also a phonological process whereby a vowel is inserted between the [[glottal stop]] and the u in the 1sg enclitic ''-'u''. This is the final vowel of the stem to which the suffix attaches, e.g. ''euba'' 'house' > ''euba'au'' 'my house', ''ebohe'' 'spear' > ''ebohe'eu'' 'my {{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=96}} Possession can also be indicated using the proclitic pronouns above.\n\nThe pronouns listed in Yoder (2011) are as follows:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Enggano pronouns\n|-\n! Pronoun !! Independent !! Suffix\n|-\n| 1sg ||\u2019u || -\u2019\n|-\n| we.{{sc|EXCL}} ||\u2019a ||\n|-\n| we.{{sc|INCL}} ||\u2019ik || -k\n|-\n| 2sg ||\u2019\u0259\u2019 || -b ~ -m\n|-\n| 2pl ||\u2019ari || -du ~ -nu\n|-\n| 3sg ||ki || rowspan=2| -d(e) ~ -n(e)\n|-\n| 3pl ||ham\u0259\u2019 \n|-\n| this ||(p\u1ebd)\u2019\u1ebd\u2019\n|-\n| that ||\u2019\u1ebd\u00f5\u2019\n|-\n| who ||h\u00e3\n|-\n| what ||\u2019i.ah\n|}\nMost of these appear to be Austronesian: Compare Malay 1sg ''aku ~ ku'', 1.{{sc|ex}} ''kami'', 1.{{sc|in}} ''kita'', 2pl ''kalian'', 3sg/pl ''dia'', and suffixes 1sg ''-ku'', 2sg ''-mu'', 3sg ''-nya'', with *k, *t (d), *l, *m, *n having shifted to ''\u2019, k, r, b, d'' in Enggano, and with final consonants and (where possible) vowels being lost. The possessive suffixes appear on nouns, and they are often preceded by a vowel. Few forms are attested, but this vowel is ''i'' or ''ai'' after {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (as with 'bag' in the phonology section), an [[echo vowel]] after several other consonants, and with several words not predictable on current evidence: ''\u2019eam \u2013 \u2019ami\u2019'' '(my) fishing rod'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns in Enggano can be subcategorised into three different classes: humans, proper nouns and common nouns. They take different articles to indicate singular and plural reference:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=85}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Articles in Enggano\n!Noun Class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n|Human\n|e-\n|ka-\n|-\n|Proper\n|\u2205-\n|\u2205-\n|-\n|Common\n|e-\n|e-\n|}\nBlench notes that ''e-'' may be a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]<ref name=\"Blench\" /> and Edwards argues that the articles not only mark [[noun class]] but also [[Grammatical case|case]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=60\u201361}} Nouns marked with ''e-'' and the other articles above can express both subjects and objects. The prefix ''e-'' can also be used to derive [[Gerund|gerunds]] from verbal stems.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} Plural number can also be indicated through [[reduplication]].{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=87}} In this case, the meaning is exhaustive, e.g. all of the nouns.\n\nNouns with an oblique function, e.g. those expressing nominal possessors, subjects of gerunds and any noun that follows the [[Oblique argument|oblique]] marker ''i'ioo'', take the article ''u-'' in place of ''e-''. Finally, [[Locative case|locative nouns]] take the locative prefix ''i-''.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}}\n\nNouns in Enggano can be modified by demonstratives and relative clauses. As in other Austronesian languages, these typically follow the nominal head. There are three demonstratives in Enggano:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=92}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Demonstratives in Enggano\n!Demonstrative\n!Enggano\n!Rough Translation\n|-\n|Proximal\n|ei'ie\n|this\n|-\n|Medial\n|e'ana\n|that\n|-\n|Distal\n|ea'a\n|that\n|}\nRelative clauses are introduced by a relativiser ''m\u00f5'\u00f5''. K\u00e4hler suggests that older speakers of Enggano would use different relativisers depending on whether the head noun was singular (''hem\u00f5\u2019\u00f5'') or plural (''h\u00f5m\u00f5\u2019\u00f5''). However, in 1937 when he was conducting research, this practice was already uncommon in everyday language.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}} An example of a relative clause in Enggano is given below. This shows that demonstratives also follow relative clauses:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}}\n<br />\n{|\n|(1)\n|ka'u'ua-da'a\n|e-uba\n|m\u00f5'\u00f5\n|'am\u0169h\u00f5\n|ei'ie\n|-\n|\n|beautiful-<small>PRED</small>\n|<small>ART</small>-house\n|<small>REL</small>\n|big\n|<small>PROX.DEM</small>\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"5\" |'This house which is big is beautiful'\n|}\n\nK\u00e4hler describes some processes of [[Morphological derivation|nominal derivation]] in Enggano. Specifically, he notes that instrumental nouns can be formed via the addition of a vowel or ''paV-'' to a verbal root, e.g. ''poko'' 'to chisel' > ''e-opoko'' 'a chisel' or ''kui'' 'to sew' > ''e-paukui'' 'needle'. Locative nouns are formed with an ''-a'' suffix, e.g. ''parudu'' 'gather' > ''e-parudu-a'' 'gathering place'.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|pp=316\u2013318}}\n\n=== Verbs and Adjectives ===\nAdjectives commonly have prefixes ''ka-, ka\u2019-, ki-''; the first two are attested in derivation, and the last is assumed as it is very common and many such adjectives otherwise appear to be reduplicated, as in ''kinanap'' 'smooth' (Yoder 2011).\n\nVerbs may have one or two prefixes and sometimes a suffix. Attested prefixes are ''ba-, ba\u2019-, ia-, iah-, ka-, ka\u2019-, kah-, ki-, kir-, ko-, pa-, pah-, \u2019a-.'' The functions of these are unknown. ''Ki-'' and ''pa-'' may occur together, as in ''pe, pape, kipe, kipape'', all glossed as 'give'. The three attested verbal suffixes are ''-i, -ar, -a\u2019'' (Yoder 2011).\n\n=== Numerals ===\nThe counting system is, or at least once was, [[vigesimal]]: K\u00e4hler recorded ''kahai'i ekaka'' 'one man' = 20, ''ariba ekaka'' 'five man' = 100, ''kahai'i edudodoka'' 'one our-body' = 400. (The last may be based on two people counting together: each time I count all twenty of my digits, you count one of yours, so that when you have counted all of your digits, the number is 20\u00d720 = 400.) However, most people now use Malay numerals when speaking Enggano, especially for higher numbers. Yoder (2011) recorded the following:<ref>Also found [https://web.archive.org/web/20101230153201/http://lingweb.eva.mpg.de/numeral/Enggano.htm here]</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n! Numeral !!

Compare the remaining ''-hai\u2019, -ru, -k\u0259r, -up, -rib'' with [[Lampung language|Lampung]] ''\u0259say, rua, t\u0259lu, \u0259pat, lima''; *s, *t, *l, *m have shifted to ''h, k, r, b'' in Enggano, and final consonants and (simple) vowels have been lost. \n''\u2019aki\u2019akin'' 6 may be reduplication of ''\u2019ak\u0259r'' 3. ''\u2019arib he \u2019aru'' 7 is 'five and two'. The two forms for 8 mean 'hugging', from the verb ''p\u00e3\u2019\u0129\u00f5p'' 'to hug', and 9 appears to be 'eight, one coming'; it may be shortened to ''kaba kahai\u2019'' (no ''-i'') in enumeration. Yoder believes 10 may also be a verb, based on an unelicited root ''\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'', as ''ki-'' and ''pa-'' are verbal prefixes (as in ''ki-pa-pe'' 'to give'); indeed, the apparent prefixes on 1\u20135 are identical to verbal prefixes as well.\n\nNumbers above 10 and 20 are formed with ''he ~ hi'' 'and': ''k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p he \u2019aru'' 'ten and two' for 12, ''kahai\u2019 kak he k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'' 'twenty and ten' for 30. ''kak'' is 'person', so twenty is 'one person'. Multiples of twenty are formed from ''kak'', as in ''\u2019ak\u0259r kak he k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'' 70, ''\u2019arib kak'' 100 (also ''kahai\u2019 ratuh'' from Malay ''ratus'').\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Blench, Roger, ''The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world.''

There is however general consensus among Austronesianists that Enggano belongs to the Austronesian language family.{{sfnp|Lafeber|1922}}<ref>Nothofer 1986.</ref><ref>Blust, R. A. (2013).

Geoffrey Sutton, 1-15, p. 4.</ref><ref name=Blench>Blench, Roger. 2014. The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world. m.s.</ref>\n\nWhen first contacted by Europeans, the [[Enggano people]] had more cultural commonalities with indigenous peoples of the [[Nicobar Islands]] than those of with Austronesian Sumatra. For instance, beehive houses were typical of both Enggano Island and the Nicobar Islands. However, there are no apparent linguistic connections with [[Nicobarese language|Nicobarese]] or other [[Austroasiatic languages]].\n\n==Classification==\nThe classification of Enggano is controversial,{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=54\u201355}} ranging from proposals that negate its inclusion in the Austronesian family all the way to classifications that place Enggano in the [[Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands languages|Northwest Sumatra\u2013Barrier Islands]] subgroup together with other [[Austronesian languages]] of the area (e.g. [[Nias language|Nias]]). \n\nBased on the low number of apparent Austronesian cognates, Capell (1982) concludes that Enggano is a [[language isolate]] rather than Austronesian as previously assumed.<ref name=Capell/> Blench (2014)<ref name=Blench/> considers Enggano to be a [[language isolate]] that has picked up Austronesian loanwords, and notes many basic vocabulary items in Enggano are of non-Austronesian origin. Based on lexical evidence from the Enggano language, he considers the Enggano people to be descendants of [[Pleistocene]] (pre-Neolithic) [[hunter-gatherer]]s that had preceded the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]].\n\nEdwards (2015) demonstrates that pronouns, numerals and many affixes in Enggano can be directly derived from [[Proto-Malayo-Polynesian language|Proto-Malayo-Polynesian]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=70\u201379}} Based on this evidence, together with regular sound changes from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian to Enggano, Edwards concludes that Enggano clearly belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages|Malayo-Polynesian]] branch of the Austronesian languages. Within Malayo-Polynesian, he considers Enggano to be a primary branch.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=93}}\n\nEdwards thus rejects Capell's and Blench's proposal that Enggano is a non-Austronesian language with Austronesian loanwords, and considers it to be clearly Austronesian. While a large portion of its lexicon obviously cannot be derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian, it remains unclear whether this represents a non-Austronesian [[substratum]] from an unknown source language, or the result of internal lexical replacement.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=91\u201392}}. He notes that Enggano possesses many aberrant phonological features (such as a small phonological inventory) and a low lexical retention rate, which is more typical of Austronesian languages spoken in eastern Indonesia and Melanesia than rather than those of western Indonesia. Enggano's lexical retention rate (i.e., percentage of lexical items that are cognate with reconstructed [[Proto-Austronesian language|Proto-Austronesian]] forms) is only 21% (46 out of 217 words), while the lexical retention rate for [[Malay language|Malay]] is 59% (132.5 out of 223 words).{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}} Some non-Austronesian languages in Southeast Asia, such as [[Nancowry language|Nancowry]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]], and [[Abui language|Abui]] also have low lexical retention rates.{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|p=76}}\n\n==Evolution==\nEnggano has historically undergone [[nasal harmony]] in its identifiable Austronesian vocabulary, where all [[stop consonant|stop consonants]] and vowels in a word became nasal after a nasal vowel, and oral after an oral vowel, so that there is no longer a phonemic distinction between them. For example, *e\u0169\u2019ada\u2019a became ''e\u0169\u2019\u00e3n\u00e3\u2019\u00e3'', while nasal consonants are no longer found in ''\u2019ub'' 'house' or ''\u2019a-rib'' 'five' (cf. Malay ''rumah, lima''). Enggano is the only western Austronesian language in which *t shifted to {{IPA|/k/}}, an unusual change that occurred independently several times in [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic]] after *k shifted to [[glottal stop]].{{sfnp|Blust|2004|p=383}}\n\n== Phonology ==\nThe only major linguistic treatment of Enggano was conducted by Hans K\u00e4hler in 1937; he published a grammar (1940), texts, and a dictionary (1987). However, phonology is limited to a simple inventory and a short paragraph of basic features; the grammar and dictionary disagree with each other, the dictionary is not consistent, some words are not legible, and doubts have been raised about the accuracy of the transcriptions. Nothofer (1992) discusses loanwords and also lists phonemes.<ref name=\"Nothofer\">Nothofer, 1986, p. 97, after K\u00e4hler (1940).</ref> Yoder (2011) is a thesis on Enggano vowels, with some comments on consonants; it will be followed here.<ref>[http://www.und.edu/dept/linguistics/theses/2011Yoder.PDF Yoder, 2011.]</ref>\n\nStress was once reported to be penultimate but appears to occur on the final syllable. Alternating syllables preceding it have secondary stress.\n\nYoder and Nothofer report seven oral and seven nasal vowels:<ref>K\u00e4hler's dictionary is similar, but lacks {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0268\u0303/}}.</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\" \n|- align=\"center\" \n!\n! front\n! central\n! back\n|- align=\"center\"\n! close\n| i \u0129\n| \u0268 \u0268\u0303\n| u \u0169\n|- align=\"center\"\n! mid\n| e \u1ebd\n| \u0258 \u0258\u0303\n| o \u00f5\n|- align=\"center\"\n! open\n| colspan=2| a \u00e3 \n|  \n|}\nDiphthongs are {{IPA|/ai, a\u0268, au, ei, \u0258i, oi/}}.\n\nVowels do not occur word-initially in Enggano apart from what Yoder analyzes as {{IPA|/i u/}} before another vowel; these are then pronounced as semivowels {{IPA|[j w]}}. (Nothofer counts these as consonants {{IPA|/j, w/}} restricted to initial position, which avoids the problem of not uncommon {{IPA|[ji]}} being analyzed as {{IPA|/ii/}}, when sequences of the same vowel are  otherwise quite rare.) The vowels {{IPA|/i \u0268 u e o/}} are all pronounced as semivowels in vowel sequences after medial glottal consonants {{IPA|/\u0294 h/}}, as in {{IPA|/k\u00f5\u0294\u0129\u00e3/ [k\u00f5\u0294j\u00e3]}} (a sp. tree) and {{IPA|/bohoe/ [boho\u032fe]}} 'wild'; otherwise, apart from diphthongs, vowel sequences are disyllabic, as in {{IPA|/\u0294a-piah/ [\u0294api.ah]}} 'to graze'. {{IPA|/i/}} optionally triggers a glide after a following glottal consonant, as in {{IPA|/ki-\u0294u/ [ki\u0294u ~ ki\u0294ju]}} 'to say'. Diphthongs lower to {{IPA|[a\u026a, a\u028a]}} etc. before a coda stop, as in {{IPA|/kipa\u0294\u00e3\u0169p/ [k\u0129p\u00e3\u0294\u00e3\u028a\u0303p]}} 'ten', and undergo metathesis when that stop is glottal, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 kak/ [kaha\u0294\u026akak]}} 'twenty'. An [[intrusive vowel]] {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306]}} appears between glottal stop and another consonant (though not semivowels), as in {{IPA|/ka\u0294h\u0268\u0258/ [ka\u0294.\u0259\u0306.h\u0268.\u0258]}} 'female leader'; this does not affect the pattern of stress.\n\nIn many words, a final vowel transcribed by K\u00e4hler is not found in Yoder.\n\nThe offglide of diphthongs lowers before glottal consonants, and a glottal stop may intrude when another word follows, as in {{IPA|/kahai\u0294 m\u0258h/}} {{IPA|[kaha\u0294\u026am\u0258\u0303h]}} 'another'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n! \n!

Approximant\n| \n| (l) \n| j ?\n| w ?\n|  \n|}\nYoder notes that the voiced stops {{IPA|[b~m, d~n]}} are in [[complementary distribution]], depending on whether the word has nasal vowels, but lists them separately. Voiced oral consonants, {{IPA|[b d l r]}}, do not occur in words with nasal consonants or vowels. Nasal consonants nasalize all vowels in a word, and there is therefore no contrast between {{IPA|[m n]}} and {{IPA|[b d]}} apart from the contrast between nasal and oral vowels. For example, with the oral stem ''tax'' 'bag', the possessive forms are ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' and ''tahib'' 'your bag', but with the nasal stem 'age', the forms are ''\u2019umunu\u2019'' 'my age' and ''\u2019umunum'' 'your age'.\n\n{{IPA|/l/}} occurs in only a few native words. {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} are infrequent and apparently a single phoneme; they only occur word finally, where they contrast with {{IPA|/h/}}: {{IPA|[x]}} occurs after the non-front vowels {{IPA|/\u0268 \u0259 u/}}, {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} after the front vowels {{IPA|/i a \u00e3/}}, and {{IPA|[s]}} after vowel sequences ending in {{IPA|/i/}} (including {{IPA|/ii, ui/}}). The resulting {{IPA|[a\u00e7 \u00e3\u00e7]}} may actually be {{IPA|/aix \u00e3\u0129x/}}, as most such words are attested with alternation like {{IPA|[ka\u00e7 ~ kais]}} 'box'. When a suffix is added, so that this consonant is no longer word-final, it becomes {{IPA|/h/}}, as in ''tahi\u2019'' 'my bag' above.\n\nNothofer is similar, but does not list the uncommon consonants {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/s ~ x/}} and counts {{IPA|[j w]}} as consonants rather than allophones of vowels. K\u00e4hler's dictionary adds {{IPA|/\u0272/}}, as well as {{IPA|/f t\u0283 d\u0292/}} as marginal phonemes, and claims that {{IPA|/t r/}} are only found in southern villages. However, Yoder states that at the time of his research in 2010 there were no differences among the six villages on Enggano Island, and that initial {{IPA|/t r/}} and final {{IPA|/t d/}} are rare in native words. Medial {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/r/}} are in free variation in a few words, with older people preferring {{IPA|/d/}} and younger speakers {{IPA|/r/}}.\n\n==Grammar==\nThe main reference on the syntax and morphology of the Enggano language is the grammar produced by the German scholar Hans K\u00e4hler, which was published in 1940.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} There are also some references to syntax and morphology in more recent work, such as Yoder (2011) and Edwards (2015). This section compares some of the findings in K\u00e4hler (1940) with those of Yoder (2011), where the language appears to have undergone some changes.\n\n=== Pronouns ===\nThe pronouns listed in K\u00e4hler (1940) are as follows:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=106}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

There is also a phonological process whereby a vowel is inserted between the [[glottal stop]] and the u in the 1sg enclitic ''-'u''. This is the final vowel of the stem to which the suffix attaches, e.g. ''euba'' 'house' > ''euba'au'' 'my house', ''ebohe'' 'spear' > ''ebohe'eu'' 'my {{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=96}} Possession can also be indicated using the proclitic pronouns above.\n\nThe pronouns listed in Yoder (2011) are as follows:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+Enggano pronouns\n|-\n! Pronoun !! Independent !! Suffix\n|-\n| 1sg ||\u2019u || -\u2019\n|-\n| we.{{sc|EXCL}} ||\u2019a ||\n|-\n| we.{{sc|INCL}} ||\u2019ik || -k\n|-\n| 2sg ||\u2019\u0259\u2019 || -b ~ -m\n|-\n| 2pl ||\u2019ari || -du ~ -nu\n|-\n| 3sg ||ki || rowspan=2| -d(e) ~ -n(e)\n|-\n| 3pl ||ham\u0259\u2019 \n|-\n| this ||(p\u1ebd)\u2019\u1ebd\u2019\n|-\n| that ||\u2019\u1ebd\u00f5\u2019\n|-\n| who ||h\u00e3\n|-\n| what ||\u2019i.ah\n|}\nMost of these appear to be Austronesian: Compare Malay 1sg ''aku ~ ku'', 1.{{sc|ex}} ''kami'', 1.{{sc|in}} ''kita'', 2pl ''kalian'', 3sg/pl ''dia'', and suffixes 1sg ''-ku'', 2sg ''-mu'', 3sg ''-nya'', with *k, *t (d), *l, *m, *n having shifted to ''\u2019, k, r, b, d'' in Enggano, and with final consonants and (where possible) vowels being lost. The possessive suffixes appear on nouns, and they are often preceded by a vowel. Few forms are attested, but this vowel is ''i'' or ''ai'' after {{IPA|[\u00e7]}} (as with 'bag' in the phonology section), an [[echo vowel]] after several other consonants, and with several words not predictable on current evidence: ''\u2019eam \u2013 \u2019ami\u2019'' '(my) fishing rod'.\n\n=== Nouns ===\nNouns in Enggano can be subcategorised into three different classes: humans, proper nouns and common nouns. They take different articles to indicate singular and plural reference:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=85}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Articles in Enggano\n!Noun Class\n!Singular\n!Plural\n|-\n|Human\n|e-\n|ka-\n|-\n|Proper\n|\u2205-\n|\u2205-\n|-\n|Common\n|e-\n|e-\n|}\nBlench notes that ''e-'' may be a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]]<ref name=\"Blench\" /> and Edwards argues that the articles not only mark [[noun class]] but also [[Grammatical case|case]].{{sfnp|Edwards|2015|pp=60\u201361}} Nouns marked with ''e-'' and the other articles above can express both subjects and objects. The prefix ''e-'' can also be used to derive [[Gerund|gerunds]] from verbal stems.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}} Plural number can also be indicated through [[reduplication]].{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=87}} In this case, the meaning is exhaustive, e.g. all of the nouns.\n\nNouns with an oblique function, e.g. those expressing nominal possessors, subjects of gerunds and any noun that follows the [[Oblique argument|oblique]] marker ''i'ioo'', take the article ''u-'' in place of ''e-''. Finally, [[Locative case|locative nouns]] take the locative prefix ''i-''.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940}}\n\nNouns in Enggano can be modified by demonstratives and relative clauses. As in other Austronesian languages, these typically follow the nominal head. There are three demonstratives in Enggano:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=92}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Demonstratives in Enggano\n!Demonstrative\n!Enggano\n!Rough Translation\n|-\n|Proximal\n|ei'ie\n|this\n|-\n|Medial\n|e'ana\n|that\n|-\n|Distal\n|ea'a\n|that\n|}\nRelative clauses are introduced by a relativiser ''m\u00f5'\u00f5''. K\u00e4hler suggests that older speakers of Enggano would use different relativisers depending on whether the head noun was singular (''hem\u00f5\u2019\u00f5'') or plural (''h\u00f5m\u00f5\u2019\u00f5''). However, in 1937 when he was conducting research, this practice was already uncommon in everyday language.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}} An example of a relative clause in Enggano is given below. This shows that demonstratives also follow relative clauses:{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|p=93}}\n<br />\n{|\n|(1)\n|ka'u'ua-da'a\n|e-uba\n|m\u00f5'\u00f5\n|'am\u0169h\u00f5\n|ei'ie\n|-\n|\n|beautiful-<small>PRED</small>\n|<small>ART</small>-house\n|<small>REL</small>\n|big\n|<small>PROX.DEM</small>\n|-\n|\n| colspan=\"5\" |'This house which is big is beautiful'\n|}\n\nK\u00e4hler describes some processes of [[Morphological derivation|nominal derivation]] in Enggano. Specifically, he notes that instrumental nouns can be formed via the addition of a vowel or ''paV-'' to a verbal root, e.g. ''poko'' 'to chisel' > ''e-opoko'' 'a chisel' or ''kui'' 'to sew' > ''e-paukui'' 'needle'. Locative nouns are formed with an ''-a'' suffix, e.g. ''parudu'' 'gather' > ''e-parudu-a'' 'gathering place'.{{sfnp|K\u00e4hler|1940|pp=316\u2013318}}\n\n=== Verbs and Adjectives ===\nAdjectives commonly have prefixes ''ka-, ka\u2019-, ki-''; the first two are attested in derivation, and the last is assumed as it is very common and many such adjectives otherwise appear to be reduplicated, as in ''kinanap'' 'smooth' (Yoder 2011).\n\nVerbs may have one or two prefixes and sometimes a suffix. Attested prefixes are ''ba-, ba\u2019-, ia-, iah-, ka-, ka\u2019-, kah-, ki-, kir-, ko-, pa-, pah-, \u2019a-.'' The functions of these are unknown. ''Ki-'' and ''pa-'' may occur together, as in ''pe, pape, kipe, kipape'', all glossed as 'give'. The three attested verbal suffixes are ''-i, -ar, -a\u2019'' (Yoder 2011).\n\n=== Numerals ===\nThe counting system is, or at least once was, [[vigesimal]]: K\u00e4hler recorded ''kahai'i ekaka'' 'one man' = 20, ''ariba ekaka'' 'five man' = 100, ''kahai'i edudodoka'' 'one our-body' = 400. (The last may be based on two people counting together: each time I count all twenty of my digits, you count one of yours, so that when you have counted all of your digits, the number is 20\u00d720 = 400.) However, most people now use Malay numerals when speaking Enggano, especially for higher numbers.

Compare the remaining ''-hai\u2019, -ru, -k\u0259r, -up, -rib'' with [[Lampung language|Lampung]] ''\u0259say, rua, t\u0259lu, \u0259pat, lima''; *s, *t, *l, *m have shifted to ''h, k, r, b'' in Enggano, and final consonants and (simple) vowels have been lost. \n''\u2019aki\u2019akin'' 6 may be reduplication of ''\u2019ak\u0259r'' 3. ''\u2019arib he \u2019aru'' 7 is 'five and two'. The two forms for 8 mean 'hugging', from the verb ''p\u00e3\u2019\u0129\u00f5p'' 'to hug', and 9 appears to be 'eight, one coming'; it may be shortened to ''kaba kahai\u2019'' (no ''-i'') in enumeration. Yoder believes 10 may also be a verb, based on an unelicited root ''\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'', as ''ki-'' and ''pa-'' are verbal prefixes (as in ''ki-pa-pe'' 'to give'); indeed, the apparent prefixes on 1\u20135 are identical to verbal prefixes as well.\n\nNumbers above 10 and 20 are formed with ''he ~ hi'' 'and': ''k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p he \u2019aru'' 'ten and two' for 12, ''kahai\u2019 kak he k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'' 'twenty and ten' for 30. ''kak'' is 'person', so twenty is 'one person'. Multiples of twenty are formed from ''kak'', as in ''\u2019ak\u0259r kak he k\u0129p\u00e3\u2019\u00e3\u0169p'' 70, ''\u2019arib kak'' 100 (also ''kahai\u2019 ratuh'' from Malay ''ratus'').\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Blench, Roger, ''The Enggano: archaic foragers and their interactions with the Austronesian world.''

Call blockers received attention from publications including [[Which?]] and [[Consumer Reports]] in the United Kingdom and United States respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leedham |first1=Robert |title=Call blocking devices \u2013 everything you need to know |url=http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |website=which.co.uk |publisher=Which? |accessdate=22 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701075905/http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rage against robocalls|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|website=consumerreports.org|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK [[BT Group|BT]] operates a service for landlines called Choose to Refuse which allows customers to block up to 10 phone numbers of their choice for a monthly fee.<ref>{{cite web|title=All about Choose to Refuse|url=http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8500/~/all-about-choose-to-refuse|website=BT.com Help|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of physical products have been developed for use with landlines. These are typically installed in homes and employ a [[Hard coding|hard coded]] or irregularly updated blacklist. Some models also have the function to create a user-generated whitelist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|title=Robocall blocker review|last=|first=|date=14 August 2015|website=Consumer Reports|publisher=|language=en|publication-date=|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> Newer devices for landlines can use cloud based data to resolve the hard coded blacklist issues and allow you to create your own whitelist/blacklist.\n\n=== Crowdsourcing ===\nA more sophisticated model uses [[crowdsourcing]] to build a more comprehensive blacklist of robocall numbers. A notable example of this is the app [[Truecaller]], which requires users to provide access to their personal [[whitelist]] of genuine contacts in exchange for access to the larger crowdsourced database. In 2013, hackers gained access to Truecaller's database of known genuine numbers, highlighting the danger of centralising this information.<ref>{{cite web|title=Truecaller Statement|url=https://blog.truecaller.com/2013/07/18/truecaller-statement/|website=Truecaller Blog|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=5 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2013/07/truecaller-database-hacked-by-syrian.html|title=Truecaller Database hacked by Syrian Electronic Army|last=|first=|date=16 July 2013|work=|access-date=|via=E Hacking News}}</ref>\n\n=== CAPTCHA ===\nBuilding on the crowdsourcing model, [[Primus Canada]] launched a patented product called Telemarketing Guard for [[landlines]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Matthew|title=Stopping Fraudulent Robocall Scams: Can More Be Done?|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ef5915d3-e47e-4834-9a42-a4393ea03d9c/AB13B79566335ED657BFD89A085CCCA1.stein2.pdf|website=United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|accessdate=21 November 2016|page=1|language=en|format=pdf|date=10 July 2013}}</ref> It improves on previous models by including a [[CAPTCHA]] style challenge-response test.\n\nBased on a database developed from customer feedback, it filters suspected telemarketing calls to a system which challenges callers to record their name after pressing a button. If a name is recorded, the customer's phone rings with the [[Caller ID]] of Telemarketing Guard. If they answer the phone, they are played the recording, at which point they can accept the call or decline and report it.<ref>{{cite web|title=Call-Blocking Technology|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/public_events/robocalls-all-rage-ftc-summit/robocalls-part7-call-blocking.pdf|website=Federal Trade Commission|accessdate=21 November 2016|page=19|language=en|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Realtime analysis ===\nA major problem for the use of both blacklisting and whitelisting techniques is the practice of [[caller ID spoofing]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Scam Alert - How Scammers Use Caller ID Spoofing to Pose as You|url=http://www.bbb.org/council/news-events/bbb-scam-alerts/2014/06/scam-alert-how-scammers-use-caller-id-spoofing-to-pose-as-you/|website=Council of Better Business Bureaus|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=20 June 2014}}</ref> which is prevalent as a result of the low [[Barriers to entry|barrier to entry]] in the [[Voice over IP|VoIP]] services market.<ref>{{harvnb|Huahong|Doup\u00e9|Zhao|Ahn|2016|p=2}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 the [[Federal Communications Commission]] proposed a framework for the telecommunications industry in the United States, which included a validation system at network level for robocalls from [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] sources by 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=CGB Announces Agenda for Robocall and Caller ID Spoofing Workshop on September 16, 2015|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-15-1001A1_Rcd.pdf|website=Federal Communications Commission|accessdate=21 November 2016|pages=9880\u20139881|language=en|format=pdf|date=10 September 2015}}</ref> The final authentication task in the framework is the signing of all VoIP calls, which would allow carriers to reliably identify robocalls.\n\nUntil these goals are achieved, a more advanced method for blocking robocalls uses [[real-time business intelligence]] techniques to address the constantly changing identities of robocalls.

The FTC contends that the companies are operating a massive telemarketing scheme that uses random, pre-recorded phone calls to deceive consumers into thinking that their vehicle's warranty is about to expire. Consumers who respond to the robocalls are pressured to purchase extended service contracts for their vehicles, which the telemarketers falsely portray as an extension of the manufacturer's original warranty. According to papers the FTC filed with the court, however, the robocalls have prompted tens of thousands of complaints from consumers who are either on the United States National Do Not Call Registry or asked not to be called. Five telephone numbers associated with the defendants have generated a total of 30,000 Do Not Call complaints. Consumers received the robocalls at home, work, and on their cell phones, sometimes several times in one day. Businesses, government offices and even 911 dispatchers have been subjected to the calls.\n\nThose who answer the pre-recorded calls hear a message telling them that their vehicle warranty is about to expire and that they should \"extend coverage before it is too late\". They are told to \"press one\" to speak to a \"warranty specialist\". The \"specialists\" then mislead consumers into believing that their company is affiliated with the dealer or manufacturer of the consumer's vehicle. They try to sell consumers a service contract for between $2,000 and $3,000, which they falsely portray as an extension of the vehicle's original warranty. The seller of extended auto warranties sued by the FTC allegedly took in more than $10 million on the sale of these deceptively marketed service contracts. In their robocalls, the companies dialed every phone number within a particular area code and prefix sequentially, without knowing whether the consumers called were motorists or owned motor vehicles, or whether those consumers' numbers were on the Do Not Call Registry. Consumers who asked that the calls be stopped often were met with \"abusive behavior\" or were simply hung up on, according to the papers filed with the court. Some of the defendants used offshore shell corporations to try to avoid scrutiny, and a top officer in the telemarketing company bragged to prospective clients that he could operate outside the law without any chance of being caught by the FTC, the papers stated. This defendant also claimed that he makes 1.8 million dials per day and that he had done more than $40 million worth of dialing for extended warranty companies, including one billion dials on behalf of his largest client, according to the court papers filed by the FTC. In addition to the robocalls, the FTC charged that the company selling the warranties mails out deceptive postcards to consumers, warning them about the imminent expiration of their auto warranties. The postcards are designed to mislead consumers into believing that they are being contacted by their dealer or manufacturer, and the postcards offer consumers the chance to \"renew\" their original warranties.<ref name=\"case\">[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html FTC: Judge Orders Halt To Robocalls Selling Deceptive Warranties], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714024144/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html |date=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> On May 15, 2009 U.S. District Judge [[John Francis Grady|John F.

Besides ordering a halt to the automatic telephone sales calls, Grady's order froze the assets of the two companies. The FTC alleged in its complaints that the calls were part of a deceptive scheme and asked the court to assure the assets will not be lost in case they might be needed to repay consumers who have been victimized. The FTC isn't immediately seeking civil fines against the companies but may do so later, agency officials said. Attorneys general in Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri have taken similar actions over calls offering extended warranties on automobiles.<ref name=\"case1\">[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 Judge blocks 'robo-calls' selling car warranties], [[Associated Press]], May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607220858/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 |date=June 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Voice broadcasting]]\n* [[Ringless voicemail]]\n* [[Cold calling]]\n* [[Google Duplex]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://complaints.donotcall.gov/complaint/complaintcheck.aspx  National Do Not Call Registry Complaints]\n*[https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us Federal Communications Commission Consumer Complaint Center]\n*[https://www.nomorobo.com Nomorobo.com]\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Telemarketing]]\n[[Category:Neologisms]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Phone call delivering pre-recorded message}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{Update|date=June 2019|reason=Information on the US FCC's [https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-affirms-robocall-blocking-default-protect-consumers-0 June 6, 2019, vote] needs to be included}}\n{{lead too short|date=May 2012}}\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2010}}\n}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=February 2012}}\n\nA '''robocall''' is a phone call that uses a computerized [[autodialer]] to deliver a pre-recorded message, as if from a [[robot]].

One of the calls was to the toll-free number used by customers of 2call.ca, a subsidiary of [[Edmonton]]-based [[Internet Service Provider]] RackNine, to phone in and record their outgoing messages. The burner cell phone belonging to \"Pierre Poutine\" was used to contact the owner of Racknine at his personal unlisted number and gave the name \"Pierre Jones\". This burner phone initiated a series of automated robocalls mostly in Guelph but with a few dozen in other ridings, that targeted mostly non-Conservative voters with false voting location changes. Some voters attended what they had been led to believe were their voting locations, and sometimes destroyed their voter registration cards in anger.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nIn November 2011, the investigator served RackNine with a production order for records and had the account holder associated with the bogus calls quickly identified.<ref>{{cite web|last=Maher and McGregor |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/Tracking+telephone+tricks/6194759/story.html |title=Tracking telephone tricks |publisher=Ottawa Citizen |accessdate=28 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226004126/http://www.ottawacitizen.com/news/Tracking+telephone+tricks/6194759/story.html |archivedate=February 26, 2012 }}</ref> Investigators have also examined the Conservative Party's CIMS voter database and showed that \"Pierre Poutine\" used the Conservative voter database to select whom to call.

[[Mobile app]]s are especially prevalent as they use techniques which do not require the modification of infrastructure. Many products are limited to use only on a single medium, such as traditional copper landlines, or [[mobile phone]] contracts from a specific [[mobile phone operator]].\n\n=== Blacklisting and whitelisting ===\nIn its simplest form, this method offers the ability to prevent further calls from phone numbers, once they are known to be a source of robocalls. Many mobile apps can prevent robocalls with a user generated [[Blacklist (computing)|blacklist]].\n\n[[File:Call-blocker-wikipedia.jpg|thumb|Landline call blocker in use]]\n\nFor landlines there are standalone call blockers which connect to the telephone. Various models work on blacklisting and whitelisting principles. Call blockers received attention from publications including [[Which?]] and [[Consumer Reports]] in the United Kingdom and United States respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leedham |first1=Robert |title=Call blocking devices \u2013 everything you need to know |url=http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |website=which.co.uk |publisher=Which? |accessdate=22 September 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701075905/http://blogs.which.co.uk/technology/phones-3/call-blocking-devices-eveything-you-need-to-know/ |archivedate=2016-07-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Rage against robocalls|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|website=consumerreports.org|publisher=Consumer Reports|accessdate=1 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the UK [[BT Group|BT]] operates a service for landlines called Choose to Refuse which allows customers to block up to 10 phone numbers of their choice for a monthly fee.<ref>{{cite web|title=All about Choose to Refuse|url=http://bt.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8500/~/all-about-choose-to-refuse|website=BT.com Help|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nA number of physical products have been developed for use with landlines. These are typically installed in homes and employ a [[Hard coding|hard coded]] or irregularly updated blacklist. Some models also have the function to create a user-generated whitelist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/07/robocall-blocker-review/index.htm|title=Robocall blocker review|last=|first=|date=14 August 2015|website=Consumer Reports|publisher=|language=en|publication-date=|access-date=21 November 2016}}</ref> Newer devices for landlines can use cloud based data to resolve the hard coded blacklist issues and allow you to create your own whitelist/blacklist.\n\n=== Crowdsourcing ===\nA more sophisticated model uses [[crowdsourcing]] to build a more comprehensive blacklist of robocall numbers. A notable example of this is the app [[Truecaller]], which requires users to provide access to their personal [[whitelist]] of genuine contacts in exchange for access to the larger crowdsourced database. In 2013, hackers gained access to Truecaller's database of known genuine numbers, highlighting the danger of centralising this information.<ref>{{cite web|title=Truecaller Statement|url=https://blog.truecaller.com/2013/07/18/truecaller-statement/|website=Truecaller Blog|accessdate=21 November 2016|language=en|date=5 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ehackingnews.com/2013/07/truecaller-database-hacked-by-syrian.html|title=Truecaller Database hacked by Syrian Electronic Army|last=|first=|date=16 July 2013|work=|access-date=|via=E Hacking News}}</ref>\n\n=== CAPTCHA ===\nBuilding on the crowdsourcing model, [[Primus Canada]] launched a patented product called Telemarketing Guard for [[landlines]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stein|first1=Matthew|title=Stopping Fraudulent Robocall Scams: Can More Be Done?|url=https://www.commerce.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/ef5915d3-e47e-4834-9a42-a4393ea03d9c/AB13B79566335ED657BFD89A085CCCA1.stein2.pdf|website=United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation|accessdate=21 November 2016|page=1|language=en|format=pdf|date=10 July 2013}}</ref> It improves on previous models by including a [[CAPTCHA]] style challenge-response test.\n\nBased on a database developed from customer feedback, it filters suspected telemarketing calls to a system which challenges callers to record their name after pressing a button.

The FTC contends that the companies are operating a massive telemarketing scheme that uses random, pre-recorded phone calls to deceive consumers into thinking that their vehicle's warranty is about to expire. Consumers who respond to the robocalls are pressured to purchase extended service contracts for their vehicles, which the telemarketers falsely portray as an extension of the manufacturer's original warranty. According to papers the FTC filed with the court, however, the robocalls have prompted tens of thousands of complaints from consumers who are either on the United States National Do Not Call Registry or asked not to be called. Five telephone numbers associated with the defendants have generated a total of 30,000 Do Not Call complaints. Consumers received the robocalls at home, work, and on their cell phones, sometimes several times in one day. Businesses, government offices and even 911 dispatchers have been subjected to the calls.\n\nThose who answer the pre-recorded calls hear a message telling them that their vehicle warranty is about to expire and that they should \"extend coverage before it is too late\". They are told to \"press one\" to speak to a \"warranty specialist\". The \"specialists\" then mislead consumers into believing that their company is affiliated with the dealer or manufacturer of the consumer's vehicle. They try to sell consumers a service contract for between $2,000 and $3,000, which they falsely portray as an extension of the vehicle's original warranty. The seller of extended auto warranties sued by the FTC allegedly took in more than $10 million on the sale of these deceptively marketed service contracts. In their robocalls, the companies dialed every phone number within a particular area code and prefix sequentially, without knowing whether the consumers called were motorists or owned motor vehicles, or whether those consumers' numbers were on the Do Not Call Registry. Consumers who asked that the calls be stopped often were met with \"abusive behavior\" or were simply hung up on, according to the papers filed with the court. Some of the defendants used offshore shell corporations to try to avoid scrutiny, and a top officer in the telemarketing company bragged to prospective clients that he could operate outside the law without any chance of being caught by the FTC, the papers stated. This defendant also claimed that he makes 1.8 million dials per day and that he had done more than $40 million worth of dialing for extended warranty companies, including one billion dials on behalf of his largest client, according to the court papers filed by the FTC. In addition to the robocalls, the FTC charged that the company selling the warranties mails out deceptive postcards to consumers, warning them about the imminent expiration of their auto warranties. The postcards are designed to mislead consumers into believing that they are being contacted by their dealer or manufacturer, and the postcards offer consumers the chance to \"renew\" their original warranties.<ref name=\"case\">[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html FTC: Judge Orders Halt To Robocalls Selling Deceptive Warranties], ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714024144/http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090515-717706.html |date=July 14, 2009 }}</ref> On May 15, 2009 U.S. District Judge [[John Francis Grady|John F.

Grady's orders also applied to Transcontinental CEO and President Christopher Cowart, Voice Touch executives James and Maureen Dunne, Voice Touch business partner Network Foundations LLC and Network Foundations executive Damian Kohlfeld. Besides ordering a halt to the automatic telephone sales calls, Grady's order froze the assets of the two companies. The FTC alleged in its complaints that the calls were part of a deceptive scheme and asked the court to assure the assets will not be lost in case they might be needed to repay consumers who have been victimized. The FTC isn't immediately seeking civil fines against the companies but may do so later, agency officials said. Attorneys general in Arkansas, Indiana and Missouri have taken similar actions over calls offering extended warranties on automobiles.<ref name=\"case1\">[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 Judge blocks 'robo-calls' selling car warranties], [[Associated Press]], May 15, 2009 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607220858/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jFpGIsUi1KVrRr07BBoVqLrkz0ZQD986V9404 |date=June 7, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Voice broadcasting]]\n* [[Ringless voicemail]]\n* [[Cold calling]]\n* [[Google Duplex]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://complaints.donotcall.gov/complaint/complaintcheck.aspx  National Do Not Call Registry Complaints]\n*[https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us Federal Communications Commission Consumer Complaint Center]\n*[https://www.nomorobo.com Nomorobo.com]\n\n{{Spamming}}\n\n[[Category:Telemarketing]]\n[[Category:Neologisms]]\n", "name_user": "Corn cheese", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReverse robocalling", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocall"}

This, and another [[antifolate]] drug, [[methotrexate]] used by Dr. Farber, were discovered and supplied by Dr. [[Yellapragada Subbarow]], Director, Research at Lederle Co. at Pearl River, NY.\n* 1954: Farber and his colleagues achieve the first remissions of [[Wilms' tumor]], a common form of childhood cancer, and boost cure rates from 40 percent to 85 percent.\n* 1976: Researchers at the Sidney Farber Cancer Center (now Dana-Farber) develop a new treatment for [[acute myelogenous leukemia]] that produces the first complete remissions of the disease in up to half of all patients.\n* 1978: Institute investigators develop combination chemotherapy for soft-tissue [[sarcoma]]s resulting in a 50-percent response rate.\n* 1980: Dana-Farber president [[Baruj Benacerraf]] receives the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of the [[major histocompatibility complex]], which enables the immune system to recognize [[antigens]].\n* 1982: Dana-Farber researchers develop and apply the [[CA-125]] blood test for [[ovarian cancer]]. They also are among the first to suspect a relationship between the retrovirus that causes [[Human T-lymphotropic virus 1|human T-cell leukemia]] (HTLV-1) and that which causes [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] ([[Subtypes of HIV|HIV-1]]).\n* 1991: Dana-Farber investigators help introduce the use of naturally occurring [[growth hormone]]s following high-dose chemotherapy, making [[bone marrow transplantation]] safer and more effective.\n* 1993: Dana-Farber investigators discover the gene that increases the risk for a common type of [[colon cancer]]. The [[DNA mismatch repair|''MSH2'']] gene and later the [[DNA mismatch repair|''MLH1'']] gene (also by DFCI investigators) are linked to hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer ([[Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer|HNPCC]]).\n* 1996: Institute researchers dramatically advance the understanding of how HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, replicates and infects healthy cells. ''Science'' magazine heralds this discovery as its \"Breakthrough of the Year\".\n* 1998: A drug called [[imatinib]] (Gleevec), the early work for which was done at Dana-Farber, achieves striking success in many patients with [[chronic myelogenous leukemia]].\n* 1999: Working with colleagues at other hospitals, Dana-Farber scientists begin the first human studies of [[endostatin]], one of a new generation of compounds that arrest or shrink tumors by shutting off their blood supply.\n* 2002: Dana-Farber researchers find that Gleevec, a targeted therapy that achieved striking success against chronic myelogenous leukemia, can shrink and even eliminate tumors in some patients with a rare and otherwise incurable digestive-tract cancer called gastrointestinal stromal tumor.\n* 2003: Scientists at Dana-Farber and the [[Whitehead Institute]] find a gene \"signature\" in several types of tumors that suggests they are likely to spread to other parts of the body, potentially leading to tests for determining whether tumors have the potential to metastasize.\n* 2005: Dana-Farber scientists report that the drug [[gefitinib]] (Iressa) produces dramatic benefits in [[non-small cell lung cancer]] patients who carry an abnormal version of a key protein, a potentially life-saving discovery for tens of thousands of patients around the world every year.\n* 2019: Dana-Farber physician and researcher [[William Kaelin Jr.]] receives the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for \"discoveries of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability.\"\n\n== Patient care ==\nDana-Farber/Brigham and Women's Cancer Center (DF/BWCC) is a collaboration between Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute and [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] to care for adults with cancer.

Dana-Farber provides outpatient services, while inpatient care is provided by Brigham and Women's Hospital. DF/BWCC cares for adult patients in more than a dozen specialized treatment centers. This coordinated arrangement makes it possible for many people to see all of their specialists in a single visit.\n\nBoston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center is a more than 60-year-old partnership between [[Boston Children's Hospital]] and Dana\u2013Farber Cancer Institute that delivers comprehensive care to children with and survivors of all types of childhood cancers.\n\nThey also work with several other local New England organizations that share a similar vision, such as [[Take a Swing at Cancer]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.takeaswing.org/|title=tasc14|author=|date=|website=tasc14|accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> Angel's Hope, Childhood Cancer Lifeline of New Hampshire and Andrew's Helpful Hands.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Dana-Farber Cancer Institute}}\n* [http://www.dana-farber.org Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]\n* [http://www.dana.org/ Charles A.
