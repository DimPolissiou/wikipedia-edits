It was written by Samuel Barnes, [[Scott La Rock]], [[Makeba Riddick]], Jean-Claude Oliver, [[KRS-One|Lawrence Parker]], and produced by [[Trackmasters|Poke & Tone]]. It was released on 15 July 2005, as the second and final single from the album. The lyrics revolve around \"basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", peaking at number 36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart. The song's accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Marcus Raboy]], was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying various activities, such as dancing and riding [[jet ski]]s with her friends.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{listen\n | filename    = Rihanna - If It's Lovin' That You Want.ogg\n | title       = Rihanna \u2014 \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\"\n | description = A 20 second sample of \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", of which critics both praised Rihanna's vocal range<ref name=\"TheHindu\"/> but also criticized the singer for sounding \"too light\" and \"thin\".<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n |pos          = left\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nFollowing the release and commercial success of \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", the lead single from ''Music of the Sun'' and Rihanna's debut in the music industry, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" was released as the second single from the album.<ref name=\"iTunesAU\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/if-its-lovin-that-you-want/id99775989|title=If It's Lovin' That You Want \u2013 Single|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (AU)|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> In an interview with [[MTV News]], Rihanna explained the lyrical meaning behind the song, saying \"The song is basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\">{{cite news|author=Brandee J.

The lyrics revolve around \"basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", peaking at number 36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart. The song's accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Marcus Raboy]], was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying various activities, such as dancing and riding [[jet ski]]s with her friends.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{listen\n | filename    = Rihanna - If It's Lovin' That You Want.ogg\n | title       = Rihanna \u2014 \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\"\n | description = A 20 second sample of \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", of which critics both praised Rihanna's vocal range<ref name=\"TheHindu\"/> but also criticized the singer for sounding \"too light\" and \"thin\".<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n |pos          = left\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nFollowing the release and commercial success of \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", the lead single from ''Music of the Sun'' and Rihanna's debut in the music industry, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" was released as the second single from the album.<ref name=\"iTunesAU\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/if-its-lovin-that-you-want/id99775989|title=If It's Lovin' That You Want \u2013 Single|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (AU)|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> In an interview with [[MTV News]], Rihanna explained the lyrical meaning behind the song, saying \"The song is basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\">{{cite news|author=Brandee J.

These positive charges help the histone tails to interact with and bind to the negatively charged [[phosphate group]]s on the DNA backbone. [[Acetylation]], which occurs normally in a cell, neutralizes the positive charges on the histone by changing amines into [[amide]]s and decreases the ability of the histones to bind to DNA. This decreased binding allows [[chromatin]] expansion, permitting genetic [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] to take place. Histone deacetylases remove those acetyl groups, increasing the positive charge of histone tails and encouraging high-affinity binding between the histones and DNA backbone. The increased DNA binding condenses DNA structure, preventing transcription.\n\nHistone deacetylase is involved in a series of pathways within the living system. According to the ''Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes'' ([[KEGG]]), these are:\n\n* Environmental information processing; [[signal transduction]]; [[notch signaling pathway]] [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?ko04330+ko:K06067 PATH:ko04330]\n* Cellular processes; cell growth and death; [[cell cycle]] [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?ko04110+ko:K06067 PATH:ko04110]\n* Human diseases; cancers; [[chronic myeloid leukemia]] [http://www.genome.jp/dbget-bin/show_pathway?ko05220+ko:K06067 PATH:ko05220]\n\nHistone acetylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression.

These positive charges help the histone tails to interact with and bind to the negatively charged [[phosphate group]]s on the DNA backbone. [[Acetylation]], which occurs normally in a cell, neutralizes the positive charges on the histone by changing amines into [[amide]]s and decreases the ability of the histones to bind to DNA. This decreased binding allows [[chromatin]] expansion, permitting genetic [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] to take place. Histone deacetylases remove those acetyl groups, increasing the positive charge of histone tails and encouraging high-affinity binding between the histones and DNA backbone. The increased DNA binding condenses DNA structure, preventing transcription.\n\nHistone deacetylase is involved in a series of pathways within the living system.

She shared First Prize in the Young Researchers competition at the Ultimate Reality Symposium in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metanexus.net/archive/ultimate_reality/032102.htm|title= Winners of the Young Researchers Competition in Physics Announced|accessdate=2008-04-24|date=2002-03-21|work=Science & Ultimate Reality|publisher=[[Metanexus Institute]]}}</ref>\n\nShe has been influenced by researchers such as [[Christopher Isham]] who call attention to the unstated assumption in most modern physics that physical properties are most naturally calibrated by a real-number continuum. She, and others, attempt to make explicit some of the implicit mathematical assumptions underpinning modern theoretical physics and cosmology.\n\nIn her interdisciplinary paper \"The Internal Description of a Causal Set: What the Universe Looks Like from the Inside\", Markopoulou instantiates some abstract terms from mathematical [[category theory]] to develop straightforward models of space-time. It proposes simple quantum models of space-time based on category-theoretic notions of a [[topos]] and its [[subobject classifier]] (which has a [[Heyting algebra]] structure, but not necessarily a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] structure).\n\nFor example, hard-to-picture category-theoretic [[presheaf (category theory)|\"presheaves\"]] from topos theory become easy-to-picture \"evolving (or varying) sets\" in her discussions of [[quantum spacetime]]. The diagrams in Markopoulou's papers (including hand-drawn diagrams in one of the earlier versions of \"The Internal Description of a Causal Set\") are straightforward presentations of possible models of space-time. They are intended as meaningful and provocative, not just for specialists but also for newcomers.\n\nIn May 2006, Markopoulou published a paper with [[Lee Smolin]] that further popularized this [[Causal dynamical triangulation|Causal Dynamical Triangulation]] (CDT) Theory by explaining time slicing of the Ambjorn\u2013Loll CDT model as result of gauge fixing. Their approach relaxed the definition of the Ambjorn\u2013Loll CDT model in 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 dimensions to allow for a varying lapse.\n\n==Quantum graphity==\nIn 2008, Markopoulou, [[Tomasz Konopka]], [[Mohammad H. Ansari]], and [[Simone Severini]] initiated the study of a new background independent model of evolutionary space called [[Quantum Graphity|quantum graphity]].\n\nIn the quantum graphity model, points in spacetime are represented by nodes on a graph connected by links that can be on or off.<ref>Konopka, Tomasz; Markopoulou, Fotini; Severini, Simone (6 Jan 2008) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0861 \"Quantum Graphity: a model of emergent locality\"]</ref> This indicates whether or not the two points are directly connected as if they are next to each other in spacetime. When they are on the links have additional state variables which are used to define the random dynamics of the graph under the influence of quantum fluctuations and temperature. At high temperature the graph is in Phase I where all the points are randomly connected to each other and no concept of spacetime as we know it exists. As the temperature drops and the graph cools, it is conjectured to undergo a phase transition to a Phase II where spacetime forms. It will then look like a spacetime manifold on large scales with only near-neighbour points being connected in the graph.\n\nThe hypothesis of quantum graphity is that this geometrogenesis models the condensation of spacetime in [[the big bang]]. A second model, related to ideas around quantum graphity, has been published.<ref>A. Hamma, F. Markopoulou, S. Loyd, F. Caravelli, S. Severini, K.

She shared First Prize in the Young Researchers competition at the Ultimate Reality Symposium in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metanexus.net/archive/ultimate_reality/032102.htm|title= Winners of the Young Researchers Competition in Physics Announced|accessdate=2008-04-24|date=2002-03-21|work=Science & Ultimate Reality|publisher=[[Metanexus Institute]]}}</ref>\n\nShe has been influenced by researchers such as [[Christopher Isham]] who call attention to the unstated assumption in most modern physics that physical properties are most naturally calibrated by a real-number continuum. She, and others, attempt to make explicit some of the implicit mathematical assumptions underpinning modern theoretical physics and cosmology.\n\nIn her interdisciplinary paper \"The Internal Description of a Causal Set: What the Universe Looks Like from the Inside\", Markopoulou instantiates some abstract terms from mathematical [[category theory]] to develop straightforward models of space-time. It proposes simple quantum models of space-time based on category-theoretic notions of a [[topos]] and its [[subobject classifier]] (which has a [[Heyting algebra]] structure, but not necessarily a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] structure).\n\nFor example, hard-to-picture category-theoretic [[presheaf (category theory)|\"presheaves\"]] from topos theory become easy-to-picture \"evolving (or varying) sets\" in her discussions of [[quantum spacetime]]. The diagrams in Markopoulou's papers (including hand-drawn diagrams in one of the earlier versions of \"The Internal Description of a Causal Set\") are straightforward presentations of possible models of space-time. They are intended as meaningful and provocative, not just for specialists but also for newcomers.\n\nIn May 2006, Markopoulou published a paper with [[Lee Smolin]] that further popularized this [[Causal dynamical triangulation|Causal Dynamical Triangulation]] (CDT) Theory by explaining time slicing of the Ambjorn\u2013Loll CDT model as result of gauge fixing. Their approach relaxed the definition of the Ambjorn\u2013Loll CDT model in 1&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 dimensions to allow for a varying lapse.\n\n==Quantum graphity==\nIn 2008, Markopoulou, [[Tomasz Konopka]], [[Mohammad H. Ansari]], and [[Simone Severini]] initiated the study of a new background independent model of evolutionary space called [[Quantum Graphity|quantum graphity]].\n\nIn the quantum graphity model, points in spacetime are represented by nodes on a graph connected by links that can be on or off.<ref>Konopka, Tomasz; Markopoulou, Fotini; Severini, Simone (6 Jan 2008) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.0861 \"Quantum Graphity: a model of emergent locality\"]</ref> This indicates whether or not the two points are directly connected as if they are next to each other in spacetime. When they are on the links have additional state variables which are used to define the random dynamics of the graph under the influence of quantum fluctuations and temperature. At high temperature the graph is in Phase I where all the points are randomly connected to each other and no concept of spacetime as we know it exists. As the temperature drops and the graph cools, it is conjectured to undergo a phase transition to a Phase II where spacetime forms. It will then look like a spacetime manifold on large scales with only near-neighbour points being connected in the graph.\n\nThe hypothesis of quantum graphity is that this geometrogenesis models the condensation of spacetime in [[the big bang]]. A second model, related to ideas around quantum graphity, has been published.<ref>A. Hamma, F. Markopoulou, S. Loyd, F. Caravelli, S. Severini, K. Markstrom (27 Nov 2009) \"A quantum Bose-Hubbard model with evolving graph as toy model for emergent spacetime\" https://arxiv.org/abs/0911.5075</ref>\n\nMarkopoulou is one of the quantum gravity researchers that uses the quantum computation framework to formulate new quantum theories of gravity.

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

SEG could not secure home-video releases for ''[[UFC 23]]'' through ''[[UFC 29]]''. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000.

After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended.\n\nThe final Strikeforce show was [[Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine]] on January 12, 2013, after which the promotion was dissolved and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.\n\n====Fox partnership====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+'''''UFC on Fox'' [[Nielsen

The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=2017-03-29|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=2017-12-11|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=2017-02-17|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last=Drahota|first=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=2018-09-29|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=2018-09-29|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with [[Anderson Silva]] tested the most of a total of 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gallery/here-are-the-ufc-fighters-usada-tested-the-most-in-2016-022317|title=Here are the UFC fighters USADA tested the most in 2016|last=ET|first=2017 at 3:01p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>  In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ufc.usada.org/testing/results/testing-numbers/|title=Testing Numbers|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 16, 2019, a total of  76 UFC fighters have been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mma-insiders.com/a-quick-look-at-all-usada-banned-ufc-fighters-since-2016-reveals-bellators-problem/|title=A quick look at all USADA banned UFC fighters since 2016 - Reveals Bellator's problem.|date=2019-05-16|website=Combat Arena|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board.

In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances.

Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015.

Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015.

Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as [[Lightweight (MMA)|lightweight]]. Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in The Octagon between rounds.\n*''[[UFC 43]]'' \u2013 In the event of a stoppage fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.\n* ''[[UFC 94]]'' \u2013 After an incident where [[Georges St-Pierre]] was accused of putting [[vaseline]] on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into The Octagon.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters).

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

A month later, in January 2001, the Fertittas bought the UFC for $2 million and created [[Zuffa|Zuffa, LLC]] as the parent entity controlling the UFC.\n\n\"I had my attorneys tell me that I was crazy because I wasn't buying anything.

Fighters must participate in the testing pool for at least six months prior to a fight in order to qualify for a UFC event.<ref name=\"mmajunkie.com\"/>  In February 2017, UFC made changes to the anti-doping policy, effective April 1, 2017, as follows: (1) Fighters who are new to the UFC with no previous contract would be subject to a one-month testing rule. The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=2017-03-29|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=2017-12-11|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=2017-02-17|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last=Drahota|first=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=2018-09-29|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=2018-09-29|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with [[Anderson Silva]] tested the most of a total of 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gallery/here-are-the-ufc-fighters-usada-tested-the-most-in-2016-022317|title=Here are the UFC fighters USADA tested the most in 2016|last=ET|first=2017 at 3:01p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>  In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ufc.usada.org/testing/results/testing-numbers/|title=Testing Numbers|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 16, 2019, a total of  76 UFC fighters have been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mma-insiders.com/a-quick-look-at-all-usada-banned-ufc-fighters-since-2016-reveals-bellators-problem/|title=A quick look at all USADA banned UFC fighters since 2016 - Reveals Bellator's problem.|date=2019-05-16|website=Combat Arena|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board. Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".<ref>Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.208</ref>\n\nThe UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard. Bantamweight moves from 150 to 155 and becomes known as [[Lightweight (MMA)|lightweight]]. Lightweight becomes known as [[Welterweight (MMA)|welterweight]], middleweight becomes [[Light Heavyweight (MMA)|light heavyweight]], and a new [[Middleweight (MMA)|middleweight]] class is introduced at 185 pounds. Stools and seconds are first permitted in The Octagon between rounds.\n*''[[UFC 43]]'' \u2013 In the event of a stoppage fights restart in the position the fight was stopped.\n* ''[[UFC 94]]'' \u2013 After an incident where [[Georges St-Pierre]] was accused of putting [[vaseline]] on his back, corner men were disallowed from bringing vaseline into The Octagon. [[Petroleum jelly]] may now only be applied by UFC employed [[cutman|cutmen]].\n* ''[[UFC 97]]'' \u2013 Foot-stomps are banned.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).
