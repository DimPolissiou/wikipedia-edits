Brown]],<ref name=jpldata/> and was announced to the public on July 29, 2005. The team had planned to delay announcing their discoveries of the bright objects Makemake and {{dp|Eris}} until further observations and calculations were complete, but announced them both on July 29 when the discovery of another large object they had been tracking, {{dp|Haumea}}, was [[Controversy over the discovery of Haumea|controversially announced]] on July 27 by a different team in Spain.<ref name=\"Maugh\"/>\n\nDespite its relative brightness (it is about a fifth as bright as Pluto),{{refn|It has an [[apparent magnitude]] in [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] of 16.7 vs. [[Pluto#Appearance and surface|15 for Pluto]].<ref name=\"Rabinowitz2007\"/>|group=lower-alpha}} Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the [[ecliptic]] (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to its relatively high [[orbital inclination]], and the fact that it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern [[constellation]] of [[Coma Berenices]].<ref name=\"Horizons\"/>\n\n[[Precovery]] images have been identified back to January 29, 1955.<ref name=jpldata/>\n\nBesides [[Pluto]], Makemake is the only other dwarf planet that was bright enough that [[Clyde Tombaugh]] could have detected it during his search for [[Planets beyond Neptune|trans-Neptunian planets]] around 1930.<ref name=\"Brown2006-discovery\" /> At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]],{{refn|Based on Minor Planet Center online Minor Planet Ephemeris Service: March 1, 1930: RA: 05h51m, Dec: +29.0.|group=lower-alpha}} at an apparent magnitude of 16.0.<ref name=\"Horizons\" /> This position, however, was also very near the [[Milky Way]], and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto,<ref name=\"Tombaugh\"/> but he did not find Makemake or any other [[trans-Neptunian object]]s.\n\n=== Name ===\nThe [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] {{mp|2005 FY|9}} was given to Makemake when the discovery was made public.

Its [[orbital period]] is 306&nbsp;years,<ref name=jpldata/> more than Pluto's 248&nbsp;years and Haumea's 285&nbsp;years. Both Makemake and Haumea are currently far from the [[ecliptic]] (at an angular distance of almost 29\u00b0). Makemake is approaching its 2033 [[apsis|aphelion]],<ref name=\"Horizons\" /> whereas Haumea passed its aphelion in early 1992.<ref name=\"Haumea_aphelion\"/>\n\nMakemake is a [[classical Kuiper belt object]] (KBO),<ref name=\"MPEC2009-P26\"/><ref group=lower-alpha name=\"B\" /> which means its orbit lies far enough from Neptune to remain stable over the age of the Solar System.<ref name=\"jewitt\"/><ref name=Luu2002/> Unlike [[plutino]]s, which can cross Neptune's orbit due to their 2:3 [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with the planet, the classical objects have [[apsis|perihelia]] further from the Sun, free from Neptune's [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]].<ref name=\"jewitt\" /> Such objects have relatively low eccentricities (''e'' below 0.2) and orbit the Sun in much the same way the planets do. Makemake, however, is a member of the \"dynamically hot\" class of classical KBOs, meaning that it has a high inclination compared to others in its population.<ref name = \"Levison2003\"/> Makemake is, probably coincidentally, [[Orbital resonance#Coincidental 'near' ratios of mean motion|near]] the 13:7 resonance with Neptune.<ref>[http://www.orbitsimulator.com/yabbfiles/Attachments/Makemake40000y_13to7.gif The 2009-02-04 nominal (non-librating) rotating frame for Makemake.]</ref>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\n=== Brightness, size, and rotation ===\n[[File:Makemake-LB1-2009Nov26-11UT.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Makemake ([[apparent magnitude]] 16.9) with edge on galaxy [https://in-the-sky.org/data/object.php?id=9128 IC 3587] ]]\n[[File:Quaoar Haumea Makemake orbits 2018.png|320px|thumb|Makemake's orbit outside of Neptune is similar to [[Haumea]]'s.

However, the occultation data was later reanalyzed,<ref name=Brown2013/> which led to the dimension estimate of {{nowrap|({{val|1434|48|-18}})&thinsp;\u00d7&thinsp;({{val|1420|18|-24}} km)}} without a pole-orientation constraint.<ref name=Brown2013/> Makemake was the fourth [[dwarf planet]] recognized, because it has a bright [[Photometric system|V-band]] [[absolute magnitude]] of \u22120.2.<ref name=jpldata/> Makemake has a high geometrical albedo of {{val|0.81|+0.01|-0.02}}.<ref name=Brown2013/>\n\nThe rotation period of Makemake is estimated at 22.83 hours.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/> A rotation period of 7.77 hours published in 2009<ref name=Heinze2009/> later turned out to be an [[Aliasing|alias]] of the actual rotation period. The possibility of this had been mentioned in the 2009 study, and the data from that study agrees well with the 22.83 hour period.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/> This rotation period is relatively long for a dwarf planet. Part of this may be due to [[tidal acceleration]] from Makemake's satellite. It has been suggested that a second large, undiscovered satellite might better explain the dwarf planet's unusually long rotation.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/>\n\nMakemake's lightcurve amplitude is small, only 0.03 ''mag''.<ref name=Brown2013/><ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/> This was thought to be due to Makemake currently being viewed pole on from Earth; however, S/2015 (136472) 1's orbital plane (which is probably orbiting with little inclination relative to Makemake's equator due to tides resulting from its rapid rotation) is edge-on from Earth, implying that Makemake is really being viewed equator-on.<ref name=\"planetary.org\"/>\n\n{{TNO imagemap}}\n\n=== Spectra and surface ===\n[[File:Makemake New Horizons.gif|thumb|310px|Makemake, indicated with red bars, as imaged by the ''[[New Horizons (spacecraft)|New Horizons]]'' spacecraft in October 2007.]]\nLike Pluto, Makemake appears red in the visible spectrum, and significantly redder than the surface of Eris (see [[trans-Neptunian object#Colors|colour comparison of TNOs]]).<ref name=\"atmosphere\" /> The near-infrared spectrum is marked by the presence of the broad [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>) [[absorption band]]s. Methane is observed also on Pluto and Eris, but its spectral signature is much weaker.<ref name=\"atmosphere\"/>\n\nSpectral analysis of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must be present in the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size.<ref name=\"brown\" /> In addition to methane, large amounts of [[ethane]] and [[tholin]]s as well as smaller amounts of [[ethylene]], [[acetylene]] and high-mass [[alkane]]s (like [[propane]]) may be present, most likely created by [[Photodissociation|photolysis]] of methane by solar radiation.<ref name=\"brown\" /><ref name=\"brown2015\"/> The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of [[solid nitrogen|nitrogen ice]] on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of [[nitrogen]] as on Pluto and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], where it composes more than 98&nbsp;percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.<ref name=\"brown\" /><ref name=\"Tegler2008\"/><ref name=Owen1993/>\n\nThe [[Far infrared|far-infrared]] (24\u201370&nbsp;\u03bcm) and [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] (70\u2013500&nbsp;\u03bcm) photometry performed by Spitzer and Herschel telescopes revealed that the surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3 to 7% of the surface.<ref name=\"Lim2010\" /> These studies were made before S/2015&nbsp;(136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake.<ref name=\"planetary.org\"/> However, some experiments have refuted these studies. Spectroscopic studies, collected from 2005 to 2008 using the William Herschel Telescope (La Palma, Spain) were analyzed together with other spectra in the literature, as of 2014. They show some degree of variation in the spectral slope, which would be associated with different abundance of the complex organic materials, byproduct of the irradiation of the ices present on the surface of Makemake. However, the relative ratio of the two dominant icy species, methane and nitrogen, remains quite stable on the surface revealing a low degree of inhomogeneity in the ice component.<ref name=\"Lorenzi2015\"/> These results have been recently confirmed when the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake, between 2006 and 2013, that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this study found that the variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be homogenous.<ref name=\"Perna2017\"/> Based on optical observations conducted between 2006 and 2017, Hromakina ''et al.'' concluded that Makemake's lightcurve was likely due to heterogeneities across its surface, but that the variations (of the order of 3%) were too small to have been detected spectroscopically.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/>\n\n=== Atmosphere ===\nMakemake was expected to have an [[atmosphere]] similar to that of [[Pluto]] but with a lower surface pressure. However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake [[Occultation#Occultations by asteroids|passed in front]] of an 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light.<ref name=\"Occultation\"/> The results showed that Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4\u201312 [[nanobar]] on the pressure at its surface.<ref name=Ortiz2012/>\n\nThe presence of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake could have a transient [[atmosphere]] similar to that of Pluto near its [[apsis|perihelion]].<ref name=\"atmosphere\"/> Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it.<ref name=\"brown\"/> The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via [[atmospheric escape]]; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32\u201336&nbsp;K),<ref name=Ortiz2012/> which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane.<ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/> However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by ''[[New Horizons]]'' suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.<ref name=\"Keeter2016\"/><ref name=\"Beatty2017\"/>\n\n== Satellite ==\n{{main|S/2015 (136472) 1}}\n\nMakemake has a single known moon, which was discovered in 2015 or 2016.<!--discovery images from 2015, announced 2016--> It is probably less than 200 km in diameter.<ref name=\"ParkerA2016\"/>\n\n==Exploration==\nIt has been calculated that a flyby mission to Makemake could take just over 16 years using a Jupiter [[gravity assist]], based on a launch date of 21 August 2024 or 24 August 2036.

Brown]],<ref name=jpldata/> and was announced to the public on July 29, 2005. The team had planned to delay announcing their discoveries of the bright objects Makemake and {{dp|Eris}} until further observations and calculations were complete, but announced them both on July 29 when the discovery of another large object they had been tracking, {{dp|Haumea}}, was [[Controversy over the discovery of Haumea|controversially announced]] on July 27 by a different team in Spain.<ref name=\"Maugh\"/>\n\nDespite its relative brightness (it is about a fifth as bright as Pluto),{{refn|It has an [[apparent magnitude]] in [[opposition (astronomy)|opposition]] of 16.7 vs. [[Pluto#Appearance and surface|15 for Pluto]].<ref name=\"Rabinowitz2007\"/>|group=lower-alpha}} Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the [[ecliptic]] (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the greater likelihood of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to its relatively high [[orbital inclination]], and the fact that it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern [[constellation]] of [[Coma Berenices]].<ref name=\"Horizons\"/>\n\n[[Precovery]] images have been identified back to January 29, 1955.<ref name=jpldata/>\n\nBesides [[Pluto]], Makemake is the only other dwarf planet that was bright enough that [[Clyde Tombaugh]] could have detected it during his search for [[Planets beyond Neptune|trans-Neptunian planets]] around 1930.<ref name=\"Brown2006-discovery\" /> At the time of Tombaugh's survey, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic, near the border of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and [[Auriga (constellation)|Auriga]],{{refn|Based on Minor Planet Center online Minor Planet Ephemeris Service: March 1, 1930: RA: 05h51m, Dec: +29.0.|group=lower-alpha}} at an apparent magnitude of 16.0.<ref name=\"Horizons\" /> This position, however, was also very near the [[Milky Way]], and Makemake would have been almost impossible to find against the dense background of stars. Tombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto,<ref name=\"Tombaugh\"/> but he did not find Makemake or any other [[trans-Neptunian object]]s.\n\n=== Name ===\nThe [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] {{mp|2005 FY|9}} was given to Makemake when the discovery was made public. Before that, the discovery team used the codename \"[[Easter Bunny|Easterbunny]]\" for the object, because of its discovery shortly after [[Easter]].<ref name=\"brownblog\" />\n\nIn July 2008, in accordance with IAU rules for classical Kuiper belt objects, {{mp|2005 FY|9}} was given the name of a [[creator deity]].<ref name=\"Slashdot, July 13, 2008\"/><!-- This rule is not mentioned in Mike Brown's story --> The name of [[Makemake (deity)|Makemake]], the creator of humanity and god of fertility in the myths of the [[Rapa Nui people|Rapa Nui]], the native people of [[Easter Island]],<ref name=\"name\"/> was chosen in part to preserve the object's connection with Easter.<ref name=\"brownblog\"/>\n\n== Orbit and classification ==\n[[File:TheKuiperBelt Orbits 2003EL61 2005FY9.svg|thumb|300px|left|Orbits of Makemake (blue), {{dp|Haumea}} (green), contrasted with the orbit of Pluto (red) and the ecliptic (grey).

Its [[orbital period]] is 306&nbsp;years,<ref name=jpldata/> more than Pluto's 248&nbsp;years and Haumea's 285&nbsp;years. Both Makemake and Haumea are currently far from the [[ecliptic]] (at an angular distance of almost 29\u00b0). Makemake is approaching its 2033 [[apsis|aphelion]],<ref name=\"Horizons\" /> whereas Haumea passed its aphelion in early 1992.<ref name=\"Haumea_aphelion\"/>\n\nMakemake is a [[classical Kuiper belt object]] (KBO),<ref name=\"MPEC2009-P26\"/><ref group=lower-alpha name=\"B\" /> which means its orbit lies far enough from Neptune to remain stable over the age of the Solar System.<ref name=\"jewitt\"/><ref name=Luu2002/> Unlike [[plutino]]s, which can cross Neptune's orbit due to their 2:3 [[orbital resonance|resonance]] with the planet, the classical objects have [[apsis|perihelia]] further from the Sun, free from Neptune's [[Perturbation (astronomy)|perturbation]].<ref name=\"jewitt\" /> Such objects have relatively low eccentricities (''e'' below 0.2) and orbit the Sun in much the same way the planets do. Makemake, however, is a member of the \"dynamically hot\" class of classical KBOs, meaning that it has a high inclination compared to others in its population.<ref name = \"Levison2003\"/> Makemake is, probably coincidentally, [[Orbital resonance#Coincidental 'near' ratios of mean motion|near]] the 13:7 resonance with Neptune.<ref>[http://www.orbitsimulator.com/yabbfiles/Attachments/Makemake40000y_13to7.gif The 2009-02-04 nominal (non-librating) rotating frame for Makemake.]</ref>\n\n== Physical characteristics ==\n\n=== Brightness, size, and rotation ===\n[[File:Makemake-LB1-2009Nov26-11UT.jpg|175px|thumb|left|Makemake ([[apparent magnitude]] 16.9) with edge on galaxy [https://in-the-sky.org/data/object.php?id=9128 IC 3587] ]]\n[[File:Quaoar Haumea Makemake orbits 2018.png|320px|thumb|Makemake's orbit outside of Neptune is similar to [[Haumea]]'s.

However, the occultation data was later reanalyzed,<ref name=Brown2013/> which led to the dimension estimate of {{nowrap|({{val|1434|48|-18}})&thinsp;\u00d7&thinsp;({{val|1420|18|-24}} km)}} without a pole-orientation constraint.<ref name=Brown2013/> Makemake was the fourth [[dwarf planet]] recognized, because it has a bright [[Photometric system|V-band]] [[absolute magnitude]] of \u22120.2.<ref name=jpldata/> Makemake has a high geometrical albedo of {{val|0.81|+0.01|-0.02}}.<ref name=Brown2013/>\n\nThe rotation period of Makemake is estimated at 22.83 hours.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/> A rotation period of 7.77 hours published in 2009<ref name=Heinze2009/> later turned out to be an [[Aliasing|alias]] of the actual rotation period. The possibility of this had been mentioned in the 2009 study, and the data from that study agrees well with the 22.83 hour period.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/> This rotation period is relatively long for a dwarf planet. Part of this may be due to [[tidal acceleration]] from Makemake's satellite. It has been suggested that a second large, undiscovered satellite might better explain the dwarf planet's unusually long rotation.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/>\n\nMakemake's lightcurve amplitude is small, only 0.03 ''mag''.<ref name=Brown2013/><ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/> This was thought to be due to Makemake currently being viewed pole on from Earth; however, S/2015 (136472) 1's orbital plane (which is probably orbiting with little inclination relative to Makemake's equator due to tides resulting from its rapid rotation) is edge-on from Earth, implying that Makemake is really being viewed equator-on.<ref name=\"planetary.org\"/>\n\n{{TNO imagemap}}\n\n=== Spectra and surface ===\n[[File:Makemake New Horizons.gif|thumb|310px|Makemake, indicated with red bars, as imaged by the ''[[New Horizons (spacecraft)|New Horizons]]'' spacecraft in October 2007.]]\nLike Pluto, Makemake appears red in the visible spectrum, and significantly redder than the surface of Eris (see [[trans-Neptunian object#Colors|colour comparison of TNOs]]).<ref name=\"atmosphere\" /> The near-infrared spectrum is marked by the presence of the broad [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>) [[absorption band]]s. Methane is observed also on Pluto and Eris, but its spectral signature is much weaker.<ref name=\"atmosphere\"/>\n\nSpectral analysis of Makemake's surface revealed that methane must be present in the form of large grains at least one centimetre in size.<ref name=\"brown\" /> In addition to methane, large amounts of [[ethane]] and [[tholin]]s as well as smaller amounts of [[ethylene]], [[acetylene]] and high-mass [[alkane]]s (like [[propane]]) may be present, most likely created by [[Photodissociation|photolysis]] of methane by solar radiation.<ref name=\"brown\" /><ref name=\"brown2015\"/> The tholins are probably responsible for the red color of the visible spectrum. Although evidence exists for the presence of [[solid nitrogen|nitrogen ice]] on its surface, at least mixed with other ices, there is nowhere near the same level of [[nitrogen]] as on Pluto and [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], where it composes more than 98&nbsp;percent of the crust. The relative lack of nitrogen ice suggests that its supply of nitrogen has somehow been depleted over the age of the Solar System.<ref name=\"brown\" /><ref name=\"Tegler2008\"/><ref name=Owen1993/>\n\nThe [[Far infrared|far-infrared]] (24\u201370&nbsp;\u03bcm) and [[Submillimetre astronomy|submillimeter]] (70\u2013500&nbsp;\u03bcm) photometry performed by Spitzer and Herschel telescopes revealed that the surface of Makemake is not homogeneous. Although the majority of it is covered by nitrogen and methane ices, where the albedo ranges from 78 to 90%, there are small patches of dark terrain whose albedo is only 2 to 12%, and that make up 3 to 7% of the surface.<ref name=\"Lim2010\" /> These studies were made before S/2015&nbsp;(136472) 1 was discovered; thus, these small dark patches may actually have been the dark surface of the satellite rather than any actual surface features on Makemake.<ref name=\"planetary.org\"/> However, some experiments have refuted these studies. Spectroscopic studies, collected from 2005 to 2008 using the William Herschel Telescope (La Palma, Spain) were analyzed together with other spectra in the literature, as of 2014. They show some degree of variation in the spectral slope, which would be associated with different abundance of the complex organic materials, byproduct of the irradiation of the ices present on the surface of Makemake. However, the relative ratio of the two dominant icy species, methane and nitrogen, remains quite stable on the surface revealing a low degree of inhomogeneity in the ice component.<ref name=\"Lorenzi2015\"/> These results have been recently confirmed when the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo acquired new visible and near infra-red spectra for Makemake, between 2006 and 2013, that covered nearly 80% of its surface; this study found that the variation in the spectra were negligible, suggesting that Makemake's surface may indeed be homogenous.<ref name=\"Perna2017\"/> Based on optical observations conducted between 2006 and 2017, Hromakina ''et al.'' concluded that Makemake's lightcurve was likely due to heterogeneities across its surface, but that the variations (of the order of 3%) were too small to have been detected spectroscopically.<ref name=\"Hromakina2019\"/>\n\n=== Atmosphere ===\nMakemake was expected to have an [[atmosphere]] similar to that of [[Pluto]] but with a lower surface pressure. However, on 23 April 2011 Makemake [[Occultation#Occultations by asteroids|passed in front]] of an 18th-magnitude star and abruptly blocked its light.<ref name=\"Occultation\"/> The results showed that Makemake presently lacks a substantial atmosphere and placed an upper limit of 4\u201312 [[nanobar]] on the pressure at its surface.<ref name=Ortiz2012/>\n\nThe presence of methane and possibly nitrogen suggests that Makemake could have a transient [[atmosphere]] similar to that of Pluto near its [[apsis|perihelion]].<ref name=\"atmosphere\"/> Nitrogen, if present, will be the dominant component of it.<ref name=\"brown\"/> The existence of an atmosphere also provides a natural explanation for the nitrogen depletion: because the gravity of Makemake is weaker than that of Pluto, Eris and Triton, a large amount of nitrogen was probably lost via [[atmospheric escape]]; methane is lighter than nitrogen, but has significantly lower vapor pressure at temperatures prevalent at the surface of Makemake (32\u201336&nbsp;K),<ref name=Ortiz2012/> which hinders its escape; the result of this process is a higher relative abundance of methane.<ref name=\"Schaller2007\"/> However, studies of Pluto's atmosphere by ''[[New Horizons]]'' suggest that methane, not nitrogen, is the dominant escaping gas, suggesting that the reasons for Makemake's absence of nitrogen may be more complicated.<ref name=\"Keeter2016\"/><ref name=\"Beatty2017\"/>\n\n== Satellite ==\n{{main|S/2015 (136472) 1}}\n\nMakemake has a single known moon, which was discovered in 2015 or 2016.<!--discovery images from 2015, announced 2016--> It is probably less than 200 km in diameter.<ref name=\"ParkerA2016\"/>\n\n==Exploration==\nIt has been calculated that a flyby mission to Makemake could take just over 16 years using a Jupiter [[gravity assist]], based on a launch date of 21 August 2024 or 24 August 2036.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Mako|2010|p=45}}</ref> The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\">{{harvnb|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref> The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}:'The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|2006|p=19}}.</ref> Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref> and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'.

The First Arab-Khazar War began during the first phase of [[Muslim conquests|Muslim expansion]]. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they launched their first raid across the Caucasus under [[Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah]]. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, [[Balanjar]], but were [[Battle of Balanjar (650s)|defeated]], suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari|al-Tabari]], both sides in the battle used [[catapult]]s against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as [[List of Khazar rulers|Irbis]] and describe him as a scion of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as is whether he can be identified with one of the many G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk rulers of the same name.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the [[First Fitna|First Muslim Civil War]] and other priorities, the Arabs refrained from repeating an attack on the Khazars until the early 8th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Mako|2010|p=45}}</ref> The Khazars launched a few raids into Transcaucasian principalities under Muslim dominion, including a large-scale raid in 683\u2013685 during the [[Second Fitna|Second Muslim Civil War]] that rendered much booty and many prisoners.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\">{{harvnb|Brook|2010|pp=126\u2013127}}</ref> There is evidence from the account of al-Tabari that the Khazars formed a united front with the remnants of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks in Transoxiana.\n\n[[File:Map of the Caucasus, 740 CE.svg|thumb|300px|{{center|Caucasus region, c. 740}}]]\n\nThe Second Arab-Khazar War began with a series of raids across the Caucasus in the early 8th century. The Umayyads tightened their grip on Armenia in 705 after suppressing a large-scale rebellion. In 713 or 714, Umayyad general [[Maslamah ibn Abd al-Malik|Maslamah]] conquered Derbent and drove deeper into Khazar territory. The Khazars launched raids in response into [[Caucasian Albania|Albania]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]] but were driven back by the Arabs under [[Hasan ibn al-Nu'man]].<ref>{{harvnb|Brook|2010|p=127}}</ref> The conflict escalated in 722 with an invasion by 30,000 Khazars into Armenia inflicting a crushing defeat. Caliph [[Yazid II]] responded, sending 25,000 Arab troops north, swiftly driving the Khazars back across the Caucasus, recovering Derbent, and advancing on Balanjar. The Arabs [[Battle of Balanjar (723)|broke through the Khazar defence]] and stormed the city; most of its inhabitants were killed or enslaved, but a few managed to flee north.<ref name=\"Brook 2010 126\u20137\"/> Despite their success, the Arabs had not yet defeated the Khazar army, and they retreated south of the Caucasus.\n\nIn 724, Arab general [[al-Jarrah ibn Abdallah al-Hakami]] inflicted a crushing defeat on the Khazars in a long battle between the rivers [[Cyrus (river)|Cyrus]] and [[Araxes]], then moved on to capture [[Tiflis]], bringing [[Caucasian Iberia]] under Muslim suzerainty. The Khazars struck back in 726, led by a prince named [[Barjik]], launching a major invasion of Albania and Azerbaijan; by 729, the Arabs had lost control of northeastern Transcaucasia and were thrust again into the defensive. In 730, Barjik invaded Iranian Azerbaijan and [[Battle of Ardabil|defeated]] Arab forces at [[Ardabil]], killing the general [[al-Djarrah al-Hakami]] and briefly occupying the town. Barjik was defeated and killed the next year at [[Mosul]], where he directed Khazar forces from a throne mounted with al-Djarrah's severed head {{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. In 737, Marwan Ibn Muhammad entered Khazar territory under the guise of seeking a truce. He then launched a surprise attack in which The Qaghan fled north and the Khazars surrendered.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Arabs did not have resources to influence affairs of Transcaucasia.{{sfn|Golden|1980|p=64}} The Qa\u011fan was forced to accept terms involving conversion to Islam, and to subject himself to the Caliphate, but the accommodation was short-lived as a combination of internal instability among the Umayyads and Byzantine support undid the agreement within three years, and the Khazars re-asserted their independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Wasserstein|2007|pp=375\u2013376}}</ref> The suggestion that the Khazars adopted [[Judaism]] as early as 740 is based on the idea that, in part, it was, a re-assertion of independence with regard to both Byzantium and the Caliphate, while conforming to a general Eurasian trend to embrace a world religion.<ref>{{harvnb|Beckwith|2009|p=149}}:'The Khazars, the close allies of the Byzantines, adopted Judaism, as their official religion, apparently by 740, three years after an invasion by the Arabs under Marwan ibn Muhammad. Marwan had used treachery against a Khazar envoy to gain peaceful entrance to Khazar territory. He then declared his dishonourable intentions and pressed deep into Khazar territory, only subsequently releasing the envoy. The Arabs devastated the horse herds, seized many Khazars and others as captives, and forced much of the population to flee into the Ural Mountains. Marwan\u2019s terms were that the kaghan and his Khazars should convert to Islam. Having no choice, the kaghan agreed, and the Arabs returned home in triumph. As soon as the Arabs were gone, the kaghan renounced Islam \u2013 with, one may assume, great vehemence. The Khazar Dynasty\u2019s conversion to Judaism is best explained by this specific historical background, together with the fact that the mid-eighth century was an age in  which the major Eurasian states proclaimed their adherence to distinctive world religions. Adopting Judaism also was politically astute: it meant the Khazars avoided having to accept the overlordship (jhowever theoretical) of the Arab caliph or the Byzantine emperor.'</ref>\n\nWhatever the impact of Marwan's campaigns, warfare between the Khazars and the Arabs ceased for more than two decades after 737. Arab raids continued until 741, but their control in the region was limited as maintaining a large garrison at Derbent further depleted the already overstretched army. A [[Third Fitna|third Muslim civil war]] soon broke out, leading to the Abbasid Revolution and the fall of the Umayyad dynasty in 750.\n\nIn 758, the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[al-Mansur]] attempted to strengthen diplomatic ties with the Khazars, ordering [[Yazid ibn Usayd al-Sulami]], one of his nobles and the [[Ostikanate of Arminiya|military governor of Armenia]], to take a royal Khazar bride. Yazid married a daughter of Khazar Khagan [[Baghatur]], but she died inexplicably, possibly in childbirth. Her attendants returned home, convinced that some Arab faction had poisoned her, and her father was enraged. Khazar general [[Ras Tarkhan]] invaded south of the Caucasus in 762\u2013764, devastating Albania, Armenia, and Iberia, and capturing Tiflis. Thereafter relations became increasingly cordial between the Khazars and the Abbasids, whose foreign policies were generally less expansionist than the Umayyads, broken only by a series of raids in 799 over another failed marriage alliance.\n\n===Rise of the Rus' and the collapse of the Khazarian state===\n[[File:Varangian routes.png|thumb|300px|Trade routes of the Black Sea region, 8th\u201311th centuries]]\n\nBy the 9th century, groups of [[Varangians|Varangian Rus']], developing a powerful warrior-merchant system, began probing south down the waterways controlled by the Khazars and their protectorate, the [[Volga Bulgaria]]ns, partially in pursuit of the Arab silver that flowed north for hoarding through the Khazarian-Volga Bulgarian trading zones,{{efn|group=note|Over 520 separate hoards of such silver have been uncovered in Sweden and [[Gotland]].{{sfn|Moss|2002|p=16}}}} partially to trade in furs and ironwork.{{efn|group=note|The Volga Bulgarian state was converted to Islam in the 10th century, and wrested liberty from its Khazarian suzerains when [[Sviatoslav I of Kiev|Svyatislav]] razed Atil.{{sfn|Abulafia|1987|pp=419, 480\u2013483}}}} Northern mercantile fleets passing Atil were tithed, as they were at Byzantine [[Cherson (theme)|Cherson]].<ref>{{harvnb|Shepard|2006|p=19}}.</ref> Their presence may have prompted the formation of a Rus' state by convincing the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]], [[Volga Finns|Merja]] and the [[Chud]]' to unite to protect common interests against Khazarian exactions of tribute.

Something of its nature may be deduced from what we know of the rites and beliefs of contiguous tribes, such as the North Caucasian Huns. [[Horse sacrifice]]s were made to this supreme deity. Rites involved offerings to fire, water, and the moon, to remarkable creatures, and to \"gods of the road\" (cf. Old T\u00fcrk ''yol tengri'', perhaps a god of fortune). Sun amulets were widespread as cultic ornaments. A tree cult was also maintained. Whatever was struck by lightning, man or object, was considered a sacrifice to the high god of heaven. The afterlife, to judge from excavations of aristocratic tumuli, was much a continuation of life on earth, warriors being interred with their weapons, horses, and sometimes with human sacrifices: the funeral of one ''tudrun'' in 711-12 saw 300 soldiers killed to accompany him to the otherworld. [[Ancestor worship]] was observed. The key religious figure appears to have been a [[shamanism|shaman]]-like ''qam'',<ref>{{harvnb|Golden|2007|pp=131\u2013133}}</ref> and it was these (''qozm\u00edm'') that were, according to the Khazar Hebrew conversion stories, driven out.\n\nMany sources suggest, and a notable number of scholars have argued, that the charismatic \u0100sh\u01d0n\u00e0 clan played a germinal role in the early Khazar state, although Zuckerman dismisses the widespread notion of their pivotal role as a 'phantom'.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

He was self-educated and became a lawyer, [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] leader, [[Illinois]] state [[Illinois House of Representatives|legislator]], and U.S. Congressman [[List of United States Representatives from Illinois|from Illinois]]. In 1849 he returned to his law practice but became vexed by the opening of additional lands to [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] as a result of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]]. He reentered politics in 1854, becoming a leader in the new [[history of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and he reached a national audience in the [[Lincoln\u2013Douglas debates|1858 debates]] against [[Stephen Douglas]]. Lincoln ran for President in 1860, sweeping the [[Northern United States|North]] in victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South equated his success with the North's rejection of their right to practice slavery, and southern states began [[Secession|seceding from the union]]. To secure its independence, the new [[Confederate States of America]] fired on [[Fort Sumter]], a U.S. fort in the South, and Lincoln called up forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].\n\nAs the leader of moderate Republicans, Lincoln stood in the center of the factions with friends and opponents on both sides. [[War Democrats]] rallied a large faction of former opponents into his moderate camp, but they were countered by [[Radical Republican]]s, who demanded harsh treatment of the Southern traitors. Anti-war Democrats (called [[Copperhead (politics)|\"Copperheads\"]]) despised him. There were irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements who plotted his assassination. Lincoln managed the factions by pitting them against each other, by carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people.<ref name=\"Randall1947\" />{{rp|65\u201387}} His [[Gettysburg Address]] became a historic clarion call for [[nationalism]], [[republicanism]], [[Civil and political rights|equal rights]], [[liberty]], and [[democracy]]. Lincoln scrutinized the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals and the [[Union blockade|naval blockade]] of the South's trade. He suspended ''[[habeas corpus]]'', and he averted British intervention by defusing the [[Trent Affair|''Trent'' Affair]]. He engineered the end to slavery with his [[Emancipation Proclamation]] and his order that the Army protect escaped slaves. He also encouraged [[Border States (American Civil War)|border states]] to outlaw slavery, and promoted the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which outlawed slavery across the country.\n\nLincoln managed his own successful [[1864 United States presidential election|re-election campaign]]. He sought to reconcile the war-torn nation by exonerating the secessionists. On April 14, 1865, just days after the war's end at [[Battle of Appomattox Court House|Appomattox]], he was enjoying a night at the theatre with his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln|Mary]] when [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln|he was assassinated]] by Confederate sympathizer [[John Wilkes Booth]]. Lincoln's marriage had produced four sons, two of whom preceded him in death, with severe emotional impact upon him and Mary.

He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as [[commander-in-chief]] by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended ''habeas corpus'', and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers.

Payne wrote in 1999 that the term \"rape myth\" does not imply that a given scenario ''never'' occurs, and \"it is clear that any individual instance might conform to the characteristics described in cultural male mythology,\" since there is \"undeniably some percentage of women\" who have made false reports of rape, and there are \"certain situational or personal characteristics that differentiate women who have been raped from those who have not.\" They argue, however, that rape myths are \"generally false\" in nature, and function to deny and justify the victimization of women.<ref name=\"irma1999\">{{cite journal |title=Rape Myth Acceptance: Exploration of Its Structure and Its Measurement Using the ''Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale'' |first1=Diana L. |last1=Payne |first2=Kimberly A. |last2=Lonsway |first3=Louise F. |last3=Fitzgerald |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume= 33 |issue=1 |date=March 1999 |pages=27\u201368 |doi=10.1006/jrpe.1998.2238|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0815388f3263ea1b4eaf7facb5e23defdb80bbcc }}</ref> \n\n=== Heteronormative discourses ===\n[[Heteronormativity]] and associated discourses undergird and perpetuate many rape myths.

Disabled people are desexualized and hypersexualized at the same time which they both work against the person. People living with disabilities are viewed on a binary scale as they are seen as all or nothing. If they are seen as capable, they are always seen as capable and if you are seen as incapable they are always denied sex. Therefore the law needs to think in a situational way as people with disabilities have different levels of capabilities, \u201cLegally, it may cause us to miss the multifaceted ways in which people with mental disabilities resist or object to sexual assault and also to assume that compliance represents consent rather than acquiescence in the face of coercion or exploitative inducements\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Benedet |first1=Janine |last2=Grant |first2=Isabel |title=Sexual Assault and the Meaning of Power and Authority for Women with Mental Disabilities |journal=Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014 |date=4 July 2014 |pages=131-154}}</ref>. The view that they are asexual or hypersexual creates the idea that they cannot be victims of sexual violence, labeling them as an unrapable group. This myth is further articulated within the Benedet and Grant article, they discuss a prominent rape myth that labels people of disabilities to be \u201clucky\u201d to get any male attention, including coerced and nonconsensual sex. Any sex, however coercive, is construed as better than no sex which was illustrated by Chenoweth\n\n=== Transgender Rape Myths ===\nAs trans-gender people challenge dominant gender norms, this often leaves them in a place of marginalization. Transgender people are the most likely to face violence and backlash as people perceive them as inherently deceptive as they are said to be concealing their \u201ctrue sex\u201d. This is a very transphobic assumption that rationalizes the violence against trans people (mainly trans women) and the criminalization of trans people (mainly trans men). \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schilt |first1=Kristen |last2=Westbrook |first2=Lauren |title=DOING GENDER, DOING HETERONORMATIVITY |journal=GENDER & SOCIETY |date=August 4, 2009 |volume=23 |pages=440-464}}</ref>\n\n\u201cPenis Panic\u201d emerges in the discourse surrounding gender-neutral washrooms, due to the belief that men (and their penis) have a \u201cpropensity to rape\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Laurel|last2=Schilt|first2=Kristen|date=2014|title=Doing gender, determining gender: Transgender people, gender panics, and the maintenance of the sex/gender/sexuality system|url=|journal=Gender and Society|volume=Vol 28, No. 1|pages=32 - 57|via=}}</ref>. Therefore transgender women are portrayed, due to their penis, as a threat to women if they share the same washroom. Susan Brownmiller explores the biological determinism that defines rape due to the structural differences in men versus women <ref>{{Cite book|last=Cahill|first=Ann|title=Rethinking Rape|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Ithaca|pages=21}}</ref> This myth is furthered by the idea that allowing transgender people to use the restroom that aligns with their perceived gender will end up allowing male sexual predators into women\u2019s bathrooms. \n\nAnother common myth is the belief that no one wants to sexually assault a transgender person due to their identity. But that is not true, as transgender folks tend to be more vulnerable they could be more at risk to face sexual violence, especially as a form of hate crime. A common misconception is that sexual assault is primarily about sexual attraction, but rather it is about the dynamics of power and control over another person.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Foundation |first1=LGBT |title=A guide for trans people who have been affected by sexual violence |url=https://www.gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Guide-for-trans-people-affected-by-sexual-violence-1.pdf |website=lgbt.foundation/counselling |publisher=LGBT Foundation |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Rape Myths in the Prison System ===\nActions such as strip searches, body-cavity searches, and non-consensual medical interventions within the prison system are not violent acts is a common myth. Looking at similar actions occurring outside the prison shows nothing less than sexual assault as these acts lack consent, often have present resistance, and can have traumatizing effects <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref>. And like many acts of sexual violence, these types of searches are also a form of exerting control over another individual.\n\nIt is believed that some prisoners have brought sexual abuse on themselves or deserve the violence they face through the crime they committed that landed them in prison, i.e. sex offenders or child molesters<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferranti |first1=Seth |title=Why Are So Many Sex Offenders Getting Murdered in California's Prisons? |url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ppmjy8/why-sex-offenders-are-getting-slaughtered-in-california-prisons-218 |website=VICE |publisher=VICE |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. But that is not true, no one deserves to be a victim of sexual violence. The prison systems have normalized sexual violence through staff interactions (abuse of power, strip searches, body cavity searches, and other nonconsensual acts), as well as ignored the violence occurring between the inmates <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakefield |first1=Jonny |title=Alberta prisoners made 67 allegations of sexual assault in the last five fiscal years; Only one resulted in a criminal charge |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/insight/violent-and-coercive-sexual-assault-behind-bars-is-a-taboo-topic-but-statistics-tell-only-part-of-the-story/ |website=Edmonton Journal |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. The normalization of sexual violence within prisons allows the system and power dynamics to be upheld. In situations where sexual violence becomes normalized, it desensitizes people to the issue, creating the belief that prisoners will come out more criminal. The negative effects to the normalization of sexual violence in prisons do not stop there, it allows many allegations to go unnoticed, leaving many victims without prosecution and the issue to not be viewed as a systemic problem <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakefield |first1=Jonny |title=Alberta prisoners made 67 allegations of sexual assault in the last five fiscal years; Only one resulted in a criminal charge |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/insight/violent-and-coercive-sexual-assault-behind-bars-is-a-taboo-topic-but-statistics-tell-only-part-of-the-story/ |website=Edmonton Journal |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>..  \n\nThe Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) helps to ensure prisoner's safety against sexual violence by, \u201climiting circumstances where prisoners experience touching, viewing, or other manipulation of their genitals, anus, buttocks, or breasts against their will\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref>.  Although this is not the case, as it rather punishes consensual interactions amongst the prisoners, resulting in the deeper issue of homophobia. Or it goes in the other direction of reducing sexual assault into consensual acts. PREA leaves many non-consensual acts virtually unregulated which go against its intended purpose.\n\nThe evil perpetrator / innocent victim dyad commonly found within the prison systems idea of sexual assault reduces violence to an individual act that occurs between two people. The prison systems, however, creates sexual violence as a \u201cgroup-based phenomenon that does group-based harm\u201d, which typically results in the reinforcement of hierarchies, fear amongst certain groups, and this belief that not all people deserve to have control over their bodies <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref>.\n\n=== Racial rape myths ===\nScholars have argued that [[racism]] remains a critical component of sexual violence discourse within the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arkles|first=Gabriel|date=2015|title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence|url=|journal=Northeastern University Law Journal|volume=Vol. 7, No. 1|pages=71 - 130|via=}}</ref> Alcoff and Gray state that white victims who report they were raped by non-white perpetrators are more likely to be believed than non-white victims who report white perpetrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alcoff|first=Linda|last2=Gray|first2=Laura|date=Winter 1993|title=Survivor Discourse: Transgression or Recuperation?|url=|journal=Signs|volume=Vol 18, No. 2|pages=260 - 290|via=}}</ref> Not only are non-white bodies seen as not rapable, but non-white men are seen as sexually deviant, violent, and dangerous.

The 2015 book ''Asking for It''&nbsp;by [[Kate Harding]] talks about common rape myths and about the differences between male and female rapes. One in five women and one in seventy-one men in the United States will find out what it's like to be raped, according to Harding. She writes, \"Women are no more important than any other potential victims, but we are the primary targets of the messages and myths that sustain rape culture. Anyone can be raped, but men aren't conditioned to live in terror of it, nor are they constantly warned that their clothing, travel choices, alcohol consumption, and expressions of sexuality are likely to bring violations upon them.\"<ref name=\"Harding\">{{Cite book |title=Asking for It |last=Harding |first=Kate |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-7382-1702-4 |location=Philadelphia |pages=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSuch stereotypes reduce the inclination of victims to report instances of rape, harassment, and assault. This reduced reporting of crimes might present a rosy picture and would further the problem, by leading to beliefs that these crimes that are reported are fake, false, or unlikely to be true.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn ''Asking for It'', Harding writes of rape that \"we tend not to treat it as a serious crime unless there's simultaneously evidence of another one\".<ref name=\"Harding\"/>{{rp|11}}  The author also quotes psychologist [[David Lisak]]. He says that \"Ultimately, only a tiny handful of rapists ever serve time for rape, a shocking outcome given that we view rape as close kin to murder in the taxonomy of violent crime\".<ref name=\"Harding\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\n=== Twin myths ===\nThe ''twin myths'' suggest that a victim\u2019s previous sexual history i) makes them less believable, and/or ii) more likely to consent. Canadian law does allow for the inclusion of previous sexual history, but defence counsel must present a s.276 application and a hearing is held to ensure the evidence will not be used in the context of the twin myths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://certificate.queenslaw.ca/blog/the-supreme-court-sexual-assault-and-twin-myths|title=The Supreme Court, Sexual Assault and \"Twin Myths\"|last=Rawson|first=Kate|date=2019|website=Queen's Certificate in Law Blog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n==Rape myth acceptance==\n===Measures===\nIn 1980, Martha R. Burt introduced the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (RMA, or RMAS).<ref name=\"Martha Burt\"/><ref name=hb>{{cite book |first=Carole A. |last=Beere |title=Sex and Gender Issues: A Handbook of Tests and Measures |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |url= https://archive.org/details/sexand_bee_1990_00_5030 |url-access=registration |via=Internet Archive |page=[https://archive.org/details/sexand_bee_1990_00_5030/page/400 400]|isbn=9780313274626 |year=1990 }}</ref> The scale was the first method for measuring an individual's level of belief in rape myths, and became the most widely used.<ref name=\"irma1999\"/> Using Burt's method, rape myth acceptance is measured by asking subjects 19 questions. The first 10 questions each consist of a statement which suggests that rape victims are responsible for their own rape, and ask the subject to assess its truthfulness, rating each statement on a seven-point scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" The 11th statement tests for the inverse of this idea, asking whether or not it is true that any woman can be raped. The remaining questions ask test subjects to guess the proportion of reported rapes that are false, and assess whether they are more or less likely to believe a rape victim based on the victim's personal characteristics (for example, their gender, their race or ethnicity, their age, or their relationship to the test subject).<ref name=\"hb\"/>\n\nBurt's original study concluded that many Americans believed in rape myths. More than half of the individuals sampled in her original survey had agreed that \"a woman who goes to the home or apartment of a man\" on the first date \"implies she is willing to have sex,\" and that in the majority of rapes \"the victim was promiscuous or had a bad reputation.\" More than half of Burt's respondents had suggested 50% or more of reported rapes were reported \"only because the woman was trying to get back at a man\" or \"trying to cover up an illegitimate pregnancy.\"<ref name=\"Martha Burt\"/>\n\nAnother measure is the 45-item Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA), developed by Diana L. Payne, Kimberly A. Lonsway, and Louise F. Fitzgerald in 1999.<ref name=\"irma1999\">{{cite journal |title=Rape Myth Acceptance: Exploration of Its Structure and Its Measurement Using the ''Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale'' |first1=Diana L. |last1=Payne |first2=Kimberly A. |last2=Lonsway |first3=Louise F. |last3=Fitzgerald |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume= 33 |issue=1 |date=March 1999 |pages=27\u201368 |doi=10.1006/jrpe.1998.2238|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0815388f3263ea1b4eaf7facb5e23defdb80bbcc }}</ref> They concluded that \"rape myth acceptance is most adequately conceptualized as consisting of both a general component and seven distinct myth components: ''She asked for it; It wasn\u2019t really rape; He didn\u2019t mean to; She really wanted it; She lied; Rape is a trivial event;'' and ''Rape is a deviant event''\"<ref name=\"irma1999\"/>\n\nThe developers of IRMA analyzed responses to a pool of 95 statements about rape to create their scale.<ref name=\"irma1999\" />\n\nBased on the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale, the Chinese Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (CRMA) is a culturally-specific myth scale that measures acceptance of rape myths in Chinese society. The scale operates under a culturally-adapted definition of rape, specifically, in China the legal definition of rape makes no provision for marital rape and does not apply to male victims. Additionally, the definition excludes \u201ctypes of coercive sexual behavior, such as other forms of penetrative sex, including oral sex, anal sex, and penetrations of the vagina or anus by other body parts like fingers or other objects.\u201d The CRMA retains 25 of 45 items from the IRMA scale and produces a five-factor structure. These myth component factors are: rape victims want to be raped; rape allegations are often false; rape must involve violence; victims are responsible for being raped; and, the motivation to rape is understandable.<ref>Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.

Disabled people are desexualized and hypersexualized at the same time which they both work against the person. People living with disabilities are viewed on a binary scale as they are seen as all or nothing. If they are seen as capable, they are always seen as capable and if you are seen as incapable they are always denied sex. Therefore the law needs to think in a situational way as people with disabilities have different levels of capabilities, \u201cLegally, it may cause us to miss the multifaceted ways in which people with mental disabilities resist or object to sexual assault and also to assume that compliance represents consent rather than acquiescence in the face of coercion or exploitative inducements\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Benedet |first1=Janine |last2=Grant |first2=Isabel |title=Sexual Assault and the Meaning of Power and Authority for Women with Mental Disabilities |journal=Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2014 |date=4 July 2014 |pages=131-154}}</ref>. The view that they are asexual or hypersexual creates the idea that they cannot be victims of sexual violence, labeling them as an unrapable group. This myth is further articulated within the Benedet and Grant article, they discuss a prominent rape myth that labels people of disabilities to be \u201clucky\u201d to get any male attention, including coerced and nonconsensual sex. Any sex, however coercive, is construed as better than no sex which was illustrated by Chenoweth\n\n=== Transgender Rape Myths ===\nAs trans-gender people challenge dominant gender norms, this often leaves them in a place of marginalization. Transgender people are the most likely to face violence and backlash as people perceive them as inherently deceptive as they are said to be concealing their \u201ctrue sex\u201d. This is a very transphobic assumption that rationalizes the violence against trans people (mainly trans women) and the criminalization of trans people (mainly trans men). \n<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schilt |first1=Kristen |last2=Westbrook |first2=Lauren |title=DOING GENDER, DOING HETERONORMATIVITY |journal=GENDER & SOCIETY |date=August 4, 2009 |volume=23 |pages=440-464}}</ref>\n\n\u201cPenis Panic\u201d emerges in the discourse surrounding gender-neutral washrooms, due to the belief that men (and their penis) have a \u201cpropensity to rape\u201d <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Westbrook|first=Laurel|last2=Schilt|first2=Kristen|date=2014|title=Doing gender, determining gender: Transgender people, gender panics, and the maintenance of the sex/gender/sexuality system|url=|journal=Gender and Society|volume=Vol 28, No. 1|pages=32 - 57|via=}}</ref> . Therefore transgender women are portrayed, due to their penis, as a threat to women if they share the same washroom. Susan Brownmiller explores the biological determinism that defines rape due to the structural differences in men versus women (<ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Cahill|first=Ann|title=Rethinking Rape|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Ithaca|pages=21}}</ref> This myth is furthered by the idea that allowing transgender people to use the restroom that aligns with their perceived gender will end up allowing male sexual predators into women\u2019s bathrooms. \n\nAnother common myth is the belief that no one wants to sexually assault a transgender person due to their identity. But that is not true, as transgender folks tend to be more vulnerable they could be more at risk to face sexual violence, especially as a form of hate crime. A common misconception is that sexual assault is primarily about sexual attraction, but rather it is about the dynamics of power and control over another person.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Foundation |first1=LGBT |title=A guide for trans people who have been affected by sexual violence |url=https://www.gendergp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Guide-for-trans-people-affected-by-sexual-violence-1.pdf |website=lgbt.foundation/counselling |publisher=LGBT Foundation |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Rape Myths in the Prison System ===\nActions such as strip searches, body-cavity searches, and non-consensual medical interventions within the prison system are not violent acts is a common myth. Looking at similar actions occurring outside the prison shows nothing less than sexual assault as these acts lack consent, often have present resistance, and can have traumatizing effects <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref>. And like many acts of sexual violence, these types of searches are also a form of exerting control over another individual.\n\nIt is believed that some prisoners have brought sexual abuse on themselves or deserve the violence they face through the crime they committed that landed them in prison, i.e. sex offenders or child molesters<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferranti |first1=Seth |title=Why Are So Many Sex Offenders Getting Murdered in California's Prisons? |url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/article/ppmjy8/why-sex-offenders-are-getting-slaughtered-in-california-prisons-218 |website=VICE |publisher=VICE |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. But that is not true, no one deserves to be a victim of sexual violence. The prison systems have normalized sexual violence through staff interactions (abuse of power, strip searches, body cavity searches, and other nonconsensual acts), as well as ignored the violence occurring between the inmates <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref> <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakefield |first1=Jonny |title=Alberta prisoners made 67 allegations of sexual assault in the last five fiscal years; Only one resulted in a criminal charge |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/insight/violent-and-coercive-sexual-assault-behind-bars-is-a-taboo-topic-but-statistics-tell-only-part-of-the-story/ |website=Edmonton Journal |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>. The normalization of sexual violence within prisons allows the system and power dynamics to be upheld. In situations where sexual violence becomes normalized, it desensitizes people to the issue, creating the belief that prisoners will come out more criminal. The negative effects to the normalization of sexual violence in prisons do not stop there, it allows many allegations to go unnoticed, leaving many victims without prosecution and the issue to not be viewed as a systemic problem <ref>{{cite web |last1=Wakefield |first1=Jonny |title=Alberta prisoners made 67 allegations of sexual assault in the last five fiscal years; Only one resulted in a criminal charge |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/insight/violent-and-coercive-sexual-assault-behind-bars-is-a-taboo-topic-but-statistics-tell-only-part-of-the-story/ |website=Edmonton Journal |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>..  \n\nThe Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) helps to ensure prisoner's safety against sexual violence by, \u201climiting circumstances where prisoners experience touching, viewing, or other manipulation of their genitals, anus, buttocks, or breasts against their will\u201d <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref>.  Although this is not the case, as it rather punishes consensual interactions amongst the prisoners, resulting in the deeper issue of homophobia. Or it goes in the other direction of reducing sexual assault into consensual acts. PREA leaves many non-consensual acts virtually unregulated which go against its intended purpose.\n\nThe evil perpetrator / innocent victim dyad commonly found within the prison systems idea of sexual assault reduces violence to an individual act that occurs between two people. The prison systems, however, creates sexual violence as a \u201cgroup-based phenomenon that does group-based harm\u201d, which typically results in the reinforcement of hierarchies, fear amongst certain groups, and this belief that not all people deserve to have control over their bodies <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arkles |first1=Gabriel |title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence |journal=Northeastern University Law Journal |date=2015 |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=71-130}}</ref></ref>.\n\n=== Racial rape myths ===\nScholars have argued that [[racism]] remains a critical component of sexual violence discourse within the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Arkles|first=Gabriel|date=2015|title=Regulating Prison Sexual Violence|url=|journal=Northeastern University Law Journal|volume=Vol. 7, No. 1|pages=71 - 130|via=}}</ref> Alcoff and Gray state that white victims who report they were raped by non-white perpetrators are more likely to be believed than non-white victims who report white perpetrators.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alcoff|first=Linda|last2=Gray|first2=Laura|date=Winter 1993|title=Survivor Discourse: Transgression or Recuperation?|url=|journal=Signs|volume=Vol 18, No. 2|pages=260 - 290|via=}}</ref> Not only are non-white bodies seen as not rapable, but non-white men are seen as sexually deviant, violent, and dangerous.

The 2015 book ''Asking for It''&nbsp;by [[Kate Harding]] talks about common rape myths and about the differences between male and female rapes. One in five women and one in seventy-one men in the United States will find out what it's like to be raped, according to Harding. She writes, \"Women are no more important than any other potential victims, but we are the primary targets of the messages and myths that sustain rape culture. Anyone can be raped, but men aren't conditioned to live in terror of it, nor are they constantly warned that their clothing, travel choices, alcohol consumption, and expressions of sexuality are likely to bring violations upon them.\"<ref name=\"Harding\">{{Cite book |title=Asking for It |last=Harding |first=Kate |publisher=Da Capo Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-0-7382-1702-4 |location=Philadelphia |pages=}}</ref>{{rp|19}}\n\nSuch stereotypes reduce the inclination of victims to report instances of rape, harassment, and assault. This reduced reporting of crimes might present a rosy picture and would further the problem, by leading to beliefs that these crimes that are reported are fake, false, or unlikely to be true.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn ''Asking for It'', Harding writes of rape that \"we tend not to treat it as a serious crime unless there's simultaneously evidence of another one\".<ref name=\"Harding\"/>{{rp|11}}  The author also quotes psychologist [[David Lisak]]. He says that \"Ultimately, only a tiny handful of rapists ever serve time for rape, a shocking outcome given that we view rape as close kin to murder in the taxonomy of violent crime\".<ref name=\"Harding\"/>{{rp|11}}\n\n=== Twin myths ===\nThe ''twin myths'' suggest that a victim\u2019s previous sexual history i) makes them less believable, and/or ii) more likely to consent. Canadian law does allow for the inclusion of previous sexual history, but defence counsel must present a s.276 application and a hearing is held to ensure the evidence will not be used in the context of the twin myths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://certificate.queenslaw.ca/blog/the-supreme-court-sexual-assault-and-twin-myths|title=The Supreme Court, Sexual Assault and \"Twin Myths\"|last=Rawson|first=Kate|date=2019|website=Queen's Certificate in Law Blog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> \n\n==Rape myth acceptance==\n===Measures===\nIn 1980, Martha R.

The first 10 questions each consist of a statement which suggests that rape victims are responsible for their own rape, and ask the subject to assess its truthfulness, rating each statement on a seven-point scale from \"strongly agree\" to \"strongly disagree.\" The 11th statement tests for the inverse of this idea, asking whether or not it is true that any woman can be raped. The remaining questions ask test subjects to guess the proportion of reported rapes that are false, and assess whether they are more or less likely to believe a rape victim based on the victim's personal characteristics (for example, their gender, their race or ethnicity, their age, or their relationship to the test subject).<ref name=\"hb\"/>\n\nBurt's original study concluded that many Americans believed in rape myths. More than half of the individuals sampled in her original survey had agreed that \"a woman who goes to the home or apartment of a man\" on the first date \"implies she is willing to have sex,\" and that in the majority of rapes \"the victim was promiscuous or had a bad reputation.\" More than half of Burt's respondents had suggested 50% or more of reported rapes were reported \"only because the woman was trying to get back at a man\" or \"trying to cover up an illegitimate pregnancy.\"<ref name=\"Martha Burt\"/>\n\nAnother measure is the 45-item Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (IRMA), developed by Diana L. Payne, Kimberly A. Lonsway, and Louise F. Fitzgerald in 1999.<ref name=\"irma1999\">{{cite journal |title=Rape Myth Acceptance: Exploration of Its Structure and Its Measurement Using the ''Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale'' |first1=Diana L. |last1=Payne |first2=Kimberly A. |last2=Lonsway |first3=Louise F. |last3=Fitzgerald |journal=Journal of Research in Personality |volume= 33 |issue=1 |date=March 1999 |pages=27\u201368 |doi=10.1006/jrpe.1998.2238|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0815388f3263ea1b4eaf7facb5e23defdb80bbcc }}</ref> They concluded that \"rape myth acceptance is most adequately conceptualized as consisting of both a general component and seven distinct myth components: ''She asked for it; It wasn\u2019t really rape; He didn\u2019t mean to; She really wanted it; She lied; Rape is a trivial event;'' and ''Rape is a deviant event''\"<ref name=\"irma1999\"/>\n\nThe developers of IRMA analyzed responses to a pool of 95 statements about rape to create their scale.<ref name=\"irma1999\" />\n\nBased on the Illinois Rape Myth Acceptance Scale, the Chinese Rape Myth Acceptance Scale (CRMA) is a culturally-specific myth scale that measures acceptance of rape myths in Chinese society. The scale operates under a culturally-adapted definition of rape, specifically, in China the legal definition of rape makes no provision for marital rape and does not apply to male victims. Additionally, the definition excludes \u201ctypes of coercive sexual behavior, such as other forms of penetrative sex, including oral sex, anal sex, and penetrations of the vagina or anus by other body parts like fingers or other objects.\u201d The CRMA retains 25 of 45 items from the IRMA scale and produces a five-factor structure. These myth component factors are: rape victims want to be raped; rape allegations are often false; rape must involve violence; victims are responsible for being raped; and, the motivation to rape is understandable.<ref>Xue J, Fang G, Huang H, Cui N, Rhodes KV, Gelles R.
