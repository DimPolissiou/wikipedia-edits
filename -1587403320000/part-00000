One-hundred and eleven protesters were arrested, 53 of whom were arrested inside the church. The main objective of the demonstration was to protest O'Connor's opposition to the teaching of safe sex in the public school system, and his opposition to the distribution of condoms to curb the spread of AIDS.<ref name=\"ZsIZP\" />  During planning, the planned protest was joined by [[Women's Health Action and Mobilization]] (WHAM!), who opposed the Catholic position on [[abortion rights]].\n\nThe protest was widely discussed, including being condemned by media outlets and national figures such as President [[George H.W.

During the late 1930s he quickly advanced from regimental to division command and upon the outbreak of [[Operation Barbarossa]] commanded a rifle division in Belarus. Mavrichev and his division were encircled in the first weeks of the war, and he spent several months making his way back to Soviet lines. He never held another combat command and spent the rest of the war in army and front staff positions. Postwar, he served as chief of officer training courses and retired in 1951.\n\n== Early life and Russian Civil War ==\nMavrichev was born to a peasant family on 21 July 1901 in the village of Bolshoye Novoye, Vakhnovsky volost, [[Cherepovetsky Uyezd]], [[Novgorod Governorate]], and graduated from the village school in 1913. Drafted into the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] on 6 March 1919, he was sent to the 103rd Brigade of the [[35th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|35th Rifle Division]] in [[Kazan]]. As a telephonist of a rifle regiment of the brigade, he fought on the [[Eastern Front (RSFSR)|Eastern Front]] against the forces of [[Alexander Kolchak]]. Mavrichev became chief of communications of the engineering and construction units of the [[5th Army (RSFSR)|5th Army]] in April 1920 and from September of that year studied at the infantry department of the Siberian Higher Military School. He became a [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] member during the same year. Upon graduation in April 1922, Mavrichev became a company commander of the 62nd Rifle Regiment of the People's Revolutionary Army of the satellite [[Far Eastern Republic]].{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2015|p=|pp=664\u2013666}}{{Sfn|Bulkin|2018|p=|pp=359\u2013360}}\n\n== Interwar period ==\nAfter the end of the war, Mavrichev briefly served as assistant chief of the [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] Escort Detachment of the [[Internal Troops|GPU Troops]] from December 1922, in January 1923 was appointed chief of the [[Blagoveshchensk]] Escort Detachment of the Amur Governorate Border Detachment of the GPU Troops.

Transferred to the [[Belorussian Military District]] in August 1937 to serve as commander of the 14th Rifle Regiment of the [[5th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|5th Rifle Division]]. Mavrichev took command of the [[33rd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|33rd Rifle Division]] in July 1938 and then the newly formed [[121st Rifle Division]] in August 1939. Promoted to ''[[kombrig]]'' on 4 November 1939, he was transferred back to the Siberian Military District in February 1940 to serve as chief of the Urechensk Infantry Commanders' Improvement Courses for reservists, but returned to Belarus in March 1941 to command the [[108th Rifle Division]] of the [[44th Rifle Corps]] of the [[Western Special Military District]] (the former Belorussian Special Military District).{{Sfn|Bulkin|2018|p=|pp=359\u2013360}} Mavrichev was made a [[major general]] when the Red Army reintroduced generals' ranks on 4 June 1940.{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2015|p=|pp=664\u2013666}}\n\n== World War II ==\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941, the division departed from summer camp at [[Dorogobuzh]] to the Ratomka camp {{convert|40|km|miles}} west of [[Minsk]]. On 25 June, it arrived at the latter, utilizing the defenses of the [[Stalin Line|Minsk Fortified Region]]. The [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] command requisitioned the division's anti-tank artillery, twelve machine guns from each regiment, and detached one of the rifle regiments. For the next six days the division fought as part of the [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Army]] against the German advance, being encircled from 28 June. On 1 July, Mavrichev and the remnants of the division left the encirclement with a group led by [[3rd Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Army]] commander General [[Vasily Kuznetsov (general)|Vasily Kuznetsov]], heading towards [[Rogachev]] and [[Bykhov]]. In mid-August there were only 45 personnel left with the group, which was surrounded and scattered by German troops in the area of Dedovo on 15 August. Mavrichev managed to escape with six others and joined the partisan detachment led by former [[64th Rifle Division]] commander Colonel [[Sergey Iovlev]]. With the latter, he reached Soviet lines on 26 September in the sector of the [[29th Army (Soviet Union)|29th Army]] near [[Bely, Tver Oblast|Bely]].{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2015|pp=664\u2013666}}\n\nPlaced at the disposal of the staff of the Western Front and the Main Personnel Directorate, Mavrichev was appointed chief of the combat training department of the [[60th Army (Soviet Union)|60th]] (later the [[3rd Shock Army|3rd Shock]]) Army in late November 1941 and in this position participated in fighting on the [[Northwestern Front]]. In April 1942 he was transferred to hold the same position for the [[53rd Army (Soviet Union)|53rd Army]] and from May served as chief of staff of the rear directorate of the Northwestern Front, holding the latter position until August 1944, when he became chief of the trophy directorate of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]], responsible for captured equipment.

He returned to army units in the mid-1920s and held battalion commands in the late 1920s and 1930s. During the late 1930s he quickly advanced from regimental to division command and upon the outbreak of [[Operation Barbarossa]] commanded a rifle division in Belarus. Mavrichev and his division were encircled in the first weeks of the war, and he spent several months making his way back to Soviet lines. He never held another combat command and spent the rest of the war in army and front staff positions. Postwar, he served as chief of officer training courses and retired in 1951.\n\n== Early life and Russian Civil War ==\nMavrichev was born to a peasant family on 21 July 1901 in the village of Bolshoye Novoye, Vakhnovsky volost, [[Cherepovetsky Uyezd]], [[Novgorod Governorate]], and graduated from the village school in 1913. Drafted into the [[Red Army]] during the [[Russian Civil War]] on 6 March 1919, he was sent to the 103rd Brigade of the [[35th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|35th Rifle Division]] in [[Kazan]]. As a telephonist of a rifle regiment of the brigade, he fought on the [[Eastern Front (RSFSR)|Eastern Front]] against the forces of [[Alexander Kolchak]]. Mavrichev became chief of communications of the engineering and construction units of the [[5th Army (RSFSR)|5th Army]] in April 1920 and from September of that year studied at the infantry department of the Siberian Higher Military School. He became a [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] member during the same year. Upon graduation in April 1922, Mavrichev became a company commander of the 62nd Rifle Regiment of the People's Revolutionary Army of the satellite [[Far Eastern Republic]].{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2015|p=|pp=664\u2013666}}{{Sfn|Bulkin|2018|p=|pp=359\u2013360}}\n\n== Interwar period ==\nAfter the end of the war, Mavrichev briefly served as assistant chief of the [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] Escort Detachment of the [[Internal Troops|GPU Troops]] from December 1922, in January 1923 was appointed chief of the [[Blagoveshchensk]] Escort Detachment of the Amur Governorate Border Detachment of the GPU Troops. From May of that year he served as chief and then assistant chief of the 32nd Blagoveshchensk Cavalry School of the GPU Troops of the Far Eastern District, and in December returned to army units to become a company commander of the 62nd Novorossiysk Rifle Regiment, now part of the [[21st Rifle Division]] of the [[Siberian Military District]]. Transferred to the Tomsk Infantry School to serve as a company commander in September 1924, Mavrichev entered the Siberian Advanced Commanders' Courses in October 1926 and after completing them in August 1927 returned to his previous position at the Tomsk Infantry School.{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2015|p=|pp=664\u2013666}}{{Sfn|Bulkin|2018|p=|pp=359\u2013360}}\n\nAfter commanding a battalion of the 34th Rifle Regiment of the [[12th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|12th Rifle Division]] of the same district from July 1928, Mavrichev served with the district staff from May 1931 as assistant chief of the 5th department (combat training). He became a battalion commander at the Omsk Infantry School in June 1932 before graduating from the [[Vystrel course]] in 1935. Transferred to the [[Belorussian Military District]] in August 1937 to serve as commander of the 14th Rifle Regiment of the [[5th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|5th Rifle Division]]. Mavrichev took command of the [[33rd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|33rd Rifle Division]] in July 1938 and then the newly formed [[121st Rifle Division]] in August 1939. Promoted to ''[[kombrig]]'' on 4 November 1939, he was transferred back to the Siberian Military District in February 1940 to serve as chief of the Urechensk Infantry Commanders' Improvement Courses for reservists, but returned to Belarus in March 1941 to command the [[108th Rifle Division]] of the [[44th Rifle Corps]] of the [[Western Special Military District]] (the former Belorussian Special Military District).{{Sfn|Bulkin|2018|p=|pp=359\u2013360}} Mavrichev was made a [[major general]] when the Red Army reintroduced generals' ranks on 4 June 1940.{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2015|p=|pp=664\u2013666}}\n\n== World War II ==\nWhen [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941, the division departed from summer camp at [[Dorogobuzh]] to the Ratomka camp 40 kilometers west of [[Minsk]]. On 25 June, it arrived at the latter, utilizing the defenses of the [[Stalin Line|Minsk Fortified Region]]. The [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|Western Front]] command requisitioned the division's anti-tank artillery, twelve machine guns from each regiment, and detached one of the rifle regiments. For the next six days the division fought as part of the [[13th Army (Soviet Union)|13th Army]] against the German advance, being encircled from 28 June. On 1 July, Mavrichev and the remnants of the division left the encirclement with a group led by [[3rd Army (Soviet Union)|3rd Army]] commander General [[Vasily Kuznetsov (general)|Vasily Kuznetsov]], heading towards [[Rogachev]] and [[Bykhov]]. In mid-August there were only 45 personnel left with group, which was surrounded and scattered by German troops in the area of Dedovo on 15 August. Mavrichev managed to escape with six other and joined the partisan detachment led by former [[64th Rifle Division]] commander Colonel [[Sergey Iovlev]]. With the latter, he reached Soviet lines on 26 September in the sector of the [[29th Army (Soviet Union)|29th Army]] near [[Bely, Tver Oblast|Bely]].{{Sfn|Tsapayev|Goremykin|2015|p=|pp=664\u2013666}}\n\nPlaced at the disposal of the staff of the Western Front and the Main Personnel Directorate, Mavrichev was appointed chief of the combat training department of the [[60th Army (Soviet Union)|60th]] (later the [[3rd Shock Army|3rd Shock]]) Army in late November 1941 and in this position participated in fighting on the [[Northwestern Front]]. In April 1942 he was transferred to hold the same position for the [[53rd Army (Soviet Union)|53rd Army]] and from May served as chief of staff of the rear directorate of the Northwestern Front, holding the latter position until August 1944, when he became chief of the trophy directorate of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]], responsible for captured equipment.

In the [[5th millennium BC]]E, the stone circles at [[Nabta Playa]] may have made use of astronomical alignments. By the time the historical [[Ancient Egypt|Dynastic Period]] began in the [[3rd millennium BC]]E, the 365-day period of the [[Egyptian calendar]] was already in use, and the observation of [[star]]s was importantining the annual flooding of the [[Nile]].\n\nThe [[Egyptian pyramids]] were carefully aligned towards the [[pole star]], and the temple of [[Amun|Amun-Re]] at [[Karnak]] was aligned on the rising of the [[winter solstice|midwinter]] Sun. [[Astronomy]] played a considerable part in fixing the dates of [[religious festival]]s and determining the hours of night, and temple [[astrology|astrologers]] were especially adept at watching the stars and observing the [[conjunction (astronomy)|conjunctions]] and risings of the [[Sun]], [[Moon]], and [[planet]]s, as well as the [[lunar phase]]s.\n\n[[File:Goddess Nut 1.JPG|thumb|Nut, Egyptian goddess of the sky, with the star chart in the tomb of Ramses VI]]\n\nIn [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]], the Egyptian tradition merged with [[Greek astronomy]] and [[Babylonian astronomy]], with the city of [[Alexandria]] in [[Lower Egypt]] becoming the centre of scientific activity across the [[Hellenistic world]]. [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman Egypt]] produced the greatest astronomer of the era, [[Ptolemy]] (90\u2013168 CE). His works on astronomy, including the [[Almagest]], became the most influential books in the history of Western astronomy. Following the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the region came to be [[Egypt in the Middle Ages|dominated by Arabic culture]] and [[astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]].\n\nThe astronomer [[Ibn Yunus]] (c. 950\u20131009) observed the [[position of the Sun|Sun's position]] for many years using a large [[astrolabe]], and his observations on [[eclipse]]s were still used centuries later. In 1006, [[Ali ibn Ridwan]] observed the [[SN 1006]], a [[supernova]] regarded as the brightest stellar event in [[recorded history]], and left the most detailed description of it. In the 14th century, Najm al-Din al-Misri wrote a treatise describing over 100 different types of scientific and astronomical instruments, many of which he invented himself.  \n\n== Ancient Egypt ==\n[[File:Nabta.gif|right|thumb|Plan of a stone circle at Nabta, Egypt]]\nEgyptian astronomy begins in prehistoric times. The presence of [[stone circles]] at [[Nabta Playa]] in [[Upper Egypt]] dating from the [[5th millennium BCE]] show the importance of [[astronomy]] to the religious life of [[ancient Egypt]] even in the prehistoric period. The annual [[flooding of the Nile]] meant that the [[heliacal risings]], or first visible appearances of [[star]]s at [[dawn]], were of special interest in determining when this might occur, and it is no surprise that the 365-day period of the [[Egyptian calendar]] was already in use at the beginning of [[History of ancient Egypt|Egyptian history]]. The [[constellation]] system used among the [[Egyptians]] also appears to have been essentially of native origin.\n\nThe precise orientation of the [[Egyptian pyramid]]s serves as a lasting demonstration of the high degree of technical skill in watching the heavens attained in the [[3rd millennium BCE]]. It has been shown the pyramids were aligned towards the [[pole star]], which, because of the [[precession of the equinoxes]], was at that time [[Thuban]], a faint star in the constellation of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].<ref>Ruggles, C.L.N.

On the different days of the year each hour was determined by a fixed star [[culmination|culminating]] or nearly culminating in it, and the position of these stars at the time is given in the tables as in the centre, on the left eye, on the right shoulder, etc. According to the texts, in founding or rebuilding temples the north axis was determined by the same apparatus, and we may conclude that it was the usual one for astronomical observations.

The city of [[Alexandria]] in [[Lower Egypt]] became the centre of scientific activity throughout the [[Hellenistic civilization]]. The greatest Alexandrian astronomer of this era was the Greek, [[Eratosthenes]] (c. 276\u2013195 BCE), who calculated the size of the [[Earth]], providing an estimate for the circumference of the Earth.\n\nFollowing the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest of Egypt]], the region once again became the centre of scientific activity throughout the [[Roman Empire]]. The greatest astronomer of this era was the [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] Egyptian, [[Ptolemy]] (90\u2013168 CE). Originating from the [[Thebaid]] region of [[Upper Egypt]], he worked at Alexandria and wrote works on astronomy including the ''[[Almagest]]'', the ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and the ''[[Tetrabiblos]]'', as well as the ''Handy Tables'', the ''Canobic Inscription'', and other minor works. The ''Almagest'' is one of the most influential books in the history of Western astronomy. In this book, Ptolemy explained how to predict the behavior of the planets with the introduction of a new mathematical tool, the [[equant]].\n\nA few mathematicians of [[late Antiquity]] wrote commentaries on the ''Almagest'', including [[Pappus of Alexandria]] as well as [[Theon of Alexandria]] and his daughter [[Hypatia]]. Ptolemaic astronomy became standard in medieval western European and [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Islamic astronomy]] until it was displaced by [[Maragheh observatory|Maraghan]], [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] and [[Tychonic system]]s by the 16th century.\n\n== Arabic-Islamic Egypt ==\n{{See also|Astronomy in medieval Islam}}\n\nFollowing the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]], the region came to be [[History of Arab Egypt|dominated by Arabic culture]].

The presence of [[stone circles]] at [[Nabta Playa]] in [[Upper Egypt]] dating from the [[5th millennium BCE]] show the importance of [[astronomy]] to the religious life of [[ancient Egypt]] even in the prehistoric period. The annual [[flooding of the Nile]] meant that the [[heliacal risings]], or first visible appearances of [[star]]s at [[dawn]], were of special interest in determining when this might occur, and it is no surprise that the 365-day period of the [[Egyptian calendar]] was already in use at the beginning of [[History of ancient Egypt|Egyptian history]]. The [[constellation]] system used among the [[Egyptians]] also appears to have been essentially of native origin.\n\nThe precise orientation of the [[Egyptian pyramid]]s serves as a lasting demonstration of the high degree of technical skill in watching the heavens attained in the [[3rd millennium BCE]]. It has been shown the pyramids were aligned towards the [[pole star]], which, because of the [[precession of the equinoxes]], was at that time [[Thuban]], a faint star in the constellation of [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].<ref>Ruggles, C.L.N.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019.

An [[equinox]] in astronomy is that point in time (not a whole day) when the Sun is directly above the Earth's equator, occurring around March 20 and September 23 each year. In most cultures, the [[equinox]]es and [[solstice]]s are considered to start or separate the [[season]]s.\n\n[[John McConnell (peace activist)|John McConnell]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.earthsite.org |title=EarthSite |accessdate=April 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422193041/http://www.earthsite.org/ |archive-date=April 22, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> first introduced the idea of a global holiday called \"Earth Day\" at the 1969 [[UNESCO]] Conference on the Environment. The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.

This initiative is being developed in association with dozens of major partners in the science and health communities as well as leading technology companies.\n* Advocacy: The time is now to mobilize and take action to save our planet. Earth Day will amplify direct links between technological innovation and inclusive climate prosperity, two signature themes we will be emphasizing around the world as we build towards the 50th Anniversary of Earth Day in 2020. Earth Day is creating millions of avenues for civic engagement in all 190 countries around the world and working with global decision-makers, including policy makers, local, regional and national governments and corporate sector leaders, to reach a diverse network of citizens around the world.\n* Volunteering: Earth Day is engaging volunteers across the globe for a month-long worldwide volunteer-driven program, \u201cThe Great Global Cleanup\u201d and starting with cleanups for Earth Day 2019. We expect 100 million people participating in public events, as well as one billion others \u2014 including K-12 students around the world \u2014 to remove billions of pieces of trash from our neighborhoods, beaches, and parks.

The first Earth Day [[proclamation]] was issued by [[San Francisco]] Mayor [[Joseph Alioto]] on March 21, 1970. Celebrations were held in various cities, such as San Francisco and in Davis, California with a multi-day street party. UN Secretary-General [[U Thant]] supported McConnell's global initiative to celebrate this annual event; and on February 26, 1971, he signed a proclamation to that effect, saying:\n<blockquote>May there be only peaceful and cheerful Earth Days to come for our beautiful [[Spaceship Earth]] as it continues to spin and circle in frigid space with its warm and fragile cargo of animate life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/cyberschoolbus/earthday/peacebell_2004.asp |title=Earth Day 2004 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nUnited Nations secretary-general [[Kurt Waldheim]] observed Earth Day with similar ceremonies on the March equinox in 1972, and the United Nations Earth Day ceremony has continued each year since on the day of the March equinox (the United Nations also works with organizers of the April 22 global event). [[Margaret Mead]] added her support for the equinox Earth Day, and in 1978 declared:\n<blockquote>Earth Day is the first holy day which transcends all national borders, yet preserves all geographical integrities, spans mountains and oceans and time belts, and yet brings people all over the world into one resonating accord, is devoted to the preservation of the harmony in nature and yet draws upon the triumphs of technology, the measurement of time, and instantaneous communication through space.<br />\nEarth Day draws on astronomical phenomena in a new way \u2013 which is also the most ancient way \u2013 by using the vernal Equinox, the time when the Sun crosses the equator making the length of night and day equal in all parts of the Earth. To this point in the annual calendar, EARTH DAY attaches no local or divisive set of symbols, no statement of the truth or superiority of one way of life over another. But the selection of the March Equinox makes planetary observance of a shared event possible, and a flag which shows the Earth, as seen from space, appropriate.<ref>Margaret Mead, \"Earth Day,\" EPA Journal, March 1978.</ref></blockquote>\nAt the moment of the equinox, it is traditional to observe Earth Day by ringing the [[Japanese Peace Bell]], which was donated by Japan to the United Nations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/pubs/cyberschoolbus/untour/subjap.htm |title=Japanese Peace Bell |publisher=UN.org |accessdate=April 22, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928182232/http://www.un.org/Pubs/CyberSchoolBus/untour/subjap.htm |archivedate=September 28, 2013  }}</ref> Over the years, celebrations have occurred in various places worldwide at the same time as the UN celebration.
