Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of record or record-equalling passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 99-day passage in 1854, making her one of a very small number of sailing ships ever to complete the passage in under 100 days. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including a record 1855 passage that stood for many years. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.

Reputedly the most extreme clipper ever built, ''Hurricane'' proved a very fast vessel, reportedly capable of speeds of up to {{convert|18|kn|mph km/h}} in ideal conditions, and establishing a number of record or record-equalling passages in the early years of her career. \n\n''Hurricane'' made a total of four [[New York City|New York]]-to-[[San Francisco]] voyages while under the American flag, the fastest of which was an outstanding 99-day passage in 1854, making her one of a very small number of sailing ships ever to complete the passage in under 100 days. After arriving at San Francisco, the ship would usually continue on to China or [[Hong Kong]] before returning via San Francisco to New York. She also made several voyages between England and India during this period, including a record 1855 passage that stood for many years. \n\nDue partly to [[Panic of 1857|an economic depression]] in the United States, ''Hurricane'' was laid up for about a year at New York in 1857&ndash;58. In late 1858, she sailed via San Francisco for [[Singapore]], where in 1860 she was sold to British interests. Renamed ''Shaw-Allum'', little is known about her subsequent career. Her last entry in shipping registers was in 1876. \n\n== Construction and design ==\n\n''Hurricane'', an extreme clipper, was built in Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1851 by [[Isaac C.

Featuring American rapper [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], it was released by [[Island Records]] on February 8, 2011 as the [[lead single]] from the album. \"On the Floor\" was written by [[Kinnda|Kinnda \"Kee\" Hamid]], [[AJ Junior]], Teddy Sky, [[Bilal Hajji|Bilal \"The Chef\" Hajji]], Pitbull, [[Los Kjarkas|Gonzalo Hermosa, Ulises Hermosa]], along with the song's producer [[RedOne]]. It is an up-tempo [[electro-house]] and [[dance-pop]] song with a [[common time]] [[tempo]] of 130 beats per minute. \"On the Floor\" incorporates elements of [[electro house]] and draws further musical influences from [[eurodance]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and [[techno music]]. Lopez recorded a Spanish-language version of the song titled \"'''Ven a Bailar'''\" ({{lang-en|\"Come to Dance\"}}), which includes additional lyrical contributions from Julio Reyes Copello and [[Jimena Romero]].\n\nIts development was motivated by Lopez's Latin heritage and pays homage to her career-beginnings as a dancer. [[interpolation (music)#In modern music|Interpolated]] within the song are recurrent elements of the 1982 Bolivian composition \"[[Llorando se fue]]\" written by Gonzalo and Ulises Hermosa, a composition that gained notoriety when it was sampled by [[Kaoma]] in their 1989 single \"[[Lambada (song)|Lambada]]\". Lopez described \"On the Floor\" as an evolution of her classic sound and as something which sounded very current. The debut and release of \"On the Floor\" coincided with Lopez's appointment as a judge on the [[American Idol (season 10)|tenth season]] of US reality TV show ''[[American Idol]],'' as well as several other product endorsement deals. ''American Idol'' also provided a platform to debut the single's [[music video]], as well as the stage for Lopez's first live performance of the song.\n\nEditors from [[BBC Online|BBC Music]] and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' drew comparisons to Lopez's debut single, \"[[If You Had My Love]]\" (1999) and follow-up single \"[[Waiting for Tonight]]\" (1999). In the United States, it was Lopez's first single in four years to garner airplay, and has sold 3.8 million copies, earning a triple platinum [[List of music recording certifications|certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It was ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the eleventh-biggest hit of 2011 on the year-end [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. \"On the Floor\" finished in first in Austria, Finland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and other countries.\n\nA [[music video]] was directed by TAJ Stansberry and choreographed by Frank Gatson, Jr, with fans being given the chance to vote for their preferred ending for the video. The completed clip premiered simultaneously on [[Vevo]] and during the March 3, 2011 episode of ''American Idol''. It depicts a [[Los Angeles]] underground club culture where Lopez portrays a \"queen of the nightclub\", among other characters. The video received critical acclaim for its lavish production, the styling and choreography, that critics felt best highlighted Lopez's abilities as a dancer.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = When asked by MTV News, \"What was it like working with Lopez?\", RedOne replied: \"Let's face it: With J.Lo, you have to go big or go home\". He said that to make a song that sounded right for Lopez he would need \"dance, parties and her Latina heritage\". Consequently the duo came up with \"On the Floor\" which also features a rap from Pitbull. Commenting on the studio process, RedOne said, \"She's a dancer. She can sing. I was really amazed, and I had so much fun working with her, her energy and everything about her is a star, and it was natural for me to do what we did.\n:\u2014[[MTV News]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1656277/jennifer-lopezs-on-floor-will-be-big-one-producer-redone-predicts.jhtml |title=Jennifer Lopez's 'On The Floor' Will Be 'A Big One,' Producer RedOne Predicts |last=Vena |first=Jocelyn |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=January 24, 2011 |publisher=MTV News ([[MTV Networks]])}}</ref>\n| width  = 25em\n| align  = right\n| quoted = 1\n}}\n\nLopez's seventh studio album ''[[Love?

Featuring American rapper [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], it was released by [[Island Records]] on February 8, 2011 as the [[lead single]] from the album. \"On the Floor\" was written by [[Kinnda|Kinnda \"Kee\" Hamid]], [[AJ Junior]], Teddy Sky, [[Bilal Hajji|Bilal \"The Chef\" Hajji]], Pitbull, [[Los Kjarkas|Gonzalo Hermosa, Ulises Hermosa]], along with the song's producer [[RedOne]]. It is an up-tempo [[electro-house]] and [[dance-pop]] song with a [[common time]] [[tempo]] of 130 beats per minute. \"On the Floor\" incorporates elements of [[electro house]] and draws further musical influences from [[eurodance]], [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]] and [[techno music]]. Lopez recorded a Spanish-language version of the song titled \"'''Ven a Bailar'''\" ({{lang-en|\"Come to Dance\"}}), which includes additional lyrical contributions from Julio Reyes Copello and [[Jimena Romero]].\n\nIts development was motivated by Lopez's Latin heritage and pays homage to her career-beginnings as a dancer. [[interpolation (music)#In modern music|Interpolated]] within the song are recurrent elements of the 1982 Bolivian composition \"[[Llorando se fue]]\" written by Gonzalo and Ulises Hermosa, a composition that gained notoriety when it was sampled by [[Kaoma]] in their 1989 single \"[[Lambada (song)|Lambada]]\". Lopez described \"On the Floor\" as an evolution of her classic sound and as something which sounded very current. The debut and release of \"On the Floor\" coincided with Lopez's appointment as a judge on the [[American Idol (season 10)|tenth season]] of US reality TV show ''[[American Idol]],'' as well as several other product endorsement deals. ''American Idol'' also provided a platform to debut the single's [[music video]], as well as the stage for Lopez's first live performance of the song.\n\nEditors from [[BBC Online|BBC Music]] and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' drew comparisons to Lopez's debut single, \"[[If You Had My Love]]\" (1999) and follow-up single \"[[Waiting for Tonight]]\" (1999). In the United States, it was Lopez's first single in four years to garner airplay, and has sold 3.8 million copies, earning a triple platinum [[List of music recording certifications|certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). It was ranked by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as the eleventh-biggest hit of 2011 on the year-end [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. \"On the Floor\" finished in first in Austria, Finland, Germany, Spain, Switzerland, and other countries.\n\nA [[music video]] was directed by TAJ Stansberry and choreographed by Frank Gatson, Jr, with fans being given the chance to vote for their preferred ending for the video. The completed clip premiered simultaneously on [[Vevo]] and during the March 3, 2011 episode of ''American Idol''. It depicts a [[Los Angeles]] underground club culture where Lopez portrays a \"queen of the nightclub\", among other characters. The video received critical acclaim for its lavish production, the styling and choreography, that critics felt best highlighted Lopez's abilities as a dancer.\n\n== Background ==\n{{Quote box\n| quote  = When asked by MTV News, \"What was it like working with Lopez?\", RedOne replied: \"Let's face it: With J.Lo, you have to go big or go home\". He said that to make a song that sounded right for Lopez he would need \"dance, parties and her Latina heritage\". Consequently the duo came up with \"On the Floor\" which also features a rap from Pitbull. Commenting on the studio process, RedOne said, \"She's a dancer. She can sing.
