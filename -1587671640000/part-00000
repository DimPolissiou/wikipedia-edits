This was one of the first games played in Indianapolis in 1895, as the city had \"opened\" the football season on the same day.  The Indianapolis Journal described the CAA team as a machine, and gave credit to Brown, Slater, Camp, Hadden and Coffeen for good runs.  Thompson made the first touchdown, followed by Brown, and then Camp, with Brown going 2 for 3 on PATs.  The ILA team had some minor disagreements with the referring, but overall claimed the CAA had great teamwork, and was well trained in interference (blocking and tackling).  <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/322142438/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 3 - The Indianapolis Journal at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/34194514/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=20 Oct 1895, Page 10 - The Inter Ocean at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/349849313/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=20 Oct 1895, 6 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n'''October 22nd-''' Mr. Mulliken, a man with past experience at Columbia and on the Crescent Athletic Club of Brooklyn, decides to join the Chicago AA eleven. CAA also began preparation for their journey to the east, and sent out the first roster of those going.  The initial list was, Stone and Thompson as Left Ends, Thomas Left Tackle, Ryan Left Guard, Stevenson Center, Bartl and Mulliken Right Guards, McCormick Right Tackle, Hadden Right End, Aldrich Quarterback, Coffeen, Blaney and Hoagland Right Half Backs, Slater Left Half Back, and Brown Full Back.  Camp would not attend the trip East due to ill health.  Another important event to note is the football teams of Rush Medical College and Lake Forest combining for the remainder of the 1895 season.  Rush would bolster the Lake Forest ranks, while also attempting Lake Forest's reportedly impossible schedule of [[1895 Northwestern Purple football team|Northwestern]], [[1895 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]], and [[1895 Illinois Fighting Illini football team|Illinois]], who at the time had a combined record of 9-3, with Michigan undefeated.  Lake Forest had also just come from contests between the likes of [[1895 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] and [[1895 Chicago Maroons football team|Chicago]], who had beaten them 52 to 0 and 26 to 5 respectively.  They had even lost to the minor team Amour, 6 to 0, and so when a merger was proposed between them and Rush, the agreement was made.  The two teams hoped to stand a better chance against the CAA as well when they play them this afternoon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspapers.com/image/349849690/?terms=Chicago+Athletic+Association+football|title=22 Oct 1895, 7 - Chicago Tribune at Newspapers.com|website=Newspapers.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>\n\n===October 22nd- CAA vs Rush-Lake Forest===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title=CAA vs Rush-Lake Forest\n|Visitor= Rush-lake Forest\n|Host= CAA\n|V1=0|V2=0\n|H1=18|H2=12\n|Date=October 22, 1895\n|Location= CAA Field, Chicago, IL\n|TimeZone=CT\n|StartTime= \n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (1st half 25 minutes, 2nd half 15 minutes)\n|Attendance= \n|Weather=\n|Referee= Hoagland\n|Umpire= Sager\n|Injured=\n|Linesmen= \n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nThe contest was yet another blowout for the semi-professionals, as Rush-Lake Forest suffered from injury, and CAA's FB Brown had a perfect 5 for 5 PAT streak, culminating in a 30 to 0 shellacking of the makeshift college team.  Thomas scores the first Touchdown, followed by Blaney twice to end the first half.  Blaney attained another touchdown at the beginning of the next half, with Thomas also scoring the last touchdown, and Brown rounding out the score to 30 with his impeccable kicking.  Although the score is large, one writer for The Inter Ocean newspaper claimed that CAA played horribly.  He asserted that \"if yesterday's showing is a test of the ability at the game, it [The Chicago AA team] would have to work hard to defeat the Yohokas Pigskin Pelters or any like organization.\"  In other news, the CAA would hold a practice with the Illinois Cycling Club this afternoon, the last practice before their trip east on October 24th at 10:30 A.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Shielding is typically applied to enclosures to isolate electrical devices from their surroundings, and to cables to isolate wires from the environment through which the cable runs. Electromagnetic shielding that blocks [[radio frequency]] (RF) [[electromagnetic radiation]] is also known as '''RF shielding'''.\n\nThe shielding can reduce the [[Coupling (electronics)|coupling]] of [[Radio frequency|radio waves]], electromagnetic fields, and [[electrostatic field]]s. A conductive enclosure used to block electrostatic fields is also known as a [[Faraday cage]]. The amount of reduction depends very much upon the material used, its thickness, the size of the shielded volume and the frequency of the fields of interest and the size, shape and orientation of apertures in a shield to an incident electromagnetic field.\n\n==Materials used==\nTypical materials used for electromagnetic shielding include [[sheet metal]], metal screen, and [[metal foam]]. Common sheet metals for shielding include copper, brass, nickel, silver, steel, and tin. Shielding effectiveness, that is how well a shield reflects or absorbs/suppresses electromagnetic radiation, is affected by the physical properties of the metal.\u00a0 These may include conductivity, solderability, permeability, thickness, and weight. A metal\u2019s properties are an important consideration in material selection. For example, electrically dominant waves are reflected by highly conductive metals like copper, silver, and brass, while magnetically dominant waves are absorbed/suppressed by a less conductive metal such as steel or stainless steel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ceptech.net/understanding-emi-rfi-shielding-to-manage-interference/|title=Understanding EMI/RFI Shielding to Manage Interference|website=Ceptech|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref> Further, any holes in the shield or mesh must be significantly smaller than the [[wavelength]] of the radiation that is being kept out, or the enclosure will not effectively approximate an unbroken conducting surface.\n\nAnother commonly used shielding method, especially with electronic goods housed in plastic enclosures, is to coat the inside of the enclosure with a metallic ink or similar material.  The ink consists of a carrier material loaded with a suitable metal, typically [[copper]] or [[nickel]], in the form of very small particulates.  It is sprayed on to the enclosure and, once dry, produces a continuous conductive layer of metal, which can be electrically connected to the [[chassis ground]] of the equipment, thus providing effective shielding.\n\nElectromagnetic shielding is the process of lowering the electromagnetic field in an area by barricading it with conductive or magnetic material. [[Copper in architecture#Radio frequency shielding|Copper is used for radio frequency (RF) shielding]] because it absorbs [[radio wave|radio]] and other [[electromagnetic wave]]s. Properly designed and constructed [[Copper in architecture#Radio frequency shielding|copper RF shielding]] enclosures satisfy most RF shielding needs, from computer and electrical switching rooms to hospital [[CAT-scan]] and [[MRI]] facilities.<ref>Seale, Wayne (2007).

As technology improves, so does the susceptibility to various types of nefarious electromagnetic interference. The idea of encasing a cable inside a grounded conductive barrier can provide mitigation to these risks. See [[Shielded cable|Shielded Cables]], and [[Electromagnetic interference]].\n\n== How it works ==\nElectromagnetic radiation consists of coupled [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields.  The electric field produces [[force]]s on the [[electric charge|charge]] carriers (i.e., [[electron]]s) within the conductor.  As soon as an electric field is applied to the surface of an ideal conductor, it induces a [[current (electricity)|current]] that causes displacement of charge inside the conductor that cancels the applied field inside, at which point the current stops. See [[Faraday cage#Operation|Faraday cage]] for more explanation.\n\nSimilarly, ''varying'' [[magnetic field]]s generate [[eddy current]]s that act to cancel the applied magnetic field.  (The conductor does not respond to static magnetic fields unless the conductor is moving relative to the magnetic field.)  The result is that [[electromagnetic radiation]] is reflected from the surface of the conductor: internal fields stay inside, and external fields stay outside.\n\nSeveral factors serve to limit the shielding capability of real RF shields. One is that, due to the [[electrical resistance]] of the conductor, the excited field does not completely cancel the incident field.  Also, most conductors exhibit a [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] response to low-frequency magnetic fields, so that such fields are not fully attenuated by the conductor.  Any holes in the shield force current to flow around them, so that fields passing through the holes do not excite opposing electromagnetic fields.  These effects reduce the field-reflecting capability of the shield.\n\nIn the case of high-[[frequency]] electromagnetic radiation, the above-mentioned adjustments take a non-negligible amount of time, yet any such radiation energy, as far as it is not reflected, is absorbed by the skin (unless it is extremely thin), so in this case there is no electromagnetic field inside either. This is one aspect of a greater phenomenon called the [[skin effect]]. A measure of the depth to which radiation can penetrate the shield is the so-called [[skin depth]].\n\n== Magnetic shielding ==\nEquipment sometimes requires isolation from external magnetic fields.  For static or slowly varying magnetic fields (below about 100&nbsp;kHz) the Faraday shielding described above is ineffective.  In these cases shields made of high [[magnetic permeability]] metal [[alloy]]s can be used, such as sheets of [[permalloy]] and [[mu-metal]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnetic-shield.com/literature/pdf/mu-2.pdf |title=MuMETAL |id=Catalog MU-2 |publisher=Magnetic Shield Corp. |date=2012 |accessdate=26 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=73410422&caseType=SERIAL_NO&searchType=statusSearch|title=Trademark Status & Document Retrieval|website=tsdr.uspto.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}</ref> or with nanocrystalline grain structure ferromagnetic metal coatings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/item/emcdirectory-design_2009/index.php#/134 |title=Interference Technology Magazine Whitepaper on Ferromagnetic Nanocrystalline Metal Magnetic Shield Coatings |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315010701/http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/item/emcdirectory-design_2009/index.php#/134 |archivedate=March 15, 2010 }}</ref>  These materials don't block the magnetic field, as with electric shielding, but rather draw the field into themselves, providing a path for the [[magnetic field lines]] around the shielded volume.  The best shape for magnetic shields is thus a closed container surrounding the shielded volume.  The effectiveness of this type of shielding depends on the material's permeability, which generally drops off at both very low magnetic field strengths and at high field strengths where the material becomes [[magnetic saturation|saturated]].  So to achieve low residual fields, magnetic shields often consist of several enclosures one inside the other, each of which successively reduces the field inside it.\n\nBecause of the above limitations of passive shielding, an alternative used with static or low-frequency fields is active shielding; using a field created by [[electromagnet]]s to cancel the ambient field within a volume.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acornnmr.com/appnotes/shielding.htm |title=NMR Magnet Shielding: The seat of the pants guide to understanding the problems of shielding NMR magnets |publisher=Acorn NMR |date=22 January 2003 |accessdate=27 June 2016}}</ref>  [[Solenoid]]s and [[Helmholtz coil]]s are types of coils that can be used for this purpose.\n\nAdditionally, [[superconductivity|superconducting]] materials can expel magnetic fields via the [[Meissner effect]].\n\n==Mathematical model==\n\nSuppose that we have a spherical shell of a (linear and isotropic) diamagnetic material with [[relative magnetic permeability|relative permeability]] <math>\\mu_\\text{r}</math>, with inner radius <math>a</math> and outer radius <math>b</math>.

To achieve stability at fast passenger train speeds (above 100 mph), articulation was not used. The S1 was completed on January 31, 1939, at Altoona shop, and was numbered 6100.\n\nAt {{convert|140|ft|2+1/2|in|m|2|abbr=on}} overall, engine and tender, the S1 was the longest reciprocating steam locomotive ever; it also had the heaviest tender (451,840lb / 205 tonnes), highest tractive effort ({{convert|76,403|lbf|kN|2|abbr=on}}) of a passenger steam engine when built and the largest drivers (84 inch diameter) ever used on a locomotive with more than three coupled axles. The problem of wheel slippage, along with a wheelbase that was too long for many of the rail line's curves, limited the S1's usefulness. No further S1 models were built as focus shifted to the much smaller but more practical class [[PRR T1|T1]] in June 1940. Design of the 4-4-4-4 T1 and the 6-4-4-6 S1 occurred concurrently, however, the S1 was the first produced.\n\n==Construction and historical background==\n[[Image:Locomotive Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The official publicity photo of PRR S1 6100 of 1939]]\n\nAs early as June 1936, the management of [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] decided to build a new passenger locomotive to replace its aging [[K4s]] locomotives. They also hoped that the new S1 steam locomotive would have a performance equal to their [[GG1]] electric engine and would be capable of hauling a 1,000-ton passenger train at 100 mph.<ref name=\"lionel\" /> A conference was held between Baldwin Locomotive Works officials and W. F. Kiesel, J. V. B. Duer and W. R. Elsey for PRR, where PRR demanded a passenger locomotive to haul 15 standard cars at 100 mph on level track between [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]] and Chicago. Baldwin presented several [[4-8-4]] and [[4-4-4-4]] designs made for other railroads. However, PRR rejected the 4-8-4 design in favor of a rigid frame [[Duplex locomotive|duplex]] and asked Baldwin to consider the wheel arrangement 4-4-6-4. In July 1936, PRR requested Baldwin Locomotive Works to submit a design for a 4-8-4 engine capable of handling a 2,000-ton train between Colehour and Harsimus Cove. \n\nTwo months after the conference, Baldwin Locomotive Works officials presented four designs to PRR:\n \n{{stack begin | clear=false | float=center}}\n<div class=\"NavFrame collapsed\">\n  <div class=\"NavHead\">Baldwin's proposals for Pennsylvania Railroad in 1936</div>\n  <div class=\"NavContent\">\n# '''a 4-4-4-4 passenger locomotive that could haul 1,200 tons but exceeded existing weight and clearance restrictions'''\n# '''a 4-4-4-6 passenger locomotive that could haul 1,200 tons but also exceeded limits'''\n# '''a 4-8-4 freight locomotive with the same weight on drivers as an M1a, which failed to meet the requirements for a 2,000-ton train'''\n# '''an articulated 4-6-6-4 locomotive'''</div>\n</div>\n{{stack end}}\n\nPRR preferred 4-4-4-4 and asked Baldwin to consider a passenger version with 80\" drivers and a freight version with 72\" drivers. However, the cooperation between PRR and Baldwin, which proceeded without signing any agreement or contract, for the development of the new high-speed duplex engine didn't go smoothly. Ten months after the first conference ( April of 1937), PRR ended Baldwin Locomotive Work's consultation and assigned the task to a consortium of [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], [[American Locomotive Company]] and [[Lima Locomotive Works]] under a joint contract. T. W. Demarest headed the joint committee, General [[wikt:superintendent|Superintendent]] of Motive Power in PRR's Western Region.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=PRR Chronology 1936\n |publisher = Pennsylvania Technical and Historical Society\n |work = PRR Chronology\n |date=  April 2015\n |url = http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1936%204_15_15.pdf\n |format=PDF|accessdate = 2018-07-21\n}}</ref>\n{{stack begin | clear=false | float=center}}\n<div class=\"NavFrame collapsed\">\n  <div class=\"NavHead\">The members of the joint committee</div>\n  <div class=\"NavContent\">\n# '''Ralph P.

The design started with a 4-4-4-4 duplex. \n\nOn 2nd June 1937, PRR officially announced the development of the \u201cPennsylvania Type\u201d high-speed passenger locomotive which would become Class S1. After various details were discussed and finalized, it became necessary to make changes that substantially increased the locomotive's weight. By the time the plans were finalized and approved it had evolved into a 6-4-4-6.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=PRR Chronology 1937\n |publisher = Pennsylvania Technical and Historical Society\n |work = PRR Chronology\n |date=  April 2015\n |url = http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1937%204_15_15.pdf\n |format=PDF|accessdate = 2018-07-21\n}}</ref>\n\n==Duplex design==\nThe benefits of a duplex design included lighter machinery, shorter cylinder stroke, less wear, lower piston thrust, smaller more efficient cylinders, and a more stable\nframe than an articulated underframe, also, no hinged connection had to be maintained.<ref> Pennsy Power by Alvin F. Staufer | 1962 | Page 217</ref> Reduced hammer blows on the track resulting in lower maintenance cost. Two sets of drivers with four wheels each could have lighter (as much as 25%) running gear than a locomotive with all four axles coupled together, smaller and lighter moving parts ensured less wear and tear. Baldwin's chief engineer believed that the 8-coupled, two-cylinder locomotives of the time were at or near practical limits in terms of steam flow, cylinder efficiency could be improved at high speed by getting the same power from four smaller cylinders with proportionately larger valves. Valve travel in S1's cylinder was 7-1/2\u201d, the lap was 1-7/8\u201d, the lead was 5/16\u201d, exhaust clearance was 0.25\u201d, valve diameter was 12\u201d. \n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:S1 boiler.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The S1 under construction at [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]]. The smaller boiler in the photo is for a [[PRR B6|B6]] [[switcher]] giving a sense of scale.]]\nThe S1 was the largest passenger locomotive ever constructed, the cast steel [[locomotive bed]] plate made by [[General Steel Castings]] was the largest single-piece casting ever made for a locomotive.<ref name=\"lionel\"/><ref name=Reed>{{cite book |last = Reed |first = Brian |date = June 1972 |title=Pennsylvania Duplexii |publisher = Profile Publications Limited |location = Windsor, Berkshire |series = Loco Profile 24 |pages=267\u2013271}}</ref> In order to negotiate sharper radius curves, S1 was equipped with [[Lateral motion device]]s made by Alco on its first and third set of drivers, allowing 57.2 mm (2.25 inches) of lateral play on the axles, but these proved to be inadequate. Unlike other experimental duplex engines like PRR's Class [[PRR Q1|Q1]] #6130 4-6-4-4, there were no flangeless wheels or blind drivers adopted on S1. \n\nIn March 1938, a [[Chicago and North Western Class E-4]] 4-6-4 \"Hudson\" #4003 was tested by PRR at Altoona.<ref>\"Black Gold - Black Diamonds: The Pennsylvania Railroad & Dieselization\" Volume 1 by Eric Hirsimaki, July 1997, Page 85-86 </ref> Based on the test results, PRR decided to adopt 84\" drivers and a cylinder pressure of 300 psi for the S1. PRR believed that the large diameter drivers could increase the tractive effort without causing undue slipping.<ref name=\"lionel\">{{cite web\n |title = Actual Production Models Shown\n |publisher = www.lionel.com\n |work = Brochures\n |year=  2003\n |url = http://www.lionel.com/Brochures/2003_Brochures/penn_s1_duplex/pennsy_s1-duplex_page2.html\n |accessdate = 2007-09-03\n}}</ref>\nIn August 1941, PRR VP-Western Region [[James M. Symes]], a senior official who against the idea of duplex engine in later years, approved the extension of stall no. 30 of the Crestline roundhouse to accommodate the S1. The stall had a connection at the back because the S1 could only be turned on a wye, but not on the roundhouse's turntable.\n\n[[Timken Company|Timken]] roller bearings were equipped on the crosshead pins, all engine trucks, and drive axles as well as the tender trucks. Besides, the lightweight reciprocating parts were manufactured by Timken High Dynamic Steel and designed by [[Timken Company|Timken]] engineers.<ref> Waide Collection of Vintage Railroad Advertisements 1840-1949 https://waidephoto.smugmug.com/Trains/Waide-Collection-of-Vintage/i-NcMc82c/A</ref> To get enough steel between the crank and axle, the back end of each main rod was offset {{convert|1+1/8|in|mm|0}} from the crank in the driver, so the big end made a {{convert|26|in|mm|0|adj=on}} circle while each side rod pin made a {{convert|28+1/4|in|mm|0|adj=on}} circle.\n\n==Boiler, steaming quality and streamlining==\nThe boiler for the S1 was the largest built by the Pennsylvania Railroad; with  {{convert|660|sqft|m2}} of direct heating surface and 500 one-inch diameter tubes and flues, the total heating surface area of S1 was 7,746 sq ft (719.6 m2), it was 99.3% as massive as the boiler for Union Pacific's 4000-class [[4-8-8-4]] locomotive, the \"Big Boy\". In terms of drawbar horsepower, the S1 was 13% more powerful than the \"Big Boy,\" 7200 hp and 6345 hp respectively. The large Belpaire firebox met the Pennsy's standards; its heating surface area included that supplied by seven American Arch circulators. Water passed through 5 1/2\" horizontal tube met at the centerline with the other cross tube forming the bottom of the 7\" vertical tube that sprayed the water up into the steam space above the crown sheet. The lowest set pair of tubes was forward with the side openings of the other six steadily rising toward the back. \n\nA large Worthington 6 SA [[feedwater heater]] was fitted with a 7 SA pump to handle the enormous boiler's thirst. The six-wheel [[leading truck|leading]] and [[trailing truck]]s were added, as the locomotive was too heavy for four-wheel units.  The [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[Art Deco]] styled shrouding of the locomotive was designed by [[Raymond Loewy]],<ref name=\"theavanti\" /><ref name=\"csm\" /> a design concept based on his earlier streamlining design for PRR [[K4s]] #3768 in 1936, for which he received [http://www.jitterbuzz.com/stream.html#essone U.S. Patent No. 2,128,490]. Raymond Loewy conducted the wind-tunnel test by using the clay model of S1 at [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] for the design of its streamlined shrouding, and It was the same laboratory where he conducted testing of the streamlining of PRR K4s #3768. The design of the smoke lifting plate around the smokestack on S1 was improved based on the wind-tunnel test result from Guggenheim.<ref> Streamliner - Raymond Loewy and Image-making in the Age of American Industrial Design |John Wall| Page 81 | </ref>.\n\n==Construction costs and testing==\nThe cost of the S1 was $669,780.00, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|669780|1939}}}} today.<ref name=\"lionel\" /> which was over twice the cost of a PRR T1 4-4-4-4 (#6111 cost $310,676). No. 6100 was completed at Altoona on Dec.21, 1938 without streamlined casing. On the same day, it made its first road test with two cars running backward to Huntingdon and returned to Altoona at speeds up to  {{convert|50|mph}} mph. During the run, it was stopped and checked for overhang on all tight curves. Assistant Chief of Motive Power-Locomotive Carleton K.

S1 was towed (facing backward) by smaller freight engines like PRR Ils and took a round-about route to the fair site.

The S1 traveled over the [[Poughkeepsie]] and [[Hell Gate Bridge]], crossed over the [[Hudson River]] and then brought it across on the NY Connecting.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dON2ZmIWZY</ref> On March 13, 1939, the S1, lettered \u201cAmerican Railroads\u201d on the tender, arrived at New York World\u2019s Fair. \n\nAt the Fair, the drive wheels operated under the locomotive's steam power<ref name=\"lionel\" /> ran continuously on the roller platform at 60 mph (97 km/h) all day long . Film footage shows that all the wheels on S1, besides the drive wheels, were also placed on rollers powered by electricity; every time S1 started its performance by moving the drive wheels, all the wheels were rolling, including the wheels on the tender's truck.\n\nThe [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] was open for two seasons, from April to October each year, and was officially closed on October 27, 1940. During the five-month break between October 1939 and April 1940, #6100 was put back on the system for passenger service and road testing. There is photo evidence showing that the S1 was hauling the [[Manhattan Limited]], a named train serving as an alternative to [[the Broadway Limited]],  in November 1939.<ref>Pennsy's \u201cBig Engine\u201d in the snow | Classic Trains Magazine | April 1st, 2014 | http://ctr.trains.com/photo-of-the-day/2014/04/pennsys-big-engine-in-the-snow </ref>\n\n[[Popular Mechanics]] described S1 as the \"'''Pride of American Railroad'''\" in an article in their June 1939 issue.<ref>Popular Mechanics | Million-Pound Iron Horse is 140 Feet Long { https://archive.org/stream/PopularMechanics1939/Popular_Mechanics_06_1939#page/n109</ref>.The [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] of 1939 attracted nearly 25 million visitors, S1's first 50,000 service mile was accumulated from this fair's live steam show. After the World's Fair, the S1 was re-lettered for the Pennsylvania Railroad fleet. As one of the most important exhibits of the World's Fair, S1 was used by the PRR for various publicity purposes; her image was featured in calendars, stamps, advertisements, brochures, puzzles, etc. The [[American Bank Note Company]] issued a series of posters in 1939, published by the Eaton paper company as part of an advertising campaign. One of the posters depicts the S1 hauling the [[Broadway Limited]].<ref>The Pennsylvania Railroad S-1 | http://www.jitterbuzz.com/stream.html#essone</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n[[File:PRR S1 hauling the Trail Blazer.jpg|thumb|left|325px|PRR S1 #6100 hauling the Trail Blazer, PRR's premier, luxury all-coach train between New York and Chicago in Nov 1942.]]\nS1 began its passenger train services starting from December 1940, on the run between Chicago and [[Pittsburgh]]. On its first run out of Fort Wayne, Indiana, the crew was led by H.H. Lehman (Fireman), C.J. Wappes (Road Foreman) and Frank Ritcha (Engineer). Due to its gigantic size,  S1 had to turn on [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]]'s wye at Chicago before going eastbound and was unable to go through the 130 lb switch (No.8) just to the west of [[Pittsburgh Union Station]]<ref>https://prrt1steamlocomotivetrust.org/faq.php | Question No.9 \"Where it will run?\"</ref> This problem wasn't fixed until 1946 which also prevented the PRR class T1 operating through Pittsburgh). \n\nThe S1 was so large that it could not negotiate the track clearances on most of the lines of the PRR system, in its brief service life it was restricted to the mainline between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Crestline, Ohio]] (283 miles/446 km). It was assigned to the Fort Wayne Division and based at the Crestline engine-house. Base on photographic evidence, S1 hauled [[the Broadway Limited]] (New York to Chicago) and [[Liberty Limited]] (Washington D.C to Chicago) in the first few months of its revenue service, and is then assigned to haul other much popular, heavier and commercially successful passenger trains such as [[List of Pennsylvania Railroad passenger trains|The General]], [[Trail Blazer (passenger train)|The Trail Blazer]] and The Golden Arrow on this route.<ref name=\"lionel\" /> \n\nMonthly mileage reports from the Hagley Library indicated that the S1 racked up {{convert|10388|mi|km|adj=on}} per month or 20 round trips between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Crestline, Ohio]] in Aug 1941 which was a very spectacular monthly mileage figure for an experimental engine, compared to K4s 6000 to 8000 miles monthly average mileage. This implied that the PRR had high regard for S1's power and speed. The S1 helped PRR to handle the extreme busy Wartime Traffic until the end of WWII and paid off her high construction cost within one year. Crews liked the S1, partly because of its very smooth ride on speed. The great mass and inertia of the locomotive together with the unique, massive 6-wheel trailing truck soaked up the bumps and the surging often experienced with duplex locomotives.\n\n==Operating performance and alleged speed records==\n[[Image:Pennsylvania Railroad Class S1 No.6100 hauling the Liberty Limited eastbound in April 1941.jpg|thumb|left|350px| PRR S1 #6100 was seen hauling the Liberty Limited eastbound at New Freedom, PA in April 1941.]]\n\nIn terms of [[tractive effort]] and [[drawbar horsepower]], PRR S1 was the most potent reciprocating steam locomotive ever built for passenger service. Starting tractive effort calculated in the usual way (85% mean effective pressure) comes out {{convert|76,400|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}, but the engine used 70.6% limited cutoff (presumably to increase port openings at short cutoff), so the railroad claimed a correspondingly lower tractive effort.{{jargon inline|date=January 2017}} During a test run between Chicago, Illinois and Crestline, Ohio in December 1940, S1 managed to reach {{convert|100.97|mph}} on level track with 1350 tons passenger stock behind her, which was equal to 24 postwar lightweight passenger cars.<ref> Dampflokomotiven in den USA 1825\u20131950 Band 2: Die technische Hochbl\u00fcte der Dampftraktion 1921\u20131950, Page 112 | 1972 | Autoren: BUCHMANN </ref> In this test run, S1 also achieved an average speed of {{convert|66|mph}}, which was 27% faster than the average schedule speed of the route. Some publications from Germany stated that S1 was able to reach {{convert|120.01|mph}} in other road tests during the late 1940s with a lighter load behind her, but PRR never claimed this record. On Apr 19, 1941, during an excursion run organized by the Detroit Railroad Club, S1 reached {{convert|105|mph}} on the route between [[Fort Wayne]] and Chicago.<ref>Black Gold - Black Diamonds: The Pennsylvania Railroad & Dieselization\" Volume 1 by Eric Hirsimaki, July 1997, Page 105</ref>\n \nAn article \"Riding the Gargantua of the Rails\"<ref> http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/Gargantua.pdf | Popular Mechanics Magazine | Dec 1941 </ref> in the Dec 1941 [[Popular Mechanics Magazine]] cites a speed recorded by assistant road foreman Charlie Wappes of the Fort Wayne Division during the S1\u2019s test runs at {{convert|133.4|mph}} with 12 heavyweight passenger cars in its back. There are other stories of the S1 reaching or exceeding {{convert|140|mph}}. In the German trade press and literature from 1945, there was a report of a record run of the S1, citing railroad officials of [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] that a speed of {{convert|141.2|mph}} was reached when the engine was trying to make up time for a delayed westbound train, [[Trail Blazer (passenger train) | the Trail Blazer]].<ref>Rekord Lokomotiven, Die schnellsten der Schiene 1848-1950, P.134 | (1988) by Wilhelm Reuter</ref>\n\nIts high-speed capability was such that many have claimed that the S1 exceeded on multiple occasions the {{convert|126|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} record steam locomotive speed set in 1938 by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] locomotive ''[[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|Mallard]]''.  The engine was claimed to have exceeded {{convert|156|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on the Fort Wayne-Chicago run, as it was reported that the PRR received a fine for the feat.\n\nThe streamlining designer of the train [[Raymond Loewy]] himself wrote in 1979: \"On a straight stretch of track without any curves for miles; I waited for the S1 to pass through at full speed. I stood on the platform and saw it coming from the distance at ''120 miles per hour''. It flashed by like a steel thunderbolt, the ground shaking under me, in a blast of air that almost sucked me into its whirlwind. Approximately a million pounds of locomotive were crashing through near me. I felt shaken and overwhelmed by an unforgettable feeling of power, by a sense of pride at the sight of what I had helped to create.\"\n\n==Suspected design flaws==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\n[[Image:PRR S1 detail.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Detail view of the driving wheels and cylinders; note the rollers upon which the wheels rested while on display]]\n\nThe lack of curve compatibility led to the S1 not being used for its intended long-distance express service. Although the S1 had less than half (47%) its total weight on the driving wheels, its [[Factor of adhesion]] was still very close to the much more successful [[PRR Q2]], Santa Fe \"Northern\" 4-8-4s the 2900s, and the renowned [[Norfolk and Western Railway class J (1941)|N&W Class J]] 4-8-4s. More than half of its weight was being carried by the massive six-wheel pilot (leading) and trailing trucks instead of the drivers. This left the two sets of four duplex driving wheels susceptible to wheel slippage. However, during the 5 1/2 years service history of S1, no serious accident occurred due to wheel slippage. The S1 managed to serve between Chicago and Crestline, Ohio for almost 5 1/2 years, made it having the longest-serving record among all experimental steam engine prototypes of the PRR, such as the [[PRR Q1|Q1]] 4-6-4-4 and [[PRR S2|S2]] turbine 6-8-6.\n\n==Mitigation measures==\nTo increase the adhesion and improve performance, PRR enlarged the sand dome on the S1. It ensured the supply of sand for steam sanding and slightly increased the axle load above the first and second set axle. The S1 was partially de-skirted in 1942 to improve the visibility of the reciprocating parts for the crews and better operation.<ref>Loco Profile, 24: Pennsylvania DuplexII | 1972</ref> Suspension springs of the pilot truck and trailer truck were fine-tuned to straighten out the overall weight distribution to achieve better performance. Railway Historian and Author Alvin F. Staufer agrees that she (S1) was oversized and thus unable to visit most roundhouses or handle tight curves, but contends: \"She was an excellent steamer and gave trouble-free service.\"<ref> Pennsylvania  \"Duplex Drive\" Locomotives in the USA, https://www.steamlocomotive.com/locobase.php?country=USA&wheel=Duplex&railroad=prr </ref>\n\n==Retirement==\n[[Image:Pennsylvania RR streamlined locomotive T1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Base on the experience gained from S1, PRR improved the design of T1. A total of 52 of them were ordered from 1940 to 1945. ]]\n\nAccording to an official report from PRR dated December 1, 1945, which is now stored in The [[Hagley Museum and Library]], S1 #6100 was awaiting engine truck repairs at Crestline. It was expected to be returned in service after a few days. This is one of a solid proof that S1 was still in service at least until December [[1945]]. At the time, at least 13 [[Pennsylvania Railroad class T1|T1]] [[4-4-4-4]] were already put into service. \n\nThe design flaws of the S1 led to only one example being produced. Before S1 was officially put in revenue service, The PRR already ordered a shorter design, the [[PRR T1|T1]] 4-4-4-4 [[Pennsylvania Railroad class T1|T1]] of 1942. Unlike her duplexes sisters, PRR S1 didn't install any Poppet Valve Gear, even though it was proposed to install [[ Valve gear | Franklin Type A rotary cam poppet valve gear]] when she was already under construction, but such proposal was rejected due to technical difficulties in 1938.<ref>Loco Profile, 24: Pennsylvania DuplexII | 1972</ref>, this decision unexpectedly prevented a lot of troubles that would have been caused by the problematic Franklin poppet valve gears in S1's service life. The total service years or total service mileage of S1 (from Nov 1939 to March 1940, Dec 1940 to May 1946) was ironically slightly longer than some of her younger duplex sisters.\n\nA time-book belonging to Pennsy engineman Byron Breininger from the Ft. Wayne division records a trip to Chicago on S1 engine #6100 at 8:59 AM on May 5, [[1946]], this run was possibly one of its last in service. Less than two years later, PRR president [[Martin W. Clement]] announced that \u201cBy May of this year (1948) we expect all of our through passenger trains west of the electrified territory to be dieselized\u201d<ref> Railway & Locomotive Historical Society Newsletter - Winter 2007 </ref>.

[[steam locomotive]] (nicknamed \"The Big Engine\") was a single experimental [[duplex locomotive]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]]. It was designed to demonstrate the advantages of duplex drives espoused by Baldwin Chief Engineer Ralph P. Johnson. It was the longest and heaviest rigid frame reciprocating steam locomotive that was ever built.<ref name=\"theavanti\">{{cite web\n |title = Raymond Loewy-Locomotives\n |publisher = The Avanti\n |url = http://www.theavanti.com/locomotives.htm\n |accessdate = 2007-09-02\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927130653/http://www.theavanti.com/locomotives.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}</ref> The [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[Art Deco]] styled shell of the locomotive was designed by [[Raymond Loewy]].<ref name=\"theavanti\" /><ref name=\"csm\">{{cite web\n |title = It's a bird!

To achieve stability at fast passenger train speeds (above 100 mph), articulation was not used. The S1 was completed on January 31, 1939, at Altoona shop, and was numbered 6100.\n\nAt {{convert|140|ft|2+1/2|in|m|2|abbr=on}} overall, engine and tender, the S1 was the longest reciprocating steam locomotive ever; it also had the heaviest tender (451,840lb / 205 tonnes), highest tractive effort ({{convert|76,403|lbf|kN|2|abbr=on}}) of a passenger steam engine when built and the largest drivers (84 inch diameter) ever used on a locomotive with more than three coupled axles. The problem of wheel slippage, along with a wheelbase that was too long for many of the rail line's curves, limited the S1's usefulness. No further S1 models were built as focus shifted to the much smaller but more practical class [[PRR T1|T1]] in June 1940. Design of the 4-4-4-4 T1 and the 6-4-4-6 S1 occurred concurrently, however, the S1 was the first produced.\n\n==Construction and historical background==\n[[Image:Locomotive Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The official publicity photo of PRR S1 6100 of 1939]]\n\nAs early as June 1936, the management of [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] decided to build a new passenger locomotive to replace its aging [[K4s]] locomotives. They also hoped that the new S1 steam locomotive would have a performance equal to their [[GG1]] electric engine and would be capable of hauling a 1,000-ton passenger train at 100 mph.<ref name=\"lionel\" /> A conference was held between Baldwin Locomotive Works officials and W. F. Kiesel, J. V. B. Duer and W. R. Elsey for PRR, where PRR demanded a passenger locomotive to haul 15 standard cars at 100 mph on level track between [[Paoli, Pennsylvania|Paoli]] and Chicago. Baldwin presented several [[4-8-4]] and [[4-4-4-4]] designs made for other railroads. However, PRR rejected the 4-8-4 design in favor of a rigid frame [[Duplex locomotive|duplex]] and asked Baldwin to consider the wheel arrangement 4-4-6-4. In July 1936, PRR requested Baldwin Locomotive Works to submit a design for a 4-8-4 engine capable of handling a 2,000-ton train between Colehour and Harsimus Cove. \n\nTwo months after the conference, Baldwin Locomotive Works officials presented four designs to PRR:\n \n{{stack begin | clear=false | float=center}}\n<div class=\"NavFrame collapsed\">\n  <div class=\"NavHead\">Baldwin's proposals for Pennsylvania Railroad in 1936</div>\n  <div class=\"NavContent\">\n# '''a 4-4-4-4 passenger locomotive that could haul 1,200 tons but exceeded existing weight and clearance restrictions'''\n# '''a 4-4-4-6 passenger locomotive that could haul 1,200 tons but also exceeded limits'''\n# '''a 4-8-4 freight locomotive with the same weight on drivers as an M1a, which failed to meet the requirements for a 2,000-ton train'''\n# '''an articulated 4-6-6-4 locomotive'''</div>\n</div>\n{{stack end}}\n\nPRR preferred 4-4-4-4 and asked Baldwin to consider a passenger version with 80\" drivers and a freight version with 72\" drivers. However, the cooperation between PRR and Baldwin, which proceeded without signing any agreement or contract, for the development of the new high-speed duplex engine didn't go smoothly. Ten months after the first conference ( April of 1937), PRR ended Baldwin Locomotive Work's consultation and assigned the task to a consortium of [[Baldwin Locomotive Works]], [[American Locomotive Company]] and [[Lima Locomotive Works]] under a joint contract.

Staufer | 1962 | Page 217</ref> Reduced hammer blows on the track resulting in lower maintenance cost. Two sets of drivers with four wheels each could have lighter (as much as 25%) running gear than a locomotive with all four axles coupled together, smaller and lighter moving parts ensured less wear and tear. Baldwin's chief engineer believed that the 8-coupled, two-cylinder locomotives of the time were at or near practical limits in terms of steam flow, cylinder efficiency could be improved at high speed by getting the same power from four smaller cylinders with proportionately larger valves. Valve travel in S1's cylinder was 7-1/2\u201d, the lap was 1-7/8\u201d, the lead was 5/16\u201d, exhaust clearance was 0.25\u201d, valve diameter was 12\u201d. \n\n==Construction==\n[[Image:S1 boiler.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The S1 under construction at [[Altoona, Pennsylvania|Altoona]]. The smaller boiler in the photo is for a [[PRR B6|B6]] [[switcher]] giving a sense of scale.]]\nThe S1 was the largest passenger locomotive ever constructed, the cast steel [[locomotive bed]] plate made by [[General Steel Castings]] was the largest single-piece casting ever made for a locomotive.<ref name=\"lionel\"/><ref name=Reed>{{cite book |last = Reed |first = Brian |date = June 1972 |title=Pennsylvania Duplexii |publisher = Profile Publications Limited |location = Windsor, Berkshire |series = Loco Profile 24 |pages=267\u2013271}}</ref> In order to negotiate sharper radius curves, S1 was equipped with [[Lateral motion device]]s made by Alco on its first and third set of drivers, allowing 57.2 mm (2.25 inches) of lateral play on the axles, but these proved to be inadequate. Unlike other experimental duplex engines like PRR's Class [[PRR Q1|Q1]] #6130 4-6-4-4, there were no flangeless wheels or blind drivers adopted on S1. \n\nIn March 1938, a [[Chicago and North Western Class E-4]] 4-6-4 \"Hudson\" #4003 was tested by PRR at Altoona.<ref>\"Black Gold - Black Diamonds: The Pennsylvania Railroad & Dieselization\" Volume 1 by Eric Hirsimaki, July 1997, Page 85-86 </ref> Based on the test results, PRR decided to adopt 84\" drivers and a cylinder pressure of 300 psi for the S1.

Symes]], a senior official who against the idea of duplex engine in later years, approved the extension of stall no. 30 of the Crestline roundhouse to accommodate the S1. The stall had a connection at the back because the S1 could only be turned on a wye, but not on the roundhouse's turntable.\n\n[[Timken Company|Timken]] roller bearings were equipped on the crosshead pins, all engine trucks, and drive axles as well as the tender trucks. Besides, the lightweight reciprocating parts were manufactured by Timken High Dynamic Steel and designed by [[Timken Company|Timken]] engineers.<ref> Waide Collection of Vintage Railroad Advertisements 1840-1949 https://waidephoto.smugmug.com/Trains/Waide-Collection-of-Vintage/i-NcMc82c/A</ref> To get enough steel between the crank and axle, the back end of each main rod was offset {{convert|1+1/8|in|mm|0}} from the crank in the driver, so the big end made a {{convert|26|in|mm|0|adj=on}} circle while each side rod pin made a {{convert|28+1/4|in|mm|0|adj=on}} circle.\n\n==Boiler, steaming quality and streamlining==\nThe boiler for the S1 was the largest built by the Pennsylvania Railroad; with  {{convert|660|sqft|m2}} of direct heating surface and 500 one-inch diameter tubes and flues, the total heating surface area of S1 was 7,746 sq ft (719.6 m2), it was 99.3% as massive as the boiler for Union Pacific's 4000-class [[4-8-8-4]] locomotive, the \"Big Boy\". In terms of drawbar horsepower, the S1 was 13% more powerful than the \"Big Boy,\" 7200 hp and 6345 hp respectively. The large Belpaire firebox met the Pennsy's standards; its heating surface area included that supplied by seven American Arch circulators. Water passed through 5 1/2\" horizontal tube met at the centerline with the other cross tube forming the bottom of the 7\" vertical tube that sprayed the water up into the steam space above the crown sheet. The lowest set pair of tubes was forward with the side openings of the other six steadily rising toward the back. \n\nA large Worthington 6 SA [[feedwater heater]] was fitted with a 7 SA pump to handle the enormous boiler's thirst. The six-wheel [[leading truck|leading]] and [[trailing truck]]s were added, as the locomotive was too heavy for four-wheel units.  The [[streamliner|streamlined]] [[Art Deco]] styled shrouding of the locomotive was designed by [[Raymond Loewy]],<ref name=\"theavanti\" /><ref name=\"csm\" /> a design concept based on his earlier streamlining design for PRR [[K4s]] #3768 in 1936, for which he received [http://www.jitterbuzz.com/stream.html#essone U.S. Patent No. 2,128,490]. Raymond Loewy conducted the wind-tunnel test by using the clay model of S1 at [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] for the design of its streamlined shrouding, and It was the same laboratory where he conducted testing of the streamlining of PRR K4s #3768. The design of the smoke lifting plate around the smokestack on S1 was improved based on the wind-tunnel test result from Guggenheim.<ref> Streamliner - Raymond Loewy and Image-making in the Age of American Industrial Design |John Wall| Page 81 | </ref>.\n\n==Construction costs and testing==\nThe cost of the S1 was $669,780.00, equal to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|669780|1939}}}} today.<ref name=\"lionel\" /> which was over twice the cost of a PRR T1 4-4-4-4 (#6111 cost $310,676). No. 6100 was completed at Altoona on Dec.21, 1938 without streamlined casing. On the same day, it made its first road test with two cars running backward to Huntingdon and returned to Altoona at speeds up to  {{convert|50|mph}} mph. During the run, it was stopped and checked for overhang on all tight curves. Assistant Chief of Motive Power-Locomotive Carleton K. Steins (1891-1973) noted superior riding and steaming qualities.<ref>{{cite web\n |title=PRR Chronology 1937\n |publisher = Pennsylvania Technical and Historical Society\n |work = PRR Chronology\n |date=  April 2015\n |url = http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1937%204_15_15.pdf\n |format=PDF|accessdate = 2018-07-21\n}}</ref> During another pre-service road test, the S1 was clocked at {{convert|73|mph}} towing 90 freight cars.<ref> The Keystone Magazine | Vol.27 | No.2 | Summer 1994 </ref>\n\n==1939 World's Fair display==\n[[Image:PRR S1.jpg|thumb|left|350px|The S1 at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] of 1939 ]]\n\nThe S1 was displayed at the [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] of 1939\u201340 with the lettering '''\"American Railroads\"''' rather than '''\"Pennsylvania Railroad\"''', as 27 eastern railroads had one combined {{convert|17|acre|ha|adj=on}} exhibit, which also included the [[Baltimore and Ohio Class N-1|Baltimore & Ohio's duplex locomotive]].<ref name=Reed /> To reach the Fair the S1 took a circuitous route over the [[Long Island Rail Road]]. Many obstacles, like some of the third rail guards, had to be temporarily removed and other obstacles were passed at a crawl to reach the fairgrounds. S1 was towed (facing backward) by smaller freight engines like PRR Ils and took a round-about route to the fair site. She ran up the [[Bel-Del]], interchanged with the [[Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]] at [[Belvidere, New Jersey|Belvidere]] and [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad|NH]] at [[Maybrook]]. The S1 traveled over the [[Poughkeepsie]] and [[Hell Gate Bridge]], crossed over the [[Hudson River]] and then brought it across on the NY Connecting.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dON2ZmIWZY</ref> On March 13, 1939, the S1, lettered \u201cAmerican Railroads\u201d on the tender, arrived at New York World\u2019s Fair. \n\nAt the Fair, the drive wheels operated under the locomotive's steam power<ref name=\"lionel\" /> ran continuously on the roller platform at 60 mph (97 km/h) all day long . Film footage shows that all the wheels on S1, besides the drive wheels, were also placed on rollers powered by electricity; every time S1 started its performance by moving the drive wheels, all the wheels were rolling, including the wheels on the tender's truck.\n\nThe [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] was open for two seasons, from April to October each year, and was officially closed on October 27, 1940. During the five-month break between October 1939 and April 1940, #6100 was put back on the system for passenger service and road testing. There is photo evidence showing that the S1 was hauling the [[Manhattan Limited]], a named train serving as an alternative to [[the Broadway Limited]],  in November 1939.<ref>Pennsy's \u201cBig Engine\u201d in the snow | Classic Trains Magazine | April 1st, 2014 | http://ctr.trains.com/photo-of-the-day/2014/04/pennsys-big-engine-in-the-snow </ref>\n\n[[Popular Mechanics]] described S1 as the \"'''Pride of American Railroad'''\" in an article in their June 1939 issue.<ref>Popular Mechanics | Million-Pound Iron Horse is 140 Feet Long { https://archive.org/stream/PopularMechanics1939/Popular_Mechanics_06_1939#page/n109</ref>.The [[1939 New York World's Fair|New York World's Fair]] of 1939 attracted nearly 25 million visitors, S1's first 50,000 service mile was accumulated from this fair's live steam show. After the World's Fair, the S1 was re-lettered for the Pennsylvania Railroad fleet. As one of the most important exhibits of the World's Fair, S1 was used by the PRR for various publicity purposes; her image was featured in calendars, stamps, advertisements, brochures, puzzles, etc. The [[American Bank Note Company]] issued a series of posters in 1939, published by the Eaton paper company as part of an advertising campaign. One of the posters depicts the S1 hauling the [[Broadway Limited]].<ref>The Pennsylvania Railroad S-1 | http://www.jitterbuzz.com/stream.html#essone</ref>\n\n==Service history==\n[[File:PRR S1 hauling the Trail Blazer.jpg|thumb|left|325px|PRR S1 #6100 hauling the Trail Blazer, PRR's premier, luxury all-coach train between New York and Chicago in Nov 1942.]]\nS1 began its passenger train services starting from December 1940, on the run between Chicago and [[Pittsburgh]]. On its first run out of Fort Wayne, Indiana, the crew was led by H.H. Lehman (Fireman), C.J. Wappes (Road Foreman) and Frank Ritcha (Engineer). Due to its gigantic size,  S1 had to turn on [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad]]'s wye at Chicago before going eastbound and was unable to go through the 130 lb switch (No.8) just to the west of [[Pittsburgh Union Station]]<ref>https://prrt1steamlocomotivetrust.org/faq.php | Question No.9 \"Where it will run?\"</ref> This problem wasn't fixed until 1946 which also prevented the PRR class T1 operating through Pittsburgh). \n\nThe S1 was so large that it could not negotiate the track clearances on most of the lines of the PRR system, in its brief service life it was restricted to the mainline between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Crestline, Ohio]] (283 miles/446 km). It was assigned to the Fort Wayne Division and based at the Crestline engine-house. Base on photographic evidence, S1 hauled [[the Broadway Limited]] (New York to Chicago) and [[Liberty Limited]] (Washington D.C to Chicago) in the first few months of its revenue service, and is then assigned to haul other much popular, heavier and commercially successful passenger trains such as [[List of Pennsylvania Railroad passenger trains|The General]], [[Trail Blazer (passenger train)|The Trail Blazer]] and The Golden Arrow on this route.<ref name=\"lionel\" /> \n\nMonthly mileage reports from the Hagley Library indicated that the S1 racked up {{convert|10388|mi|km|adj=on}} per month or 20 round trips between [[Chicago, Illinois]] and [[Crestline, Ohio]] in Aug 1941 which was a very spectacular monthly mileage figure for an experimental engine, compared to K4s 6000 to 8000 miles monthly average mileage. This implied that the PRR had high regard for S1's power and speed. The S1 helped PRR to handle the extreme busy Wartime Traffic until the end of WWII and paid off her high construction cost within one year. Crews liked the S1, partly because of its very smooth ride on speed. The great mass and inertia of the locomotive together with the unique, massive 6-wheel trailing truck soaked up the bumps and the surging often experienced with duplex locomotives.\n\n==Operating performance and alleged speed records==\n[[Image:Pennsylvania Railroad Class S1 No.6100 hauling the Liberty Limited eastbound in April 1941.jpg|thumb|left|350px| PRR S1 #6100 was seen hauling the Liberty Limited eastbound at New Freedom, PA in April 1941.]]\n\nIn terms of [[tractive effort]] and [[drawbar horsepower]], PRR S1 was the most potent reciprocating steam locomotive ever built for passenger service. Starting tractive effort calculated in the usual way (85% mean effective pressure) comes out {{convert|76,400|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}, but the engine used 70.6% limited cutoff (presumably to increase port openings at short cutoff), so the railroad claimed a correspondingly lower tractive effort.{{jargon inline|date=January 2017}} During a test run between Chicago, Illinois and Crestline, Ohio in December 1940, S1 managed to reach {{convert|100.97|mph}} on level track with 1350 tons passenger stock behind her, which was equal to 24 postwar lightweight passenger cars.<ref> Dampflokomotiven in den USA 1825\u20131950 Band 2: Die technische Hochbl\u00fcte der Dampftraktion 1921\u20131950, Page 112 | 1972 | Autoren: BUCHMANN </ref> In this test run, S1 also achieved an average speed of {{convert|66|mph}}, which was 27% faster than the average schedule speed of the route. Some publications from Germany stated that S1 was able to reach {{convert|120.01|mph}} in other road tests during the late 1940s with a lighter load behind her, but PRR never claimed this record. On Apr 19, 1941, during an excursion run organized by the Detroit Railroad Club, S1 reached {{convert|105|mph}} on the route between [[Fort Wayne]] and Chicago.<ref>Black Gold - Black Diamonds: The Pennsylvania Railroad & Dieselization\" Volume 1 by Eric Hirsimaki, July 1997, Page 105</ref>\n \nAn article \"Riding the Gargantua of the Rails\"<ref> http://streamlinermemories.info/PRR/Gargantua.pdf | Popular Mechanics Magazine | Dec 1941 </ref> in the Dec 1941 [[Popular Mechanics Magazine]] cites a speed recorded by assistant road foreman Charlie Wappes of the Fort Wayne Division during the S1\u2019s test runs at {{convert|133.4|mph}} with 12 heavyweight passenger cars in its back. There are other stories of the S1 reaching or exceeding {{convert|140|mph}}. In the German trade press and literature from 1945, there was a report of a record run of the S1, citing railroad officials of [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] that a speed of {{convert|141.2|mph}} was reached when the engine was trying to make up time for a delayed westbound train, [[Trail Blazer (passenger train) | the Trail Blazer]].<ref>Rekord Lokomotiven, Die schnellsten der Schiene 1848-1950, P.134 | (1988) by Wilhelm Reuter</ref>\n\nIts high-speed capability was such that many have claimed that the S1 exceeded on multiple occasions the {{convert|126|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} record steam locomotive speed set in 1938 by the [[London and North Eastern Railway|LNER]] locomotive ''[[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|Mallard]]''.  The engine was claimed to have exceeded {{convert|156|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} on the Fort Wayne-Chicago run, as it was reported that the PRR received a fine for the feat.\n\nThe streamlining designer of the train [[Raymond Loewy]] himself wrote in 1979: \"On a straight stretch of track without any curves for miles; I waited for the S1 to pass through at full speed. I stood on the platform and saw it coming from the distance at ''120 miles per hour''. It flashed by like a steel thunderbolt, the ground shaking under me, in a blast of air that almost sucked me into its whirlwind. Approximately a million pounds of locomotive were crashing through near me. I felt shaken and overwhelmed by an unforgettable feeling of power, by a sense of pride at the sight of what I had helped to create.\"\n\n==Suspected design flaws==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2009}}\n[[Image:PRR S1 detail.jpg|thumb|left|185px|Detail view of the driving wheels and cylinders; note the rollers upon which the wheels rested while on display]]\n\nThe lack of curve compatibility led to the S1 not being used for its intended long-distance express service. Although the S1 had less than half (47%) its total weight on the driving wheels, its [[Factor of adhesion]] was still very close to the much more successful [[PRR Q2]], Santa Fe \"Northern\" 4-8-4s the 2900s, and the renowned [[Norfolk and Western Railway class J (1941)|N&W Class J]] 4-8-4s. More than half of its weight was being carried by the massive six-wheel pilot (leading) and trailing trucks instead of the drivers. This left the two sets of four duplex driving wheels susceptible to wheel slippage. However, during the 5 1/2 years service history of S1, no serious accident occurred due to wheel slippage. The S1 managed to serve between Chicago and Crestline, Ohio for almost 5 1/2 years, made it having the longest-serving record among all experimental steam engine prototypes of the PRR, such as the [[PRR Q1|Q1]] 4-6-4-4 and [[PRR S2|S2]] turbine 6-8-6.\n\n==Mitigation measures==\nTo increase the adhesion and improve performance, PRR enlarged the sand dome on the S1. It ensured the supply of sand for steam sanding and slightly increased the axle load above the first and second set axle. The S1 was partially de-skirted in 1942 to improve the visibility of the reciprocating parts for the crews and better operation.<ref>Loco Profile, 24: Pennsylvania DuplexII | 1972</ref> Suspension springs of the pilot truck and trailer truck were fine-tuned to straighten out the overall weight distribution to achieve better performance. Railway Historian and Author Alvin F. Staufer agrees that she (S1) was oversized and thus unable to visit most roundhouses or handle tight curves, but contends: \"She was an excellent steamer and gave trouble-free service.\"<ref> Pennsylvania  \"Duplex Drive\" Locomotives in the USA, https://www.steamlocomotive.com/locobase.php?country=USA&wheel=Duplex&railroad=prr </ref>\n\n==Retirement==\n[[Image:Pennsylvania RR streamlined locomotive T1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Base on the experience gained from S1, PRR improved the design of T1. A total of 52 of them were ordered from 1940 to 1945. ]]\n\nAccording to an official report from PRR dated December 1, 1945, which is now stored in The [[Hagley Museum and Library]], S1 #6100 was awaiting engine truck repairs at Crestline. It was expected to be returned in service after a few days. This is one of a solid proof that S1 was still in service at least until December [[1945]]. At the time, at least 13 [[Pennsylvania Railroad class T1|T1]] [[4-4-4-4]] were already put into service. \n\nThe design flaws of the S1 led to only one example being produced. Before S1 was officially put in revenue service, The PRR already ordered a shorter design, the [[PRR T1|T1]] 4-4-4-4 [[Pennsylvania Railroad class T1|T1]] of 1942. Unlike her duplexes sisters, PRR S1 didn't install any Poppet Valve Gear, even though it was proposed to install [[ Valve gear | Franklin Type A rotary cam poppet valve gear]] when she was already under construction, but such proposal was rejected due to technical difficulties in 1938.<ref>Loco Profile, 24: Pennsylvania DuplexII | 1972</ref>, this decision unexpectedly prevented a lot of troubles that would have been caused by the problematic Franklin poppet valve gears in S1's service life. The total service years or total service mileage of S1 (from Nov 1939 to March 1940, Dec 1940 to May 1946) was ironically slightly longer than some of her younger duplex sisters.\n\nA time-book belonging to Pennsy engineman Byron Breininger from the Ft. Wayne division records a trip to Chicago on S1 engine #6100 at 8:59 AM on May 5, [[1946]], this run was possibly one of its last in service. Less than two years later, PRR president [[Martin W.
