A major figure in the development of post-Independence New York City and State, Varick became the [[List of mayors of New York City|45th Mayor of New York City]] in 1789 and served eleven concurrent one-year terms until 1801.<ref name=\"dlib\">{{cite web|title=Guide to the Papers of Richard Varick 1743-1871 (Bulk 1775-1830)  MS 655|url=http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/nyhs/varick/|website=dlib.nyu.edu|publisher=[[New-York Historical Society]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref> \n\nPrevious to his terms as mayor, Varick served as the [[Recorder of New York City|14th Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

Varick's body of work from this era would lead to the ''Varick Transcripts'' which now live in the [[Library of Congress]].

He was also a longtime trustee of [[Columbia University]].\n\n==Early life & family==\nHe was born on March 15, 1753, at [[Hackensack, New Jersey|Hackensack]] in [[Bergen County, New Jersey]] to John Varick and Jane (n\u00e9e Dey) Varick.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\">{{cite book|last1=Cushman|first1=Paul|title=Richard Varick : A Forgotten Founding Father : revolutionary war soldier, Federalist politician, mayor of New York|date=2010|publisher=Modern Memoirs|location=Amherst, MA|isbn=978-0-9772337-6-2|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=aDOUOnCcpQYC}}</ref> Both Varick's parents ancestors had emigrated with the [[Dutch West India Company]] in the early to mid 17th century and remained in the greater New York City area. Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold. Copy of engraving by H. B. Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

The resulting 44 letterbooks contain copies of all documents dating from May, 1775 to June, 1785. Categories of papers, records, and correspondence are organized as follows;\n{{ordered list |list_style_type=upper-alpha\n|''Continental Congress''\n|''Continental and State Military Personnel''\n|''Civil Officials and Private Citizens''\n|''Foreign Officers and Subjects of Foreign Nations''\n|''Enemy Officers and British Subjects''\n|''Continental Army Council Proceedings (War Council Proceedings)''\n|''General Orders''\n|''Personal Correspondence''\n}}\n\n===Society of the Cincinnati===\n{{Main|Society of the Cincinnati}}\n{{see also|List of original members of the Society of the Cincinnati}}\nIn 1783 the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] was founded of which Varick was an original member and president of the New York chapter from 1783 until his death in 1831. Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Recorder & Attorney General of New York (1784 - 1789)===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]] which still hangs today in [[New York City Hall]]]]\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River. The property was landscaped with lawns and gardens to the waterfront. Varick would become the figurehead of the continuing development of Jersey City, inviting luminary friends such as  Major General [[Marquis de Lafayette]] to visit while touring America in 1824 for special Fourth of July celebrations.

Along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], Varick codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

Amongst Varick's ancestors are [[Joris Jansen Rapelje]], a member of the [[Council of Twelve Men]] which was the first democratic body in the history of the United States (1641). Varick's maternal grandfather was a colonel in the Continental Army whose house, the [[Dey Mansion]], which would go on to play a pivotal role in the American Revolution.\n\nVarick was one of seven children, his siblings being: Abraham Varick (the great-grandfather of Anna Maria Romeyn Varick, who married [[George Lauder (Scottish industrialist)|George Lauder]] of the [[Lauder Greenway Family]].); Dr. John Varick Jr.; Anne Elting; Sarah Froeligh; Jane De Witt (wife of [[Simeon De Witt]]); and Maria Gilbert.\n\n===Education===\nLittle is known about the specifics of Varick's education before university, though surviving letters indicate that he was educated by private tutors and studied Latin, French, and other subjects. He enrolled in King's College (the original name of [[Columbia University]]) in [[New York City]] in 1771 where he studied under [[John Morin Scott]]. Varick clerked for Scott during his education and after being admitted into the New York Bar in October 1774, Scott made him an offer to be a partner in his firm. Unusually, Varick had not yet graduated from King's College despite having passed the bar and never formally graduated. Later in his career, Varick would become a trustee of King's College for over thirty years.<ref name=\"Lefkowitz2003\">{{cite book|last=Lefkowitz|first=Arthur|title=George Washington's Indispensable Men|date=2003|publisher=Stackpole Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OHhyDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA219&lpg=PA219&dq=%22george+washington%22+%22richard+varick%22+trusted&source=bl&ots=tGR1fKUCQX&sig=ACfU3U2VhSeS7RTNhnLUqmjqSUy4gc1C8A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj3vtLDuvrkAhUYFjQIHUIzBtM4ChDoATAEegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=%22george%20washington%22%20%22richard%20varick%22%20trusted&f=false|accessdate=1 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Military career==\n===American Revolutionary War===\n====Service under General Schuyler & Northern Army====\n[[File:Richard varick officer continental army.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick painted c.1787 by [[Ralph Earl]]. The portrait shows Varick in his Continental Army officers uniform although he retired his commission in 1783. The blue decoration is that of the Society of the Cincinnati.]] Eight months into his career in private practice, the [[American Revolutionary War]] began. At the influence of his employer, John Morin Scott, Varick suspended his studies and enlisted in the militia. On June 28, 1775, he was appointed captain of the [[1st New York Regiment]] and after only three days as field officer, was appointed military secretary under General [[Philip Schuyler]]. It was thought that Scott, understanding the administrative and intellectual value of his young partner, secured the appointment. Varick departed New York City with Schuyler on July 4, 1775, to head north to [[Fort Ticonderoga]] and launch the campaign to drive the British out of Canada. En route, the traveling party stopped in Albany briefly where Varick would first meet General [[Benedict Arnold]], who would become a good friend, also played a significant role in Varick's life until Arnold's treason in 1780.\n\nBy the summer of 1776, Schuyler had been felled by multiple illnesses and was reeling from a series of losses on the battlefield. Varick, by this juncture, in part out of necessity, and in part by appointment, was performing three jobs at once: private secretary to Schuyler, quartermaster for all the northern forts held by the Continental Army, and the Northern Army's deputy muster master general. Laterally, actual battlefield commands had been outsourced to Arnold and General [[Horatio Gates]]. Schuyler, recognizing the burden Varick was carrying, promoted him to Lieutenant Colonel. Varick's almost total control of the administration for the Northern Army lead to an even closer friendship between Arnold and Varick.\n\nThat same summer, Arnold was planning his attack effort to stop the British advance down [[Lake Champlain]] in what would be one of the first battles in the history of the [[U.S. Navy]]. With a dearth of available ships, the armada was largely built from scratch by Varick who solved the crisis by contacting his wide network in New York City and the surrounding area to send materials and coastal men who were qualified for such work. While the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] ended in defeat for the navy, it succeeded in slowing the British advance for the winter as they retreaded to their Canadian bases.\n\nVarick also faced run-ins with fellow officers who were not part of Schuyler's faction. General [[Anthony Walton White]], who had briefly served at Washington's aide-de-camp, was accused by Schuyler of looting a private home on the frontier. After denying the charges, White barged into Varick's offices and challenged him to a duel, under the impression that Varick had spoken negatively to his character. Varick, unarmed, narrowly escaped White's attempt to murder him after Varick declined the challenge. \n \nAfter the disastrous [[Battle of Saratoga]], Schuyler was removed from duty by the [[Continental Congress]] in August 1777 and replaced by General Gates. With factionalism rife within the Northern Army, Varick was aligned with Arnold which pitted him against Gates, whom he disliked regardless. Their circle of friendship had also grown to include [[Henry Brockholst Livingston]] and [[Matthew Clarkson]]. Their camaraderie was rudely defined as \"the New York gang\" by [[James Wilkinson]], a partisan of General Gates'.\n\nVarick would quietly and capably continue in his role as the Northern Army's deputy muster master general, though not as Gates' aide-de-camp or private secretary, until January 12, 1780 when the department was abolished by the Continental Congress in a larger reorganization.\n\n====Service under General Arnold====\n[[File:Benedict Arnold.

Hall after John Trumbull, published 1879., 1931 - 1932 - NARA - 532921.tif|thumb|Benedict Arnold]]\nVarick briefly resumed his law in private practice, which proved challenging in his politically volatile hometown of New York City\u2014which was under occupation by the enemy. In August 1780, Benedict Arnold approached Varick about joining his staff at his newly appointed position as commanding officer of [[West Point, New York|West Point]] (then an active military instillation) as his [[aide-de-camp]] and inspector-general.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/><ref name=\"Jameson1900\">{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=J.

Varick, along with [[David Franks (aide-de-camp)|David Franks]], were arrested. Varick had been ill in bed when informed both of Arnold's treason and his own arrest. Contemporary reports described Varick as spending several days on the edge of madness about Arnold's defection. Despite Arnold writing to Washington personally to say that his aides were not complicit, both Varick and Franks were detained by Washington as a precautionary measure. After a court of inquiry completed its investigation, they found Varick not guilty, and delivered the following:\n\n<blockquote>\u201c''That Lieutenant Colonel Varick\u2019s conduct with respect to the base Peculations and Treasonable Practices of the late General Arnold is not only unimpeachable but think him entitled (throughout every part of his conduct) to a degree of Merit that does him great honor as an Officer and particularly distinguishes him as a sincere Friend to his Country\u2026''\u201d</blockquote>\n\n====Service under General Washington====\nA by-product of the above was the introduction of Varick to [[George Washington]], which would lead to the two working together for the rest of their careers, and lives. This relationship began in 1781 when Washington petitioned the Continental Congress to establish team of writers to record and preserve all of his, and the army's, papers, planning, and correspondence for use by future generations. This would be under the supervision \u201cof a Man of character in whom entire confidence can be placed\u201d. Washington appointed Varick in this role, which made use of his highly respected administrative skills, and would fully rehabilitate his name after the Arnold scandal. Establishing his office at [[Poughkeepsie]], Varick and his assistants spent more than two years in compiling the forty-four folio volumes known as the [[Varick Transcripts]]. Varick served under Washington solely until Washington retired his commission in 1783.<ref name=\"albanyinstitute\">{{cite web|title=Colonel Richard Varick (1753-1831)|url=http://www.albanyinstitute.org/details/items/colonel-richard-varick-1753-1831.html|website=www.albanyinstitute.org|publisher=[[Albany Institute of History and Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"metmuseum\">{{cite web|title=Relates to General Richard Montgomery {{!}} Letter from Richard Varick to DeWitt Clinton, Governor of New York, requesting repayment of cash he has advanced for expenditures relating to the Internment<!--sic--> of the Remains of the late General Montgomery {{!}} The Met|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/667757|website=metmuseum.org|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nUpon completing the assigned duties after years or work, General Washington wrote:\n<blockquote>\u201c''I take this first opportunity of signifying my entire approbation of the manner in which you have executed the important duties of recording secretary; and the satisfaction I feel in having my papers so properly arranged, and so correctly recorded; and beg you will accept my thanks for the care and attention which you have given to this business and beg you be persuaded, that I shall take pleasure in asserting on every occasion, the sense of entertainment of the fidelity, skill and indefatigable industry manifested by you in the performance of your public duties''.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Writings of Washington|url=http://www.archive.org/stream/cu31924092900400/cu31924092900400_djvu.txt|website=www.archive.org|pages=113\u2013114|publisher=New York Free Press|accessdate=16 October 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter he retired from his service in the Continental Army, Varick would remain in service as a colonel in the [[New York State Militia]] until 1801.<ref name=\"Cushman2010\"/>\n\n=====<div style=\"text-align: center;\">The Varick Transcripts</div>=====\nThe Varick Transcripts are deposited in the [[Library of Congress]].

Membership was generally limited to [[Officer (armed forces)|officers]] who had served at least three years in the [[Continental Army]] or [[Continental Navy|Navy]]. The first meeting of the Society was held in May at a dinner at [[Mount Gulian]] (Verplanck House) in [[Fishkill, New York]], before the British [[Evacuation Day (New York)|evacuation from New York City]]. The meeting was chaired by Varick's friend [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] [[Alexander Hamilton]]. The Society has three goals: \"To preserve the rights so dearly won; to promote the continuing union of the states; and to assist members in need, their widows, and their orphans.\" \n\nVarick would also be responsible for maintaining the legacy of George Washington. From 1790 to 1836, celebrations of Washington's birthday in the City included Tammany Hall dinners, Washington Benevolent Society parades, and an intimate open house held each February 22 by [[Mary Simpson (house servant)|Mary Simpson]] (c. 1752 - March 18, 1836), at her John Street grocery.\n\n==Political career==\n===Recorder & Attorney General of New York(1784 - 1789)===\nVarick was the [[Recorder of New York City]] from 1784 to 1789. An office that no longer exists, it is equatable to 'Chief Legal Officer'. In this office, along with [[Samuel Jones (New York comptroller)|Samuel Jones]], he codified New York State's first statutes after Revolution in the [[Laws of New York]] (2 vols., 1789).

During his term as a member of the New York State Assembly, he was [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker]] during the sessions of 1787 and 1788. Varick was appointed the [[New York State Attorney General]] from 1788 to 1789.\n\nRemarkably, due to the elitist nature of the [[New York Constitution|New York State Constitution of 1777]], almost all government positions in the city and state of New York were appointed by the [[Council of Appointment]]. Few, if any, general elections or other democratic functions would exist until 1802. Thus, in the year 1788, Varick was simultaneously the Recorder of New York City, a State Assemblyman representing New York City, the Speaker of the House of the State of New York, and the Attorney General of the State of New York. Though Varick is on record protesting the egregious nature of his occupying multiple offices, it was rationalized at the time that as both an expert administrator and lawyer, he was an ideal choice to fill these myriad offices and to build swiftly the various mechanisms of government. And, that the subsequent laws were codified quickly in the nascent days of an independent New York City and State to ensure the function, and growth, of both entities.\n\n===Mayor of New York City===\n[[File:Richard varick 1805 john trumbull.png|thumb|left|Richard Varick (c.1805) by [[John Trumbull]] which still hangs today in [[New York City Hall]]]]\n[[File:Richard Varick Signature 1796.jpg|thumb|right|Signature of Richard Varick while Mayor of New York (1798)]]\nMost notably, Varick was the [[Mayor of New York City]] for twelve years during the formative post-Independence era from 1789 to 1801.<ref name=\"Marcus1985\">{{cite book|last1=Marcus|first1=Maeva|last2=Perry|first2=James R.|title=The Documentary History of the Supreme Court of the United States, 1789-1800: Suits against states|date=1985|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|isbn=9780231088725|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K7jhBkyoKSUC&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107|accessdate=21 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> While Mayor, he focused on the yellow fever epidemics which struck repeatedly.\n\n==Post-Political Life==\n===Founding of Jersey City===\nIn 1804, Varick, who was out of office and politically unpopular in New York City, joined his friend [[Alexander Hamilton]] to create the Associates of the Jersey Company which would lay the groundwork for modern Jersey City through private development. The consortium behind the company were predominantly [[Federalism|Federalists]] who, like Varick and Hamilton, had been swept out of power in the election of 1800 by [[Thomas Jefferson]] and other [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]]. Large tracts of land in [[Paulus Hook]] were purchased by the company with the titles owned by Varick and his two cousins, Anthony Dey, a prominent attorney and major land owner, and [[Jacob Radcliff]], a Justice of the New York Supreme Court who would later become mayor of New York City (twice) from 1810-1811 and again from 1815 - 1818. They laid out the city squares and streets that still characterize the neighborhood, giving them names also seen in [[Lower Manhattan]] or after war heroes (Grove, Varick, Mercer, Wayne, Monmouth and Montgomery among them).<ref>{{cite web|title=Associates of the Jersey Company, 1804 Jersey City's Founding Fathers|url=https://njcu.libguides.com/jerseycitypastandpresent/associatesofthejerseycompany|website=njcu.libguides.com|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1816, Colonel Varick purchased lots on the north side of Essex Street and built Prospect Hall overlooking the Hudson River.

consecutive season in the [[Liga I]], and its 22nd overall season in the top-flight of Romanian football. It was the first season with new shirt supplier Masita.\n\nO\u021belul's primary objective will be to obtain a qualifying spot for the [[2011\u201312 UEFA Europa League|2011\u20132012 season]] of [[Europa League]].\n\n==Overview==\nThe [[2009\u201310 Liga I|previous]] season of Liga I ended on May 22 and the players went on vacation. On June 10 the team returned from holiday, with two new faces: [[Lauren\u0163iu Bu\u015f]], which returned from a 6-month loan from [[Arie\u015ful Turda]], team from which he was initially bought in January 2010 but loaned back to finish the season there, and [[Georgian Butoi]] \u2013 a youth player signed up from [[FC Farul Constan\u0163a|Farul Constan\u0163a]].\n\nThe team trained in Gala\u021bi for a few days and on June 13 they left for a training camp in [[Poiana Bra\u015fov]].

Due to the ongoing [[Late-2000s recession|economical crisis]] O\u021belul tried to talk some players into cutting down their wages, with players like [[Gabriel Paraschiv|Paraschiv]], [[Gabriel Viglianti|Viglianti]] and [[Milan Perendija|Perendija]] accepting.<ref>{{cite news |title=Respect, Paraschiv! |url=http://www.otelul-galati.ro/stiri.php?id=2483 |work=otelul-galati.ro |date=23 June 2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |language=Romanian}}</ref> The mountain training-camp ended on June 26.\n\nThe team reunited again in Gala\u021bi on June 28 where they started training again. The following day, club president [[Marius Stan (footballer)|Marius Stan]] announced that ticket prices went up because the club needs money to continue or start new investments \u2013 especially the floodlights system, feature without which the team will not be able to play Liga I matches on home ground.\n\nThe team is set for another training camp, this time in Germany, between 2\u201315

He is the winner of the 4th annual [[New Talent Singing Awards]] in 1985. He has released numerous albums throughout his career and mainly has [[R&B]] influenced songs.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life and career===\n\nAlex To was born and raised in Hong Kong to a Filipino singer father Ollie Delfino and the Chinese singer Chang Loo. In 1980, at the age of 18, he studied abroad in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada majoring in commercial design. In 1985, at age 23, he graduated from university and worked as an [[Art Director]] back in Hong Kong. That same year, he entered the 4th annual [[New Talent Singing Awards]] and won first place (the Gold Award). He was then signed to [[Capital Artists]] and began his career in the music industry. His debut [[Standard Cantonese|Cantonese]] album ''\u53ea\u60f3\u7559\u4e0b'' was released in 1986. His first [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] album ''\u8ac7\u60c5\u8aaa\u611b'' was released in 1990 in [[Taiwan]].\nIn 1987, he also met and spent time with Michael Jackson during his visit to Hong Kong.

In the macular degeneration group, five out of eight subjects preferred the VRD images to the [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) or paper images and thought they were better and brighter and were able to see equal or better resolution levels. The Keratoconus patients could all resolve smaller lines in several line tests using the VRD as opposed to their own correction. They also found the VRD images to be easier to view and sharper. As a result of these several tests, virtual retinal display is considered safe technology.\n\nVirtual retinal display creates images that can be seen in ambient daylight and ambient room light. The VRD is considered a preferred candidate to use in a surgical display due to its combination of high resolution and high contrast and brightness. Additional tests show high potential for VRD to be used as a display technology for patients that have low vision.\n\n=====EyeTap=====\n\nThe [[EyeTap]] (also known as Generation-2 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212812/http://wearcam.org/glass.pdf \"GlassEyes\": The Theory of EyeTap Digital Eye Glass, supplemental material for IEEE Technology and Society, Volume Vol. 31, Number 3, 2012, pp. 10\u201314].</ref>) captures rays of light that would otherwise pass through the center of the lens of the wearer's eye, and substitutes synthetic computer-controlled light for each ray of real light.\n\nThe Generation-4 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\" /> (Laser EyeTap) is similar to the VRD (i.e. it uses a computer-controlled laser light source) except that it also has infinite depth of focus and causes the eye itself to, in effect, function as both a camera and a display by way of exact alignment with the eye and resynthesis (in laser light) of rays of light entering the eye.<ref>\"Intelligent Image Processing\", [[John Wiley and Sons]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-471-40637-6}}, 384 p.</ref>\n\n=====Handheld=====\n\nA Handheld display employs a small display that fits in a user's hand.

Handheld display AR promises to be the first commercial success for AR technologies. The two main advantages of handheld AR are the portable nature of handheld devices and the ubiquitous nature of camera phones.

SAR makes use of digital projectors to display graphical information onto physical objects. The key difference in SAR is that the display is separated from the users of the system. Since the displays are not associated with each user, SAR scales naturally up to groups of users, allowing for collocated collaboration between users.\n\nExamples include [[shader lamps]], mobile projectors, virtual tables, and smart projectors. Shader lamps mimic and augment reality by projecting imagery onto neutral objects. This provides the opportunity to enhance the object's appearance with materials of a simple unit\u2014a projector, camera, and sensor.\n\nOther applications include table and wall projections. One innovation, the Extended Virtual Table, separates the virtual from the real by including [[beam splitter|beam-splitter]] mirrors attached to the ceiling at an adjustable angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1162/105474601753272862|title = The Extended Virtual Table: An Optical Extension for Table-Like Projection Systems|journal = Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|volume = 10|issue = 6|pages = 613\u2013631|year = 2001|last1 = Bimber|first1 = Oliver|last2 = Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o|first2 = L.

The computer comprises memory and a processor.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Survey of Augmented Reality Technologies, Applications and Limitations|last=Krevelen, Poelman|first=D.W.F, Ronald|publisher=International Journal of Virtual Reality|year=2010|pages=3, 6}}</ref> The computer takes the scanned environment then generates images or a video and puts it on the receiver for the observer to see. The fixed marks on an object's surface are stored in the memory of a computer. The computer also withdraws from its memory to present images realistically to the onlooker.

The software must derive real world coordinates, independent of camera, and camera images. That process is called [[image registration]], and uses different methods of [[computer vision]], mostly related to [[video tracking]].<ref name=\"recentadvances\" /><ref>Maida, James; Bowen, Charles; Montpool, Andrew; Pace, John.

An '''augogram''' is a computer generated image that is used to create AR. '''Augography''' is the science and software practice of making augograms for AR.\n\nUsually those methods consist of two parts. The first stage is to detect [[interest point detection|interest points]], fiducial markers or [[optical flow]] in the camera images. This step can use [[Feature detection (computer vision)|feature detection]] methods like [[corner detection]], [[blob detection]], [[edge detection]] or [[Thresholding (image processing)|thresholding]], and other [[image processing]] methods.<ref>State, Andrei; Hirota, Gentaro; Chen, David T; Garrett, William; Livingston, Mark.

Some methods assume objects with known geometry (or fiducial markers) are present in the scene. In some of those cases the scene 3D structure should be calculated beforehand. If part of the scene is unknown simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can map relative positions. If no information about scene geometry is available, [[structure from motion]] methods like [[bundle adjustment]] are used. Mathematical methods used in the second stage include: [[projective geometry|projective]] ([[Epipolar geometry|epipolar]]) geometry, [[geometric algebra]], [[Rotation formalisms in three dimensions|rotation representation]] with [[Rotation matrix#Exponential map|exponential map]], [[Kalman filter|kalman]] and [[Particle filter|particle]] filters, [[nonlinear optimization]], [[robust statistics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n[[Augmented Reality Markup Language]] (ARML) is a data standard developed within the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]] (OGC),<ref>{{cite web | title = ARML 2.0 SWG| work = Open Geospatial Consortium website | publisher = Open Geospatial Consortium | url = http://www.opengeospatial.org/projects/groups/arml2.0swg| accessdate = 12 November 2013 }}</ref> which consists of Extensible Markup Language ([[XML]]) grammar to describe the location and appearance of virtual objects in the scene, as well as [[ECMAScript for XML|ECMAScript]] bindings to allow dynamic access to properties of virtual objects.\n\nTo enable rapid development of augmented reality applications, some software development kits (SDKs) have emerged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://augmentedrealitynews.org/ar-sdk/top-5-augmented-reality-sdks/|title=Top 5 AR SDKs|website=|publisher=Augmented Reality News|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813170057/https://augmentedrealitynews.org/ar-sdk/top-5-augmented-reality-sdks/|archive-date=13 August 2013|accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://augmentedworldexpo.com/news/tutorial-top-10-mobile-augmented-reality-sdks-for-developers//|title = Top 10 AR SDKs|publisher = Augmented World Expo|accessdate = 15 November 2013|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131123011106/http://augmentedworldexpo.com/news/tutorial-top-10-mobile-augmented-reality-sdks-for-developers/|archive-date = 23 November 2013|url-status = dead|df = dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe implementation of augmented reality in consumer products requires considering the design of the applications and the related constraints of the technology platform. Since AR systems rely heavily on the immersion of the user and the interaction between the user and the system, design can facilitate the adoption of virtuality. For most augmented reality systems, a similar design guideline can be followed. The following lists some considerations for designing augmented reality applications:\n\n====Environmental/context design====\n\nContext Design focuses on the end-user's physical surrounding, spatial space, and accessibility that may play a role when using the AR system. Designers should be aware of the possible physical scenarios the end-user may be in such as:\n* Public, in which the users use their whole body to interact with the software\n* Personal, in which the user uses a smartphone in a public space\n* Intimate, in which the user is sitting with a desktop and is not really moving\n* Private, in which the user has on a wearable.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://uxdesign.cc/the-principles-of-good-user-experience-design-for-augmented-reality-d8e22777aabd|title=\"The Principles of Good UX for Augmented Reality \u2013 UX Collective.\" UX Collective|last=Wilson|first=Tyler|date=30 January 2018|website=|access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy evaluating each physical scenario, potential safety hazards can be avoided and changes can be made to greater improve the end-user's immersion. [[User experience|UX designers]] will have to define user journeys for the relevant physical scenarios and define how the interface reacts to each.\n\nEspecially in AR systems, it is vital to also consider the spatial and surrounding elements that change the effectiveness of the AR technology. Environmental elements such as lighting and sound can prevent the AR device sensor from detecting necessary data and ruin the immersion of the end-user.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.igi-global.com/book/emerging-technologies-augmented-reality/338|title=Emerging Technologies of Augmented Reality: Interfaces and Design|last1=Haller|first1=Michael|last2=Billinghurst|first2=Mark|last3=Thomas|first3=Bruce|website=igi-global.com|access-date=|isbn=9781599040660|publisher=IGI Global|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother aspect of context design involves the design of the system's functionality and its ability to accommodate user preferences.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.google/products/google-vr/best-practices-mobile-ar-design/|title=Best Practices for Mobile AR Design- Google|date=13 December 2017|website=blog.google|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|title=Human Computer Interaction with Augmented Reality|website=eislab.fim.uni-passau.de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525000513/http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While accessibility tools are common in basic application design, some consideration should be made when designing time-limited prompts (to prevent unintentional operations), audio cues and overall engagement time. It is important to note that in some situations, the application's functionality may hinder the user's ability. For example, applications that is used for driving should reduce the amount of user interaction and use audio cues instead.\n\n====Interaction design====\n\n[[Interaction design]] in augmented reality technology centers on the user's engagement with the end product to improve the overall user experience and enjoyment. The purpose of interaction design is to avoid alienating or confusing the user by organizing the information presented. Since user interaction relies on the user's input, designers must make system controls easier to understand and accessible. A common technique to improve usability for augmented reality applications is by discovering the frequently accessed areas in the device's touch display and design the application to match those areas of control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theblog.adobe.com/basic-patterns-of-mobile-navigation/|title=Basic Patterns of Mobile Navigation|date=9 May 2017|website=theblog.adobe.com|access-date=}}</ref> It is also important to structure the user journey maps and the flow of information presented which reduce the system's overall cognitive load and greatly improves the learning curve of the application.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|title=Principles of Mobile App Design: Engage Users and Drive Conversions|website=thinkwithgoogle.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413185621/https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|archive-date=13 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn interaction design, it is important for developers to utilize augmented reality technology that complement the system's function or purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/inside-out-interaction-design-for-augmented-reality.php|title=Inside Out: Interaction Design for Augmented Reality-UXmatters|website=uxmatters.com|access-date=}}</ref> For instance, the utilization of exciting AR filters and the design of the unique sharing platform in [[Snapchat]] enables users to better the user's social interactions. In other applications that require users to understand the focus and intent, designers can employ a [[reticle]] or [[Ray casting|raycast]] from the device.<ref name=\":5\" /> Moreover, augmented reality developers may find it appropriate to have digital elements scale or react to the direction of the camera and the context of objects that can are detected.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAugmented reality technology allows to utilize the introduction of [[Three-dimensional space|3D space]]. This means that a user can potentially access multiple copies of 2D interfaces within a single AR application.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n====Visual design====\n\nIn general, [[Visual design elements and principles|visual design]] is the appearance of the developing application that engages the user. To improve the graphic interface elements and user interaction, developers may use visual cues to inform the user what elements of UI are designed to interact with and how to interact with them. Since navigating in an AR application may appear difficult and seem frustrating, visual cue design can make interactions seem more natural.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn some augmented reality applications that use a 2D device as an interactive surface, the 2D control environment does not translate well in 3D space making users hesitant to explore their surroundings. To solve this issue, designers should apply visual cues to assist and encourage users to explore their surroundings.\n\nIt is important to note the two main objects in AR when developing VR applications: 3D [[volumetric]] objects that are manipulated and realistically interact with light and shadow; and animated media imagery such as images and videos which are mostly traditional 2D media rendered in a new context for augmented reality.<ref name=\":3\" /> When virtual objects are projected onto a real environment, it is challenging for augmented reality application designers to ensure a perfectly seamless integration relative to the real-world environment, especially with 2D objects. As such, designers can add weight to objects, use depths maps, and choose different material properties that highlight the object's presence in the real world. Another visual design that can be applied is using different [[computer graphics lighting|lighting]] techniques or casting shadows to improve overall depth judgment. For instance, a common lighting technique is simply placing a light source overhead at the 12&nbsp;o\u2019clock position, to create shadows on virtual objects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Possible applications==\nAugmented reality has been explored for many applications, from gaming and entertainment to medicine, education and business. Example application areas described below include archaeology, architecture, commerce and education. Some of the earliest cited examples include augmented reality used to support surgery by providing virtual overlays to guide medical practitioners, to AR content for astronomy and welding.<ref name=\"Dupzyk 2016\"/><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.slashgear.com/dont-be-blind-on-wearable-cameras-insists-ar-genius-20239514/|title=Don't be blind on wearable cameras insists AR genius|date=20 July 2012|work=SlashGear|access-date=21 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Archaeology===\nAR has been used to aid [[Archaeology|archaeological]] research.

Each user can collaborate by mutually \"navigating, searching, and viewing data\". Hrvoje Benko, a researcher in the computer science department at [[Columbia University]], points out that these particular systems and others like them can provide \"3D panoramic images and 3D models of the site itself at different excavation stages\" all the while organizing much of the data in a collaborative way that is easy to use. Collaborative AR systems supply [[multimodal interaction]]s that combine the real world with virtual images of both environments.<ref>{{Cite book |doi = 10.1109/ISMAR.2004.23|chapter = Collaborative Mixed Reality Visualization of an Archaeological Excavation|title = Third IEEE and ACM International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality|pages = 132\u2013140|year = 2004|last1 = Benko|first1 = H.|last2 = Ishak|first2 = E.W.|last3 = Feiner|first3 = S.|isbn = 0-7695-2191-6|chapter-url = https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4835ffa05831617be3e0c36d306b0e0fc339f703}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture===\nAR can aid in visualizing building projects. Computer-generated images of a structure can be superimposed onto a real-life local view of a property before the physical building is constructed there; this was demonstrated publicly by [[Trimble Navigation]] in 2004. AR can also be employed within an architect's workspace, rendering animated 3D visualizations of their 2D drawings. Architecture sight-seeing can be enhanced with AR applications, allowing users viewing a building's exterior to virtually see through its walls, viewing its interior objects and layout.<ref>Divecha, Devina.[http://www.designmena.com/inspiration/augmented-reality-ar-part-architecture-design Augmented Reality (AR) used in architecture and design].

A major difference between augmented reality and straightforward image recognition is that one can overlay multiple media at the same time in the view screen, such as social media share buttons, the in-page video even audio and 3D objects.

As an example, astronomical constellations and the movements of objects in the solar system were oriented in 3D and overlaid in the direction the device was held, and expanded with supplemental video information. Paper-based science book illustrations could seem to come alive as video without requiring the child to navigate to web-based materials.\n\nIn 2013, a project was launched on [[Kickstarter]] to teach about electronics with an educational toy that allowed children to scan their circuit with an iPad and see the electric current flowing around.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://circuits.lightup.io/|title=LightUp - An award-winning toy that teaches kids about circuits and coding|website=LightUp|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110100/https://circuits.lightup.io/|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> While some educational apps were available for AR by 2016, it was not broadly used.

The first was \"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\" by Gerald Baron.<ref name=\"BARO13\">\"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\", ''Emergency Management Magazine'', 24 September 2009</ref> According to Adam Crowe: \"Technologies like augmented reality (ex: Google Glass) and the growing expectation of the public will continue to force professional emergency managers to radically shift when, where, and how technology is deployed before, during, and after disasters.\"<ref name=\"CROW13\">\"What Does the Future Hold for Emergency Management?\", Emergency Management Magazine, 8 November 2013</ref>\n\nAnother early example was a search aircraft looking for a lost hiker in rugged mountain terrain. Augmented reality systems provided aerial camera operators with a geographic awareness of forest road names and locations blended with the camera video. The camera operator was better able to search for the hiker knowing the geographic context of the camera image.

In their 1993 paper \"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\" the authors describe the use of map overlays applied to video from space surveillance telescopes. The map overlays indicated the trajectories of various objects in geographic coordinates. This allowed telescope operators to identify satellites, and also to identify and catalog potentially dangerous space debris.<ref name=\"ABER93\">Abernathy, M., Houchard, J., Puccetti, M., and Lambert, J,\"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\", Proceedings of 1993 Space Surveillance Workshop 30 March to 1 April 1993, pages 189-195</ref>\n\nStarting in 2003 the US Army integrated the SmartCam3D augmented reality system into the Shadow Unmanned Aerial System to aid sensor operators using telescopic cameras to locate people or points of interest. The system combined fixed geographic information including street names, points of interest, airports, and railroads with live video from the camera system. The system offered a \"picture in picture\" mode that allows it to show a synthetic view of the area surrounding the camera's field of view. This helps solve a problem in which the field of view is so narrow that it excludes important context, as if \"looking through a soda straw\". The system displays real-time friend/foe/neutral location markers blended with live video, providing the operator with improved situational awareness.\n\nAs of 2010, Korean researchers are looking to implement mine-detecting robots into the military. The proposed design for such a robot includes a mobile platform that is like a track which would be able to cover uneven distances including stairs.

In the ''Harvard Business Review'', Magid Abraham and Marco Annunziata discuss how AR devices are now being used to \"boost workers' productivity on an array of tasks the first time they're used, even without prior training'.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://hbr.org/2017/03/augmented-reality-is-already-improving-worker-performance|title=Augmented Reality Is Already Improving Worker Performance|last=Abraham|first=Magid|last2=Annunziata|first2=Marco|date=13 March 2017|website=[[Harvard Business Review]]|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref> They contend that \"these technologies increase productivity by making workers more skilled and efficient, and thus have the potential to yield both more economic growth and better jobs\".<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n===Broadcast and live events===\n\nWeather visualizations were the first application of augmented reality in television. It has now become common in weather casting to display full motion video of images captured in real-time from multiple cameras and other imaging devices. Coupled with 3D graphics symbols and mapped to a common virtual geospatial model, these animated visualizations constitute the first true application of AR to TV.\n\nAR has become common in sports telecasting. Sports and entertainment venues are provided with see-through and overlay augmentation through tracked camera feeds for enhanced viewing by the audience. Examples include the yellow \"[[first down]]\" line seen in television broadcasts of [[American football]] games showing the line the offensive team must cross to receive a first down. AR is also used in association with football and other sporting events to show commercial advertisements overlaid onto the view of the playing area. Sections of [[rugby football|rugby]] fields and [[cricket]] pitches also display sponsored images. Swimming telecasts often add a line across the lanes to indicate the position of the current record holder as a race proceeds to allow viewers to compare the current race to the best performance. Other examples include hockey puck tracking and annotations of racing car performance and snooker ball trajectories.<ref name=\"recentadvances\">Azuma, Ronald; Balliot, Yohan; Behringer, Reinhold; Feiner, Steven; Julier, Simon; MacIntyre, Blair.

In September 2017, Snapchat updated its app to include a camera filter that allowed users to render an animated, cartoon version of themselves called \"[[Bitmoji]]\". These animated avatars would be projected in the real world through the camera, and can be photographed or video recorded.<ref>Wagner, Kurt. \"Snapchat's New Augmented Reality Feature Brings Your Cartoon Bitmoji into the Real World.\" Recode, Recode, 14 Sept. 2017, www.recode.net/2017/9/14/16305890/snapchat-bitmoji-ar-Facebook.</ref> In the same month, Snapchat also announced a new feature called \"Sky Filters\" that will be available on its app. This new feature makes use of augmented reality to alter the look of a picture taken of the sky, much like how users can apply the app's filters to other pictures. Users can choose from sky filters such as starry night, stormy clouds, beautiful sunsets, and rainbow.<ref>Miller, Chance. \"Snapchat's Latest Augmented Reality Feature Lets You Paint the Sky with New Filters.\" 9to5Mac, 9to5Mac, 25 Sept. 2017, 9to5mac.com/2017/09/25/how-to-use-snapchat-sky-filters/.</ref>\n\n==The dangers of AR==\n\n===Reality modifications===\nIn a paper titled \"Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO\u201d, researchers at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management claim the game caused \"a disproportionate increase in vehicular crashes and associated vehicular damage, personal injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations, called Pok\u00e9Stops, where users can play the game while driving.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Faccio |first1=Mara |last2=McConnell |first2=John J. |title=Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO |date=2017 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3073723 |ssrn=3073723 }}</ref> Using data from one municipality, the paper extrapolates what that might mean nationwide and concluded \"the increase in crashes attributable to the introduction of Pok\u00e9mon GO is 145,632 with an associated increase in the number of injuries of 29,370 and an associated increase in the number of fatalities of 256 over the period of July 6, 2016, through November 30, 2016.\" The authors extrapolated the cost of those crashes and fatalities at between $2bn and $7.3 billion for the same period. Furthermore, more than one in three surveyed advanced Internet users would like to edit out disturbing elements around them, such as garbage or graffiti.<ref>Peddie, J., 2017, Agumented Reality, Springer{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref> They would like to even modify their surroundings by erasing street signs, billboard ads, and uninteresting shopping windows. So it seems that AR is as much a threat to companies as it is an opportunity. Although, this could be a nightmare to numerous brands that do not manage to capture consumer imaginations it also creates the risk that the wearers of augmented reality glasses may become unaware of surrounding dangers. Consumers want to use augmented reality glasses to change their surroundings into something that reflects their own personal opinions. Around two in five want to change the way their surroundings look and even how people appear to them.\n\nNext, to the possible privacy issues that are described below, overload and over-reliance issues are the biggest danger of AR. For the development of new AR-related products, this implies that the user-interface should follow certain guidelines as not to overload the user with information while also preventing the user from over-relying on the AR system such that important cues from the environment are missed.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\">{{cite journal |last1=Azuma |first1=Ronald T. |title=A Survey of Augmented Reality |journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments |date=August 1997 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=355\u2013385 |doi=10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355 |citeseerx=10.1.1.35.5387 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fdc075d1cc14d64c11c3c860e86a082b761f4a0 }}</ref> This is called the virtually-augmented key.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\"/> Once the key is ignored, people might not desire the real world anymore.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\nThe concept of modern augmented reality depends on the ability of the device to record and analyze the environment in real time. Because of this, there are potential legal concerns over privacy. While the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] allows for such recording in the name of public interest, the constant recording of an AR device makes it difficult to do so without also recording outside of the public domain.

Markers are visual cues which trigger the display of the virtual information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://anymotion.com/en/wissensgrundlagen/augmented-reality-marker|title=What are augmented reality markers ?|website=anymotion.com|access-date=18 June 2019}}</ref> A piece of paper with some distinct geometries can be used. The camera recognizes the geometries by identifying specific points in the drawing. Markerless tracking, also called instant tracking, does not use markers. Instead, the user positions the object in the camera view preferably in a horizontal plane. It uses sensors in mobile devices to accurately detect the real-world environment, such as the locations of walls and points of intersection.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.marxentlabs.com/what-is-markerless-augmented-reality-dead-reckoning/|title=Markerless Augmented Reality is here.|date=9 May 2014|work=Marxent {{!}} Top Augmented Reality Apps Developer|access-date=23 January 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n=====Virtual retinal display=====\n\nA [[virtual retinal display]] (VRD) is a personal display device under development at the [[University of Washington]]'s Human Interface Technology Laboratory under Dr. Thomas A.

In the macular degeneration group, five out of eight subjects preferred the VRD images to the [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) or paper images and thought they were better and brighter and were able to see equal or better resolution levels. The Keratoconus patients could all resolve smaller lines in several line tests using the VRD as opposed to their own correction. They also found the VRD images to be easier to view and sharper. As a result of these several tests, virtual retinal display is considered safe technology.\n\nVirtual retinal display creates images that can be seen in ambient daylight and ambient room light. The VRD is considered a preferred candidate to use in a surgical display due to its combination of high resolution and high contrast and brightness. Additional tests show high potential for VRD to be used as a display technology for patients that have low vision.\n\n=====EyeTap=====\n\nThe [[EyeTap]] (also known as Generation-2 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20131004212812/http://wearcam.org/glass.pdf \"GlassEyes\": The Theory of EyeTap Digital Eye Glass, supplemental material for IEEE Technology and Society, Volume Vol. 31, Number 3, 2012, pp. 10\u201314].</ref>) captures rays of light that would otherwise pass through the center of the lens of the wearer's eye, and substitutes synthetic computer-controlled light for each ray of real light.\n\nThe Generation-4 Glass<ref name=\"GlassEyes\" /> (Laser EyeTap) is similar to the VRD (i.e. it uses a computer-controlled laser light source) except that it also has infinite depth of focus and causes the eye itself to, in effect, function as both a camera and a display by way of exact alignment with the eye and resynthesis (in laser light) of rays of light entering the eye.<ref>\"Intelligent Image Processing\", [[John Wiley and Sons]], 2001, {{ISBN|0-471-40637-6}}, 384 p.</ref>\n\n=====Handheld=====\n\nA Handheld display employs a small display that fits in a user's hand.

Today [[Simultaneous localization and mapping]] (SLAM) markerless trackers such as PTAM (parallel tracking and mapping) are starting to come into use. Handheld display AR promises to be the first commercial success for AR technologies. The two main advantages of handheld AR are the portable nature of handheld devices and the ubiquitous nature of camera phones. The disadvantages are the physical constraints of the user having to hold the handheld device out in front of them at all times, as well as the distorting effect of classically wide-angled mobile phone cameras when compared to the real world as viewed through the eye.<ref>{{cite web |last=Feiner |first=Steve |title=Augmented reality: a long way off? |url=http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/38869/augmented-reality-interview-steve-feiner |work=AR Week |publisher=Pocket-lint |accessdate=3 March 2011|date=3 March 2011}}</ref>\n\nGames such as ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'' and ''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'' utilize an [[Image Linked Map]] (ILM) interface, where approved [[geotagged]] locations appear on a stylized map for the user to interact with.<ref>{{cite web |last=Borge |first=Ariel |title=The story behind 'Pok\u00e9mon Go's' impressive mapping |url=http://mashable.com/2016/07/10/john-hanke-pokemon-go/ |date=11 July 2016 |work=[[Mashable]] |accessdate=13 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n=====Spatial=====\n\n[[Projection mapping|Spatial augmented reality]] (SAR) augments real-world objects and scenes, without the use of special displays such as monitors, head-mounted displays or hand-held devices. SAR makes use of digital projectors to display graphical information onto physical objects. The key difference in SAR is that the display is separated from the users of the system. Since the displays are not associated with each user, SAR scales naturally up to groups of users, allowing for collocated collaboration between users.\n\nExamples include [[shader lamps]], mobile projectors, virtual tables, and smart projectors. Shader lamps mimic and augment reality by projecting imagery onto neutral objects. This provides the opportunity to enhance the object's appearance with materials of a simple unit\u2014a projector, camera, and sensor.\n\nOther applications include table and wall projections. One innovation, the Extended Virtual Table, separates the virtual from the real by including [[beam splitter|beam-splitter]] mirrors attached to the ceiling at an adjustable angle.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1162/105474601753272862|title = The Extended Virtual Table: An Optical Extension for Table-Like Projection Systems|journal = Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments|volume = 10|issue = 6|pages = 613\u2013631|year = 2001|last1 = Bimber|first1 = Oliver|last2 = Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o|first2 = L.

Many more implementations and configurations make spatial augmented reality display an increasingly attractive interactive alternative.\n\nA SAR system can display on any number of surfaces in an indoor setting at once. SAR supports both a graphical visualization and passive [[Haptic perception|haptic]] sensation for the end users.

However, they often rely on computationally intensive computer vision algorithms with extreme latency requirements. To compensate for the lack of computing power, offloading data processing to a distant machine is often desired.

An '''augogram''' is a computer generated image that is used to create AR. '''Augography''' is the science and software practice of making augograms for AR.\n\nUsually those methods consist of two parts. The first stage is to detect [[interest point detection|interest points]], fiducial markers or [[optical flow]] in the camera images. This step can use [[Feature detection (computer vision)|feature detection]] methods like [[corner detection]], [[blob detection]], [[edge detection]] or [[Thresholding (image processing)|thresholding]], and other [[image processing]] methods.<ref>State, Andrei; Hirota, Gentaro; Chen, David T; Garrett, William; Livingston, Mark.

Some methods assume objects with known geometry (or fiducial markers) are present in the scene. In some of those cases the scene 3D structure should be calculated beforehand. If part of the scene is unknown simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can map relative positions. If no information about scene geometry is available, [[structure from motion]] methods like [[bundle adjustment]] are used.

Since AR systems rely heavily on the immersion of the user and the interaction between the user and the system, design can facilitate the adoption of virtuality. For most augmented reality systems, a similar design guideline can be followed. The following lists some considerations for designing augmented reality applications:\n\n====Environmental/context design====\n\nContext Design focuses on the end-user's physical surrounding, spatial space, and accessibility that may play a role when using the AR system. Designers should be aware of the possible physical scenarios the end-user may be in such as:\n* Public, in which the users use their whole body to interact with the software\n* Personal, in which the user uses a smartphone in a public space\n* Intimate, in which the user is sitting with a desktop and is not really moving\n* Private, in which the user has on a wearable.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://uxdesign.cc/the-principles-of-good-user-experience-design-for-augmented-reality-d8e22777aabd|title=\"The Principles of Good UX for Augmented Reality \u2013 UX Collective.\" UX Collective|last=Wilson|first=Tyler|date=30 January 2018|website=|access-date=19 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nBy evaluating each physical scenario, potential safety hazards can be avoided and changes can be made to greater improve the end-user's immersion. [[User experience|UX designers]] will have to define user journeys for the relevant physical scenarios and define how the interface reacts to each.\n\nEspecially in AR systems, it is vital to also consider the spatial and surrounding elements that change the effectiveness of the AR technology. Environmental elements such as lighting and sound can prevent the AR device sensor from detecting necessary data and ruin the immersion of the end-user.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.igi-global.com/book/emerging-technologies-augmented-reality/338|title=Emerging Technologies of Augmented Reality: Interfaces and Design|last1=Haller|first1=Michael|last2=Billinghurst|first2=Mark|last3=Thomas|first3=Bruce|website=igi-global.com|access-date=|isbn=9781599040660|publisher=IGI Global|year=2007}}</ref>\n\nAnother aspect of context design involves the design of the system's functionality and its ability to accommodate user preferences.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://blog.google/products/google-vr/best-practices-mobile-ar-design/|title=Best Practices for Mobile AR Design- Google|date=13 December 2017|website=blog.google|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|title=Human Computer Interaction with Augmented Reality|website=eislab.fim.uni-passau.de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525000513/http://www.eislab.fim.uni-passau.de/files/publications/2014/TR2014-HCIwithAR_1.pdf|archive-date=25 May 2018|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> While accessibility tools are common in basic application design, some consideration should be made when designing time-limited prompts (to prevent unintentional operations), audio cues and overall engagement time. It is important to note that in some situations, the application's functionality may hinder the user's ability. For example, applications that is used for driving should reduce the amount of user interaction and use audio cues instead.\n\n====Interaction design====\n\n[[Interaction design]] in augmented reality technology centers on the user's engagement with the end product to improve the overall user experience and enjoyment. The purpose of interaction design is to avoid alienating or confusing the user by organizing the information presented. Since user interaction relies on the user's input, designers must make system controls easier to understand and accessible. A common technique to improve usability for augmented reality applications is by discovering the frequently accessed areas in the device's touch display and design the application to match those areas of control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theblog.adobe.com/basic-patterns-of-mobile-navigation/|title=Basic Patterns of Mobile Navigation|date=9 May 2017|website=theblog.adobe.com|access-date=}}</ref> It is also important to structure the user journey maps and the flow of information presented which reduce the system's overall cognitive load and greatly improves the learning curve of the application.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|title=Principles of Mobile App Design: Engage Users and Drive Conversions|website=thinkwithgoogle.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413185621/https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/principles-of-mobile-app-design-engage-users-and-drive-conversions/|archive-date=13 April 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn interaction design, it is important for developers to utilize augmented reality technology that complement the system's function or purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2009/08/inside-out-interaction-design-for-augmented-reality.php|title=Inside Out: Interaction Design for Augmented Reality-UXmatters|website=uxmatters.com|access-date=}}</ref> For instance, the utilization of exciting AR filters and the design of the unique sharing platform in [[Snapchat]] enables users to better the user's social interactions. In other applications that require users to understand the focus and intent, designers can employ a [[reticle]] or [[Ray casting|raycast]] from the device.<ref name=\":5\" /> Moreover, augmented reality developers may find it appropriate to have digital elements scale or react to the direction of the camera and the context of objects that can are detected.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAugmented reality technology allows to utilize the introduction of [[Three-dimensional space|3D space]]. This means that a user can potentially access multiple copies of 2D interfaces within a single AR application.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n====Visual design====\n\nIn general, [[Visual design elements and principles|visual design]] is the appearance of the developing application that engages the user. To improve the graphic interface elements and user interaction, developers may use visual cues to inform the user what elements of UI are designed to interact with and how to interact with them. Since navigating in an AR application may appear difficult and seem frustrating, visual cue design can make interactions seem more natural.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn some augmented reality applications that use a 2D device as an interactive surface, the 2D control environment does not translate well in 3D space making users hesitant to explore their surroundings. To solve this issue, designers should apply visual cues to assist and encourage users to explore their surroundings.\n\nIt is important to note the two main objects in AR when developing VR applications: 3D [[volumetric]] objects that are manipulated and realistically interact with light and shadow; and animated media imagery such as images and videos which are mostly traditional 2D media rendered in a new context for augmented reality.<ref name=\":3\" /> When virtual objects are projected onto a real environment, it is challenging for augmented reality application designers to ensure a perfectly seamless integration relative to the real-world environment, especially with 2D objects. As such, designers can add weight to objects, use depths maps, and choose different material properties that highlight the object's presence in the real world. Another visual design that can be applied is using different [[computer graphics lighting|lighting]] techniques or casting shadows to improve overall depth judgment. For instance, a common lighting technique is simply placing a light source overhead at the 12&nbsp;o\u2019clock position, to create shadows on virtual objects.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Possible applications==\nAugmented reality has been explored for many applications, from gaming and entertainment to medicine, education and business.

Each user can collaborate by mutually \"navigating, searching, and viewing data\". Hrvoje Benko, a researcher in the computer science department at [[Columbia University]], points out that these particular systems and others like them can provide \"3D panoramic images and 3D models of the site itself at different excavation stages\" all the while organizing much of the data in a collaborative way that is easy to use.

Computer-generated images of a structure can be superimposed onto a real-life local view of a property before the physical building is constructed there; this was demonstrated publicly by [[Trimble Navigation]] in 2004. AR can also be employed within an architect's workspace, rendering animated 3D visualizations of their 2D drawings. Architecture sight-seeing can be enhanced with AR applications, allowing users viewing a building's exterior to virtually see through its walls, viewing its interior objects and layout.<ref>Divecha, Devina.[http://www.designmena.com/inspiration/augmented-reality-ar-part-architecture-design Augmented Reality (AR) used in architecture and design].

As an example, astronomical constellations and the movements of objects in the solar system were oriented in 3D and overlaid in the direction the device was held, and expanded with supplemental video information. Paper-based science book illustrations could seem to come alive as video without requiring the child to navigate to web-based materials.\n\nIn 2013, a project was launched on [[Kickstarter]] to teach about electronics with an educational toy that allowed children to scan their circuit with an iPad and see the electric current flowing around.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://circuits.lightup.io/|title=LightUp - An award-winning toy that teaches kids about circuits and coding|website=LightUp|language=en-US|access-date=29 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180829110100/https://circuits.lightup.io/|archive-date=29 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> While some educational apps were available for AR by 2016, it was not broadly used.

The first was \"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\" by Gerald Baron.<ref name=\"BARO13\">\"Augmented Reality--Emerging Technology for Emergency Management\", ''Emergency Management Magazine'', 24 September 2009</ref> According to Adam Crowe: \"Technologies like augmented reality (ex: Google Glass) and the growing expectation of the public will continue to force professional emergency managers to radically shift when, where, and how technology is deployed before, during, and after disasters.\"<ref name=\"CROW13\">\"What Does the Future Hold for Emergency Management?\", Emergency Management Magazine, 8 November 2013</ref>\n\nAnother early example was a search aircraft looking for a lost hiker in rugged mountain terrain. Augmented reality systems provided aerial camera operators with a geographic awareness of forest road names and locations blended with the camera video. The camera operator was better able to search for the hiker knowing the geographic context of the camera image. Once located, the operator could more efficiently direct rescuers to the hiker's location because the geographic position and reference landmarks were clearly labeled.<ref name=\"COOP07\">{{cite journal |last1=Cooper |first1=Joseph |title=Supporting Flight Control for UAV-Assisted Wilderness Search and Rescue Through Human Centered Interface Design |journal=Theses and Dissertations |date=15 November 2007 |url=https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/1217/ }}</ref>\n\n===Social interaction===\nAR can be used to facilitate social interaction. An augmented reality social network framework called Talk2Me enables people to disseminate information and view others' advertised information in an augmented reality way. The timely and dynamic information sharing and viewing functionalities of Talk2Me help initiate conversations and make friends for users with people in physical proximity.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1109/PERCOM.2018.8444578 |chapter=Talk2Me: A Framework for Device-to-Device Augmented Reality Social Network |title=2018 IEEE International Conference on Pervasive Computing and Communications (Per ''Com'') |pages=1\u201310 |year=2018 |last1=Shu |first1=Jiayu |last2=Kosta |first2=Sokol |last3=Zheng |first3=Rui |last4=Hui |first4=Pan |isbn=978-1-5386-3224-6 |chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0de7cb3483a8d8f867e738250f16ba4f5efacc1f }}</ref> However, use of an AR headset can inhibit the quality of an interaction between two people if one isn't wearing one if the headset becomes a distraction. <ref>{{cite web |title=Effects of Augmented Reality on Social Interactions |url=https://www.electronicsdiary.com/2019/05/effects-of-augmented-reality-on-social.html |website=Electronics Diary}}</ref>\n\nAugmented reality also gives users the ability to practice different forms of social interactions with other people in a safe, risk-free environment. Hannes Kauffman, Associate Professor for Virtual Reality at TU [[Vienna]], says: \"In collaborative Augmented Reality multiple users may access a shared space populated by virtual objects, while remaining grounded in the real world. This technique is particularly powerful for educational purposes when users are collocated and can use natural means of communication (speech, gestures, etc.), but can also be mixed successfully with immersive VR or remote collaboration.\"{{cite quote|date=October 2019}} Hannes cites [[education]] as a potential use of this technology.\n\n===Video games===\n{{See also|List of augmented reality software#Games|l1=List of augmented reality software \u00a7 Games}}\n[[File:Desjardins AR Augmented Reality Game, March 2013.png|thumb|upright|alt= An image from an AR mobile game | An AR mobile game using a trigger image as [[fiducial marker]]]]\n\nThe gaming industry embraced AR technology.

In their 1993 paper \"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\" the authors describe the use of map overlays applied to video from space surveillance telescopes. The map overlays indicated the trajectories of various objects in geographic coordinates. This allowed telescope operators to identify satellites, and also to identify and catalog potentially dangerous space debris.<ref name=\"ABER93\">Abernathy, M., Houchard, J., Puccetti, M., and Lambert, J,\"Debris Correlation Using the Rockwell WorldView System\", Proceedings of 1993 Space Surveillance Workshop 30 March to 1 April 1993, pages 189-195</ref>\n\nStarting in 2003 the US Army integrated the SmartCam3D augmented reality system into the Shadow Unmanned Aerial System to aid sensor operators using telescopic cameras to locate people or points of interest. The system combined fixed geographic information including street names, points of interest, airports, and railroads with live video from the camera system. The system offered a \"picture in picture\" mode that allows it to show a synthetic view of the area surrounding the camera's field of view. This helps solve a problem in which the field of view is so narrow that it excludes important context, as if \"looking through a soda straw\". The system displays real-time friend/foe/neutral location markers blended with live video, providing the operator with improved situational awareness.\n\nAs of 2010, Korean researchers are looking to implement mine-detecting robots into the military. The proposed design for such a robot includes a mobile platform that is like a track which would be able to cover uneven distances including stairs. The robot's mine detection sensor would include a combination of metal detectors and [[Ground-penetrating radar]] to locate mines or [[Improvised explosive device|IEDs]]. This unique design would be immeasurably helpful in saving lives of Korean soldiers.<ref name=\"Kang 2010\">{{cite proceedings |last1=Kang |first1=Seong Pal|last2=Choi|first2=Junho|last3=Suh|first3=Seung-Beum|last4=Kang|first4=Sungchul |title=Design of mine detection robot for Korean mine field |journal=2010 IEEE Workshop on Advanced Robotics and its Social Impacts |date=October 2010 |pages=53\u201356 |doi=10.1109/ARSO.2010.5679622}}</ref>\n\nResearchers at USAF Research Lab (Calhoun, Draper et al.) found an approximately two-fold increase in the speed at which UAV sensor operators found points of interest using this technology.<ref name=\"CALH05\">Calhoun, G.

It has now become common in weather casting to display full motion video of images captured in real-time from multiple cameras and other imaging devices. Coupled with 3D graphics symbols and mapped to a common virtual geospatial model, these animated visualizations constitute the first true application of AR to TV.\n\nAR has become common in sports telecasting. Sports and entertainment venues are provided with see-through and overlay augmentation through tracked camera feeds for enhanced viewing by the audience. Examples include the yellow \"[[first down]]\" line seen in television broadcasts of [[American football]] games showing the line the offensive team must cross to receive a first down. AR is also used in association with football and other sporting events to show commercial advertisements overlaid onto the view of the playing area. Sections of [[rugby football|rugby]] fields and [[cricket]] pitches also display sponsored images. Swimming telecasts often add a line across the lanes to indicate the position of the current record holder as a race proceeds to allow viewers to compare the current race to the best performance. Other examples include hockey puck tracking and annotations of racing car performance and snooker ball trajectories.<ref name=\"recentadvances\">Azuma, Ronald; Balliot, Yohan; Behringer, Reinhold; Feiner, Steven; Julier, Simon; MacIntyre, Blair.

In September 2017, Snapchat updated its app to include a camera filter that allowed users to render an animated, cartoon version of themselves called \"[[Bitmoji]]\". These animated avatars would be projected in the real world through the camera, and can be photographed or video recorded.<ref>Wagner, Kurt. \"Snapchat's New Augmented Reality Feature Brings Your Cartoon Bitmoji into the Real World.\" Recode, Recode, 14 Sept. 2017, www.recode.net/2017/9/14/16305890/snapchat-bitmoji-ar-Facebook.</ref> In the same month, Snapchat also announced a new feature called \"Sky Filters\" that will be available on its app. This new feature makes use of augmented reality to alter the look of a picture taken of the sky, much like how users can apply the app's filters to other pictures. Users can choose from sky filters such as starry night, stormy clouds, beautiful sunsets, and rainbow.<ref>Miller, Chance. \"Snapchat's Latest Augmented Reality Feature Lets You Paint the Sky with New Filters.\" 9to5Mac, 9to5Mac, 25 Sept. 2017, 9to5mac.com/2017/09/25/how-to-use-snapchat-sky-filters/.</ref>\n\n==The dangers of AR==\n\n===Reality modifications===\nIn a paper titled \"Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO\u201d, researchers at Purdue University's Krannert School of Management claim the game caused \"a disproportionate increase in vehicular crashes and associated vehicular damage, personal injuries, and fatalities in the vicinity of locations, called Pok\u00e9Stops, where users can play the game while driving.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Faccio |first1=Mara |last2=McConnell |first2=John J. |title=Death by Pok\u00e9mon GO |date=2017 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.3073723 |ssrn=3073723 }}</ref> Using data from one municipality, the paper extrapolates what that might mean nationwide and concluded \"the increase in crashes attributable to the introduction of Pok\u00e9mon GO is 145,632 with an associated increase in the number of injuries of 29,370 and an associated increase in the number of fatalities of 256 over the period of July 6, 2016, through November 30, 2016.\" The authors extrapolated the cost of those crashes and fatalities at between $2bn and $7.3 billion for the same period. Furthermore, more than one in three surveyed advanced Internet users would like to edit out disturbing elements around them, such as garbage or graffiti.<ref>Peddie, J., 2017, Agumented Reality, Springer{{page needed|date=October 2019}}</ref> They would like to even modify their surroundings by erasing street signs, billboard ads, and uninteresting shopping windows. So it seems that AR is as much a threat to companies as it is an opportunity. Although, this could be a nightmare to numerous brands that do not manage to capture consumer imaginations it also creates the risk that the wearers of augmented reality glasses may become unaware of surrounding dangers. Consumers want to use augmented reality glasses to change their surroundings into something that reflects their own personal opinions. Around two in five want to change the way their surroundings look and even how people appear to them.\n\nNext, to the possible privacy issues that are described below, overload and over-reliance issues are the biggest danger of AR. For the development of new AR-related products, this implies that the user-interface should follow certain guidelines as not to overload the user with information while also preventing the user from over-relying on the AR system such that important cues from the environment are missed.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\">{{cite journal |last1=Azuma |first1=Ronald T. |title=A Survey of Augmented Reality |journal=Presence: Teleoperators and Virtual Environments |date=August 1997 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=355\u2013385 |doi=10.1162/pres.1997.6.4.355 |citeseerx=10.1.1.35.5387 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4fdc075d1cc14d64c11c3c860e86a082b761f4a0 }}</ref> This is called the virtually-augmented key.<ref name=\"Azuma, R. T. 1997\"/> Once the key is ignored, people might not desire the real world anymore.\n\n===Privacy concerns===\nThe concept of modern augmented reality depends on the ability of the device to record and analyze the environment in real time. Because of this, there are potential legal concerns over privacy. While the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] allows for such recording in the name of public interest, the constant recording of an AR device makes it difficult to do so without also recording outside of the public domain. Legal complications would be found in areas where a right to a certain amount of privacy is expected or where copyrighted media are displayed.\n\nIn terms of individual privacy, there exists the ease of access to information that one should not readily possess about a given person. This is accomplished through facial recognition technology. Assuming that AR automatically passes information about persons that the user sees, there could be anything seen from social media, criminal record, and marital status.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1145/2638728.2641709 |chapter=Augmented reality |title=Proceedings of the 2014 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing Adjunct Publication - UbiComp '14 Adjunct |pages=1283\u20131288 |year=2014 |last1=Roesner |first1=Franziska |last2=Kohno |first2=Tadayoshi |last3=Denning |first3=Tamara |last4=Calo |first4=Ryan |last5=Newell |first5=Bryce Clayton |isbn=978-1-4503-3047-3 |chapter-url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/9acde5d5b02484f4296712c522fb2bf0024eafbe }}</ref>\n\nThe Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation, which was originally introduced by [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] in 2004 and further refined with [[Ray Kurzweil]] and [[Marvin Minsky]] in 2013, was ultimately ratified at the Virtual Reality Toronto conference on June 25, 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.ebrary.net/123089/sociology/code_ethics_human_augmentation|title=The Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation - Augmented Reality : Where We Will All Live -|website=m.ebrary.net|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/the-future-of-tech-just-c_b_10929608|title=The Future of Tech Just Changed at VRTO--Here's Why That Matters to You|last=Damiani|first=Jesse|last2=|first2=|date=2016-07-18|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2019-11-18|last3=|first3=|last4=|first4=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrfocus.com/2016/07/vrto-spearheads-code-of-ethics-on-human-augmentation/|title=VRTO Spearheads Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation|website=VRFocus|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eyetap.org/hacode/|title=The Code of Ethics on Human Augmentation|website=www.eyetap.org|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref>\n\n== Notable researchers ==\n* [[Ivan Sutherland]] invented the [[The Sword of Damocles (virtual reality)|first VR head-mounted display]] at [[Harvard University]].\n* [[Steve Mann (inventor)|Steve Mann]] formulated an earlier concept of [[mediated reality]] in the 1970s and 1980s, using cameras, processors, and display systems to modify visual reality to help people see better (dynamic range management), building computerized welding helmets, as well as \"augmediated reality\" vision systems for use in everyday life.

The Main Boreholes show eustatic changes on the marine conditions, with a retreat of the sea level, leading to the appearance of vegetation and abundant pollen on the uppermost parts of the formation. The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation. As the level of the sea recovered on the Toarcian, mostly of the setting turn out to be a bathial marine bottom.<ref>Feldman-Olszewska, A. (1997).

Between them, FCSB (26 times) and Dinamo (18 times) have won the [[Liga I|Romanian football championship]] 44 times out of 101 completed seasons, resulting in a percentage of {{#expr: 44/101 * 100 round 2}}%. This supremacy extends also to the [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]] (22 times for FCSB and 13 times for Dinamo) and the [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]] (6 times for FCSB and 2 times for Dinamo).\n\nThey are also the two Romanian football teams with the best results in club competitions organised by [[UEFA]]. FCSB won the [[European Cup]] in [[European Cup 1985\u201386|1986]], was runner-up in the same competition in [[European Cup 1988\u201389|1989]] after reaching the semi-finals in [[European Cup 1987\u201388|1988]]. In [[UEFA Cup 2005\u201306|2006]], FCSB reached the semi-finals of [[UEFA Cup]].
