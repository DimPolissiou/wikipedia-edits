With partner and wife [[Pang Qing]], he is the 2010 [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic silver medalist]], 2006 & 2010 [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]], a five-time [[Four Continents Championships|Four Continents champion]] (2002, 2004, 2008, 2009 & 2011) and the [[2008-2009 GPF|2008 Grand Prix Final Champion]].\n\n==Career==\nTong was born into a [[Manchu people|Manchurian]] family in the city of [[Harbin]], China, the home of Chinese pair skating. He began skating at age six. He originally competed as a single skater. He then competed as an ice dancer for two years because of his weak jumps. After his short ice dancing career, Tong switched to pairs. He previously competed with Zhang Xiwen. In 1993, coach [[Yao Bin]] teamed him up with Qing and they have been skating together ever since.\n\nWhen Yao moved to Beijing, Pang and Tong trained without a coach until 1997, when they began training under Yao again.\n\nPang and Tong did not have a strong junior career, perhaps due to the fact that the Junior Grand Prix did not exist when they were skating at the junior level. They placed 14th, 9th, and 8th at the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]] between 1997 and 1999. After that, they went senior.\n\nPang and Tong won the silver medal at the 1997 Chinese national championships, but did not represent China at the World Championships until 1999. They are the 2000 Chinese national champions. At their first major senior international, the [[1999 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|1999 Four Continents Championships]] (the first Four Continents ever held), they placed 5th. They then went to their first Worlds, where they placed 14th.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, Pang and Tong made their Grand Prix debut. They placed 4th at Skate Canada and 5th at Cup of Russia. They slowly moved up the ranks over the years. At the 2002 Winter Olympics, coming in as the Four Continents Champions, they placed 9th.\n\nFollowing the 2001\u20132002 season, Pang and Tong began to be contenders. They consistently placed on the podium at their Grand Prix events. They won their first World medal (a bronze) at the 2004 World Championships.\n\nAfter their first world medal, they had a rough 2004\u20132005 season and a shaky start at the beginning of the 2005\u20132006 season. They recovered with consistency by the 2006 Olympics, where they placed a controversial 4th behind teammates [[Shen Xue]] & [[Hongbo Zhao]] and [[Zhang Dan]] & [[Zhang Hao (figure skater)|Zhang Hao]].  They went to the 2006 Worlds and won it.\n\nIn the 2006\u20132007 season, Pang and Tong were unable to defend their World title. They were forced to withdraw from Skate America due to injury. They won the silver medal at the Cup of China, the Asian Winter Games, and the Four Continents Championships. At Worlds, they placed second.\n\nDuring the 2007\u20132008 season, Pang and Tong had a rough start, losing two out of their three Grand Prix events. They came back strong midseason by winning the bronze at the Grand Prix Final and their third Four Continents title. They ended their season with a disappointing 5th at the World Championships.\n\nDuring the 2008\u20132009 season, Pang and Tong had another rough outing at their first event, the Cup of China. Despite this, they went on the two win their next Grand Prix events and the final. During that season, they made history, when they went on to win a record setting fourth Four Continents title and have now won more Four Continent titles than any other person. Despite the momentum they had built, they had another disappointing World Championships, where they were once again finished the podium.\n\nDuring the 2009\u20132010 season, Pang and Tong won both of their Grand Prix events and a silver at the Grand Prix Final, defeating all the world medalists at the previous world championship.\n\nIn the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Pang and Tong set a new [[ISU Judging System|World Record]] for the free skate with a score of 141.81 points.<ref>Agence France Presse, [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100216/wl_asia_afp/oly2010fskatepairs \"Shen, Zhao claim China's first figure skating gold\"], Emmeline Moore, 16 February 2010 (accessed 16 February 2010)</ref> They placed second place behind [[Shen Xue]] and [[Hongbo Zhao]] thanks to their teammates world record-setting short program.

August 15, 1979 in [[Harbin]], [[Heilongjiang]]) is a [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] [[pair skater]]. With partner and wife [[Pang Qing]], he is the 2010 [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Olympic silver medalist]], 2006 & 2010 [[World Figure Skating Championships|World Champion]], a five-time [[Four Continents Championships|Four Continents champion]] (2002, 2004, 2008, 2009 & 2011) and the [[2008-2009 GPF|2008 Grand Prix Final Champion]].\n\n==Career==\nTong was born into a [[Manchu people|Manchurian]] family in the city of [[Harbin]], China, the home of Chinese pair skating. He began skating at age six. He originally competed as a single skater. He then competed as an ice dancer for two years because of his weak jumps. After his short ice dancing career, Tong switched to pairs. He previously competed with Zhang Xiwen. In 1993, coach [[Yao Bin]] teamed him up with Qing and they have been skating together ever since.\n\nWhen Yao moved to Beijing, Pang and Tong trained without a coach until 1997, when they began training under Yao again.\n\nPang and Tong did not have a strong junior career, perhaps due to the fact that the Junior Grand Prix did not exist when they were skating at the junior level. They placed 14th, 9th, and 8th at the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]] between 1997 and 1999. After that, they went senior.\n\nPang and Tong won the silver medal at the 1997 Chinese national championships, but did not represent China at the World Championships until 1999. They are the 2000 Chinese national champions. At their first major senior international, the [[1999 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships|1999 Four Continents Championships]] (the first Four Continents ever held), they placed 5th. They then went to their first Worlds, where they placed 14th.\n\nIn the 1999\u20132000 season, Pang and Tong made their Grand Prix debut. They placed 4th at Skate Canada and 5th at Cup of Russia. They slowly moved up the ranks over the years. At the 2002 Winter Olympics, coming in as the Four Continents Champions, they placed 9th.\n\nFollowing the 2001\u20132002 season, Pang and Tong began to be contenders. They consistently placed on the podium at their Grand Prix events. They won their first World medal (a bronze) at the 2004 World Championships.\n\nAfter their first world medal, they had a rough 2004\u20132005 season and a shaky start at the beginning of the 2005\u20132006 season. They recovered with consistency by the 2006 Olympics, where they placed a controversial 4th behind teammates [[Shen Xue]] & [[Hongbo Zhao]] and [[Zhang Dan]] & [[Zhang Hao (figure skater)|Zhang Hao]].  They went to the 2006 Worlds and won it.\n\nIn the 2006\u20132007 season, Pang and Tong were unable to defend their World title. They were forced to withdraw from Skate America due to injury. They won the silver medal at the Cup of China, the Asian Winter Games, and the Four Continents Championships. At Worlds, they placed second.\n\nDuring the 2007\u20132008 season, Pang and Tong had a rough start, losing two out of their three Grand Prix events. They came back strong midseason by winning the bronze at the Grand Prix Final and their third Four Continents title. They ended their season with a disappointing 5th at the World Championships.\n\nDuring the 2008\u20132009 season, Pang and Tong had another rough outing at their first event, the Cup of China. Despite this, they went on the two win their next Grand Prix events and the final. During that season, they made history, when they went on to win a record setting fourth Four Continents title and have now won more Four Continent titles than any other person. Despite the momentum they had built, they had another disappointing World Championships, where they were once again finished the podium.\n\nDuring the 2009\u20132010 season, Pang and Tong won both of their Grand Prix events and a silver at the Grand Prix Final, defeating all the world medalists at the previous world championship.\n\nIn the [[2010 Winter Olympics]], Pang and Tong set a new [[ISU Judging System|World Record]] for the free skate with a score of 141.81 points.<ref>Agence France Presse, [https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20100216/wl_asia_afp/oly2010fskatepairs \"Shen, Zhao claim China's first figure skating gold\"], Emmeline Moore, 16 February 2010 (accessed 16 February 2010)</ref> They placed second place behind [[Shen Xue]] and [[Hongbo Zhao]] thanks to their teammates world record-setting short program.

The Cubs' AAA club in Ft. Worth recalled Hubbs in October and then purchased his contract outright in November. The end result of this maneuvering was to protect Hubbs from being drafted by another club. This was a sign that the Cubs clearly expected Hubbs to make the major league team in the near future.

Playing outfield and shortstop in the all-rookie competition, Hubbs appeared in 59 games, had 198 at-bats and a batting average of .298. His 50 runs batted in and 8 home runs were enough to earn a nomination for player of the year in the Appalachian League.\n\nOn July 18, 1959, he led Morristown to a 20-0 victory over the first place [[Salem Pirates]].  Hubbs hit 2 home runs and a double and scored 5 runs. Morristown continued the offensive barrage 5 days later against Wytheville.

The Cubs' AAA club in Ft. Worth recalled Hubbs in October and then purchased his contract outright in November. The end result of this maneuvering was to protect Hubbs from being drafted by another club. This was a sign that the Cubs clearly expected Hubbs to make the major league team in the near future.

BBC. April 2003, Retrieved August 23, 2017</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe book is narrated by \"Chief\" Bromden, a gigantic yet docile [[Half-breed|half-Native American]] patient at a psychiatric hospital, who presents himself as deaf and mute. Bromden\u2019s tale focuses mainly on the antics of the rebellious [[Randle McMurphy|Randle Patrick McMurphy]], who faked insanity to serve his sentence for battery and gambling in the hospital rather than at a prison work farm. The head administrative nurse, [[Nurse Ratched]], rules the ward with absolute authority and little medical oversight. She is assisted by her three day-shift orderlies and her assistant doctors.\n\nMcMurphy constantly antagonizes Nurse Ratched and upsets the routines of the ward, leading to endless power struggles between the inmate and the nurse. He runs a card table, captains the ward's basketball team, comments on Nurse Ratched's figure, incites the other patients to conduct a vote about watching the [[World Series]] on television, and organizes an unsupervised deep-sea fishing trip. His reaction after claiming to be able to and subsequently failing to lift a heavy control panel in the defunct [[hydrotherapy]] room (referred to as the \"tub room\") \u2013 \"But at least I tried\" \u2013 gives the men incentive to try to stand up for themselves, instead of allowing Nurse Ratched to take control of every aspect of their lives.  The Chief opens up to McMurphy, revealing late one night that he can speak and hear. A disturbance after the fishing trip results in McMurphy and the Chief being sent for [[electroshock therapy]] sessions, but such punishment does little to curb McMurphy's rambunctious behavior.\n\nOne night, after bribing the night orderly, McMurphy smuggles two prostitute girlfriends with liquor onto the ward and breaks into the pharmacy for codeine cough syrup and unnamed psychiatric medications. McMurphy persuades one of the women to seduce Billy Bibbit, a timid, boyish patient with a terrible [[stutter]] and little experience with women, so he can lose his [[virginity]]. Although McMurphy plans to escape before the morning shift starts, he and the other patients instead fall asleep without cleaning up the mess of the group\u2019s antics, and the morning staff discovers the ward in complete disarray. Nurse Ratched finds Billy and the prostitute in each other's arms, partially dressed, and admonishes him. Billy asserts himself for the first time, answering Nurse Ratched without stuttering. Ratched calmly threatens to tell Billy's mother what she has seen. Billy has an emotional breakdown, and once left alone in the doctor's office, commits suicide by cutting his throat. Nurse Ratched blames McMurphy for the loss of Billy's life. Enraged at what she has done to Billy, McMurphy attacks Ratched, attempting to [[strangle]] her to death, tearing off her uniform and revealing her breasts to the patients and aides who are watching.  McMurphy is physically restrained and moved to the Disturbed ward.\n\nNurse Ratched misses a week of work due to her injuries, during which time many of the patients either transfer to other wards or check out of the hospital forever. When she returns she cannot speak and is thus deprived of her most potent tool to keep the men in line. With Bromden, Martini, and Scanlon the only patients who attended the boat trip left on the ward, McMurphy is brought back in. He has received a [[lobotomy]], and is now in a vegetative state, rendering him silent and motionless. The Chief smothers McMurphy with a pillow during the night in an act of mercy before lifting the tub room control panel that McMurphy could not lift earlier, throwing it through a window and escaping the hospital.\n\n==Background==\n''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sitinmovement.org/history/america-civil-rights-timeline.asp |title=America's Civil Rights Timeline |work=International Civil Rights Center & Museum |year=2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> and deep changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America. The 1960s began the controversial movement towards [[deinstitutionalization]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Stroman |first=Duane |year=2003 |title=The Disability Rights Movement: From Deinstitutionalization to Self-determination |publisher=University Press of America}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus |first1=D.J. |last1=Scherl |first2=L.B. |last2=Macht |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |date=September 1979 |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=599\u2013604 |doi=10.1176/ps.30.9.599 |pmid=223959}}</ref>  an act that would have affected the characters in Kesey's novel. The novel is a direct product of Kesey's time working the [[shift work|graveyard shift]] as an orderly at a mental health facility in [[Menlo Park, California]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mitchell|Snyder|p=174}}</ref> Not only did he speak to the patients and witness the workings of the institution; he also voluntarily took [[psychoactive drugs]], including [[mescaline]] and [[LSD]], as part of [[Project MKUltra]].<ref name=\"Literary Encyclopedia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=4941 |title=Ken Kesey (1935\u20132001) |last=Huffman |first=Bennett |date=May 17, 2002 |encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia |accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his work with [[Project MKUltra]], Kesey took LSD recreationally.

The novel's narrator, the Chief, combines these authorities in his mind, calling them \"The Combine\" in reference to the mechanistic way they manipulate and process individuals. The authority of The Combine is most often personified in the character of Nurse Ratched who controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of rewards and subtle shame.<ref name=\"Time review\" /> Although she does not normally resort to conventionally harsh discipline, her actions are portrayed as more insidious than those of a conventional prison administrator. This is because the subtlety of her actions prevents her prisoners from understanding they are being controlled at all. The Chief also sees the Combine in the damming of the wild [[Columbia River]] at [[Celilo Falls]], where his Native American ancestors hunted, and in the broader conformity of post-war American [[consumer society]]. The novel's critique of the mental ward as an instrument of [[oppression]] comparable to the prison mirrored many of the claims that French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]] was making at the same time. Similarly, Foucault argued that [[taboo|invisible forms of discipline]] oppressed individuals on a broad societal scale, encouraging them to [[Censorship|censor]] aspects of themselves and their actions. The novel also criticizes the emasculation of men in society, particularly in the character of Billy Bibbit, the stuttering Acute patient who is domineered by both Nurse Ratched and his mother.\n\nCentral elements of ''One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'' embody Erving Goffman's sociological analysis of total institutions, particularly the analytical subset of mental hospitals. Goffman's description of admission procedures in total institutions, for example, reflects the notion of \"the combine\" espoused by Chief Brombden's character: \u201cAdmission procedures might be called \u2018trimming\u2019 or \u2018programming\u2019 because in thus being squared away the new arrival allows himself to be shaped and coded into an object that can be fed into the administrative machinery, to be worked on smoothly by routine operations\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Goffman, Erving, author.|title=Asylums : Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|isbn=978-1-351-32776-3|oclc=1004358134}}</ref> (p.&nbsp;16).  Further, the behavior of the patients in ''One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'' represent the range of adaptations to total institutions delineated in section VI of \"The Inmate World\" in the essay, \"Characteristics of Total Institutions.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Title==\nThe title of the book is a line from a nursery rhyme:\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\">\nVintery, mintery, cutery, corn,\nApple seed and apple thorn,\nWire, briar, limber lock\nThree geese in a flock\nOne flew East\nOne flew West\nAnd one flew over the cuckoo's nest\n</poem>\nChief Bromden's grandmother sang a version of this song to him when he was a child, a fact revealed in the story when the Chief received yet another ECT treatment after he assisted McMurphy with defending George, a patient being abused by the ward's aides.\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''[[Randle McMurphy]]:''' A free-spirited, rebellious con man, sent to the hospital from a prison work farm. He is guilty of [[Battery (crime)|battery]] and [[gambling]]. He had also been charged with, but never convicted of - due to the girl in question not wishing to testify so as not to implicate herself and her willingness to participate - [[statutory rape]]. McMurphy is transferred from a prison work farm to the hospital, thinking it will be an easy way to serve out his sentence in comfort. In the end, McMurphy attacks Nurse Ratched, sacrificing his freedom and his health in exchange for freeing the previously shackled spirits of the cowed patients on the ward.\n* '''Chief Bromden:''' The novel's half-Native American narrator has been in the mental hospital since the end of [[World War II]]. Bromden is presumed by staff and patients alike to be deaf and mute, and through this guise he becomes privy to many of the ward's dirtiest secrets.<ref name=\"Time review\" />  As a young man, the Chief was a high school [[American football|football]] star, a college student, and a [[Battle of Anzio|war hero]]. After seeing his father, a Native American chieftain, humiliated at the hands of the [[U.S. government]] and his white wife, Chief Bromden descends into clinical depression and begins hallucinating. Soon he is diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. He believes society is controlled by a large, mechanized system which he calls \"The Combine.\"\n** Richard Gray, author of ''A History of American Literature'', said Bromden \"supplies\" the novel's \"vision\".<ref name=\"Gray574\">{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Richard |title=A History of American Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49mOWts2oaQC&pg=PT574&lpg=PT574&dq=%22Randle+McMurphy%22 |accessdate=June 15, 2015|date=September 23, 2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-4568-1 |page=574 }}</ref> Gray explains Bromden's \"eye\" \"sees the inner truth\" and Bromden \"is an outsider, an innocent eye in a way like [[Huck Finn]], but what he sees is far stranger, far more surreal.\"<ref name=\"Gray574\" /> Gray explained Bromden's vision \"may not be literally true but it is symbolically so because, to quote [[Emily Dickinson]] again, 'Much madness is divinest sense.'\"<ref name=\"Gray574\" /> The first chapter ends with the Chief pleading to the reader, \"...you think this is too horrible to have really happened, this is too awful to be the truth! But, please. It's still hard for me to have a clear mind thinking on it. But it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\"\n\n===Staff===\n* '''[[Nurse Ratched]] (also known as \"Big Nurse\"):''' The tyrannical head nurse of the mental institution, who exercises near-total control over those in her care, including her subordinates. She will not hesitate to restrict her patients' access to medication, amenities, and basic human necessities if it suits her manipulative whims. Her favorite informant is the timid Billy Bibbit, whom she coerces into divulging the unit's secrets by threatening to complain about him to his mother. McMurphy's fun-loving, rebellious presence in Ratched's institution is a constant annoyance, as neither threats nor punishment nor shock therapy will stop him or the patients under his sway. Eventually, after McMurphy nearly chokes her to death in a fit of rage, Nurse Ratched has him lobotomized. However, the damage has already been done, and Nurse Ratched's rule is broken after McMurphy's attack leaves her nearly unable to speak, which renders her unable to intimidate her patients, subordinates and superiors.\n* '''The \"Black Boys\" Washington, Williams and Warren:''' Three black men who work as aides in the ward. Williams is a [[dwarfism|dwarf]], his growth stunted after witnessing his mother being raped by white men. The Chief says Nurse Ratched hired them for their sadistic nature.\n* '''Dr. John Spivey:''' The ward doctor. Nurse Ratched drove off other doctors, but she kept Spivey because he always did as he was told. Harding suggests that the nurse could threaten to expose him as a drug addict if he stood up to her. McMurphy's rebellion inspires him to stand up to Nurse Ratched.\n* '''Nurse Pilbow:''' The young night nurse. Her face, neck, and chest are stained with a profound [[birthmark]]. She is a devout Catholic and fears sinning. She blames the patients for infecting her with their evil and takes it out on them.\n* '''Mr. Turkle:''' An elderly African American aide who works the late shift in the ward. He agrees to let McMurphy host a party and sneak in prostitutes one night.\n* '''The Japanese Nurse:''' The nurse in charge of the upstairs disturbed ward, for violent and unmanageable patients. She is kind and openly opposes Nurse Ratched's methods.\n\n===Acutes===\nThe acutes are patients who officials believe can still be cured. With few exceptions, they are there voluntarily, a fact that angers McMurphy when he first learns of it, then later causes him to feel further pity for the patients, thus further inspiring him to prove to them they can still be strong despite their seeming willingness to be weak.\n* '''Billy Bibbit:''' A nervous, shy, and boyish patient with an extreme speech impediment, Billy cuts and burns himself, and has attempted suicide numerous times. Billy has a fear of women, especially those with authority such as his mother. To alleviate this, McMurphy sneaks a prostitute into the ward so Billy can lose his virginity. The next morning, Nurse Ratched threatens to tell his mother; fearing the loss of his mother's love, Billy has an emotional breakdown and commits suicide by cutting his own throat.\n* '''Dale Harding:''' The unofficial leader of the patients before McMurphy arrives, he is an intelligent, good-looking man who's ashamed of his repressed [[homosexuality]]. Harding's beautiful yet malcontent wife is a source of shame for him.\n* '''George Sorensen:''' A man with [[germaphobia]], he spends his days washing his hands in the ward's drinking fountain. McMurphy manages to persuade him to lead a fishing expedition for the patients after discovering he had captained a [[PT boat]] during World War II. Afterward, the three black boys maliciously forcibly [[louse|delouse]] him, cruelly knowing the mental anguish this will cause him.\n* '''Charlie Cheswick:''' A loud-mouthed patient who always demands changes in the ward, but never has the courage to see anything through. He finds a friend in McMurphy, who's able to voice his opinions for him. At one point McMurphy decides to fall in line when he learns his stay in the ward is indefinite and his release is solely determined by the Big Nurse. As a result, Cheswick drowns himself in the ward's swimming pool when he decides he himself will never escape the relentless Big Nurse.\n* '''Martini:''' A patient who suffers from severe hallucinations. \n* '''Scanlon:''' A patient obsessed with explosives and destruction. He is the only other non-vegetative patient confined to the ward by force aside from McMurphy and Bromden; the rest can leave at any time.\n* '''Jim Sefelt and Bruce Fredrickson:''' Two [[epileptic]] patients. Sefelt refuses to take his anti-seizure medication, as it makes his teeth fall out and as such makes him self-conscious over his appearance. Fredrickson takes Sefelt's medication as well as his own because he is terrified of the seizures, and loses teeth due to the resulting overdosage.\n* '''Max Taber:''' An unruly patient who was released before McMurphy arrived, a broken man. The Chief later describes how, after he questioned what was in his medication, Nurse Ratched had him \"fixed.\"\n\n===Chronics===\nThe chronics are patients who will never be cured. Many of the chronics are elderly and/or in vegetative states.\n* '''Ruckly:''' A hell-raising patient who challenges the rules until the Big Nurse authorizes his lobotomy.  After the [[lobotomy]], he sits and stares at a picture of his wife, and occasionally screams profanities.\n* '''Ellis:''' Ellis was put in a vegetative state by [[electroshock therapy]]. He stands against the wall in a disturbing [[Messiah|messianic]] position with arms outstretched.\n* '''Pete Bancini:''' Bancini suffered brain damage at birth but managed to hold down simple jobs, such as a [[railroad switch|switch]] operator on a lightly-used railroad [[branch line]], until the switches were automated and he lost his job, after which he was institutionalized. The Chief remembers how once, and only once, he lashed out violently against the aides, telling the other patients that he was a living miscarriage, born dead.\n* '''Rawler:''' A patient on the Disturbed ward, above the main ward, who says nothing but \"loo, loo, loo!\" all day and tries to run up the walls. One night, Rawler castrates himself while sitting on the toilet and bleeds to death before anyone realizes what he has done.\n* '''Old Blastic:''' An old patient who is in a vegetative state. The first night McMurphy is in the ward, Bromden dreams Blastic is hung by his heel and sliced open, spilling his rusty visceral matter. The next morning, Bromden learns Blastic died during the night.\n* '''The Lifeguard:''' An ex-professional [[American football|football]] player, he still has the cleat marks on his forehead from the injury that scrambled his brains. He explains to McMurphy, unlike prison, patients are kept in the hospital as long as the staff desires. It is this conversation that causes McMurphy to fall in line for a time.\n* '''Colonel Matterson:''' The oldest patient in the ward, he suffers from severe [[senile dementia]] and cannot move without a wheelchair. He is a veteran of the First World War, and spends his days \"explaining\" objects through [[metaphor]].\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Candy:''' The prostitute McMurphy brings on the fishing trip. Billy Bibbit has a crush on her and McMurphy arranges a night for Candy to sleep with him.\n* '''Sandra:''' Another prostitute and friend of Candy and McMurphy. She and Sefelt sleep together on the night she and Candy are sneaked into the ward late one night. Sefelt has a seizure while they are having sex.\n* '''Vera Harding:''' Dale Harding's wife. Described as very attractive. She is a primary cause of concern for Dale, who often worries about her fidelity.\n\n==Controversy==\n''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' is one of America's most challenged and banned novels.\n* '''1974''': Five residents of [[Strongsville, Ohio]] sued the local Board of Education to remove the novel from classrooms. They deemed the book \"pornographic\" and said it \"glorifies criminal activity, has a tendency to corrupt juveniles, and contains descriptions of bestiality, bizarre violence, and torture, dismemberment, death, and human elimination\".\n* '''1975''': [[Randolph, New York]] and Alton, Oklahoma removed the book from all of their public schools.\n* '''1977''': Schools in [[Westport, Maine]] removed it from required reading lists.\n* '''1978''': Freemont High School in [[St. Anthony, Idaho]] banned it and fired the teacher who assigned it.\n* '''1982''': [[Merrimack, New Hampshire]] High School challenged it.\n* '''1986''': Aberdeen Washington High school challenged it in Honors English classes.\n* '''2000''': [[Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District|Placentia Unified School District]] ([[Yorba Linda, California]]) challenged it. Parents said the teachers could \"choose the best books, but they keep choosing this garbage over and over again\".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ala.org/bbooks/frequentlychallengedbooks/classics |title=Banned & Challenged Classics |work=American Library Association |year=2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe novel was adapted into [[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (play)|a 1963 play]], starring [[Kirk Douglas]] (who purchased the rights to produce it for the stage and motion pictures) as McMurphy and [[Gene Wilder]] as Billy Bibbit.

BBC. April 2003, Retrieved August 23, 2017</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe book is narrated by \"Chief\" Bromden, a gigantic yet docile [[Half-breed|half-Native American]] patient at a psychiatric hospital, who presents himself as deaf and mute. Bromden\u2019s tale focuses mainly on the antics of the rebellious [[Randle McMurphy|Randle Patrick McMurphy]], who faked insanity to serve his sentence for battery and gambling in the hospital rather than at a prison work farm. The head administrative nurse, [[Nurse Ratched]], rules the ward with absolute authority and little medical oversight. She is assisted by her three day-shift orderlies and her assistant doctors.\n\nMcMurphy constantly antagonizes Nurse Ratched and upsets the routines of the ward, leading to endless power struggles between the inmate and the nurse. He runs a card table, captains the ward's basketball team, comments on Nurse Ratched's figure, incites the other patients to conduct a vote about watching the [[World Series]] on television, and organizes an unsupervised deep-sea fishing trip. His reaction after claiming to be able to and subsequently failing to lift a heavy control panel in the defunct [[hydrotherapy]] room (referred to as the \"tub room\") \u2013 \"But at least I tried\" \u2013 gives the men incentive to try to stand up for themselves, instead of allowing Nurse Ratched to take control of every aspect of their lives.  The Chief opens up to McMurphy, revealing late one night that he can speak and hear. A disturbance after the fishing trip results in McMurphy and the Chief being sent for [[electroshock therapy]] sessions, but such punishment does little to curb McMurphy's rambunctious behavior.\n\nOne night, after bribing the night orderly, McMurphy smuggles two prostitute girlfriends with liquor onto the ward and breaks into the pharmacy for codeine cough syrup and unnamed psychiatric medications. McMurphy persuades one of the women to seduce Billy Bibbit, a timid, boyish patient with a terrible [[stutter]] and little experience with women, so he can lose his [[virginity]]. Although McMurphy plans to escape before the morning shift starts, he and the other patients instead fall asleep without cleaning up the mess of the group\u2019s antics, and the morning staff discovers the ward in complete disarray. Nurse Ratched finds Billy and the prostitute in each other's arms, partially dressed, and admonishes him. Billy asserts himself for the first time, answering Nurse Ratched without stuttering. Ratched calmly threatens to tell Billy's mother what she has seen. Billy has an emotional breakdown, and once left alone in the doctor's office, commits suicide by cutting his throat. Nurse Ratched blames McMurphy for the loss of Billy's life. Enraged at what she has done to Billy, McMurphy attacks Ratched, attempting to [[strangle]] her to death, tearing off her uniform and revealing her breasts to the patients and aides who are watching.  McMurphy is physically restrained and moved to the Disturbed ward.\n\nNurse Ratched misses a week of work due to her injuries, during which time many of the patients either transfer to other wards or check out of the hospital forever. When she returns she cannot speak and is thus deprived of her most potent tool to keep the men in line. With Bromden, Martini, and Scanlon the only patients who attended the boat trip left on the ward, McMurphy is brought back in. He has received a [[lobotomy]], and is now in a vegetative state, rendering him silent and motionless. The Chief smothers McMurphy with a pillow during the night in an act of mercy before lifting the tub room control panel that McMurphy could not lift earlier, throwing it through a window and escaping the hospital.\n\n==Background==\n''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' was written in 1959 and published in 1962 in the midst of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sitinmovement.org/history/america-civil-rights-timeline.asp |title=America's Civil Rights Timeline |work=International Civil Rights Center & Museum |year=2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> and deep changes to the way psychology and psychiatry were being approached in America. The 1960s began the controversial movement towards [[deinstitutionalization]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Stroman |first=Duane |year=2003 |title=The Disability Rights Movement: From Deinstitutionalization to Self-determination |publisher=University Press of America}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Deinstitutionalization in the absence of consensus |first1=D.J. |last1=Scherl |first2=L.B. |last2=Macht |journal=Hospital and Community Psychiatry |date=September 1979 |volume=30 |issue=9 |pages=599\u2013604 |doi=10.1176/ps.30.9.599 |pmid=223959}}</ref>  an act that would have affected the characters in Kesey's novel. The novel is a direct product of Kesey's time working the [[shift work|graveyard shift]] as an orderly at a mental health facility in [[Menlo Park, California]].<ref>{{harvnb|Mitchell|Snyder|p=174}}</ref> Not only did he speak to the patients and witness the workings of the institution; he also voluntarily took [[psychoactive drugs]], including [[mescaline]] and [[LSD]], as part of [[Project MKUltra]].<ref name=\"Literary Encyclopedia\">{{cite web |url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/speople.php?rec=true&UID=4941 |title=Ken Kesey (1935\u20132001) |last=Huffman |first=Bennett |date=May 17, 2002 |encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia |accessdate=March 10, 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his work with [[Project MKUltra]], Kesey took LSD recreationally. He advocated for drug use as a path to individual freedom,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonhistoryproject.org/articles/biographies/ken-kesey-biography/ |title=Ken Kesey Biography |work=Oregon History Project |year=2015 |accessdate=June 15, 2015}}</ref> an attitude that was reflected in the views of psychological researchers of the time.<ref name=\"Jean Houston 1966\">Masters, R.E.L. & Jean Houston, (1966) ''The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience'', America Press Inc., 115(4). 110.</ref><ref>''The LSD Pother'' (1966), America Press Inc., 115(14). 377</ref> In the 1960s LSD was thought to offer the best access to the human mind.

The novel's narrator, the Chief, combines these authorities in his mind, calling them \"The Combine\" in reference to the mechanistic way they manipulate and process individuals. The authority of The Combine is most often personified in the character of Nurse Ratched who controls the inhabitants of the novel's mental ward through a combination of rewards and subtle shame.<ref name=\"Time review\" /> Although she does not normally resort to conventionally harsh discipline, her actions are portrayed as more insidious than those of a conventional prison administrator. This is because the subtlety of her actions prevents her prisoners from understanding they are being controlled at all. The Chief also sees the Combine in the damming of the wild [[Columbia River]] at [[Celilo Falls]], where his Native American ancestors hunted, and in the broader conformity of post-war American [[consumer society]]. The novel's critique of the mental ward as an instrument of [[oppression]] comparable to the prison mirrored many of the claims that French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]] was making at the same time. Similarly, Foucault argued that [[taboo|invisible forms of discipline]] oppressed individuals on a broad societal scale, encouraging them to [[Censorship|censor]] aspects of themselves and their actions. The novel also criticizes the emasculation of men in society, particularly in the character of Billy Bibbit, the stuttering Acute patient who is domineered by both Nurse Ratched and his mother.\n\nCentral elements of ''One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'' embody Erving Goffman's sociological analysis of total institutions, particularly the analytical subset of mental hospitals. Goffman's description of admission procedures in total institutions, for example, reflects the notion of \"the combine\" espoused by Chief Brombden's character: \u201cAdmission procedures might be called \u2018trimming\u2019 or \u2018programming\u2019 because in thus being squared away the new arrival allows himself to be shaped and coded into an object that can be fed into the administrative machinery, to be worked on smoothly by routine operations\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Goffman, Erving, author.|title=Asylums : Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates|isbn=978-1-351-32776-3|oclc=1004358134}}</ref> (p.&nbsp;16).  Further, the behavior of the patients in ''One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest'' represent the range of adaptations to total institutions delineated in section VI of the \"The Inmate World\" in the essay, \"Characteristics of Total Institutions.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Title==\nThe title of the book is a line from a nursery rhyme:\n<poem style=\"margin-left:2em;\">\nVintery, mintery, cutery, corn,\nApple seed and apple thorn,\nWire, briar, limber lock\nThree geese in a flock\nOne flew East\nOne flew West\nAnd one flew over the cuckoo's nest\n</poem>\nChief Bromden's grandmother sang a version of this song to him when he was a child, a fact revealed in the story when the Chief received yet another ECT treatment after he assisted McMurphy with defending George, a patient being abused by the ward's aides.\n\n==Main characters==\n* '''[[Randle McMurphy]]:''' A free-spirited, rebellious con man, sent to the hospital from a prison work farm. He is guilty of [[Battery (crime)|battery]] and [[gambling]]. He had also been charged with, but never convicted of - due to the girl in question not wishing to testify so as not to implicate herself and her willingness to participate - [[statutory rape]]. McMurphy is transferred from a prison work farm to the hospital, thinking it will be an easy way to serve out his sentence in comfort. In the end, McMurphy attacks Nurse Ratched, sacrificing his freedom and his health in exchange for freeing the previously shackled spirits of the cowed patients on the ward.\n* '''Chief Bromden:''' The novel's half-Native American narrator has been in the mental hospital since the end of [[World War II]]. Bromden is presumed by staff and patients alike to be deaf and mute, and through this guise he becomes privy to many of the ward's dirtiest secrets.<ref name=\"Time review\" />  As a young man, the Chief was a high school [[American football|football]] star, a college student, and a [[Battle of Anzio|war hero]]. After seeing his father, a Native American chieftain, humiliated at the hands of the [[U.S. government]] and his white wife, Chief Bromden descends into clinical depression and begins hallucinating. Soon he is diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]]. He believes society is controlled by a large, mechanized system which he calls \"The Combine.\"\n** Richard Gray, author of ''A History of American Literature'', said Bromden \"supplies\" the novel's \"vision\".<ref name=\"Gray574\">{{cite book |last=Gray |first=Richard |title=A History of American Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=49mOWts2oaQC&pg=PT574&lpg=PT574&dq=%22Randle+McMurphy%22 |accessdate=June 15, 2015|date=September 23, 2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=978-1-4443-4568-1 |page=574 }}</ref> Gray explains Bromden's \"eye\" \"sees the inner truth\" and Bromden \"is an outsider, an innocent eye in a way like [[Huck Finn]], but what he sees is far stranger, far more surreal.\"<ref name=\"Gray574\" /> Gray explained Bromden's vision \"may not be literally true but it is symbolically so because, to quote [[Emily Dickinson]] again, 'Much madness is divinest sense.'\"<ref name=\"Gray574\" /> The first chapter ends with the Chief pleading to the reader, \"...you think this is too horrible to have really happened, this is too awful to be the truth! But, please. It's still hard for me to have a clear mind thinking on it. But it's the truth even if it didn't happen.\"\n\n===Staff===\n* '''[[Nurse Ratched]] (also known as \"Big Nurse\"):''' The tyrannical head nurse of the mental institution, who exercises near-total control over those in her care, including her subordinates. She will not hesitate to restrict her patients' access to medication, amenities, and basic human necessities if it suits her manipulative whims. Her favorite informant is the timid Billy Bibbit, whom she coerces into divulging the unit's secrets by threatening to complain about him to his mother. McMurphy's fun-loving, rebellious presence in Ratched's institution is a constant annoyance, as neither threats nor punishment nor shock therapy will stop him or the patients under his sway. Eventually, after McMurphy nearly chokes her to death in a fit of rage, Nurse Ratched has him lobotomized. However, the damage has already been done, and Nurse Ratched's rule is broken after McMurphy's attack leaves her nearly unable to speak, which renders her unable to intimidate her patients, subordinates and superiors.\n* '''The \"Black Boys\" Washington, Williams and Warren:''' Three black men who work as aides in the ward. Williams is a [[dwarfism|dwarf]], his growth stunted after witnessing his mother being raped by white men. The Chief says Nurse Ratched hired them for their sadistic nature.\n* '''Dr. John Spivey:''' The ward doctor. Nurse Ratched drove off other doctors, but she kept Spivey because he always did as he was told. Harding suggests that the nurse could threaten to expose him as a drug addict if he stood up to her. McMurphy's rebellion inspires him to stand up to Nurse Ratched.\n* '''Nurse Pilbow:''' The young night nurse. Her face, neck, and chest are stained with a profound [[birthmark]]. She is a devout Catholic and fears sinning. She blames the patients for infecting her with their evil and takes it out on them.\n* '''Mr. Turkle:''' An elderly African American aide who works the late shift in the ward. He agrees to let McMurphy host a party and sneak in prostitutes one night.\n* '''The Japanese Nurse:''' The nurse in charge of the upstairs disturbed ward, for violent and unmanageable patients. She is kind and openly opposes Nurse Ratched's methods.\n\n===Acutes===\nThe acutes are patients who officials believe can still be cured. With few exceptions, they are there voluntarily, a fact that angers McMurphy when he first learns of it, then later causes him to feel further pity for the patients, thus further inspiring him to prove to them they can still be strong despite their seeming willingness to be weak.\n* '''Billy Bibbit:''' A nervous, shy, and boyish patient with an extreme speech impediment, Billy cuts and burns himself, and has attempted suicide numerous times. Billy has a fear of women, especially those with authority such as his mother. To alleviate this, McMurphy sneaks a prostitute into the ward so Billy can lose his virginity. The next morning, Nurse Ratched threatens to tell his mother; fearing the loss of his mother's love, Billy has an emotional breakdown and commits suicide by cutting his own throat.\n* '''Dale Harding:''' The unofficial leader of the patients before McMurphy arrives, he is an intelligent, good-looking man who's ashamed of his repressed [[homosexuality]]. Harding's beautiful yet malcontent wife is a source of shame for him.\n* '''George Sorensen:''' A man with [[germaphobia]], he spends his days washing his hands in the ward's drinking fountain. McMurphy manages to persuade him to lead a fishing expedition for the patients after discovering he had captained a [[PT boat]] during World War II. Afterward, the three black boys maliciously forcibly [[louse|delouse]] him, cruelly knowing the mental anguish this will cause him.\n* '''Charlie Cheswick:''' A loud-mouthed patient who always demands changes in the ward, but never has the courage to see anything through. He finds a friend in McMurphy, who's able to voice his opinions for him. At one point McMurphy decides to fall in line when he learns his stay in the ward is indefinite and his release is solely determined by the Big Nurse. As a result, Cheswick drowns himself in the ward's swimming pool when he decides he himself will never escape the relentless Big Nurse.\n* '''Martini:''' A patient who suffers from severe hallucinations. \n* '''Scanlon:''' A patient obsessed with explosives and destruction. He is the only other non-vegetative patient confined to the ward by force aside from McMurphy and Bromden; the rest can leave at any time.\n* '''Jim Sefelt and Bruce Fredrickson:''' Two [[epileptic]] patients. Sefelt refuses to take his anti-seizure medication, as it makes his teeth fall out and as such makes him self-conscious over his appearance. Fredrickson takes Sefelt's medication as well as his own because he is terrified of the seizures, and loses teeth due to the resulting overdosage.\n* '''Max Taber:''' An unruly patient who was released before McMurphy arrived, a broken man. The Chief later describes how, after he questioned what was in his medication, Nurse Ratched had him \"fixed.\"\n\n===Chronics===\nThe chronics are patients who will never be cured. Many of the chronics are elderly and/or in vegetative states.\n* '''Ruckly:''' A hell-raising patient who challenges the rules until the Big Nurse authorizes his lobotomy.  After the [[lobotomy]], he sits and stares at a picture of his wife, and occasionally screams profanities.\n* '''Ellis:''' Ellis was put in a vegetative state by [[electroshock therapy]]. He stands against the wall in a disturbing [[Messiah|messianic]] position with arms outstretched.\n* '''Pete Bancini:''' Bancini suffered brain damage at birth but managed to hold down simple jobs, such as a [[railroad switch|switch]] operator on a lightly-used railroad [[branch line]], until the switches were automated and he lost his job, after which he was institutionalized. The Chief remembers how once, and only once, he lashed out violently against the aides, telling the other patients that he was a living miscarriage, born dead.\n* '''Rawler:''' A patient on the Disturbed ward, above the main ward, who says nothing but \"loo, loo, loo!\" all day and tries to run up the walls. One night, Rawler castrates himself while sitting on the toilet and bleeds to death before anyone realizes what he has done.\n* '''Old Blastic:''' An old patient who is in a vegetative state. The first night McMurphy is in the ward, Bromden dreams Blastic is hung by his heel and sliced open, spilling his rusty visceral matter. The next morning, Bromden learns Blastic died during the night.\n* '''The Lifeguard:''' An ex-professional [[American football|football]] player, he still has the cleat marks on his forehead from the injury that scrambled his brains. He explains to McMurphy, unlike prison, patients are kept in the hospital as long as the staff desires. It is this conversation that causes McMurphy to fall in line for a time.\n* '''Colonel Matterson:''' The oldest patient in the ward, he suffers from severe [[senile dementia]] and cannot move without a wheelchair. He is a veteran of the First World War, and spends his days \"explaining\" objects through [[metaphor]].\n\n===Other characters===\n* '''Candy:''' The prostitute McMurphy brings on the fishing trip. Billy Bibbit has a crush on her and McMurphy arranges a night for Candy to sleep with him.\n* '''Sandra:''' Another prostitute and friend of Candy and McMurphy. She and Sefelt sleep together on the night she and Candy are sneaked into the ward late one night. Sefelt has a seizure while they are having sex.\n* '''Vera Harding:''' Dale Harding's wife. Described as very attractive. She is a primary cause of concern for Dale, who often worries about her fidelity.\n\n==Controversy==\n''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' is one of America's most challenged and banned novels.\n* '''1974''': Five residents of [[Strongsville, Ohio]] sued the local Board of Education to remove the novel from classrooms. They deemed the book \"pornographic\" and said it \"glorifies criminal activity, has a tendency to corrupt juveniles, and contains descriptions of bestiality, bizarre violence, and torture, dismemberment, death, and human elimination\".\n* '''1975''': [[Randolph, New York]] and Alton, Oklahoma removed the book from all of their public schools.\n* '''1977''': Schools in [[Westport, Maine]] removed it from required reading lists.\n* '''1978''': Freemont High School in [[St. Anthony, Idaho]] banned it and fired the teacher who assigned it.\n* '''1982''': [[Merrimack, New Hampshire]] High School challenged it.\n* '''1986''': Aberdeen Washington High school challenged it in Honors English classes.\n* '''2000''': [[Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District|Placentia Unified School District]] ([[Yorba Linda, California]]) challenged it.

It is based on the [[Gregory Maguire]] novel ''[[Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West]]'' (published in 1995), itself a retelling of the classic 1900 novel, ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' by [[L. Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B. Platt and [[David Stone (producer)|David Stone]], with direction by [[Joe Mantello]] and choreography by [[Wayne Cilento]], the original production of ''Wicked'' premiered on Broadway at the [[Gershwin Theatre]] in October 2003, after completing pre-Broadway tryouts at San Francisco's [[Curran Theatre]] in May/June of that same year. Its original stars included [[Idina Menzel]] as Elphaba, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Glinda, and [[Joel Grey]] as the Wizard.<ref name=\"ibdb\">{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=13485 |title=Wicked |accessdate= November 8, 2007 |work= [[Internet Broadway Database]]}}</ref> The original Broadway production won three [[Tony Award]]s and seven [[Drama Desk Award]]s, while its original cast album received a [[Grammy Award]].\n\n''Wicked'' celebrated its sixteenth anniversary on Broadway on October 30, 2019.

Platt|Marc Platt]] to realize Schwartz's own intended adaptation. Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways. It is designed to set the reader thinking about what it really is to be \"Wicked\", and whether good intentions with bad results are the same as bad intentions with bad results. Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda.

[[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]].

Frank Baum]] and the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' (1939).\n\nThe musical is told from the perspective of the [[Witchcraft|witches]] of the [[Land of Oz]]; its plot begins before and continues after [[Dorothy Gale]] arrives in Oz from [[Kansas]], and includes several references to the 1939 film and Baum's novel. ''Wicked'' tells the story of two unlikely friends, [[Elphaba]] (the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]) and Galinda (whose name later changes to [[Glinda the Good Witch]]), who struggle through opposing personalities and viewpoints, rivalry over the same love-interest, reactions to the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wizard]]'s corrupt government, and, ultimately, Elphaba's private fall from grace.\n\nProduced by Universal Stage Productions in coalition with [[Marc E. Platt|Marc Platt]], Jon B.

Persuaded, Platt signed on as joint producer of the project with Universal and David Stone.<ref name=rightstowicked/>\n\nThe novel, described as a political, social, and ethical commentary on the nature of good and evil, takes place in the [[Land of Oz]], in the years leading to [[Dorothy Gale|Dorothy]]'s arrival. The story centers on [[Elphaba]], the misunderstood, smart, and fiery girl of emerald-green skin who grows up to become the notorious [[Wicked Witch of the West]] and Galinda, the beautiful, blonde, popular girl who grows up to become [[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda]] the [[Good Witch of the South]]. The story is divided into five different sections based on the plot location and presents events, characters, and situations from Baum's ''The Wonderful Wizard of Oz'' (1900) and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]] in new ways.

Schwartz considered how best to condense the novel's dense and complicated plot into a sensible script.<ref name=briefhistory/> To this end, he collaborated with [[Emmy Award]]\u2013winning writer [[Winnie Holzman]] to develop the outline of the plot over the course of a year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-holzman.htm |title=Winnie Holzman \u2013 Wicked's book writer |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz}}</ref> while meeting with producer Marc Platt to refine the structural outline of the show, spinning an original stage piece rather than creating a strict adaptation of Maguire's work.<ref name=briefhistory/>\n\nWhile the draft followed Maguire's idea of retelling the story of the 1939 film from the perspective of its main villain, the storyline of the stage adaptation \"goes far afield\" from the novel. As Holzman observed in an interview with ''[[Playbill]]'', \"It was [Maguire's] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops&nbsp;\u2013 and really the whole plot&nbsp;\u2013 is different onstage.\"<ref name=\"playbill 2\">{{Cite news |first=Michael |last=Buckley |title=STAGE TO SCREENS: A Chat with Wicked Nominee and TV Veteran Winnie Holzman |date=June 6, 2004 |url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |work=Playbill |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121164650/http://www.playbill.com/features/article/86583.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Schwartz justified the deviation, saying \"Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda&nbsp;\u2013 who becomes Glinda&nbsp;\u2013 and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.\"<ref name=\"script\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-script.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Script |accessdate=November 8, 2007 |publisher=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero's appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba's survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda - and eventually becoming the [[Tin Woodman]] instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba's years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir's birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, Doctor Dillamond not being murdered, and Madame Morrible going to prison instead of dying.<ref name=\" novel\">{{Cite book | author=Maguire, Gregory | title=Wicked: The Life and Times of the Wicked Witch of the West | publisher=[[ReganBooks]] | year=1995 | isbn=978-0-06-039144-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/wickedlifetim00magu }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Libretto|book]], lyrics, and score for the musical were developed through a series of readings.<ref name=briefhistory/> For these developmental workshops, [[Kristin Chenoweth]], the [[Tony Award]]\u2013winning actress whom Schwartz had in mind while composing the music for the character,<ref name=\"grimmerie\">{{Cite book | author=David Cote | title=Wicked: The Grimmerie: A Behind-the-Scenes Look at the Hit Broadway Musical |publisher=[[Hachette Books|Hyperion]] |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-4013-0820-9 }}</ref> joined the project as Glinda. [[Stephanie J. Block]] played Elphaba in all of the workshops (she was the original Elphaba in the first national tour, and joined the Broadway cast later on) before fellow performer [[Idina Menzel]] was cast in the role in late 2000. Earlier that same year, the creators recruited New York producer Stone, who began the transition of the workshop production into a full Broadway production. [[Joe Mantello]] was brought in as director and [[Wayne Cilento]] as choreographer while Tony Award-winning designer [[Eugene Lee (designer)|Eugene Lee]] created the set and visual style for the production based on both [[William Wallace Denslow|W.

[[Glinda the Good Witch]] talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the [[governor]] of [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green [[potion]], and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with [[green]] skin (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\"). An Ozian asks Galinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A [[Flashback (psychology)|flashback]] starts with a scene at the [[college]], Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, [[Nessarose]] (\"Dear Old Shiz\"). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is [[Physical disability|physically disabled]] and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of [[Silver Shoes|silver slippers]]. The headshiztress and [[Witchcraft|witch]], [[Madam Morrible]], decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, [[Psychokinesis|telekinetically]]. Madame Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her [[Magic (fantasy)|sorcery]]. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the [[Wizard of Oz (character)|Wonderful Wizard of Oz]], something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (\"[[The Wizard and I]]\"). Both Glinda and Elphaba dislike each other (\"What Is This Feeling?\") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with [[List of Wicked characters|Dr. Dillamond]], a [[goat]], who as the only animal professor at the university is beginning to suffer from [[discrimination]]. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (\"Something Bad\").\n\nLater, the [[Winkie Country|Winkie]] Prince [[List of Wicked characters|Fiyero Tiggular]] arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply \"Dancing through life\". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a [[Practical joke|prank]]. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her but is too nice to hurt her feelings (\"Dancing Through Life\"). She continues to fall for him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and starts dancing with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Glinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed [[Cotoneaster lacteus|milk flowers]] in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Glinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (\"[[Popular (Wicked song)|Popular]]\").\n\nThe next day in class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduces the students to the [[cage]], which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small [[lion]] cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves, embarrassed, to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, for he loves Galinda, as it starts to [[rain]] (\"I'm Not That Girl\"). Madame Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of [[Poppy|poppy flowers]] but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to \u2018Glinda\u2019, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the [[Emerald City]] with her (\"One Short Day\").\n\nThe girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (\"A Sentimental Man\"). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madame Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new \u2018press secretary\u2019. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the ''[[Grimoire|Grimmerie]]'', which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a [[levitation]] spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, [[Chistery|Chistery]]. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. [[Winged monkeys|Chistery sprouts wings]], and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a \u2018wicked [[Witchcraft|witch]]\u2019. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a [[broom]] and flies away from the Emerald City (\"[[Defying Gravity (song)|Defying Gravity]]\").\n\n===Act II===\nSometime later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title \u2019[[Wicked Witch of the West]]\u2019. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title \u2018[[Glinda the Good Witch|Glinda the Good]]\u2019 and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (\"No One Mourns the Wicked\" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madame Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (\"Thank Goodness\").\n\nElphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has [[Tyrant|taken away the rights of the Munchkins]] in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into \u2018[[ruby slippers]]\u2019. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore, and the opportunity to take his last chance to tell Glinda that he loves her, as she is now engaged to Fiyero. This news breaks Elphaba\u2019s heart, however she isn\u2019t surprised. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spellbook and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title \u201c[[Wicked Witch of the East]]\u201d (\"The [[Wicked Witch of the East]]\"). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. She then tells Nessarose that she has to return to the palace in order to set the monkeys free, however, Nessarose knows that she is only going back to find Fiyero. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a [[Tin Woodman|man made of tin]] and flees the [[mansion]].\n\nElphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (\"Wonderful\"). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although heartbroken at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (\"I'm Not That Girl\" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madame Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madame Morrible agrees and conjures a [[tornado]].\n\nElphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (\"As Long As You're Mine\"). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a [[tornado]]. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.\n\nGlinda and Elphaba meet in [[Munchkin Country|Munchkinland]], the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named [[Dorothy Gale]] and a dog named [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]] inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the [[yellow brick road]]. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by [[crucifixion]]). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (\"[[No Good Deed (song)|No Good Deed]]\").\n\nLater, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown [[Cowardly Lion|lion]], that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realized Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (\"March of the Witch Hunters\").\n\nBack at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers \u2013 the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's [[castle]] to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the ''Grimmerie'' to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (\"For Good\"). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.\n\nIn the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madame Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz and sends Madame Morrible to [[prison]].\n\nMeanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]]) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (\"Finale\").\n\n==Notable English-language casts==\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2019}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:11; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | Character\n! style=\"width:9%;\" | San Francisco tryout <br> <small>2003</small><ref name=sanfran>Gans, Andrew.

Some of these motifs indicate irony&nbsp;\u2013 for example, when Glinda presents Elphaba with a \"ghastly\" hat in \"Dancing through Life\", the score reprises a theme from \"What is this Feeling?\" a few scenes earlier,<ref name=musicalthemes/> in which Elphaba and Glinda had espoused their mutual loathing.\n\nTwo musical themes in ''Wicked'' run throughout the score. Although Schwartz rarely reuses motifs or melodies from earlier works,<ref name=\"musicalthemes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicalschwartz.com/wicked-musical-themes.htm |title=Wicked \u2013 Musical Themes |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=MusicalSchwartz.com }}</ref> the first&nbsp;\u2013 Elphaba's theme&nbsp;\u2013 came from ''[[The Survival of St. Joan]]'', on which he worked as [[musical director]].<ref name=musicalthemes/> \"I always liked this tune a lot and I never could figure out what to do with it,\" he remarked in an interview in 2004.<ref name=musicalthemes/> The chord progression that he first penned in 1971 became a major theme of the show's orchestration. By changing the instruments that carry the motif in each instance, Schwartz enables the same melody to convey different moods. In the overture, the tune is carried by the orchestra's [[brass section]], with heavy percussion. The result is, in Schwartz' own words, \"like a giant shadow terrorizing you\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> When played by the piano with some electric bass in \"As Long As You're Mine\", however, the same chord progression becomes the basis for a romantic duet. And with new lyrics and an altered [[bridge (music)|bridge]], the theme forms the core of the song \"No One Mourns the Wicked\" and its reprises.<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\nSchwartz uses the \"Unlimited\" theme as the second major motif running through the score. Although not included as a titled song, the theme appears as an [[section (music)|interlude]] in several of the musical numbers. In a tribute to [[Harold Arlen]], who wrote the score for the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|1939 film adaptation]], the \"Unlimited\" melody incorporates the first seven [[note (music)|notes]] of the song \"[[Over the Rainbow]].\" Schwartz included it as an inside joke as, \"according to [[copyright law]], when you get to the eighth note, then people can come and say, 'Oh you stole our tune.' And of course obviously it's also disguised in that it's completely different rhythmically. And it's also harmonized completely differently.... It's over a different chord and so on, but still it's the first seven notes of 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'\".<ref name=musicalthemes/> Schwartz further obscured the motif's origin by setting it in a [[minor key]] in most instances. This also creates contrast in the songs in which it forms a part, for example in \"Defying Gravity\", which is written primarily in the key of [[D-flat major]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/scorch.asp?ppn=SC0009049 |title=Defying Gravity |accessdate=November 8, 2007|work=Musicnotes.com }}</ref> In the song \"The Wicked Witch of the East\", however, when Elphaba finally uses her powers to let her sister walk, the \"Unlimited\" theme is played in a [[major key]].<ref name=musicalthemes/>\n\n===Recordings===\n{{See also|Wicked (musical album)}}\nA [[cast recording]] of the original Broadway production was released on December 16, 2003, by [[Universal Music]]. All of the songs featured on stage are present on the recording with the exception of \"The Wizard and I (Reprise)\" and \"The Wicked Witch of the East\".
