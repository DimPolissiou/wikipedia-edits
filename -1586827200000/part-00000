Instead therefore, of appointing Claypole to be a major-general, where severity and rigour was necessary, Oliver gave him places of great honour and emolument, but of such a nature as that the most scrupulous might accept.{{sfn|Noble|1784|pp=353\u2013354}} As Claypole had never, during the whole time of his relations holding the helm, done any action that could even inconvenience an individual, at the [[Restoration (England)|restoration]] of the monarchy he was included in the [[Act of Oblivion|general pardon]], unlike those who had participated in acts such as the regicide of Charles I who were exempted from the general pardon and were tried for crimes committed during the Interregnum.{{sfn|Noble|1798}} Until her death in 1665 Claypole gave shelter to [[Elizabeth Cromwell]], his mother-in-law and Oliver Cromwell's widow.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>{{sfn|Firth|Roots|2004}}<ref group=lower-alpha>Mark Noble speculates that although the register says that Elizabeth Cromwell, the widow of Oliver, was buried in Northbrough, on 19 November 1665 this was only a political death, because she feared persecution and thought it prudent to be supposed dead. Noble based this speculation on information provided by the Reverend James Clearke of Peterbrought {{harv|Noble|1784|p=viii}}.</ref> Some years afterwards, however, when court and country were filled with rumours of plots, Claypole was fixed upon to be the head and contriver of one against the royal family, supposedly in consort with the old Oliverian party.{{sfn|Noble|1784|pp=355\u2013356}}\n\nMark Noble states that he was apprehended, in June, 1678, and sent to the Tower, obtaining an habeas corpus to the king's bench, he thought to procure bail but though many persons, to whom no objection could be made, offered themselves for that purpose, chief-justice Sir [[William Scroggs]] set the bail so high that Claypole's friends thought it prudent to decline it. Claypole was therefore remanded back to the Tower; but at the next term, as no evidence appeared against him, and what was, perhaps, much more fortunate to him, a counter plot began to work, he was discharged.{{sfn|Noble|1784|p=376}} When writing the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] article on Claypole, [[Charles Harding Firth]] concurs with Noble, but Ivan Roots in the more recent [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] does not, and thinks it is a case of mistaken identity because although a man called John Claypole, whose profession is given as a printer, was held on suspension of being involved in a plot given his character, it was unlikely to be John Claypole who resided at the manor of Northborough.{{sfn|Firth|Roots|2004}}\n\nHistory is silent what became of him after his imprisonment.

Claypole married a second time, in June 1670, Blanche, widow of Lancelot Stavely, by whom he had one daughter, Bridget. However, Claypole fell under the influence of Anne Ottee, a laundress, and disinherited Bridget for Ottee's benefit. Bridget brought an action in chancery and recovered some portion of his property, but most of it, including the manor of Northborough, Claypole had sold off during his lifetime.<ref name=DNB>{{harvnb|Firth|1887|p=12}}</ref>{{sfn|Firth|Roots|2004}}\n\nClaypole had several other relations including a brother called Henry<ref>[[George Vertue|Vertue's]] engravings of [[Thomas Simon|Simons's]] works (Medals, coins, great seals, and other works of Thomas Simon\" by George Vertue\" [https://books.google.com/books?id=7mAGAAAAQAAJ&lpg=RA1-PA75-IA1&ots=MHNl0V9uUW&dq=Vertue%27s%20engravings%20of%20Simons%27s%20works%2C&pg=RA1-PA32#v=onepage&q=&f=false pp. 32,33]</ref> In Thurloe's state papers, notice is taken of captain Wingfield Claypole, an officer in Ireland, and Christopher Claypole, who Mark Noble believed was also, in the army, and was sent to the Hague in 1658. John Claypole expresses his obligations to Henry Cromwell, lord-deputy (in a letter dated 16 April 1658) for his regard to his brothers and sisters, and himself, upon all occasions; he tells him, \"that indeed, they cannot plead any desert, though,\" says he, \"my sister is very good, yet not enough so to entitle her to so much of your kindness\".{{sfn|Noble|1784|p=357}} This sister seems to be the wife of major Staples, who certainly married one of his sisters, and as he earnestly requests a place for him of the lord-deputy, it is most reasonable to suppose he was the husband of this sister in whose praise he speaks. Wingfield, and another of his brothers, had done something wrong, for he says of the former, \"I wish he had not presumed upon your goodness, in to long an absence\", and requests his pardon on his behalf, yet desires he may be reprehended; and also requests that his other brother may likewise be reproved, as he fears he will stand in too much need of it. Another brother was James Claypoole, 1634\u20131687, an admired friend of [[William Penn]], the Quaker,{{sfn|Noble|1784|p=357}} who emigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1683. Other brothers included Edward (1636 \u2013 ca. 1690), a Captain of Foot, who resided in Barbados from the late 1660s/early1670s and Norton (1640\u20131688), who emigrated to North America in 1678 and died there in [[Sussex County, Delaware]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|1|group=lower-alpha}}\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite ODNB|first=C.

Instead therefore, of appointing Claypole to be a major-general, where severity and rigour was necessary, Oliver gave him places of great honour and emolument, but of such a nature as that the most scrupulous might accept.{{sfn|Noble|1784|pp=353\u2013354}} As Claypole had never, during the whole time of his relations holding the helm, done any action that could even inconvenience an individual, at the [[Restoration (England)|restoration]] of the monarchy he was included in the [[Act of Oblivion|general pardon]], unlike those who had participated in acts such as the regicide of Charles I who were exempted from the general pardon and were tried for crimes committed during the Interregnum.{{sfn|Noble|1798}} Until her death in 1665 Claypole gave shelter to [[Elizabeth Cromwell]], his mother-in-law and Oliver Cromwell's widow.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>{{sfn|Firth|Roots|2004}}<ref group=lower-alpha>Mark Noble speculates that although the register says that Elizabeth Cromwell, the widow of Oliver, was buried in Northbrough, on 19 November 1665 this was only a political death, because she feared persecution and thought it prudent to be supposed dead.

Claypole was therefore remanded back to the Tower; but at the next term, as no evidence appeared against him, and what was, perhaps, much more fortunate to him, a counter plot began to work, he was discharged.{{sfn|Noble|1784|p=376}} When writing the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] article on Claypole, [[Charles Harding Firth]] concurs with Noble, but Ivan Roots in the more recent [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] does not, and thinks it is a case of mistaken identity because although a man called John Claypole, whose profession is given as a printer, was held on suspension of being involved in a plot given his character, it was unlikely to be John Claypole who resided at the manor of Northborough.{{sfn|Firth|Roots|2004}}\n\nHistory is silent what became of him after his imprisonment.

John Claypole expresses his obligations to Henry Cromwell, lord-deputy (in a letter dated 16 April 1658) for his regard to his brothers and sisters, and himself, upon all occasions; he tells him, \"that indeed, they cannot plead any desert, though,\" says he, \"my sister is very good, yet not enough so to entitle her to so much of your kindness\".{{sfn|Noble|1784|p=357}} This sister seems to be the wife of major Staples, who certainly married one of his sisters, and as he earnestly requests a place for him of the lord-deputy, it is most reasonable to suppose he was the husband of this sister in whose praise he speaks. Wingfield, and another of his brothers, had done something wrong, for he says of the former, \"I wish he had not presumed upon your goodness, in to long an absence\", and requests his pardon on his behalf, yet desires he may be reprehended; and also requests that his other brother may likewise be reproved, as he fears he will stand in too much need of it. Another brother was James Claypoole, 1634\u20131687, an admired friend of [[William Penn]], the Quaker,{{sfn|Noble|1784|p=357}} who emigrated to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1683. Other brothers included Edward (1636 \u2013 ca. 1690), a Captain of Foot, who resided in Barbados from the late 1660s/early1670s and Norton (1640\u20131688), who emigrated to North America in 1678 and died there in [[Sussex County, Delaware]].\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|1|group=lower-alpha}}\n==Citations==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite ODNB|first=C.

It pitted local Indonesian Republicans on the island of [[Sulawesi]] against the Dutch who sought to re-assert their authority. The Dutch counter-insurgency offensive was masterminded by the controversial [[Raymond Westerling]], a [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in the KNIL ([[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]]). Westerling's operation, which started in December 1946 and ended in February 1947, succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans by instituting summary executions of suspected enemy fighters.\n\n==Background of the insurgency==\nBetween 1816 and 1905, the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] consolidated their control over the [[Bugis]] states of South Sulawesi. By 1911, the Dutch had integrated the entire region into the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"Tol136\">Tol (2001), p. 136</ref> Dutch rule was interrupted by the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese]] invasion of the East Indies during World War Two. During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], Sulawesi along with much of eastern Indonesia was administrated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] which sought to suppress local Republican and nationalist movements in contrast to the Army-dominated occupations of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]].<ref name=\"Kahin355\">Kahin (1952), p. 355</ref> Following the [[Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, the nationalist movement in Sulawesi established contact with [[Sukarno]]'s Republican administration in Java.<ref name=\"Kahin355\" />\n\nHowever, due to the weak state of the nationalist forces in Sulawesi, they were unable to resist [[Australia]]n and Dutch occupation forces which quickly occupied much of East Indonesia with little resistance. By 5 April 1946, most of the local Republican administration including Governor [[Sam Ratulangi]] were imprisoned by the returning Dutch authorities. The Dutch also interned the pro-Republican aristocracy and their supporters. Despite this, resistance continued in the form of pro-Republican intellectuals and guerrillas, surviving nobility and Java-based militants.<ref name=\"Kahin355\" /> The Dutch downplayed the local resistance as manifestations of international [[Communism]] and Javanese domination,<ref name=\"Westerling92\">Westerling (1952), p. 92</ref> portraying the native populations as contented and resistant to revolutionary change.<ref name=\"Westerling89\">Westerling (1952), p. 89</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Malino Conference]] in July 1946 which established local federal states in Dutch-controlled parts of Indonesia, the Sulawesi government's effectiveness was weakened by the poor economic situation, agricultural famines and a non-existent civil administration.<ref name=\"Westerling90\">Westerling (1952), p. 90</ref> The Indonesian Republic in Java provided training for Sulawesi guerrillas and even dispatched Javanese forces, using the ports of [[Polongbangkeng]] and [[Barru]] for landing troops and supplies.<ref name=\"Westerling92\" /> By December 1946, Dutch authority in the island was limited to the confines of [[Makassar]] and on the verge of an absolute breakdown. Hundreds of government officials and members of the pro-Dutch Eurasian and Indo Chinese community, were attacked and killed. The KNIL garrisons, stationed on the island, were not able to provide protection.<ref name=\"Westerling93\">Westerling (1952), p. 93</ref>\n\n==The \"Westerling Method\"==\nThe failure of conventional tactics prompted the Netherlands East Indies government to dispatch the maverick counter-insurgency expert [[Raymond Westerling]] who initiated a three-month pacification campaign from December 1946 to February 1947. Earlier Dutch tactics had focused on temporarily detaining and releasing suspected guerrillas.<ref name=\"Westerling95\">Westerling (1952), p. 95</ref> In November 1946, British-trained commando Westerling had developed a contingent of commandos within the KNIL known as the [[Depot Special Forces]] (DST), which specialised in counter-insurgency warfare and interrogation.<ref name=\"Sidarto\">{{cite news | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/19/westerling039s-war.html | work=Jakarta Post | title=Westerling's War | date=19 May 2010 | access-date=25 November 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013120826/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/19/westerling039s-war.html | archive-date=13 October 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Westerling, pacifying Sulawesi, without losing thousands of innocent lives could only be accomplished by instituting summary justice on the spot of suspected enemy fighters, who were generally executed. This became known as the \"Westerling Method\". Westerling ordered the registration of all [[Javanese people|Javanese]] arriving in Makassar due to the large numbers of Javanese participating in the Sulawesi resistance. He also used scouts to infiltrate local villages and to identify members of the resistance.<ref name=\"Westerling96\">Westerling (1952), p. 96</ref>\n\nBased on their information and that of the Dutch military intelligence service, the DST surrounded one of more suspected villages during night, after which they drove the population to a central location. At daybreak, the operation began, often led by Westerling. Men would be separated from women and children. From the gathered information Westerling exposed certain people as terrorists and murderers. They were shot without any further investigation. Afterwards Westerling forced local communities to refrain from supporting guerillas by swearing on the [[Quran]]<ref name=\"Sidarto\" /> and established local self-defence units with some members recruited from former guerrillas deemed as \"redeemable\".<ref name=\"Westerling101-105\">Westerling (1952), pp. 101\u2013105</ref>\n\nWesterling directed eleven operations throughout the campaign. He succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans. His actions restored Dutch rule in southern Sulawesi. However, the Netherlands East Indies government and the Dutch army command soon realised that Westerling's notoriety led to growing public criticism. In April 1947 the Dutch government instituted an official inquiry of his controversial methods. Raymond Westerling was put on the sidelines. He was relieved of his duties in November 1948.<ref name=\"Westerling98-99\">Westerling (1952), pp. 98\u201399</ref>\n\n==Controversy over death toll==\nThe Republican government claimed that Westerling was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. Initially they had estimated the number of victims at 15,000, but later stated it was 40,000. A monument with the name Monumen Korban 40.000 Jiwa was erected in the city of Makassar to commemorate the victims of the campaign. Dutch historian Jaap de Moor blames the inflation of the death toll on the fact that Republican government used it as propaganda to draw attention from the world to their diplomatic and armed struggle against the Dutch. Mohammed Natzir of the Indonesian Historical Commission of the Armed Forces also calls the figure of 40,000 deaths fiction and a propaganda measure of the Republican government against the Dutch occupation of that time.\n\nIn his book ''De Zuid-Celebes Affaire: Kapitein Westerling en de standrechtelijke executies'' Dutch historian Willem IJzereef estimates that the actions of the DST cost about 1,500 Indonesian lives. About 400 of them were executed during actions led by Westerling himself, while the remaining 1,100 were killed during actions of his second in command. Another 1,500 deaths could be added by actions of other KNIL units. Approximately 900 Indonesians were killed by pro-Dutch police units and members of the village guards. IJzereef believes that Indonesian resistance caused around 1,500 victims.<ref>IJzereef (1984), p. 172</ref>\n\n==Accusations of war crimes==\nWesterling has always defended his actions and denied accusations of war crimes. His memoirs, which he publiced in 1952, devote a chapter to his self-defense. \"They painted me as a bloodthirsty monster, who attacked the people of Celebes by fire and sword and exposed all those, who in the interest of Indonesia's national independence resisted Dutch rule, to a merciless campaign of repression\".

It pitted local Indonesian Republicans on the island of [[Sulawesi]] against the Dutch who sought to re-assert their authority. The Dutch counter-insurgency offensive was masterminded by the controversial [[Raymond Westerling]], a [[Captain (land)|Captain]] in the KNIL ([[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]]). Westerling's operation, which started in December 1946 and ended in February 1947, succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans by instituting summary executions of suspected enemy fighters.\n\n==Background of the insurgency==\nBetween 1816 and 1905, the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] consolidated their control over the [[Bugis]] states of South Sulawesi. By 1911, the Dutch had integrated the entire region into the [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"Tol136\">Tol (2001), p. 136</ref> Dutch rule was interrupted by the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese]] invasion of the East Indies during World War Two. During the [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia]], Sulawesi along with much of eastern Indonesia was administrated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] which sought to suppress local Republican and nationalist movements in contrast to the Army-dominated occupations of [[Java]] and [[Sumatra]].<ref name=\"Kahin355\">Kahin (1952), p. 355</ref> Following the [[Japanese surrender]] in August 1945, the nationalist movement in Sulawesi established contact with [[Sukarno]]'s Republican administration in Java.<ref name=\"Kahin355\" />\n\nHowever, due to the weak state of the nationalist forces in Sulawesi, they were unable to resist [[Australia]]n and Dutch occupation forces which quickly occupied much of East Indonesia with little resistance. By 5 April 1946, most of the local Republican administration including Governor [[Sam Ratulangi]] were imprisoned by the returning Dutch authorities. The Dutch also interned the pro-Republican aristocracy and their supporters. Despite this, resistance continued in the form of pro-Republican intellectuals and guerrillas, surviving nobility and Java-based militants.<ref name=\"Kahin355\" /> The Dutch downplayed the local resistance as manifestations of international [[Communism]] and Javanese domination,<ref name=\"Westerling92\">Westerling (1952), p. 92</ref> portraying the native populations as contented and resistant to revolutionary change.<ref name=\"Westerling89\">Westerling (1952), p. 89</ref>\n\nDespite the [[Malino Conference]] in July 1946 which established local federal states in Dutch-controlled parts of Indonesia, the Sulawesi government's effectiveness was weakened by the poor economic situation, agricultural famines and a non-existent civil administration.<ref name=\"Westerling90\">Westerling (1952), p. 90</ref> The Indonesian Republic in Java provided training for Sulawesi guerrillas and even dispatched Javanese forces, using the ports of [[Polongbangkeng]] and [[Barru]] for landing troops and supplies.<ref name=\"Westerling92\" /> By December 1946, Dutch authority in the island was limited to the confines of [[Makassar]] and on the verge of an absolute breakdown. Hundreds of government officials and members of the pro-Dutch Eurasian and Indo Chinese community, were attacked and killed. The KNIL garrisons, stationed on the island, were not able to provide protection.<ref name=\"Westerling93\">Westerling (1952), p. 93</ref>\n\n==The \"Westerling Method\"==\nThe failure of conventional tactics prompted the Netherlands East Indies government to dispatch the maverick counter-insurgency expert [[Raymond Westerling]] who initiated a three-month pacification campaign from December 1946 to February 1947. Earlier Dutch tactics had focused on temporarily detaining and releasing suspected guerrillas.<ref name=\"Westerling95\">Westerling (1952), p. 95</ref> In November 1946, British-trained commando Westerling had developed a contingent of commandos within the KNIL known as the [[Depot Special Forces]] (DST), which specialised in counter-insurgency warfare and interrogation.<ref name=\"Sidarto\">{{cite news | url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/19/westerling039s-war.html | work=Jakarta Post | title=Westerling's War | date=19 May 2010 | access-date=25 November 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013120826/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/05/19/westerling039s-war.html | archive-date=13 October 2010 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAccording to Westerling, pacifying Sulawesi, without losing thousands of innocent lives could only be accomplished by instituting summary justice on the spot of suspected enemy fighters, who were generally executed. This became known as the \"Westerling Method\". Westerling ordered the registration of all [[Javanese people|Javanese]] arriving in Makassar due to the large numbers of Javanese participating in the Sulawesi resistance. He also used scouts to infiltrate local villages and to identify members of the resistance.<ref name=\"Westerling96\">Westerling (1952), p. 96</ref>\n\nBased on their information and that of the Dutch military intelligence service, the DST surrounded one of more suspected villages during night, after which they drove the population to a central location. At daybreak, the operation began, often led by Westerling. Men would be separated from women and children. From the gathered information Westerling exposed certain people as terrorists and murderers. They were shot without any further investigation. Afterwards Westerling forced local communities to refrain from supporting guerillas by swearing on the [[Quran]]<ref name=\"Sidarto\" /> and established local self-defence units with some members recruited from former guerrillas deemed as \"redeemable\".<ref name=\"Westerling101-105\">Westerling (1952), pp. 101\u2013105</ref>\n\nWesterling directed eleven operations throughout the campaign. He succeeded in eliminating the insurgency and undermining local support for the Republicans. His actions restored Dutch rule in southern Sulawesi. However, the Netherlands East Indies government and the Dutch army command soon realised that Westerling's notoriety led to growing public criticism. In April 1947 the Dutch government instituted an official inquiry of his controversial methods. Raymond Westerling was put on the sidelines. He was relieved of his duties in November 1948.<ref name=\"Westerling98-99\">Westerling (1952), pp. 98\u201399</ref>\n\n==Controversy over death toll==\nThe Republican government claimed that Westerling was responsible for tens of thousands of deaths. Initially they had estimated the number of victims at 15,000, but later stated it was 40,000. A monument with the name Monumen Korban 40.000 Jiwa was erected in the city of Makassar to commemorate the victims of the campaign. Dutch historian Jaap de Moor blames the inflation of the death toll on the fact that Republican government used it as propaganda to draw attention from the world to their diplomatic and armed struggle against the Dutch. Mohammed Natzir of the Indonesian Historical Commission of the Armed Forces also calls the figure of 40,000 deaths fiction and a propaganda measure of the Republican government against the Dutch occupation of that time.\n\nIn his book ''De Zuid-Celebes Affaire: Kapitein Westerling en de standrechtelijke executies'' Dutch historian Willem IJzereef estimates that the actions of the DST cost about 1,500 Indonesian lives. About 400 of them were executed during actions led by Westerling himself, while the remaining 1,100 were killed during actions of his second in command. Another 1,500 deaths could be added by actions of other KNIL units. Approximately 900 Indonesians were killed by pro-Dutch police units and members of the village guards. IJzereef believes that Indonesian resistance caused around 1,500 victims.<ref>IJzereef (1984), p. 172</ref>\n\n==Accusations of war crimes==\nWesterling has always defended his actions and denied accusations of war crimes. His memoirs, which he publiced in 1952, devote a chapter to his self-defense. \"They painted me as a bloodthirsty monster, who attacked the people of Celebes by fire and sword and exposed all those, who in the interest of Indonesia's national independence resisted Dutch rule, to a merciless campaign of repression\". Westerling stated he had based his tactics on the premise that he performed the role of policeman, combating terror: \"I arrested terrorists, not because they acted as instigators of the Republican government... but because they made themselves guilty of open and unmistaken crimes...I never had them [his troops] bombard a village, nor did I take the hut of innocent under fire. I had executed some criminals, but nobody had died needlessly or wrongly by my doing.<ref>Westerling (1952), p. 150</ref>\n\nIn 1949, the Dutch\u2013Indonesian agreement on transfer of power stipulated neither country would call the other on its wartime offences, thus ruling out any attempt by Indonesia to press for Westerling's extradition.\n\n==Lawsuit against Dutch State==\nIn 2013, the Dutch ambassador in Indonesia, apologized on behalf of the Dutch government.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2016/08/25/lijst-namen-slachtoffers-indie-openbaar-4005138-a1517969|lang=nl|access-date=13 April 2020|date=25 August 2016|work=nrc.nl|title=Lijst namen slachtoffers indie openbaar}}</ref> In 2014 widows and children of the murdered men filed a lawsuit against the Dutch state.

The battle station's commander, the [[Grand Moff Tarkin]] ([[Peter Cushing]]) orders the Death Star's [[superweapon]] to be fired at the planet. Alderaan explodes instantly in a ball of fire.

The adoptive father of Princess Leia, [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) is seen piloting a starship to the planet's surface, which is shown as a mountainous, alpine region covered in snow.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House.

An exhaustive search of the files under Public Buildings and Grounds in the U.S. National Archives and of the several collections in the Library of Congress have proved fruitless.  A careful perusal of all known surviving correspondence and papers of Andrew Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant has likewise failed to reveal mention of Banneker.  This conclusively dispels the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Ellicott was able to reconstruct it in detail from Banneker's recollection.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br/>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}<br>(4) {{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918055745/https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1994/02/20/the-egyptian-illusion/ee123656-ca7f-4ef7-8f28-99d7edd166ba/|archivedate=2018-09-18|url-status=live|title=The Egyptian Illusion|last=Martel|first=Erich|work=Opinions|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1994-02-20|accessdate=2018-09-17|quote=Teachers who want reliable information on African American history often don't know where to turn.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br/>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref><ref>(1) [https://archive.org/stream/bulletinunitedst2311964unit#page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1964.]<br>(2) [http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007223056/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf |date=October 7, 2017 }}<br>(3) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/n8/mode/1up Bedini, 1971.]<br>(4) Bedini, 1991.<br>(5) [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/n7/mode/1up Bedini,1999.]<br>(6) [https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095152/http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-Benjamin-Banneker-African-American/dp/0938420593#customerReviews Murdock]<br>(7) [https://web.archive.org/web/20140426233224/http://www.profsurv.com/magazine/article.aspx?i=567 Toscano, 2000.]<br>(8) [http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008.]</ref>\n\nIn a 1969 publication, Bedini reported that a story connecting Banneker with the survey and planning of the federal city had appeared within a work that a member of the Ellicott family had edited.

The paper stated:\n\n<blockquote> ... L'Enfant made a demand that could not be accorded and ... in a fit of high dudgeon gathered all his plans and papers and unceremoniously left. ... Washington was in despair, since it involved a defeat of all of his cherished plans in regard to the \"Federal City.\" This perturbation on his part was quickly ended, however, when it transpired that Banneker had daily for the purposes of calculation and practice, transcribed nearly all L'Enfant's field notes and through the assistance they afforded Mr. Andrew Ellicott, L'Enfant's assistant, Washington City was laid down very nearly on the original lines. ...

At Jefferson's request, Banneker was appointed as the third member of the team.<br/>The assignment was to define the boundaries of the new city and then design and lay out its streets and major buildings. Banneker worked closely with L'Enfant and his maps. But the bureaucrats of that day did not take kindly to a foreigner being given so much power and authority and they interfered in many frustrating ways.  This resulted in the highly sensitive and hot-tempered L'Enfant resigning his position and returning to France, taking all of the plans and maps with him. Everyone was dismayed and Jefferson called a meeting of the men involved. What was to be done? Start all over again after more than a year's work? Dispair and frustration showed on their faces. Suddenly Banneker asked, \"Did you like the plans that were made?\" All eyes turned to him. \"Of course, but we don't have them.\" \"I think I can reproduce them from memory\", said Banneker. The men were astounded and somewhat skeptical. Banneker then went home, and because of his remarkable memory, was able to reproduce all the plans in two days.

He was a farmer, a mathematician, an inventor, an astronomer, a writer, a surveyor, a scientist, and a humanitarian. When he surveyed the city of Washington with Major Pierre Charles L'Enfant, Banneker became one of the first black civil servants of the new nation. Along with a team, Banneker identified the boundaries of the capitol city. They installed intermittent stone markers along the perimeter of the District. .... In 1753, Banneker constructed one of the first entirely wooden clocks in America. .... Banneker's scientific research led him to write one of the first series of almanacs printed in the United States.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321194817/https://www.nps.gov/places/sw-9-intermediate-boundary-stone-of-the-district-of-columbia.htm/index.htm|archive-date=March 21, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHowever, historical research has shown that none of these legends can be correct.<ref name=Founders/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\">[https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up Bedini, 1999, p. 132-136.] \"An exhaustive search of government repositories, including the Public Buildings and Grounds files in the National Archives, and various collections in the Library of Congress, failed to turn up Banneker's name on any of the contemporary documents or records related to the selection, planning and survey of the City of Washington. Nor was he mentioned in any of the surviving correspondence and papers of Andre Ellicott and of Pierre Charles L'Enfant. .... Although the exact date of Banneker's departure from the survey is not specified in Ellicott's report of expenditures, it occurred sometime late in the month of April 1791, following the arrival of one of Ellicott's brothers. It was not until some ten months after Banneker's departure from the scene that L'Enfant was dismissed, by means of a letter from Jefferson dated February 27, 1792. This conclusively dispels any basis for the legend that after L'Enfant's dismissal and his refusal to make available his plan of the city, Banneker recollected the plan in detail from which Ellicott was able to reconstruct it. Equally untrue and in fact impossible is the legend that Thomas Jefferson as secretary of state invited Banneker to luncheon at the White House. Jefferson during this period was in Philadelphia, the national capital in Washington had yet not been built, and there was no White House.\"</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969], pp. 7, 29.</ref> As Bedini reported in 1969, Ellicott's 1791 assignment was to produce a survey of a square, the length of whose sides would each be {{convert|10|mi|km|1}} (a \"ten mile square\").<ref name=Bedini22/> L'Enfant was to survey, design and lay out the national capital city within this square.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50#v=onepage&q=Banneker&f=false Stewart, p. 50] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426112936/https://books.google.com/books?id=GgULOzNSafMC&pg=PA50 |date=April 26, 2016}}</ref> Ellicott and L'Enfant each worked independently under the supervision of the three Commissioners that President Washington had earlier appointed.<ref name=Bedini22/> Bedini could not find any evidence that showed that Banneker had ever worked with or for L'Enfant.<ref name=Bedini22/><ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/>\n\nBanneker left the federal capital area and returned to his home near [[Ellicott City, Maryland#History|Ellicott's Mills]] in April 1791.<ref name=\"Bedini 1999, p. 132\"/><ref name=Arnebeck>{{cite web|last=Arnebeck|first=Bob|url=http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129062551/http://dcswamp.blogspot.com/2017/01/seat-of-empire.html|archivedate=2018-01-29|title=Washington Examined: Seat of Empire: the General and the Plan 1790 to 1801|date=2017-01-02|publisher=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2018-01-29|quote=Meanwhile Andrew Ellicott, the nation's Surveyor General, finished surveying the boundary lines of the federal district, and joined L'Enfant in laying out the city.

Sockets allow lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for lampholders, including early ''de facto'' standards and later standards created by various [[standards bodies]]. Many of the later standards conform to a general coding system in which a socket type is designated by a letter or abbreviation followed by a number.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Advantages of Using LED Verlichting|work=The Difference of Connections|url=http://www.ledgu10dimbaar.nl/website/index.php?TreeItem=391161&NewsItem=28097|publisher=LED Spots & LED Inbouwspots|accessdate=16 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816132543/http://www.ledgu10dimbaar.nl/website/index.php?TreeItem=391161&NewsItem=28097|archivedate=16 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe most common type of sockets for [[mains electricity]] are [[Edison screw]]s, used in continental Europe and North America, while [[bayonet mount]]s dominate in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, except Canada, and in the automotive industry. [[Fluorescent lamps]] typically require a two-pin, unthreaded socket.\n\nNot all lamps require a socket. For example, some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to screw terminals or other wires, and some reflector lamps provide screw terminals for electrical connections.\n\n==History==\nEarly experimental incandescent lamps employed wire leads which had to be connected to screw terminals, but this was inconvenient for commercial use. The Edison organization{{clarify|date=October 2018}} used simple wooden receptacles with internal copper strips for lamps on the commercial steamship ''[[SS Columbia (1880)|SS Columbia]]'', the first ship to use electric light bulbs. These sockets included switches, but required bulbs to be mounted upright.\n\nThe Edison organization developed a screw-base in 1880 which was initially made of wood but later made of plaster of Paris.<ref>Robert Friedel, Paul Israel, ''Edison's Electric Light: Biography of an Invention'', Rutgers University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-8135-1118-6}}, pp. 169-171</ref> Many competitive designs of lamps and sockets appeared in the early era of incandescent lighting, which often were incompatible with other designs.\n\n==Construction and materials==\nThe construction of a lampholder socket defines and limits its intended use. Ceramic insulation can withstand considerably higher [[operating temperature]]s than bakelite or other plastics. The electrical components and wires must be designed to carry the intended current plus a safety factor.\n\nThe contact surface area, thickness and conductivity of the metal, connection methods and maximum operating temperature must all be considered in the design of a new socket. In addition, mechanical factors such as shape of the socket, fixture mounting and attachment, lamp support, ease of re-lamping and total cost of manufacture must be considered. Sockets designed for ordinary household and industrial use have much more design leeway than those used in precision applications.\n\nThe lampholder must be located far enough from the filament that the metals with the lowest melting point will remain solid. Historically this metal was a tin/lead [[solder]] whose melting point might be as low as {{convert|180|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} Due to the thermal changes from ambient temperature to full operating temperature, the design of a socket must allow for a considerable amount of expansion and contraction. Spring elements are required to accommodate these dimensional changes. However, the temperature at which a metal loses its spring is far below the melting point. This is why some older sockets that no longer work can be restored by prying up the base spring slightly.\n\nLampholder failures are usually caused by mechanical abuse or by overheating. A socket with a built-in switch is far more likely to fail in normal use as the switch parts wear out. Insulation failures are usually caused by impacts or by difficulty inserting or removing a lamp. Sockets used outdoors or in damp areas often suffer from corrosion which can cause the lamp to \"stick\" in the socket and attempts to change a lamp can result in breakage of either the lamp or the lampholder. The corrosion is not only environmentally produced but may be a result of the current flowing through the parts when there is appreciable resistance between the parts. Fixtures in such environments may require gaskets or other waterproofing methods to prevent buildup of moisture in the socket area.\n\n==Edison screw bases==\n[[File:Light bulb socket E26 three way.jpg|thumb|upright|A standard American three-way lightbulb socket]]\n{{Main|Edison screw#Types}}\n* E10 Miniature  (Flashlight lamp)\n* E11 Mini-Candelabra \n* E12 Candelabra \n* E14 European\n* E17 Intermediate\n* E26 Medium\n* E26D [[3-way_lamp|Three-way]] Medium (modified socket with additional ring contact for 3-way lamps)\n* E27 Medium\n* E39 Mogul\n* E39D Three-way Mogul (modified socket with additional ring contact for 3-way lamps)\n* E40 Mogul \n* Skirted (PAR-38)\n\nThe light bulb commonly used since the early 20th century for general-purpose lighting applications, with a pear-like shape and an Edison screw base, is referred to as an \"[[A-series light bulb]].\" This most common general purpose bulb type would be classed as \"A19/E26\" or the metric version \"A60/E27\".\n\n==Bayonet styles==\n[[File:Bayonet-mount-01.svg|thumb|upright|A bayonet mount]]\n\n{{main|Bayonet mount}}\n* BA9s Miniature bayonet\n* BA15s Single Contact Bayonet\n* BA15d Double Contact Bayonet\n* Bay15d Indexed DC Bayonet\n* Bay22 Double Contact Bayonet\n* Bayonet Candelabra with prefocusing collar\n* P28s Medium prefocus\n* P40s Mogul prefocus\n\n==Bi-post==\n{{main|Bi-pin connector}}\n[[File:General Electric MS25015-2 1200w 115v airway beacon light bulb left.jpg |thumb|115-volt airway beacon light bulb with a Mogul bi-post base]]\nWith bi-post bases, the lamp orientation is fixed so that the filament will always be in the focal plane. Filament configurations such as the C13D (coiled, zig-zagged) emit far more light perpendicular to the zig-zag than parallel to it.\n*Mogul bi-post (G38) can handle up to 100 amps and is used with searchlights and film & stage lighting fixtures of 1000 watts or larger.

The 1000-watt [[FEL lamp|FEL]] medium two-pin base halogen lamp allows designers to insert the lamp into the end of the ellipsoidal reflector through a smaller hole than previously possible with conventional incandescent lamps. This improves efficiency compared to the older side-inserted lamp or a double-ended lamp which requires two holes. One variation is the polarized two-pin socket \u2013 used primarily in [[projector]]s, which defines the exact positioning of the filament on one side. This improves the \"point source\" characteristic necessary for building complex optical systems.\n\nAnother facet of the two-pin design is that many new designs of lamps use baseless glass envelopes. The wire leads are thickened and crimped in the glass envelope of the lamp base. The MR16 is an example of this design; the actual lamp is inserted into the reflector with the leads sticking out and a ceramic paste used to glue it in.\n\n==Wedge base==\n{{main|Wedge base}}\nMiniature lamps may have a [[wedge base]] made of glass or plastic. The base may be an extension of the glass envelope of the bulb, with the wire leads of the lamp folded up at the base.  Some wedge bases are made of plastic and slipped over the wire leads. A wedge base holds the lamp by spring compression in the socket. The lamp is inserted and removed without twisting. Wedge base lamps are widely used in automotive applications, and many [[Christmas lights]] strings use plastic wedge-based bulbs.\n\n==Fluorescent tubular lamp standards==\n{{main|Fluorescent-lamp formats}}Fluorescent Linear Tube Light bulbs are measured in {{frac|1|8}} of inches.

Sockets allow lamps to be safely and conveniently replaced (re-lamping). There are many different standards for lampholders, including early ''de facto'' standards and later standards created by various [[standards bodies]]. Many of the later standards conform to a general coding system in which a socket type is designated by a letter or abbreviation followed by a number.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Advantages of Using LED Verlichting|work=The Difference of Connections|url=http://www.ledgu10dimbaar.nl/website/index.php?TreeItem=391161&NewsItem=28097|publisher=LED Spots & LED Inbouwspots|accessdate=16 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130816132543/http://www.ledgu10dimbaar.nl/website/index.php?TreeItem=391161&NewsItem=28097|archivedate=16 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe most common type of sockets for [[mains electricity]] are [[Edison screw]]s, used in continental Europe and North America, while [[bayonet mount]]s dominate in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, except Canada, and in the automotive industry. [[Fluorescent lamps]] typically require a two-pin, unthreaded socket.\n\nNot all lamps require a socket. For example, some miniature lamps have wire leads suitable for direct connection to screw terminals or other wires, and some reflector lamps provide screw terminals for electrical connections.\n\n==History==\nEarly experimental incandescent lamps employed wire leads which had to be connected to screw terminals, but this was inconvenient for commercial use. The Edison organization{{clarify|date=October 2018}} used simple wooden receptacles with internal copper strips for lamps on the commercial steamship ''[[SS Columbia (1880)|SS Columbia]]'', the first ship to use electric light bulbs. These sockets included switches, but required bulbs to be mounted upright.\n\nThe Edison organization developed a screw-base in 1880 which was initially made of wood but later made of plaster of Paris.<ref>Robert Friedel, Paul Israel, ''Edison's Electric Light: Biography of an Invention'', Rutgers University Press, 1986, {{ISBN|0-8135-1118-6}}, pp. 169-171</ref> Many competitive designs of lamps and sockets appeared in the early era of incandescent lighting, which often were incompatible with other designs.\n\n==Construction and materials==\nThe construction of a lampholder socket defines and limits its intended use. Ceramic insulation can withstand considerably higher [[operating temperature]]s than bakelite or other plastics. The electrical components and wires must be designed to carry the intended current plus a safety factor.\n\nThe contact surface area, thickness and conductivity of the metal, connection methods and maximum operating temperature must all be considered in the design of a new socket. In addition, mechanical factors such as shape of the socket, fixture mounting and attachment, lamp support, ease of re-lamping and total cost of manufacture must be considered. Sockets designed for ordinary household and industrial use have much more design leeway than those used in precision applications.\n\nThe lampholder must be located far enough from the filament that the metals with the lowest melting point will remain solid. Historically this metal was a tin/lead [[solder]] whose melting point might be as low as {{convert|180|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} Due to the thermal changes from ambient temperature to full operating temperature, the design of a socket must allow for a considerable amount of expansion and contraction. Spring elements are required to accommodate these dimensional changes. However, the temperature at which a metal loses its spring is far below the melting point. This is why some older sockets that no longer work can be restored by prying up the base spring slightly.\n\nLampholder failures are usually caused by mechanical abuse or by overheating. A socket with a built-in switch is far more likely to fail in normal use as the switch parts wear out. Insulation failures are usually caused by impacts or by difficulty inserting or removing a lamp. Sockets used outdoors or in damp areas often suffer from corrosion which can cause the lamp to \"stick\" in the socket and attempts to change a lamp can result in breakage of either the lamp or the lampholder. The corrosion is not only environmentally produced but may be a result of the current flowing through the parts when there is appreciable resistance between the parts. Fixtures in such environments may require gaskets or other waterproofing methods to prevent buildup of moisture in the socket area.\n\n==Edison screw bases==\n[[File:Light bulb socket E26 three way.jpg|thumb|upright|A standard American three-way lightbulb socket]]\n{{Main|Edison screw#Types}}\n* E10 Miniature  (Flashlight lamp)\n* E11 Mini-Candelabra \n* E12 Candelabra \n* E14 European\n* E17 Intermediate\n* E26 Medium\n* E26D [[3-way_lamp|Three-way]] Medium (modified socket with additional ring contact for 3-way lamps)\n* E27 Medium\n* E39 Mogul\n* E39D Three-way Mogul (modified socket with additional ring contact for 3-way lamps)\n* E40 Mogul \n* Skirted (PAR-38)\n\nThe light bulb commonly used since the early 20th century for general-purpose lighting applications, with a pear-like shape and an Edison screw base, is referred to as an \"[[A-series light bulb]].\" This most common general purpose bulb type would be classed as \"A19/E26\" or the metric version \"A60/E27\".\n\n==Bayonet styles==\n[[File:Bayonet-mount-01.svg|thumb|upright|A bayonet mount]]\n\n{{main|Bayonet mount}}\n* BA9s Miniature bayonet\n* BA15s Single Contact Bayonet\n* BA15d Double Contact Bayonet\n* Bay15d Indexed DC Bayonet\n* Bay22 Double Contact Bayonet\n* Bayonet Candelabra with prefocusing collar\n* P28s Medium prefocus\n* P40s Mogul prefocus\n\n==Bi-post==\n{{main|Bi-pin connector}}\n[[File:General Electric MS25015-2 1200w 115v airway beacon light bulb left.jpg |thumb|115-volt airway beacon light bulb with a Mogul bi-post base]]\nWith bi-post bases, the lamp orientation is fixed so that the filament will always be in the focal plane. Filament configurations such as the C13D (coiled, zig-zagged) emit far more light perpendicular to the zig-zag than parallel to it.\n*Mogul bi-post (G38) can handle up to 100 amps and is used with searchlights and film & stage lighting fixtures of 1000 watts or larger. Incandescent, halogen and HMI light sources use this design.\n*Medium bi-post (G22) is used with film & stage lighting fixtures between 250 and 1000 watts.\n*Mini bi-post (G4-G6)\n\nCommon types:\n*G4 - {{cvt|4|mm|in|5}} pin spacing\n**<small>GU4 & GZ4 - are same as G4 and only denote what lamp mount clip is needed to hold the actual light bulb in place</small>\n*G5.3 - {{cvt|5.3|mm|in|5}} pin spacing\n**<small>GU5.3, GX5.3, GY5.3, GZ5.3 - are same as G5.3 and only denote what lamp mount clip is needed to hold the actual light bulb in place</small> \n*G6.35 - {{cvt|6.35|mm|in|2}}spacing\n**<small>GY6.35 & GZ6.35 - are same as G6.35 and only denote what lamp mount clip is needed to hold the actual light bulb in place</small> \n*G8 - {{cvt|8|mm|in|5}} pin spacing\n**<small>GU8 - same as G8 and only denotes what lamp mount clip is needed to hold the actual light bulb in place</small> \n*GY8.6 - {{cvt|8.6|mm|in|5}} pin spacing \n*G9 - {{cvt|9|mm|in|5}} pin spacing \n*G12 - {{cvt|12|mm|in|5}} pin spacing\n\n== Bi-pin connector ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}\n[[Image:Halogenmetalldampflampe.jpg|thumb| [[Metal halide lamp]] with G8.5 base ]]\n{{main|Bi-pin connector}}\n* Medium bi-pin is used on each end of a T12 fluorescent lamp\n* Mini bi-pin is used with MR16 halogen lamps\n\nThe two-pin socket is an update of the bi-post design with smaller pins designed to reduce the cost of manufacture. The 1000-watt [[FEL lamp|FEL]] medium two-pin base halogen lamp allows designers to insert the lamp into the end of the ellipsoidal reflector through a smaller hole than previously possible with conventional incandescent lamps. This improves efficiency compared to the older side-inserted lamp or a double-ended lamp which requires two holes. One variation is the polarized two-pin socket \u2013 used primarily in [[projector]]s, which defines the exact positioning of the filament on one side. This improves the \"point source\" characteristic necessary for building complex optical systems.\n\nAnother facet of the two-pin design is that many new designs of lamps use baseless glass envelopes. The wire leads are thickened and crimped in the glass envelope of the lamp base. The MR16 is an example of this design; the actual lamp is inserted into the reflector with the leads sticking out and a ceramic paste used to glue it in.\n\n==Wedge base==\n{{main|Wedge base}}\nMiniature lamps may have a [[wedge base]] made of glass or plastic. The base may be an extension of the glass envelope of the bulb, with the wire leads of the lamp folded up at the base.  Some wedge bases are made of plastic and slipped over the wire leads. A wedge base holds the lamp by spring compression in the socket. The lamp is inserted and removed without twisting. Wedge base lamps are widely used in automotive applications, and many [[Christmas lights]] strings use plastic wedge-based bulbs.\n\n==Fluorescent tubular lamp standards==\n{{main|Fluorescent-lamp formats}}Fluorescent Linear Tube Light bulbs are measured in {{frac|1|8}} of inches.
