Conquistadors like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] lived and worked in Santo Domingo before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors in the American continent. [[Sugar cane]] was introduced to Hispaniola from the [[Canary Islands]], and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola.<ref>Sugar Cane: Past and Present, Peter Sharpe {{cite web |url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518084734/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref> The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the [[Real Audiencia]] from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.\n\nIn the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas. With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, [[free people of color]], and slaves lived in similar conditions, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding ''intermixing,'' resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Taino, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the on of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.\n\nBy the mid-17th century the French sent colonists and [[privateers]] to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the [[pirate]]s, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to [[Kingdom of France|France]] with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony in the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer an economic decline.<ref name=\"google48\">{{cite book |editor-last=Knight |editor-first=Franklin W. |title=General history of the Caribbean |date=1997 |publisher=Unesco |location=London |isbn=978-92-3-103146-5 |page=48 |edition=1. publ. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&lpg=PR2&pg=PR2#v=onepage |accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 17, 1655, the English landed on nearby Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to [[Santo Domingo]], the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted [[lancer]]s, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\n\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a [[smallpox]] epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards [[Battle of Sabana Real|attacked the north]] and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Campuzano Polanco Coat of Arms on Burial Slab.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Campuzano Polanco family]] coat of arms]]\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 17th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti)&nbsp;\u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name=\"google48\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic \u2013 THE FIRST COLONY|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island.

During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref> As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Scheina>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\n\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe (see [[War of the Pyrenees]]). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n=== French rule ===\n{{Main|Era de Francia}}\n[[File:Battle of Santo Domingo (French and British ships).jpg|thumb|left|French and British ships fighting at the [[Battle of San Domingo]] (1806)]]\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Islandwide Struggle for Freedom: Revolution, Emancipation, and Reenslavement in Hispaniola, 1789-1809|page=93}}</ref> The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. [[Toussaint Louverture]], who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the treaty. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]] when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time, the Haitian General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw. As Christophe retreated across the island, he slaughtered and burned.<ref name=\"Short Dominican History\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.studycountry.com/guide/DO-history.htm|title=A Brief History of Dominican Republic|website=SpainExchange Country Guide}}</ref> In October 1808 the landowner [[Juan S\u00e1nchez Ram\u00edrez]] began a rebellion against the French colonial government in Santo Domingo and the insurgents were aided by Puerto Rico and British Jamaica.<ref name=\"Bethell\">{{cite book|last1=Bethell|first1=Leslie|title=The Cambridge History of Latin America: Volume 3|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth|url-access=registration|date=1984|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgehistory0000beth/page/245 245\u201348]}}</ref> The British ejected the French and returned Santo Domingo to the Spaniards in 1809.

In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.{{efn|''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of \"scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.\" (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)}} In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\nThe Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to \"forage and sack\" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a \"heavy tribute\" on the Dominican people.<ref name=\"Matibag\" />{{rp|page number needed}}\n\nHaiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the [[Espa\u00f1a Boba]] period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], or [[Gran Colombia]]. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the [[cibao]] region. After independence, and eventually being under [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|Spanish rule]] once again in 1861, many families returned to Santo Domingo including new waves of immigration from [[Spain]].\n\n=== Dominican War of Independence (1844)===\n{{See also|Dominican War of Independence}}\n[[File:Parque y Parroquia Hato Mayor.jpg|thumb|Statues honoring Trinitarian leaders [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], [[Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez]], and [[Mat\u00edas Ram\u00f3n Mella]].]]\nIn 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.<ref name=\"pons\">{{cite book |first=Frank |last =Moya Pons| authorlink =Frank Moya Pons | title = The Dominican Republic: A National History|edition= August 1, 1998|page= 543 |publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers; 2nd edition| isbn= 978-1-55876-191-9|year =1998}}</ref>{{rp|p147\u2013149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence.

They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian [[Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard|Charles H\u00e9rard]] who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti.

They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Encarta\"/> The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\n\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Imbert's (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, \u201cin Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and\u2026the number of wounded was very superior\u2026[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03272011-220809/unrestricted/DePena.pdf|title=The Siblings of Hispaniola: Political Union and Separation of Haiti and Santo Domingo, 1822\u20131844}}</ref>\n\nThe Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845.

In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>\n\nWithout adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].\n\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for [[hard cash]] at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde]] and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General [[Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3]] besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<ref name=Cross>{{cite book |title= Sociedad y desarrollo en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 1844\u20131899 |date= 1984 |last=Cross Beras |first=Julio A. |publisher=CENAPEC |isbn=978-84-89525-17-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n{{See also|Dominican Restoration War}}\n[[File:Luperoncaballo.JPG|thumb|[[Gregorio Luper\u00f3n]] fought against the pretensions of Pedro Santana to recover the Dominican sovereignty.]]\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|colonial status]].

This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Pe\u00f1a, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez.\n\nIn February 1930, when V\u00e1squez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]]. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader [[Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a]]; in return for letting Ure\u00f1a take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning \"neutrality,\" Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ure\u00f1a's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ure\u00f1a was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.\n\nAs per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ure\u00f1a as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.\n\n=== Trujillo Era (1930\u201361)===\n[[File:Rafel Trujillo 1934.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Rafael Trujillo]] imposed a dictatorship of 31 years in the country (1930\u20131961)]]\n\nThere was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan.

It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with [[Haiti]], the north-to-south (though somewhat irregular) border between the two countries being {{convert|376|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> To the north and north-west lie [[The Bahamas]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and to west, across the [[Mona Passage]], the US Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]]. The country's area is reported variously as {{convert|48442|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} (by the embassy in the United States)<ref name=embassy/> and {{convert|48670|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> making it the second largest country in the [[Antilles]], after [[Cuba]]. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest city [[Santo Domingo]] is on the southern coast.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/>\n\n[[File:Constanza (15196384558).jpg|thumb|[[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]] valley]]\nThe Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the ''[[Cordillera Septentrional]]'' (\"Northern Mountain Range\"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]], near the Haitian border, to the [[Saman\u00e1 Peninsula]] in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic&nbsp;\u2013 indeed, in the whole of the West Indies&nbsp;\u2013 is the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (\"Central Mountain Range\"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of [[Azua de Compostela|Azua]], on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level),<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the ''[[Sierra de Neiba]]'', while in the south the ''[[Sierra de Bahoruco]]'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'', ''Sierra de Yamas\u00e1'', and ''Sierra de Saman\u00e1''.\n\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepci\u00f3n de La Vega|La Vega]] and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.\n\nThe ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.\n[[File:Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves.jpeg|thumb|left|Mangroves in Los Haitises National Park]]\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\n\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> Other important lakes are [[Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n]] or Cabral, with [[freshwater|fresh water]], and [[Laguna de Oviedo]], a lagoon with [[brackish water]].\n\nThere are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and [[Beata]], in the southwest. Smaller islands include the [[Cayos Siete Hermanos]], [[Isla Cabra]], [[Cayo Jackson]], [[Cayo Lim\u00f3n]], [[Cayo Levantado]], [[Cayo la Bocaina]], [[Catalina Island (Dominican Republic)|Catalanita]], [[Cayo Pisaje]] and [[Isla Alto Velo]]. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} [[Isla Cabritos]] lies within [[Lago Enriquillo]].\n\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|a magnitude 8.1 earthquake]] off the northeast coast, triggering a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Dominican Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of the Dominican Republic]]\n<!--[[File:Los Haitises Park.jpeg|thumb|Los Haitises Park National Park]]-->\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] in the coastal and lowland areas.

The Dominican Republic is the most popular tourist destination in the [[Caribbean]]. With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa De Campo]] and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\n\n[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]], and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10&nbsp;km from the Haitian border.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Transportation ===\n{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Obelisco Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|El Malecon av. in [[Santo Domingo]]]]\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternative routes ([[DR-4]]).\n\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;\u2013 Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;\u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]\n{{Main|Santo Domingo Metro}}\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[rapid transit]] system in [[Santo Domingo]], the country's capital.

The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east.

[[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\n\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015.

However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\n\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Church and Convent Regina Angelorum CCSD 07 2018 0762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Church and Convent, Colonial Santo Domingo.]]\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=E|title=Dominican Republic National Commission for UNESCO|work=UNESCO|date=November 14, 1957|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Ta\u00edno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\n\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Chicharr\u00f3n mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly [[Spanish cuisine#Spanish regional variation: typical dishes and meal routines|Spanish]], [[Ta\u00edno#Food and agriculture|Ta\u00edno]], and [[African cuisine|African]].

The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|378}}\n\n[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\n\n[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>\n\n[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\n\n[[Dominican rock]] and [[Reggaeton]] are also popular. Many, if not the majority, of its performers are based in Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\n=== Fashion ===\n[[File:Oscar de la Renta by foto di matti.jpg|thumb|Dominican native, fashion designer and perfume maker [[Oscar de la Renta]]]]\n\nThe country boasts one of the ten most important design schools in the region, La Escuela de Dise\u00f1o de Altos de Chav\u00f3n, which is making the country a key player in the world of fashion and design. Noted fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] was born in the Dominican Republic in 1932, and became a US citizen in 1971. He studied under the leading Spaniard designer [[Crist\u00f3bal Balenciaga]] and then worked with the house of [[Lanvin (clothing)|Lanvin]] in Paris. By 1963, he had designs bearing his own label.

The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181033/http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |title=Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana&nbsp;\u2013 Bandera Nacional |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=National Army of the Dominican Republic |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\" (meaning \"Dominican Republic\"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.\n\nThe [[Floral emblem|national flower]] is the [[Pereskia quisqueyana|Bayahibe Rose]] and the [[national tree]] is the [[Swietenia mahagoni|West Indian Mahogany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.listindiario.com/la-vida/2011/7/16/196080/La-rosa-de-Bayahibe-nuestra-flor-nacional |title=La rosa de Bayah\u00edbe, nuestra flor nacional|author=L\u00f3pez, Yaniris |work=Listin Diario |date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The national bird is the ''Cigua Palmera'' or [[Palmchat]] (\"Dulus dominicus\").<ref name=depaul>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodigital.com.do/articulo,30016,html |title=El jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional |trans-title=The National Botanical Garden |language=es |last=P\u00e9rez |first=Faustino |work=DiarioDigitalRD.com |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023033403/http://www.diariodigital.com.do/articulo%2C30016%2Chtml |archivedate=October 23, 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Dominican Republic celebrates [[Dia de la Altagracia]] on January 21 in honor of its patroness, [[Juan Pablo Duarte|Duarte]]'s Day on January 26 in honor of one of its founding fathers, Independence Day on February 27, [[Dominican Restoration War|Restoration Day]] on August 16, ''Virgen de las Mercedes'' on September 24, and [[Constitution Day]] on November 6.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{Main|Sports in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:DSC00621 Albert Pujols.jpg|thumb|150px|Dominican native and [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Albert Pujols]]]]\n\n[[Baseball]] is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic.<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|59}} The country has a baseball league of six teams.

By 1503, the Spanish Crown legalized the distribution of Indians to work the mines as part of the [[encomienda]] system.  According to Pons, \"Once the Indians entered the mines, hunger and disease literally wiped them out.\"  By 1508 the Indian population of about 400,000 was reduced to 60,000, and by 1514, only 26,334 remained.

Conquistadors like [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]] and [[Francisco Pizarro]] lived and worked in Santo Domingo before they embarked on their prosperous endeavors in the American continent. [[Sugar cane]] was introduced to Hispaniola from the [[Canary Islands]], and the first sugar mill in the New World was established in 1516, on Hispaniola.<ref>Sugar Cane: Past and Present, Peter Sharpe {{cite web |url=http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518084734/http://www.siu.edu/~ebl/leaflets/sugar.htm |archivedate=2008-05-18 }}</ref> The need for a labor force to meet the growing demands of sugar cane cultivation led to an exponential increase in the importation of slaves over the following two decades. The sugar mill owners soon formed a new colonial elite and convinced the Spanish king to allow them to elect the members of the [[Real Audiencia]] from their ranks. Poorer colonists subsisted by hunting the herds of wild cattle that roamed throughout the island and selling their leather.\n\nIn the 1560s English pirates joined the French in regularly raiding Spanish shipping in the Americas. With the conquest of the American mainland, Hispaniola's sugar plantation economy quickly declined. Most Spanish colonists left for the silver-mines of [[Mexico]] and [[Peru]], while new immigrants from Spain bypassed the island. Agriculture dwindled, new imports of slaves ceased, and white colonists, [[free people of color]], and slaves lived in similar conditions, weakening the racial hierarchy and aiding ''intermixing,'' resulting in a population of predominantly mixed Spaniard, Taino, and African descent. Except for the city of Santo Domingo, which managed to maintain some legal exports, Dominican ports were forced to rely on contraband trade, which, along with livestock, became the on of the main sources of livelihood for the island's inhabitants.\n\nBy the mid-17th century the French sent colonists and [[privateers]] to settle the northwestern coast of Hispaniola due to its strategic position in the region. In order to entice the [[pirate]]s, the French supplied them with women who had been taken from prisons, accused of prostitution and thieving. After decades of armed struggles with the French, Spain ceded the western coast of the island to [[Kingdom of France|France]] with the 1697 [[Treaty of Ryswick]], whilst the Central Plateau remained under Spanish domain. France created a wealthy colony in the island, while the Spanish colony continued to suffer an economic decline.<ref name=\"google48\">{{cite book |editor-last=Knight |editor-first=Franklin W. |title=General history of the Caribbean |date=1997 |publisher=Unesco |location=London |isbn=978-92-3-103146-5 |page=48 |edition=1. publ. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ppGJBmQVJjEC&lpg=PR2&pg=PR2#v=onepage |accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn April 17, 1655, the English landed on nearby Hispaniola and marched 30 miles overland to [[Santo Domingo]], the main Spanish stronghold on the island. The sweltering heat soon felled many of the northern European invaders. The Spanish defenders, having had time to prepare an ambush for the aimlessly thrashing, mosquito-swatting newcomers, sprang on them with mounted [[lancer]]s, sending them careening back toward the beach in utter confusion. Their commander, Venables, hid behind a tree where, in the words of one disgusted observer, he was \u201cso much possessed with terror that he could hardly speak.\u201d The elite [[Siege of Santo Domingo (1655)|defenders of Santo Domingo]] were amply rewarded with titles from the Spanish Crown.\n\nThe French attacked Santiago in 1667, and this was followed by a devastating hurricane the next year and a [[smallpox]] epidemic that killed about 1,500 in 1669. In 1687, the Spaniards captured the fort at Petit-Goave, but the French fought back and hanged their leaders. Two years later Louis XIV was at war and ordered the French to invade the Spaniards, and Tarin de Cussy sacked Santiago. In 1691, the Spaniards [[Battle of Sabana Real|attacked the north]] and sacked Cap-Fran\u00e7ois. Island tensions subsided once peace was restored and Spain's last Habsburg monarch\u2014the deformed invalid Charles II\u2014died on 30 November 1700, being succeeded by the sixteen-year-old French Bourbon princeling Philip of Anjou.\n\n=== 18th century ===\n[[File:Campuzano Polanco Coat of Arms on Burial Slab.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Campuzano Polanco family]] coat of arms]]\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] replaced the [[House of Habsburg]] in Spain in 1700 and introduced economic reforms that gradually began to revive trade in Santo Domingo. The crown progressively relaxed the rigid controls and restrictions on commerce between Spain and the colonies and among the colonies. The last ''flotas'' sailed in 1737; the monopoly port system was abolished shortly thereafter. By the middle of the century, the population was bolstered by emigration from the [[Canary Islands]], resettling the northern part of the colony and planting tobacco in the [[Cibao Valley]], and importation of slaves was renewed. The colony of Santo Domingo saw a population increase during the 17th century, as it rose to about 91,272 in 1750. Of this number approximately 38,272 were white landowners, 38,000 were free mixed people of color, and some 15,000 were slaves. This contrasted sharply with the population of the French colony of Saint-Domingue (present-day Haiti)&nbsp;\u2013 the wealthiest colony in the Caribbean and whose population of one-half a million was 90% enslaved and overall seven times as numerous as the Spanish colony of Santo Domingo.<ref name=\"google48\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/3.htm|title=Dominican Republic \u2013 THE FIRST COLONY|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> The 'Spanish' settlers, whose blood by now was mixed with that of Tainos, Africans and Canary Guanches, proclaimed: 'It does not matter if the French are richer than us, we are still the true inheritors of this island. In our veins runs the blood of the heroic ''conquistadores'' who won this island of ours with sword and blood.'<ref>{{cite book|title=Peasants and Religion: A Socioeconomic Study of Dios Olivorio and the Palma Sola Religion in the Dominican Republic|page=565}}</ref>\n[[File:Capture of the French Privateer Sandwich by armed Marines on the Sloop Sally, from the U.S. Frigate Constitution, Puerto - NARA - 532590.tif|thumb|[[Fortaleza San Felipe]] was the site of the [[battle of Puerto Plata Harbor]] in May 1800, one of the few land battles of the [[Quasi-War]] with France, when U.S. forces from the frigate ''Constitution'' captured it.]]\nWhen the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]] between Spain and Britain broke out in 1739, Spanish [[privateer]]s, particularly from Santo Domingo, began to troll the Caribbean Sea, a development that lasted until the end of the eighteenth century. During this period, Spanish privateers from Santo Domingo sailed into enemy ports looking for ships to plunder, thus harming commerce with Britain and New York. As a result, the Spanish obtained stolen merchandise\u2014foodstuffs, ships, enslaved persons\u2014that were sold in Hispaniola's ports, with profits accruing to individual sea raiders. The revenue acquired in these acts of piracy was invested in the economic expansion of the colony and led to repopulation from Europe.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ricourt|first1=Milagros|title=The Dominican Racial Imaginary: Surveying the Landscape of Race and Nation in Hispaniola|date=2016|publisher=Rutgers University Press|page=57}}</ref> As restrictions on colonial trade were relaxed, the colonial elites of St. Domingue offered the principal market for Santo Domingo's exports of beef, hides, mahogany, and tobacco. With the outbreak of the [[Haitian Revolution]] in 1791, the rich urban families linked to the colonial bureaucracy fled the island, while most of the rural ''hateros'' (cattle ranchers) remained, even though they lost their principal market. Although the population of Spanish Santo Domingo was perhaps one-fourth that of French Saint-Domingue, this did not prevent the Spanish king from launching an invasion of the French side of the island in 1793, attempting to take advantage of the chaos sparked by the [[French Revolution]].<ref name=Scheina>{{cite book|last1=Scheina|first1=Robert L.|title=Latin America's Wars: Volume 1|date=2003|publisher=Potomac Books}}</ref> French forces checked Spanish progress toward Port-au-Prince in the south, but the Spanish pushed rapidly through the north, most of which they occupied by 1794.\n\nAlthough the Spanish military effort went well on Hispaniola, it did not so in Europe (see [[War of the Pyrenees]]). As a consequence, Spain was forced to cede Santo Domingo to the French under the terms of the [[Peace of Basel|Treaty of Basel]] (July 22, 1795) in order to get the French to withdraw from Spain.\n\n=== French rule ===\n{{Main|Era de Francia}}\n[[File:Battle of Santo Domingo (French and British ships).jpg|thumb|left|French and British ships fighting at the [[Battle of San Domingo|battle of Santo Domingo (1806)]]]]\nFrom 1795 to 1822 the city changed hands several times along with the colony it headed. It was ceded to France in 1795 after years of struggles. However, the French failed to consolidate this cession, mainly because of the continued presence of British troops in Saint-Domingue (they remained until 1798). As the news of Santo Domingo's cession became known on the island, many Dominicans had sided with Britain against France, welcoming British ships into their ports, pledging allegiance to the British and enlisting in the military forces of France's nemesis.<ref>{{cite book|title=An Islandwide Struggle for Freedom: Revolution, Emancipation, and Reenslavement in Hispaniola, 1789-1809|page=93}}</ref> The city was briefly captured by Haitian rebels in 1801, recovered by France in 1802, and was once again reclaimed by Spain in 1809. [[Toussaint Louverture]], who at least in theory represented imperial France, marched into Santo Domingo from Saint-Domingue to enforce the terms of the treaty. Toussaint's army committed numerous atrocities; as a consequence, the Spanish population fled from Santo Domingo in exodus proportions. French control of the former Spanish colony passed from Toussaint Louverture to Gen. [[Charles Leclerc (general, born 1772)|Charles Leclerc]] when he seized the city of Santo Domingo in early 1802. Following the defeat of the French under Gen. Donatien de Rochembeau at Le Cap in November 1803 by the Haitians, their new leader, [[Jean-Jacques Dessalines|Dessalines]], attempted to drive the French out of Santo Domingo. He invaded the Spanish side of the island, defeated the French-led Spanish colonials at River Yaque del Sur, and besieged the capital on March 5, 1805. At the same time, the Haitian General [[Henri Christophe|Christophe]] marched north through Cibao, capturing Santiago where he massacred prominent individuals who had sought refuge in a church. The arrival of small French squadrons off the Haitian coast at Goncaives and at Santo Domingo forced the Haitians to withdraw.

In order to raise funds for the huge indemnity of 150 million francs that Haiti agreed to pay the former French colonists, and which was subsequently lowered to 60 million francs, the Haitian government imposed heavy taxes on the Dominicans. Since Haiti was unable to adequately provision its army, the occupying forces largely survived by commandeering or confiscating food and supplies at gunpoint. Attempts to [[Land reform|redistribute]] land conflicted with the system of communal land tenure (''terrenos comuneros''), which had arisen with the ranching economy, and some people resented being forced to grow cash crops under Boyer and [[Joseph Balthazar Inginac]]'s ''Code Rural''.{{efn|''Terrenos comuneros'' arose because of \"scarce population, low value of the land, the absence of officials qualified to survey the lands, and the difficulty of dividing up the ranch in such a way that each would receive a share of the grasslands, forests, streams, palm groves, and small agricultural plots that, only when combined, made possible the exploitation of the ranch.\" (Hoetink, ''The Dominican People: Notes for a Historical Sociology'' transl. Stephen Ault Pg. 83 (Johns Hopkins Press: Baltimore, 1982)}} In the rural and rugged mountainous areas, the Haitian administration was usually too inefficient to enforce its own laws. It was in the city of Santo Domingo that the effects of the occupation were most acutely felt, and it was there that the movement for independence originated.\n\nThe Haitians associated the [[Roman Catholic Church]] with the French slave-masters who had exploited them before independence and confiscated all church property, deported all foreign clergy, and severed the ties of the remaining clergy to the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. All levels of education collapsed; the university was shut down, as it was starved both of resources and students, with young Dominican men from 16 to 25 years old being drafted into the Haitian army. Boyer's occupation troops, who were largely Dominicans, were unpaid and had to \"forage and sack\" from Dominican civilians. Haiti imposed a \"heavy tribute\" on the Dominican people.<ref name=\"Matibag\" />{{rp|page number needed}}\n\nHaiti's constitution forbade white elites from owning land, and Dominican major landowning families were forcibly deprived of their properties. During this time, many white elites in Santo Domingo did not consider owning slaves due to the economic crisis that Santo Domingo faced during the [[Espa\u00f1a Boba]] period. The few landowners that wanted slavery established in Santo Domingo had to emigrate to other colonies such as [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]], or [[Gran Colombia]]. Many landowning families stayed on the island, with a heavy concentration of landowners settling in the [[cibao]] region. After independence, and eventually being under [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|Spanish rule]] once again in 1861, many families returned to Santo Domingo including new waves of immigration from [[Spain]].\n\n=== Dominican War of Independence (1844)===\n{{See also|Dominican War of Independence}}\n[[File:Parque y Parroquia Hato Mayor.jpg|thumb|Statues honoring Trinitarian leaders [[Juan Pablo Duarte]], [[Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez]], and [[Mat\u00edas Ram\u00f3n Mella]].]]\nIn 1838, [[Juan Pablo Duarte]] founded a secret society called [[La Trinitaria (Dominican Republic)|La Trinitaria]], which sought the complete independence of Santo Domingo without any foreign intervention.<ref name=\"pons\">{{cite book |first=Frank |last =Moya Pons| authorlink =Frank Moya Pons | title = The Dominican Republic: A National History|edition= August 1, 1998|page= 543 |publisher = Markus Wiener Publishers; 2nd edition| isbn= 978-1-55876-191-9|year =1998}}</ref>{{rp|p147\u2013149}} Also [[Francisco del Rosario S\u00e1nchez]] and [[Ramon Matias Mella]], despite not being among the founding members of La Trinitaria, were decisive in the fight for independence.

They rose up on January 27, 1843, ostensibly in support of the Haitian [[Charles Rivi\u00e8re-H\u00e9rard|Charles H\u00e9rard]] who was challenging Boyer for the control of Haiti. However, the movement soon discarded its pretext of support for H\u00e9rard and now championed Dominican independence. After overthrowing Boyer, H\u00e9rard executed some Dominicans, and threw many others into prison; Duarte escaped.<ref name=Scheina/> After subduing the Dominicans, H\u00e9rard, a mulatto, faced a rebellion by blacks in [[Port-au-Prince]].

They were backed by [[Pedro Santana]], a wealthy cattle rancher from [[El Seibo]], who became general of the army of the nascent republic. The Dominican Republic's first [[Constitution of the Dominican Republic|Constitution]] was adopted on November 6, 1844, and was modeled after the [[United States Constitution]].<ref name=\"Encarta\"/> The decades that followed were filled with tyranny, factionalism, economic difficulties, rapid changes of government, and exile for political opponents. Archrivals Santana and [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] held power most of the time, both ruling arbitrarily. They promoted competing plans to annex the new nation to another power: Santana favored Spain, and B\u00e1ez the United States.\n\nThreatening the nation's independence were renewed Haitian invasions. On 19 March 1844, the Haitian Army, under the personal command of President H\u00e9rard, invaded the eastern province from the north and progressed as far as Santiago, but was soon forced to withdraw after suffering disproportionate losses. According to Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Imbert's (the General defending Santiago) report of April 5, 1844 to Santo Domingo, \u201cin Santiago, the enemy did not leave behind in the battlefield less than six hundred dead and\u2026the number of wounded was very superior\u2026[while on] our part we suffered not one casualty.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://etd.library.vanderbilt.edu/available/etd-03272011-220809/unrestricted/DePena.pdf|title=The Siblings of Hispaniola: Political Union and Separation of Haiti and Santo Domingo, 1822\u20131844}}</ref>\n\nThe Dominicans repelled the Haitian forces, on both land and sea, by December 1845.

These privileges not only served him to win the war but also allowed him to persecute, execute and drive into exile his political opponents, among which Duarte was the most important. In Haiti after the fall of Boyer, black leaders had ascended to the power once enjoyed exclusively by the mulatto elite.<ref>{{cite book|title=Haitian-Dominican Counterpoint: Nation, State, and Race on Hispaniola|page=114}}</ref>\n\nWithout adequate roads, the regions of the Dominican Republic developed in isolation from one another. In the south, also known at the time as Ozama, the economy was dominated by cattle-ranching (particularly in the southeastern savannah) and cutting mahogany and other hardwoods for export. This region retained a semi-feudal character, with little commercial agriculture, the hacienda as the dominant social unit, and the majority of the population living at a subsistence level. In the north (better-known as Cibao), the nation's richest farmland, peasants supplemented their subsistence crops by growing tobacco for export, mainly to Germany. Tobacco required less land than cattle ranching and was mainly grown by smallholders, who relied on itinerant traders to transport their crops to Puerto Plata and Monte Cristi. Santana antagonized the Cibao farmers, enriching himself and his supporters at their expense by resorting to multiple peso printings that allowed him to buy their crops for a fraction of their value. In 1848, he was forced to resign and was succeeded by his vice-president, [[Manuel Jimenes]].\n\nAfter defeating a new Haitian invasion in 1849, Santana marched on Santo Domingo and deposed Jimenes in a coup d'\u00e9tat. At his behest, Congress elected Buenaventura B\u00e1ez as President, but B\u00e1ez was unwilling to serve as Santana's puppet, challenging his role as the country's acknowledged military leader. In 1853, Santana was elected president for his second term, forcing B\u00e1ez into exile. Three years later, after repulsing another Haitian invasion, he negotiated a treaty leasing a portion of Saman\u00e1 Peninsula to a U.S. company; popular opposition forced him to abdicate, enabling B\u00e1ez to return and seize power. With the treasury depleted, B\u00e1ez printed eighteen million uninsured pesos, purchasing the 1857 tobacco crop with this currency and exporting it for [[hard cash]] at immense profit to himself and his followers. Cibao tobacco planters, who were ruined when hyperinflation ensued, revolted and formed a new government headed by [[Jos\u00e9 Desiderio Valverde]] and headquartered in Santiago de los Caballeros. In July 1857 General [[Juan Luis Franco Bid\u00f3]] besieged Santo Domingo. The Cibao-based government declared an amnesty to exiles and Santana returned and managed to replace Franco Bid\u00f3 in September 1857. After a year of civil war, Santana captured Santo Domingo in June 1858, overthrew both B\u00e1ez and Valverde and installed himself as president.<ref name=Cross>{{cite book |title= Sociedad y desarrollo en Rep\u00fablica Dominicana, 1844\u20131899 |date= 1984 |last=Cross Beras |first=Julio A. |publisher=CENAPEC |isbn=978-84-89525-17-7}}</ref>\n\n=== Restoration republic ===\n{{See also|Dominican Restoration War}}\n[[File:Luperoncaballo.JPG|thumb|[[Gregorio Luper\u00f3n]] fought against the pretensions of Pedro Santana to recover the Dominican sovereignty.]]\nIn 1861, after imprisoning, silencing, exiling, and executing many of his opponents and due to political and economic reasons, Santana signed a pact with the Spanish Crown and reverted the Dominican nation to [[Spanish occupation of the Dominican Republic|colonial status]].

But this brought no peace and, with his former [[Secretary of War]] [[Desiderio Arias]] maneuvering to depose him and despite a U.S. offer of military aid against Arias, Jimenes resigned on May 7, 1916.<ref name=\"congress\">{{cite web| title=Dominican Republic: Occupation by the United States, 1916\u20131924| work=Country Studies| publisher=[[Library of Congress]]; Federal Research Division| url=http://countrystudies.us/dominican-republic/10.htm| accessdate=May 29, 2007}}</ref>\n[[File:Ocupacion-1916.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[United States Marine Corps]] at the time landing on Dominican soil in 1916.]]\n[[File:USMC Fortaleza Ozama 1922 restored.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The flag of the [[United States]] waving over [[Fortaleza Ozama|Ozama Fortress]] during the [[United States occupation of the Dominican Republic (1916\u201324)|U.S. occupation]] of the Dominican Republic, c. 1922]]\nWilson thus ordered the U.S. occupation of the Dominican Republic.

This position helped him launch his plans to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez. Trujillo had the support of Carlos Rosario Pe\u00f1a, who formed the Civic Movement, which had as its main objective to overthrow the government of V\u00e1squez.\n\nIn February 1930, when V\u00e1squez attempted to win another term, his opponents rebelled in secret alliance with the commander of the National Army (the former National Guard), General [[Rafael Trujillo|Rafael Leonidas Trujillo Molina]]. Trujillo secretly cut a deal with rebel leader [[Rafael Estrella Ure\u00f1a]]; in return for letting Ure\u00f1a take power, Trujillo would be allowed to run for president in new elections. As the rebels marched toward Santo Domingo, V\u00e1squez ordered Trujillo to suppress them. However, feigning \"neutrality,\" Trujillo kept his men in barracks, allowing Ure\u00f1a's rebels to take the capital virtually uncontested. On March 3, Ure\u00f1a was proclaimed acting president with Trujillo confirmed as head of the police and the army.\n\nAs per their agreement, Trujillo became the presidential nominee of the newly formed Patriotic Coalition of Citizens (Spanish: Coalici\u00f3n patriotica de los ciudadanos), with Ure\u00f1a as his running mate. During the election campaign, Trujillo used the army to unleash his repression, forcing his opponents to withdraw from the race. Trujillo stood to elect himself, and in May he was elected president virtually unopposed after a violent campaign against his opponents, ascending to power on August 16, 1930.\n\n=== Trujillo Era (1930\u201361)===\n[[File:Rafel Trujillo 1934.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Rafael Trujillo]] imposed a dictatorship of 31 years in the country (1930\u20131961)]]\n\nThere was considerable economic growth during [[Rafael Trujillo]]'s long and iron-fisted regime, although a great deal of the wealth was taken by the dictator and other regime elements. There was progress in healthcare, education, and transportation, with the building of hospitals and clinics, schools, and roads and harbors. Trujillo also carried out an important housing construction program and instituted a pension plan.

It shares the island roughly at a 2:1 ratio with [[Haiti]], the north-to-south (though somewhat irregular) border between the two countries being {{convert|376|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> To the north and north-west lie [[The Bahamas]] and the [[Turks and Caicos Islands]], and to west, across the [[Mona Passage]], the US Commonwealth of [[Puerto Rico]]. The country's area is reported variously as {{convert|48442|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} (by the embassy in the United States)<ref name=embassy/> and {{convert|48670|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> making it the second largest country in the [[Antilles]], after [[Cuba]]. The Dominican Republic's capital and largest city [[Santo Domingo]] is on the southern coast.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/>\n\n[[File:Constanza (15196384558).jpg|thumb|[[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]] valley]]\nThe Dominican Republic has four important mountain ranges. The most northerly is the ''[[Cordillera Septentrional]]'' (\"Northern Mountain Range\"), which extends from the northwestern coastal town of [[San Fernando de Monte Cristi|Monte Cristi]], near the Haitian border, to the [[Saman\u00e1 Peninsula]] in the east, running parallel to the Atlantic coast. The highest range in the Dominican Republic&nbsp;\u2013 indeed, in the whole of the West Indies&nbsp;\u2013 is the ''[[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]]'' (\"Central Mountain Range\"). It gradually bends southwards and finishes near the town of [[Azua de Compostela|Azua]], on the Caribbean coast. In the Cordillera Central are the four highest peaks in the Caribbean: [[Pico Duarte]] ({{convert|3098|m|ft|0|disp=or}} above sea level),<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> La Pelona ({{convert|3094|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), La Rucilla ({{convert|3049|m|ft|0|disp=or}}), and Pico Yaque ({{convert|2760|m|ft|0|disp=or}}). In the southwest corner of the country, south of the Cordillera Central, there are two other ranges: the more northerly of the two is the ''[[Sierra de Neiba]]'', while in the south the ''[[Sierra de Bahoruco]]'' is a continuation of the [[Massif de la Selle]] in Haiti. There are other, minor mountain ranges, such as the ''Cordillera Oriental'' (\"Eastern Mountain Range\"), ''Sierra Mart\u00edn Garc\u00eda'', ''Sierra de Yamas\u00e1'', and ''Sierra de Saman\u00e1''.\n\nBetween the Central and Northern mountain ranges lies the rich and fertile [[Cibao]] valley. This major valley is home to the cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] and [[Concepci\u00f3n de La Vega|La Vega]] and most of the farming areas of the nation. Rather less productive are the semi-arid San Juan Valley, south of the Central Cordillera, and the Neiba Valley, tucked between the Sierra de Neiba and the Sierra de Bahoruco. Much of the land around the [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]] Basin is below sea level, with a hot, arid, desert-like environment. There are other smaller valleys in the mountains, such as the [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], [[Jarabacoa]], [[Villa Altagracia]], and [[Bonao]] valleys.\n\nThe ''Llano Costero del Caribe'' (\"Caribbean Coastal Plain\") is the largest of the plains in the Dominican Republic. Stretching north and east of Santo Domingo, it contains many sugar plantations in the [[savannah]]s that are common there. West of Santo Domingo its width is reduced to {{convert|10|km|mi}} as it hugs the coast, finishing at the mouth of the Ocoa River. Another large plain is the ''Plena de Azua'' (\"Azua Plain\"), a very arid region in [[Azua Province]]. A few other small coastal plains are on the northern coast and in the [[Pedernales Province|Pedernales]] Peninsula.\n[[File:Dominican republic Los Haitises mangroves.jpeg|thumb|left|Mangroves in Los Haitises National Park]]\nFour major rivers drain the numerous mountains of the Dominican Republic. The [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]] is the longest and most important Dominican river. It carries excess water down from the Cibao Valley and empties into Monte Cristi Bay, in the northwest. Likewise, the [[Yuna River]] serves the Vega Real and empties into Saman\u00e1 Bay, in the northeast. Drainage of the San Juan Valley is provided by the San Juan River, [[tributary]] of the [[Yaque del Sur]], which empties into the Caribbean, in the south. The [[Artibonite River|Artibonito]] is the longest river of Hispaniola and flows westward into Haiti.\n\nThere are many lakes and coastal lagoons. The largest lake is [[Lake Enriquillo|Enriquillo]], a [[salt lake]] at {{convert|45|m|ft|0}} below sea level, the lowest elevation in the Caribbean.<ref name=\"CIADemo\"/> Other important lakes are [[Laguna de Rinc\u00f3n]] or Cabral, with [[freshwater|fresh water]], and [[Laguna de Oviedo]], a lagoon with [[brackish water]].\n\nThere are many small offshore islands and [[cay]]s that form part of the Dominican territory. The two largest islands near shore are [[Saona Island|Saona]], in the southeast, and [[Beata]], in the southwest. Smaller islands include the [[Cayos Siete Hermanos]], [[Isla Cabra]], [[Cayo Jackson]], [[Cayo Lim\u00f3n]], [[Cayo Levantado]], [[Cayo la Bocaina]], [[Catalina Island (Dominican Republic)|Catalanita]], [[Cayo Pisaje]] and [[Isla Alto Velo]]. To the north, at distances of {{convert|100|-|200|km|mi|0}}, are three extensive, largely submerged [[Bank (topography)|banks]], which geographically are a southeast continuation of [[the Bahamas]]: [[Navidad Bank]], [[Silver Bank]], and [[Mouchoir Bank]]. Navidad Bank and Silver Bank have been officially claimed by the Dominican Republic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} [[Isla Cabritos]] lies within [[Lago Enriquillo]].\n\nThe Dominican Republic is located near fault action in the Caribbean. In 1946, it suffered [[1946 Dominican Republic earthquake|a magnitude 8.1 earthquake]] off the northeast coast, triggering a [[tsunami]] that killed about 1,800, mostly in coastal communities. Caribbean countries and the United States have collaborated to create tsunami warning systems and are mapping high-risk low-lying areas.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{Main|Climate of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Dominican Republic K\u00f6ppen.svg|upright=1.35|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification system|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of the Dominican Republic]]\n<!--[[File:Los Haitises Park.jpeg|thumb|Los Haitises Park National Park]]-->\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] in the coastal and lowland areas.

With the construction of projects like [[Cap Cana]], San Souci Port in Santo Domingo, [[Casa de Campo, Dominican Republic|Casa De Campo]] and the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino (ancient Moon Palace Resort) in [[Punta Cana]], the Dominican Republic expects increased tourism activity in the upcoming years.\n\n[[Ecotourism]] has also been a topic increasingly important in this nation, with towns like [[Jarabacoa]] and neighboring [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]], and locations like the [[Pico Duarte]], [[Bahia de las Aguilas]], and others becoming more significant in efforts to increase direct benefits from tourism. Most residents from other countries [[Visa policy of the Dominican Republic|are required to get a tourist card]], depending on the country they live in. In the last 10 years the Dominican Republic has become one of the worlds notably progressive states in terms of recycling and waste disposal. A UN report cited there was a 221.3% efficiency increase in the previous 10 years due, in part, to the opening of the largest open air landfill site located in the north 10&nbsp;km from the Haitian border.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n\n=== Transportation ===\n{{Main|Transportation in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:Obelisco Santo Domingo.jpg|thumb|El Malecon av. in [[Santo Domingo]]]]\nThe country has three national trunk highways, which connect every major town. These are [[DR-1]], [[DR-2]], and [[DR-3]], which depart from Santo Domingo toward the northern (Cibao), southwestern (Sur), and eastern (El Este) parts of the country respectively. These highways have been consistently improved with the expansion and reconstruction of many sections. Two other national highways serve as spur ([[DR-5]]) or alternative routes ([[DR-4]]).\n\nIn addition to the national highways, the government has embarked on an expansive reconstruction of spur secondary routes, which connect smaller towns to the trunk routes. In the last few years the government constructed a 106-kilometer toll road that connects Santo Domingo with the country's northeastern peninsula. Travelers may now arrive in the Saman\u00e1 Peninsula in less than two hours. Other additions are the reconstruction of the DR-28 (Jarabacoa&nbsp;\u2013 Constanza) and [[DR-12]] (Constanza&nbsp;\u2013 Bonao). Despite these efforts, many secondary routes still remain either unpaved or in need of maintenance. There is currently a nationwide program to pave these and other commonly used routes. Also, the [[Santiago light rail]] system is in planning stages but currently on hold.\n\n=== Bus services ===\nThere are two main bus transportation services in the Dominican Republic: one controlled by the government, through the Oficina T\u00e9cnica de Transito Terrestre (OTTT) and the Oficina Metropolitana de Servicios de Autobuses (OMSA), and the other controlled by private business, among them, Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de Transporte La Nueva Opci\u00f3n (FENATRANO) and the Confederacion Nacional de Transporte (CONATRA). The government transportation system covers large routes in metropolitan areas such as Santo Domingo and Santiago.\n\nThere are many privately owned bus companies, such as Metro Servicios Tur\u00edsticos and Caribe Tours, that run daily routes.\n\n=== Santo Domingo Metro ===\n[[File:Stodgo metro.jpg|thumb|A pair of 9000 series are tested on the Santo Domingo Metro.]]\n{{Main|Santo Domingo Metro}}\nThe Dominican Republic has a [[rapid transit]] system in [[Santo Domingo]], the country's capital. It is the most extensive metro system in the insular [[Caribbean]] and Central American region by length and number of stations. The Santo Domingo Metro is part of a major \"National Master Plan\" to improve transportation in Santo Domingo as well as the rest of the nation. The first line was planned to relieve traffic congestion in the [[DR-1|M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez]] and [[DR-13|Hermanas Mirabal Avenue]]. The second line, which opened in April 2013, is meant to relieve the congestion along the [[DR-13|Duarte-Kennedy-Centenario]] Corridor in the city from west to east. The current length of the Metro, with the sections of the two lines open {{as of|2013|August|lc=y}}, is {{convert|27.35|km|mi}}.

[[Cable Internet access|Cable Internet]] and [[Digital subscriber line|DSL]] are available in most parts of the country, and many [[Internet service provider]]s offer [[3G]] wireless internet service. The Dominican Republic became the second country in Latin America to have 4G LTE wireless service. The reported speeds are from 1 Mbit/s up to 100 Mbit/s for residential services.\n\nFor commercial service there are speeds from 256 kbit/s up to 154 Mbit/s. (Each set of numbers denotes [[Cable Internet access|downstream/upstream speed]]; that is, to the user/from the user.) Projects to extend [[Wi-Fi]] hot spots have been made in Santo Domingo. The country's commercial radio stations and television stations are in the process of transferring to the [[Data transmission|digital spectrum]], via [[HD Radio]] and [[High-definition television|HDTV]] after officially adopting [[Advanced Television Systems Committee standards|ATSC]] as the digital medium in the country with a switch-off of analog transmission by September 2015. The telecommunications regulator in the country is INDOTEL (''Instituto Dominicano de Telecomunicaciones'').\n\nThe largest telecommunications company is [[Claro Rep\u00fablica Dominicana|Claro]]&nbsp;\u2013 part of [[Carlos Slim]]'s [[Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil]]&nbsp;\u2013 which provides wireless, landline, broadband, and [[IPTV]] services.

However, the country has a long history of [[fine art]] that goes back to the middle of the 1800s when the country became independent and the beginnings of a national art scene emerged.\n\nHistorically, the painting of this time were centered around images connected to national independence, historical scenes, portraits but also landscapes and images of still life. Styles of painting ranged between [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]]. Between 1920 and 1940 the art scene was influenced by styles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] and [[impressionism]]. Dominican artists were focused on breaking from previous, academic styles in order to develop more independent and individual styles.\n\n=== Architecture ===\n[[File:Church and Convent Regina Angelorum CCSD 07 2018 0762.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Church and Convent, Colonial Santo Domingo.]]\nThe architecture in the Dominican Republic represents a complex blend of diverse cultures. The deep influence of the [[Europe]]an colonists is the most evident throughout the country. Characterized by ornate designs and [[baroque architecture|baroque]] structures, the style can best be seen in the capital city of [[Santo Domingo]], which is home to the first cathedral, castle, monastery, and fortress in all of the [[Americas]], located in the city's [[Ciudad Colonial (Santo Domingo)|Colonial Zone]], an area declared as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/526|title=Colonial City of Santo Domingo|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/nac/geoportal.php?country=DO&language=E|title=Dominican Republic National Commission for UNESCO|work=UNESCO|date=November 14, 1957|accessdate=August 24, 2016}}</ref> The designs carry over into the villas and buildings throughout the country. It can also be observed on buildings that contain stucco exteriors, arched doors and windows, and red tiled roofs.\n\nThe indigenous peoples of the Dominican Republic have also had a significant influence on the architecture of the country. The [[Ta\u00edno]] people relied heavily on the mahogany and guano (dried palm tree leaf) to put together crafts, artwork, furniture, and houses. Utilizing mud, thatched roofs, and mahogany trees, they gave buildings and the furniture inside a natural look, seamlessly blending in with the island's surroundings.\n\nLately, with the rise in tourism and increasing popularity as a Caribbean vacation destination, architects in the Dominican Republic have now begun to incorporate cutting-edge designs that emphasize luxury. In many ways an architectural playground, villas and hotels implement new styles, while offering new takes on the old. This new style is characterized by simplified, angular corners and large windows that blend outdoor and indoor spaces. As with the culture as a whole, contemporary architects embrace the Dominican Republic's rich history and various cultures to create something new. Surveying modern villas, one can find any combination of the three major styles: a villa may contain angular, modernist building construction, Spanish Colonial-style arched windows, and a traditional Taino hammock in the bedroom balcony.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n{{Main|Cuisine of the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:ChicharronMixto.JPG|thumb|Chicharr\u00f3n mixto, common dish in the country derived from Andalusia in southern Spain.]]\n\nDominican cuisine is predominantly [[Spanish cuisine#Spanish regional variation: typical dishes and meal routines|Spanish]], [[Ta\u00edno#Food and agriculture|Ta\u00edno]], and [[African cuisine|African]].

Between 1937 and 1950 merengue music was promoted internationally by Dominican groups like Billo's Caracas Boys, Chapuseaux and Damiron \"Los Reyes del Merengue,\" Joseito Mateo, and others. Radio, television, and international media popularized it further. Some well known merengue performers are [[Wilfrido Vargas]], [[Johnny Ventura]], singer-songwriter [[Los Hermanos Rosario]], [[Juan Luis Guerra]], [[Fernando Villalona]], [[Eddy Herrera]], [[Sergio Vargas]], [[To\u00f1o Rosario]], [[Milly Quezada]], and [[Chich\u00ed Peralta]].\n\nMerengue became popular in the United States, mostly on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], during the 1980s and 1990s,<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|375}} when many Dominican artists residing in the U.S. (particularly New York) started performing in the Latin club scene and gained radio airplay. They included Victor Roque y La Gran Manzana, Henry Hierro, Zacarias Ferreira, Aventura, and Milly Jocelyn Y Los Vecinos. The emergence of ''[[Bachata (music)|bachata]]'', along with an increase in the number of Dominicans living among other [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] groups in New York, [[New Jersey]], and Florida, has contributed to Dominican music's overall growth in popularity.<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|378}}\n\n[[Bachata (music)|Bachata]], a form of music and dance that originated in the countryside and rural marginal neighborhoods of the Dominican Republic, has become quite popular in recent years. Its subjects are often romantic; especially prevalent are tales of heartbreak and sadness. In fact, the original name for the genre was ''amargue'' (\"bitterness,\" or \"bitter music,\"), until the rather ambiguous (and mood-neutral) term ''bachata'' became popular. Bachata grew out of, and is still closely related to, the [[Pan-Latinism|pan-Latin]] American romantic style called ''[[bolero]]''. Over time, it has been influenced by merengue and by a variety of Latin American guitar styles.\n\n[[Palo music|Palo]] is an [[Afro-Dominican (Dominican Republic)|Afro-Dominican]] sacred music that can be found throughout the island. The drum and human voice are the principal instruments. Palo is played at religious ceremonies\u2014usually coinciding with saints' religious feast days\u2014as well as for secular parties and special occasions. Its roots are in the [[Congo region]] of central-west Africa, but it is mixed with European influences in the melodies.<ref>[http://www.iasorecords.com/music/palo-drum-afro-dominican-tradition Palo Drum: Afro-Dominican Tradition]. iasorecords.com</ref>\n\n[[Salsa music]] has had a great deal of popularity in the country. During the late 1960s Dominican musicians like [[Johnny Pacheco]], creator of the [[Fania All Stars]], played a significant role in the development and popularization of the genre.\n\n[[Dominican rock]] and [[Reggaeton]] are also popular.

The flag has a large white cross that divides it into four quarters. Two quarters are red and two are blue. Red represents the blood shed by the liberators. Blue expresses God's protection over the nation. The white cross symbolizes the struggle of the liberators to bequeath future generations a free nation. An alternative interpretation is that blue represents the ideals of progress and liberty, whereas white symbolizes peace and unity among Dominicans.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113181033/http://www.ejercito.mil.do/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=165&Itemid=132 |archivedate=January 13, 2009 |title=Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional de la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana&nbsp;\u2013 Bandera Nacional |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |publisher=National Army of the Dominican Republic |language=Spanish}}</ref>\n\nIn the center of the cross is the Dominican coat of arms, in the same colors as the national flag. The coat of arms pictures a red, white, and blue flag-draped shield with a Bible, a gold cross, and arrows; the shield is surrounded by an olive branch (on the left) and a palm branch (on the right). The Bible traditionally represents the truth and the light. The gold cross symbolizes the redemption from slavery, and the arrows symbolize the noble soldiers and their proud military.  A blue ribbon above the shield reads, \"Dios, Patria, Libertad\" (meaning \"God, Fatherland, Liberty\"). A red ribbon under the shield reads, \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana\" (meaning \"Dominican Republic\"). Out of all the flags in the world, the depiction of a Bible is unique to the Dominican flag.\n\nThe [[Floral emblem|national flower]] is the [[Pereskia quisqueyana|Bayahibe Rose]] and the [[national tree]] is the [[Swietenia mahagoni|West Indian Mahogany]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.listindiario.com/la-vida/2011/7/16/196080/La-rosa-de-Bayahibe-nuestra-flor-nacional |title=La rosa de Bayah\u00edbe, nuestra flor nacional|author=L\u00f3pez, Yaniris |work=Listin Diario |date=July 17, 2011}}</ref> The national bird is the ''Cigua Palmera'' or [[Palmchat]] (\"Dulus dominicus\").<ref name=depaul>{{cite web|url=http://www.diariodigital.com.do/articulo,30016,html |title=El jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico Nacional |trans-title=The National Botanical Garden |language=es |last=P\u00e9rez |first=Faustino |work=DiarioDigitalRD.com |accessdate=October 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023033403/http://www.diariodigital.com.do/articulo%2C30016%2Chtml |archivedate=October 23, 2008 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe Dominican Republic celebrates [[Dia de la Altagracia]] on January 21 in honor of its patroness, [[Juan Pablo Duarte|Duarte]]'s Day on January 26 in honor of one of its founding fathers, Independence Day on February 27, [[Dominican Restoration War|Restoration Day]] on August 16, ''Virgen de las Mercedes'' on September 24, and [[Constitution Day]] on November 6.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{Main|Sports in the Dominican Republic}}\n[[File:DSC00621 Albert Pujols.jpg|thumb|150px|Dominican native and [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Albert Pujols]]]]\n\n[[Baseball]] is by far the most popular sport in the Dominican Republic.<ref name=\"Harvey2006\"/>{{rp|59}} The country has a baseball league of six teams.

Stan is upset that he has to go and becomes even more angered when he is locked in a room with nerdy \"Melvin\" classmates that he does not like: [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Pip Pirrup|Pip]], [[Butters Stotch|Butters]], and [[Dougie (South Park)|Dougie]]. After finding a box of women's clothing the three insist on playing ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', and an unenthusiastic Stan uses the game to find a way out of the basement to an upstairs bedroom where there are cookies and TV. Meanwhile, at the party, Mr. Mackey gives [[Gerald and Shiela Broflovski|the Broflovskis]] and [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Marshes]] a tour of his home and leads them out to the [[hot tub]]. The wives leave Randy and Gerald outside in the hot tub, who declare the present evening to be a night of experimenting. The two talk about [[threesomes]] and decide to [[masturbate]] in front of one another. This leads to awkwardness after Randy questions his sexuality.\n\nThe [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] thinks that the party inside is a [[mass suicide|suicide cult]], and that they plan to kill themselves at the start of the meteor shower. Determined to prevent this, they set up a blockade and prepare to open fire on the cult if they do not desist; at one point, a couple of party-goers leave and are immediately fatally shot at (due to the ATF believing they had weapons despite them clearly not having any). The Newsman recalls that the last time the ATF did this was at the [[Waco siege]] where they ended up killing innocent people for false accusation, but the ATF dismisses him. All the while, the party-goers (who progressively become drunk) inside are unaware of their presence. Stan and the kids discover what is happening and try to speak to the ATF, but are shot at and forced to flee back inside. The kids record a [[video tape]] showing that the party inside is not a cult to the Newsman; the ATF realizes their mistake, claiming it was a \"test simulation\" and quickly disperse after their secret weapon, a large rocket called \"The Negotiator\", fires and destroys every home in the neighborhood except for Mackey's. \n\nInside, Randy is extremely uncomfortable being around Gerald, who is concerned about Randy's behavior. When Randy finally admits to the entire party that he and Gerald engaged in group masturbation, he is relieved upon discovering that he's not the only one to have masturbated in front of a person of the same sex. Outside, the boys rejoice their triumph of saving the day and Stan realizes that the others are just normal kids like him. All is immediately forgotten, however, when [[Kyle Broflovski|Kyle]] returns from [[Jewbilee]] camp and Stan goes back to his old ways, telling Kyle that he had to \"spend the evening with these friggin' Melvins\".\n\nThe credits roll with a parody version of [[Cher]]'s \"[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]\" (which the ATF used to drown out the party-goers in an effort for them to submit, unaware that Mackey was playing the same song and which everyone enjoyed).\n\n==Production==\nTrey and Matt based much of the plot, including the ATF's use of Cher, on the [[Waco siege]] after watching the documentary [[Waco: The Rules of Engagement]].

Although keeping the navigation channel open was a continuing problem, Keitum harbour was the main connection between Sylt and the mainland until around 1867.

Work on the ''Keitum-Therme'' started in 2007 but stopped in 2008, after disagreement between the municipality Sylt-Ost and the builder, leaving the facility half-finished. Due to water and frost damage, the condition of the ruins has long deteriorated past the point at which work could be economically resumed. However, plans to demolish the structures have been blocked by lawsuits about the bankruptcy of the development company.<ref name=therme1>{{cite web|url=http://www.shz.de/lokales/sylter-rundschau/verhandlungen-ueber-thermenruine-gehen-in-naechste-runde-id8625221.html|title=Verhandlungen \u00fcber Thermenruine gehen in die n\u00e4chste Runde (German)|publisher=Sylter Rundschau|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=Therme2>{{cite web|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/region/article108767301/Keitum-Therme-Sylt-wird-teuerste-Ruine-nicht-los.html|title=Keitum-Therme - Sylt wird die teuerste Ruine nicht los (German)|publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n===Transport===\nKeitum has a railway station on the line between [[Westerland, Germany|Westerland]] and [[Nieb\u00fcll]].

Although the Convention was intended to revise the league of states and first system of government under the [[Articles of Confederation]], the intention from the outset of many of its proponents, chief among them [[James Madison]] of Virginia and [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York, was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one.  The delegates elected [[George Washington]] of Virginia, former commanding general of the [[Continental Army]] in the late [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) and proponent of a stronger national government, to become President of the Convention. The result of the Convention was the creation of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]], placing the Convention among the most significant events in American history.\n\nAt the time, the convention was not referred to as a \"Constitutional\" convention, nor did most of the delegates arrive intending to draft a new constitution.  Many assumed that the purpose of the convention was to discuss and draft improvements to the existing Articles of Confederation, and would have not agreed to participate otherwise. Once the Convention began, however, most of the delegates \u2013 though not all \u2013 came to agree in general terms that the goal would be a new system of government, not simply a revised version of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nSeveral broad outlines were proposed and debated, most notably James Madison's [[Virginia Plan]] and [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]]'s [[New Jersey Plan]]. The Virginia Plan was selected as the basis for the new government. While the concept of a federal government with three branches (legislative, executive, and judicial) and the general role of each branch was not heavily disputed, several issues delayed further progress and put the success of the Convention in doubt. The most contentious disputes revolved around the composition and election of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] as the upper legislative house of a [[bicameral]] [[United States Congress|Congress]]; whether \"proportional representation\" was to be defined by a state's geography or by its population, and whether slaves were to be counted; whether to divide the [[Executive (government)|executive power]] among three people or vest the power in a single chief executive to be called the President; how a president would be elected, for what term, and whether to limit each president to a single term in office; what offenses should be impeachable; the nature of a fugitive slave clause, and whether to allow the abolition of the slave trade; and whether judges should be chosen by the legislature or the executive. Most of the time during the Convention was spent on deciding these issues.\n\nProgress was slow until mid-July, when the [[Connecticut Compromise]] resolved enough lingering arguments for a draft written by the [[Committee of Detail]] to gain acceptance. Though more modifications and compromises were made over the following weeks, most of the rough draft remained in place and can be found in the finished version of the Constitution. After several more issues were resolved, the Committee on Style produced the final version in early September. It was voted on by the delegates, inscribed on parchment with engraving for printing, and signed by thirty-nine of fifty-five delegates on September 17, 1787. The completed proposed Constitution was then released to the public to begin the debate and [[History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution|ratification process]].\n\n==Historical context==\n{{Further|History of the United States (1776\u20131789)}}\n[[File:United States 1789-03 to 1789-08 eastern.jpg|thumb]]\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the [[Thirteen states|thirteen American states]] replaced their [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|colonial governments]] with [[republic]]an constitutions based on the principle of [[separation of powers]], organizing government into [[legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches. At the same time, these revolutionary constitutions endorsed [[legislative supremacy]] by placing most power in the legislature\u2014since it was viewed as most representative of the people\u2014including power traditionally considered as belonging to the executive and judicial branches. State [[Governor (United States)|governors]] lacked significant authority, and state courts and judges were under the control of the legislative branch.{{Sfn|Wood|1998|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nAfter [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaring independence]] from Britain in 1776, the thirteen states created a permanent alliance to coordinate American efforts to win the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This alliance, the [[United States]], was to be governed according to the [[Articles of Confederation]], which was more of a treaty between independent countries than a national constitution.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=13\u201314}} The Articles were adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in 1777 but not finally ratified by all states until 1781.{{Sfn|Van Cleve|2017|p=1}} During the [[Confederation Period]], the United States was essentially a federation of independent republics, with the Articles guaranteeing state sovereignty and independence. The Confederation was governed by the [[Congress of the Confederation]], a [[unicameral]] legislature whose members were chosen by the state legislatures and in which each state cast a single vote.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=4}} Congress was given a limited set of powers, mainly in the area of waging war and foreign affairs. It could not levy taxes or tariffs, and it could only request money from the states, with no power to force delinquent states to pay.{{Sfn|Van Cleve|2017|pp=4\u20135}} Since the Articles could only be amended by unanimous vote of the states, any state had effective [[veto]] power over any proposed change.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=5}} A [[super majority]] (nine of thirteen state delegations) was required for Congress to pass major legislation such as declaring war, making treaties, or borrowing money.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=41}} The Confederation had no executive or judicial branches, which meant the Confederation government lacked effective means to enforce its laws and treaties against state non-compliance.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=47}} It soon became evident to nearly all that the Confederation government, as originally organized, was inadequate for managing the various problems confronting the United States.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=5}}\n\nOnce the immediate task of winning the war had passed, states began to look to their interests rather than those of the whole country. By the mid-1780s, states were refusing to provide Congress with funding, which meant the Confederation government could not pay the interest on its foreign debt,  pay soldiers stationed along the Ohio River or defend American navigation rights on the Mississippi River against Spanish interference.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=20\u201321}} In 1782, Rhode Island vetoed an amendment that would have allowed Congress to levy taxes on imports to pay off federal debts. A second attempt was made to approve a federal impost in 1785; however, this time it was New York which disapproved.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=15}}\n\nThe Confederation Congress also lacked the power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. Britain, France, and Spain imposed various restrictions on American ships and products, while the US was unable to coordinate retaliatory trade policies. When states like Massachusetts or Pennsylvania placed reciprocal duties on British trade, neighboring states such as Connecticut and Delaware established [[free port]]s to gain an economic advantage. In the 1780s, some states even began applying customs duties against the trade of neighboring states.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=21\u201323}} In 1784, Congress proposed an amendment to give it powers over foreign trade; however, it failed to receive unanimous approval by the states.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=34}}\n\nMany upper-class Americans complained that state constitutions were too democratic and, as a result, legislators were more concerned with maintaining popular approval than doing what was best for the nation. The most pressing example was the way state legislatures responded to calls for economic relief in the 1780s. Many people were unable to pay taxes and debts due to a post-war economic depression that was exacerbated by a scarcity of gold and silver [[Coin|specie]]. States responded by issuing [[paper currency]], which had a tendency to [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|depreciate]] in value, and by making it easier to defer tax and debt payments. These policies favored debtors at the expense of creditors, and it was proposed that Congress be given the power to prevent such [[Populism|populist]] laws.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=74\u201388}}\n\nWhen the government of Massachusetts refused to enact similar relief legislation, rural farmers resorted to violence in [[Shays' Rebellion]] (1786\u20131787). This rebellion was led by a former Revolutionary War captain, [[Daniel Shays]], a small farmer with tax debts, who had never received payment for his service in the [[Continental Army]].  The rebellion took months for Massachusetts to put down completely, and some desired a federal army that would be able to put down such insurrections.{{Sfn|Richards|2003|pp=132\u2013139}}\n\nThese and other issues greatly worried many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] that the Union as it existed up to that point was in danger of breaking apart.{{Sfn|Palumbo|2009|pp=9\u201310}}{{Sfn|Kaminski|Leffler|1991|p=3}} In September 1786, delegates from five states met at the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] and invited all states to a larger convention to be held in Philadelphia in 1787. The Confederation Congress later endorsed this convention \"for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation\".{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=6}} Rhode Island was the only state that refused to send delegates, though it would become the last state to ratify the Constitution in May 1790.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|title=Observing Constitution Day|date=August 21, 2016|website=archives.gov|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817165833/https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|archive-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Operations and procedures ==\n[[File:Independence_Hall_10.jpg|thumb|Independence Hall's Assembly Room]]\nOriginally planned to begin on May 14, the Convention had to be postponed when very few of the selected delegates were present on that day due to the difficulty of travel in the late 18th century. On May 14, only delegates from Virginia and Pennsylvania were present.{{Sfn|Moehn|2003|p=37}} It was not until May 25 that a [[quorum]] of seven states was secured and the Convention could begin inside the [[Independence Hall (United States)|Pennsylvania State House]].{{Sfn|Moehn|2003|p=37}} New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until July 23, more than halfway through the proceedings.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=103}}\n\nThe first thing the Convention did was choose a presiding officer, unanimously electing [[George Washington]] president of the Convention.{{Sfn|Padover|Landynski|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}} The Convention then adopted rules to govern its proceedings. The rules gave each state delegation a single vote either for or against a proposal following the majority opinion of the state's delegates.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=83}} This rule increased the power of the smaller states.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=51}}\n\nWhen a state's delegates divided evenly on a motion, the state did not cast a vote. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30\u201340 being present on a typical day, and each state had its quorum requirements. Maryland and Connecticut allowed a single delegate to cast its vote. New York required all three of its delegates to be present. If too few of a state's delegates were in attendance, the state did not cast a vote. After two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid-July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although [[Alexander Hamilton]] would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=83}}{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=51}}\n\nThe rules allowed delegates to demand reconsideration of any decision previously voted on. This allowed the delegates to take [[straw vote]]s to measure the strength of controversial proposals and to change their minds as they worked for consensus.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=82}} It was also agreed that the discussions and votes would be kept secret until the conclusion of the meeting.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=11}} Despite the sweltering summer heat, the windows of the meeting hall were nailed shut to keep the proceedings a secret from the public.<ref name=\"Pursuing American Ideals2\">{{cite book|title=History Alive!

Madison also believed the method of representation in Congress had to change. Since under Madison's plan, Congress would exercise authority over citizens directly\u2014not simply through the states\u2014representation ought to be apportioned by population, with larger states having more votes in Congress.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=130}}\n\nMadison was also concerned with preventing a [[tyranny of the majority]]. The government needed to be neutral between the various [[Political faction|factions]] or interest groups that divided society\u2014creditors and debtors, rich and poor, or farmers, merchants and manufacturers. Madison believed that a single faction could more easily control the government within a state but would have a more difficult time dominating a national government comprising many different interest groups. The government could be designed in such a way to further insulate officeholders from the pressures of a majority faction. To protect both national authority and minority rights, Madison believed Congress should be granted veto power over state laws.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=131\u2013132}}\n\n== Early debates ==\n[[File:Virginia Plan.png|thumb|Virginia Plan]]\n[[File: Pinckney Plan.png|thumb|Charles Pinckney Plan]]\nWhile waiting for the Convention to formally begin, Madison sketched out his initial proposal, which became known as the [[Virginia Plan]] and reflected his views as a strong [[American nationalism|nationalist]]. The Virginia and Pennsylvania delegates agreed with Madison's plan and formed what came to be the predominant coalition within the Convention.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=52}} The plan was modeled on the state governments and was written in the form of fifteen resolutions outlining basic principles. It lacked the system of [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] that would become central to the US Constitution.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=53}} It called for a supreme national government and was a radical departure from the Articles of Confederation.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=91}} On May 29, [[Edmund Randolph]], the governor of Virginia, presented the Virginia Plan to the Convention.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=86}}\n\nThe same day, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of South Carolina introduced his own plan that also greatly increased the power of the national government; however, the supporters of the Virginia Plan ensured that it, rather than Pinckney's plan, received the most consideration.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=99}} Many of Pinckney's ideas did appear in the final draft of the Constitution. His plan called for a bicameral legislature made up of a House of Delegates and a Senate. The popularly elected House would elect Senators who would serve for four-year terms and represent one of four regions. The national legislature would have veto power over state laws. The legislature would elect a chief executive called a president. The president and his cabinet would have veto power over legislation. The plan also included a national judiciary.{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}}\n\nOn May 30, the Convention agreed, at the request of [[Gouverneur Morris]], \"that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme Legislative, Executive and Judiciary\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=102}} This was the Convention's first move towards going beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation and instead produce an entirely new government.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=102\u2013104}} Once it had agreed to the idea of a supreme national government, the Convention began debating specific parts of the Virginia Plan.\n\n=== Congress ===\n[[File:EdmundRandolph.jpeg|thumb|Edmund Randolph, the Governor of Virginia, introduced the Virginia Plan]]\nThe Virginia Plan called for the unicameral Confederation Congress to be replaced with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] Congress. This would be a truly national legislature with power to make laws \"in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent\".{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=139}} It would also be able to veto state laws. Representation in both houses of Congress would be [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] according either to \"quotas of contribution\" (a state's wealth as reflected in the taxes it paid) or the size of each state's non-slave population. The [[lower house]] of Congress would be directly elected by the people, while the [[upper house]] would be elected by the lower house from candidates nominated by state legislatures.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=139-140}}\n\n==== Proportional representation ====\nImmediately after agreeing to form a supreme national government, the delegates turned to the Virginia Plan's proposal for proportional representation in Congress.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=105}} Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, which were the largest states by population, were unhappy with the one vote per state rule in the Confederation Congress since combined they had almost half the nation's population but could be outvoted by the smaller states.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=56, 66}} Nevertheless, the delegates were divided over the best way to apportion representatives. Quotas of contribution appealed to southern delegates because they would include [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] property, but [[Rufus King]] of Massachusetts highlighted the impractical side of such a scheme. If the national government did not impose [[direct tax]]es (which for the next century it rarely did), he noted, representatives could not be assigned. Calculating such quotas would also be difficult due to the lack of reliable data. Basing representation on the number of \"free inhabitants\" was unpopular with delegates from the South, where forty percent of the population was enslaved.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=56-58, 77|p=}} In addition, the small states were opposed to any change that decreased their own influence. Delaware's delegation threatened to leave the Convention if proportional representation replaced equal representation, so the debate on apportionment was postponed.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=109}}\n\nOn June 9, [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] of New Jersey reminded the delegates that they were sent to Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation, not to establish a national government. While he agreed that the Confederation Congress needed new powers, including the power to coerce the states, he was adamant that a confederation required equal representation for states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=149}} James Madison records his words as follows:{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|p=178}}\n\n{{quote|[The Articles of the Confederation] were, therefore, the proper basis of all the proceedings of the Convention. We ought to keep within its limits, or we should be charged by our constituents with usurpation . . . the Commissions under which we acted were not only the measure of our power. [T]hey denoted also the sentiments of the States on the subject of our deliberation. The idea of a national [Government] as contradistinguished from a federal one, never entered into the mind of any of them, and to the public mind, we must accommodate ourselves. We have no power to go beyond the federal scheme, and if we had the people are not ripe for any other. We must follow the people; the people will not follow us.}}\n\n==== Bicameralism and elections ====\n{{quote box\n| quote = In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations are just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The Senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2014James Madison, as recorded by Robert Yates, Tuesday, June 26, 1787{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|p=431}}\n| align = right\n| width = 25%\n}}\nOn May 31, the delegates discussed the structure of Congress and how its members would be selected. The division of the legislature into an upper and lower house was familiar and had wide support. The [[British Parliament]] had an elected [[House of Commons]] and a hereditary [[House of Lords]]. All the states had bicameral legislatures except for Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=89, 110}} The delegates quickly agreed that each house of Congress should be able to originate bills. They also agreed that the new Congress would have all the legislative powers of the Confederation Congress and veto power over state laws.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=121}}\n\nThere was some opposition to popular election of the lower house or [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. [[Elbridge Gerry]] of Massachusetts and [[Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut feared the people were too easily misled by [[demagogue]]s and that popular election could lead to mob rule and anarchy. [[Pierce Butler]] of South Carolina believed that only wealthy men of property could be trusted with political power. The majority of the Convention, however, supported popular election.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=110\u2013116}} [[George Mason]] of Virginia said the lower house was \"to be the grand depository of the democratic principle of the government.\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=117}}\n\nThere was general agreement that the upper house or [[United States Senate|Senate]] should be smaller and more selective than the lower house. Its members should be [[gentlemen]] drawn from the most intelligent and virtuous among the citizenry.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=122}} Experience had convinced the delegates that such an upper house was necessary to tame the excesses of the democratically elected lower house.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=89, 110}} The Virginia Plan's method of selecting the Senate was more controversial. Members concerned with preserving state power wanted state legislatures to select senators, while [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] of Pennsylvania proposed direct election by the people.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=119}} It was not until June 7 that the delegates unanimously decided that state legislatures would choose senators.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=64-65}}\n\n==== Three-Fifths ratio ====\nOn the question of proportional representation, the three large states still faced opposition from the eight small states. James Wilson realized that the large states needed the support of the [[Deep South]] states of Georgia and the Carolinas. For these southern delegates, the main priority was the protection of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=67}} Working with [[John Rutledge]] of South Carolina, Wilson proposed the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] on June 11. This resolution apportioned seats in the House of Representatives based on a state's free population plus three-fifths of its slave population. Nine states voted in favor, with only New Jersey and Delaware against.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=75-78}} This compromise would give the South at least a dozen additional congressmen and electoral college votes.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=79}} That same day, the large-state/slave-state alliance also succeeded in applying the three-fifths ratio to Senate seats (though this was later overturned).{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=80}}\n\n=== Executive branch ===\nAs English law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions\u2014law making embodied in the legislature and law executing embodied in the king and his courts\u2014the division of the legislature from the executive and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.{{Sfn|Padover|Landynski|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}} Even so, the form the executive should take, its powers and its selection would be sources of constant dispute through the summer of 1789.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=124}} At the time, few nations had nonhereditary executives that could serve as models. The [[Dutch Republic]] was led by a [[stadtholder]], but this office was in practice inherited by members of the [[House of Orange]]. The [[Swiss Confederacy]] had no single leader, and the [[elective monarchies]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were viewed as corrupt.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=154}}\n\nAs a result of their colonial experience, Americans distrusted a strong chief executive. Under the Articles of Confederation, the closest thing to an executive was the [[Committee of the States]], which was empowered to transact government business while Congress was in recess. However, this body was largely inactive. The revolutionary state constitutions made the governors subordinate to the legislatures, denying them executive veto power over legislation. Without veto power, governors were unable to block legislation that threatened minority rights.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=125\u2013126}} States chose governors in different ways. Many state constitutions empowered legislatures to select them, but several allowed direct election by the people. In Pennsylvania, the people elected an executive council and the legislature appointed one of its members to be chief executive.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=154}}\n\nThe Virginia Plan proposed a national executive chosen by Congress. It would have the power to execute national laws and be vested with the power to make war and treaties.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=140}} Whether the executive would be a single person or a group of people was not defined.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=90}} The executive together with a \"convenient number\" of federal judges would form a [[Council of Revision]] with the power to veto any act of Congress. This veto could be overridden by an unspecified number of votes in both houses of Congress.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=140}}\n\n==== Unitary executive ====\n[[File:James-wilson.png|thumb|James Wilson's ideas shaped the American presidency more than any other delegate{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=127}}]]\n\nJames Wilson feared that the Virginia Plan made the executive too dependent on Congress. He argued that there should be a single, [[Unitary executive theory|unitary executive]]. Members of a multiple executive would most likely be chosen from different regions and represent regional interests. In Wilson's view, only a single executive could represent the nation as a whole while giving \"energy, dispatch, and responsibility\" to the government.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=127}}\n\nWilson used his understanding of civic virtue as defined by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] to help design the presidency. The challenge was to design a properly constituted executive that was fit for a republic and based on civic virtue by the general citizenry. He spoke 56 times calling for a chief executive who would be energetic, independent, and accountable. He believed that the moderate level of class conflict in American society produced a level of sociability and inter-class friendships that could make the presidency the symbolic leader of the entire American people.  Wilson did not consider the possibility of bitterly polarized [[Political parties in the United States|political parties]]. He saw [[popular sovereignty]] as the cement that held America together linking the interests of the people and of the presidential administration. The president should be a man of the people who embodied the national responsibility for the public good and provided transparency and accountability by being a highly visible national leader, as opposed to numerous largely anonymous congressmen.{{Sfn|Taylor|Hardwick|2009|pp=331\u2013346.}}{{Sfn|McCarthy|1987|pp=689\u2013696}}{{Sfn|DiClerico|1987|pp=301\u2013317}}\n\nOn June 1, Wilson proposed that \"the Executive consist of a single person.\" This motion was seconded by Charles Pinckney, whose plan called for a single executive and specifically named this official a \"president\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=127}} Roger Sherman objected in favor of something similar to a [[parliamentary system]] in which the executive should be appointed by and directly accountable to the legislature. Edmund Randolph agreed with Wilson that the executive needed \"vigor\", but he disapproved of a unitary executive, which he feared was \"the [[fetus]] of monarchy\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=128}} Randolph and George Mason led the opposition against a unitary executive, but most delegates agreed with Wilson. The prospect that George Washington would be the first president may have allowed the proponents of a unitary executive to accumulate a large coalition. Wilson's motion for a single executive passed on June 4.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=128, 134}} Initially, the convention set the executive's term of office to seven years, but this would be revisited.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=136}}\n\n==== Election, removal and the veto ====\nWilson also argued that the executive should be directly elected by the people. Only through direct election could the executive be independent of both Congress and the states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=129}} This view was unpopular. A few delegates such as Roger Sherman, Elbridge Gerry, and Pierce Butler opposed the direct election of the executive because they considered the people too easily manipulated. However, most delegates did not question the intelligence of the voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late 18th century. Due to a lack of information, the average voter would be too ignorant about the candidates to make an informed decision.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=130}}\n\nA majority of delegates favored the president's election by Congress for a seven-year term; though there was concern that this would give the legislature too much power. Southern delegates supported selection by state legislatures, but this was opposed by nationalists such as Madison who feared that such a president would become a [[Power broker (politics)|power broker]] between different states interests rather than a symbol of national unity. Realizing that direct election was impossible, Wilson proposed what would become the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]]\u2014the states would be divided into districts in which voters would choose electors who would then elect the president. This would preserve the separation of powers and keep the state legislatures out of the selection process. Initially, however, this scheme received little support.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=135-136}}\n\nThe issue was one of the last major issues to be resolved and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the formation of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the House would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=136}}\n\nThe Virginia Plan made no provision for removing the executive. On June 2, [[John Dickinson]] of Delaware proposed that the president be removed from office by Congress at the request of a majority of state legislatures. Madison and Wilson opposed this state interference in the national executive branch. Sherman argued that Congress should be able to remove the president for any reason in what was essentially a [[vote of no-confidence]]. George Mason worried that would make the president a \"mere creature of the legislature\" and violate the separation of powers. Dickinson's motion was rejected, but in the aftermath of the vote there was still no consensus over how an unfit president should be removed from office.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=141-142}}\n\nOn June 4, the delegates debated the Council of Revision. Wilson and [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York disagreed with the mixing of executive and judicial branches. They wanted the president to have an absolute veto to guarantee his independence from the legislative branch. Remembering how colonial governors used their veto to \"extort money\" from the legislature, [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania opposed giving the president an absolute veto. Gerry proposed that a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress be able to overrule any veto of the Council of Revision. This was amended to replace the council with the president alone, but Madison insisted on retaining a Council of Revision and consideration of the veto power was postponed.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=138-140}}\n\nThe office of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] was also included later in the deliberations, mainly to provide the president a successor if he was unable to complete his term but also to provide presidential electors with an incentive to vote for at least one out of state candidate in addition to a \"favorite son\" from their own state or region.\n\n=== Judiciary ===\nIn the English tradition, judges were seen as being agents of the king and his court, who represented him throughout his realm. Madison believed that in the American states, this direct link between state executives and judges was a source of corruption through [[patronage]], and thought the link had to be severed between the two, thus creating the \"third branch\" of the judiciary which had been without any direct precedent before this point.{{Sfn|Padover|Landynski|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nOn June 4, delegates unanimously agreed to a national judiciary \"of one supreme tribunal and one or more inferior tribunals\". The delegates disagreed on how federal judges should be chosen. The Virginia Plan called for the national legislature to appoint judges. James Wilson wanted the president to appoint judges to increase the power of that office.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=236}}\n\nOn June 13, the revised report on the Virginia Plan was issued. This report summarized the decisions made by the delegates in the first two weeks of the Convention. It was agreed that a \"national judiciary be established, to consist of one supreme tribunal\". Congress would have the power to create and appoint inferior courts. Judges were to hold office [[Good Behavior Clause|\"during good behavior\"]], and the Senate would appoint them.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=159}}\n\n=== Alternative plans ===\n[[File: New Jersey Plan.png|thumb|New Jersey Plan]]\nThe small state delegates were alarmed at the plan taking shape: a supreme national government that could override state laws and proportional representation in both houses of Congress.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=88}} William Paterson and other delegates from New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland, and New York created an alternative plan that consisted of several amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Under the [[New Jersey Plan]], as it was called, the Confederation Congress would remain unicameral with each state having one vote. Congress would be allowed to levy tariffs and other taxes as well as regulate trade and commerce. Congress would elect a plural \"federal executive\" whose members would serve a single term and could be removed by Congress at the request of a majority of state governors. There would also be a federal judiciary to apply US law. Federal judges would serve for life and be appointed by the executives. Laws enacted by Congress would take precedence over state laws. This plan was introduced on June 15.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=161-162}}{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=90-91}}{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}}\n[[File: Hamilton Plan.png|thumb|Hamilton's Plan]]\nOn June 18, [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York presented his own plan that was at odds with both the Virginia and New Jersey plans. It called for the constitution to be modeled on the [[British Government|British government]]. The bicameral legislature included a lower house called the Assembly elected by the people for three-year terms. The people would choose electors who would elect the members of a Senate who served for life. Electors would also choose a single executive called the governor who would also serve for life. The governor would have an absolute veto over bills. There would also be a national judiciary whose members would serve for life. Hamilton called for the abolition of the states (or at least their reduction to sub-jurisdictions with limited powers). Some scholars have suggested that Hamilton presented this radical plan in order to help secure passage of the Virginia Plan by making it seem moderate by comparison. The plan was so out of step with the political reality that it was not even debated, and Hamilton would be troubled for years by accusations that he was a [[Monarchism|monarchist]].{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=94-95}}{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}}\n\nOn June 19, the delegates voted on the New Jersey Plan. With the support of the slave states and Connecticut, the large states were able to defeat the plan by a 7\u20133 margin. Maryland's delegation was divided, so it did not vote.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=96}} This did not end the debate over-representation. Rather, the delegates found themselves in a stalemate that lasted into July.\n[[File: Roger Sherman 1721-1793 by Ralph Earl.jpeg|thumb|Roger Sherman of Connecticut]]\n\nOn several occasions, the Connecticut delegation\u2014Roger Sherman, [[Oliver Ellsworth]] and [[William Samuel Johnson]]\u2014proposed a compromise that the House would have proportional representation and the Senate equal representation.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=164}} A version of this compromise had originally been crafted and proposed by Sherman on June 11. He agreed with Madison that the Senate should be composed of the wisest and most virtuous citizens, but he also saw its role as defending the rights and interests of the states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=150}} James Madison recorded Sherman's June 11 speech as follows:{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|p=196}}\n\n{{quote|Mr. Sherman proposed that the proportion of suffrage in the 1st branch should be according to the respective numbers of free inhabitants; and that in the second branch or Senate, each State should have one vote and no more. He said as the States would remain possessed of certain individual rights, each State ought to be able to protect itself: otherwise, a few large States will rule the rest. The House of Lords in England he observed had certain particular rights under the Constitution, and hence they have an equal vote with the House of Commons that they may be able to defend their rights.}}\n\nOn June 29, Johnson made a similar point: \"that in one branch, the people ought to be represented; in the other, the states.\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=181}} Neither side was ready yet to embrace the concept of [[divided sovereignty]] between the states and a federal government, however.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=173}} The distrust between large and small state delegates had reached a low point, exemplified by comments made on June 30 by [[Gunning Bedford Jr]]. As reported by Robert Yates, Bedford stated:{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|pp=500\u2013501}}\n\n{{quote|I do not, gentlemen, trust you. If you possess the power, the abuse of it could not be checked; and what then would prevent you from exercising it to our destruction? . . . Yes, sir, the larger states will be rivals but not against each other\u2014they will be rivals against the rest of the states . . . Will you crush the smaller states, or must they be left unmolested? Sooner than be ruined, there are foreign powers who will take us by the hand.}}\n\n==Compromising on apportionment==\n=== Grand Committee ===\n[[File: Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Siffrein Duplessis.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania]]\nAs the Convention was entering its second full month of deliberations, it was decided that further consideration of the prickly question of how to apportion representatives in the national legislature should be referred to a committee composed of one delegate from each of the eleven states that were present at that time at the Convention. The members of this \"Grand Committee,\" as it has come to be known, included William Paterson of New Jersey, [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]] of New York, [[Luther Martin]] of Maryland, Gunning Bedford, Jr. of Delaware, Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, [[Abraham Baldwin]] of Georgia, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, George Mason of Virginia, [[William Davie]] of North Carolina, [[John Rutledge]] of South Carolina and [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=200}} The committee's composition heavily favored the smaller states, as even the large state delegates tended to be more moderate.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=110}}\n\nWhile the Convention took a three-day recess in observance of the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] holiday, the Grand Committee began its work.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=110}} Franklin proposed and the committee adopted a compromise similar to the Connecticut plan. Membership in the House would be apportioned by population, with members elected from districts of forty thousand people. Each state would have an equal vote in the Senate. To gain large state support, however, Franklin proposed that the House of Representatives have exclusive power to originate bills concerned with raising money or government salaries (this would become the [[Origination Clause]]).{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=201}} This compromise has become known as the Great Compromise or the [[Connecticut Compromise]].{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=111}}\n\n=== Revisiting the three-fifths ratio ===\nThe committee presented its report on July 5, but the compromise was not immediately adopted by the Convention. For the next eleven days, the Convention stalled as delegates attempted to gain as many votes for their states as possible.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=115}} On July 6, a five-man committee was appointed to allocate specific numbers of representatives to each state. It called for a 56\u2013member House of Representatives and used \"[t]he number of blacks and whites with some regard to supposed wealth\" as a basis of allocating representatives to each state. The Northern states had 30 representatives while the Southern states had 26. Delegates from non-slave states objected to counting slaves as they could not vote.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=116\u2013117}}{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=208}}\n\nOn July 9, a new committee was chosen to reconsider the allocation of representatives. This time there were eleven members, one from each state. It recommended a 65\u2013member House with allocation of representatives based on the number of free inhabitants and three-fifths of slaves. Under this new scheme, Northern states had 35 representatives and the South had 30. Southern delegates protested the North's greater representation and argued that their growing populations had been underestimated. The Committee of Eleven's report was approved, but the divergent interests of the Northern and Southern states remained obstacles to reaching consensus.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=208}}\n\nOn July 10, Edmund Randolph called for a regular [[United States Census|census]] on which to base future reallocation of House seats.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=118}} During the debate on the census, South Carolina delegates Pierce Butler and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney sought to replace the three-fifths ratio with a full count of the slave population. They argued that slave property contributed to the wealth of the Southern states and as such should be used in calculating representation. This irritated Northern delegates who were already reluctant to support the three-fifths compromise. James Wilson, one of the authors of the three-fifths compromise, asked, \"Are slaves to be admitted as Citizens? Then why are they not admitted on an equality with White Citizens? Are they admitted as property? Then why is not other property admitted into the computation?\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=209\u2013210}}\n\nAfter fierce debate, the delegates voted to apportion representation and [[direct tax]]ation based on all white inhabitants and three-fifths of the slave population. This formula would apply to the existing states as well as any states created in the future. The first census would occur six years after the new federal government began operations and every ten years afterward .{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Great Compromise ===\n{{Main|Connecticut Compromise}}\nOn July 14, John Rutledge and James Wilson attempted to secure proportional representation in the Senate. Charles Pinckney proposed a form of semi-proportional representation in which the smaller states would gain more representation than under a completely proportional system. This proposal was defeated.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nIn a close vote on July 16, the Convention adopted the Great Compromise as recommended by the Grand Committee. Nationalist delegates remained bitterly opposed, however, until on July 23 they succeeded in further modifying the compromise to give members of the Senate individual voting power, rather than having votes taken by each state's representatives [[wikt:en bloc|en bloc]], as had occurred in Congress under the Articles of Confederation.<ref name=\"RECORDS 1787 94 952\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9OFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA94|title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, Volume 2|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1911|editor-last=Farrand|editor-first=Max|location=New Haven|pages=94\u201395}}</ref> This accomplished the nationalist goal of preventing state governments from having a direct say in Congress's choice to make national laws.<ref name=\"Claus2\">See Laurence Claus, Power Enumeration and the Silences of Constitutional Federalism http://ssrn.com/abstract=2837390</ref> The final document was thus a mixture of Madison's original \"national\" constitution and the desired \"federal\" Constitution that many of the delegates sought.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=199}}\n\n==Further debate==\n===Federal supremacy===\nOn July 17, the delegates worked to define the powers of Congress. The Virginia Plan asserted the supremacy of the national government, giving Congress authority \"to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent\" and stating that congressional legislation would take precedence over conflicting state laws. In a motion introduced by Gunning Bedford, the Convention approved this provision with only South Carolina and Georgia voting against. Four small states\u2014Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland\u2014accepted the expansion of congressional power. Later in life, Madison explained that this was a result of the Great Compromise. Once the small states were assured they would be represented in the new government, they \"exceeded all others in zeal\" for a strong national government.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\nThe Virginia Plan also gave Congress veto power over state laws. Madison believed this provision was crucial to prevent the states from engaging in irresponsible behavior, such as had occurred under the Confederation government. Gouverneur Morris feared the congressional veto would alienate states that might otherwise support the Constitution. Luther Martin argued that it would be too impractical and time-consuming, asking \"Shall the laws of the states be sent up to the general legislature before they shall be permitted to operate?\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=228}}\n\nThe Convention rejected the congressional veto. In its place, Martin proposed language taken from the New Jersey Plan that was unanimously approved by the Convention: \"that the Legislative acts of the US made by virtue and pursuance of the articles of Union, and all treaties made and ratified under the authority of the US shall be the supreme law of the respective States . . . and that the . . . States shall be bound thereby in their decisions\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=229}}\n\n===Appointing judges===\nNeeding a break from discussing the presidency, the delegates once again considered the judicial branch on July 18. They were still divided over the method of appointment. Half of the Convention wanted the Senate to choose judges, while the other half wanted the president to do it. Luther Martin supported Senate appointment because he thought that body's members would defend the interests of the individual states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=237}}\n\nNathaniel Gorham had suggested a compromise\u2014appointment by the president with the \"[[advice and consent]] of the Senate\". While the meaning of \"advice and consent\" was still undefined, the proposal gained some support. On July 21, Madison offered an alternative compromise\u2014the president would appoint judges but the Senate could veto an appointment by a two-thirds majority. This proposal would have made it very hard for the Senate to block judicial appointments. Madison's proposal failed to garner support, and the delegates ended by reaffirming that the Senate would appoint judges.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=238}}\n\nOn July 21, Wilson and Madison tried unsuccessfully to revive Madison's council of revision. While judges had a role in reviewing the constitutionality of laws, argued Gorham, mixing the policy judgments of the president with the legal judgments of a court would violate the separation of powers. John Rutledge agreed, saying \"judges ought never to give their opinion on a law till it comes before them\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n==First draft==\nThe Convention adjourned from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of the [[Committee of Detail]], which was to produce a first draft of the Constitution. It was chaired by [[John Rutledge]], with the other members including [[Edmund Randolph]], [[Oliver Ellsworth]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], and [[Nathaniel Gorham]].\n\nThough the committee did not record minutes of its proceedings, three key surviving documents offer clues to the committee's handiwork: an outline by Randolph with edits by Rutledge, extensive notes and a second draft by Wilson, also with Rutledge's edits, and the committee's final report to the Convention.<ref name=\"Stewart\">{{cite book|last= Stewart|first= David O.|title= The Summer of 1787|year= 2007|publisher= Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-7432-8692-3}}</ref>{{rp|168}} From this evidence it is thought that the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other sources, such as the [[Articles of Confederation]], provisions of the state constitutions, and even [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney's]] plan, to produce the first full draft,{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=269\u201370}}<ref name=\" Stewart\" />{{rp|165}} which author [[David O. Stewart]] has called a \"remarkable copy-and-paste job.\"<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|165}}\n\nRandolph adopted two rules in preparing his initial outline: that the Constitution should only include essential principles, avoiding minor provisions that would change over time, and that it should be stated in simple and precise language.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=270}}\n\nMuch of what was included in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's proposal would ultimately be incorporated into the final version of the Constitution without debate.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|169}} Examples of these details included the [[Speech and Debate Clause]], which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nHowever, Rutledge, himself a former state governor, was determined that while the new national government should be stronger than the Confederation government had been, the national government's power over the states should not be limitless; and at Rutledge's urging, the committee went beyond what the Convention had proposed. As Stewart describes it, the committee \"hijacked\" and remade the Constitution, altering critical agreements the Convention delegates had already made, enhancing the powers of the states at the expense of the national government, and adding several far-reaching provisions that the Convention had never discussed.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|165}}\n\n[[File: John Rutledge.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Rutledge]], a judge and former governor of South Carolina, chaired the committee that wrote the first draft of the Constitution. He argued for a federal government of limited power.]]\n\nThe first major change, insisted on by Rutledge, was meant to sharply curtail the essentially unlimited powers to legislate \"in all cases for the general interests of the Union\" that the Convention only two weeks earlier had agreed to grant the Congress. Rutledge and Randolph worried that the broad powers implied in the language agreed on by the Convention would have given the national government too much power at the expense of the states. In Randolph's outline the committee replaced that language with a list of 18 specific \"enumerated\" powers, many adopted from the Articles of Confederation, that would strictly limit the Congress' authority to measures such as imposing taxes, making treaties, going to war, and establishing post offices.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=273\u201374}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|170\u201371}} Rutledge, however, was not able to completely convince all of the members of the committee to accept the change. Over the course of a series of drafts, a catchall provision (the \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause]]\") was eventually added, most likely by Wilson, a nationalist little concerned with the sovereignty of individual states, giving the Congress the broad power \"to make all Laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=274}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|171\u201372}} Another revision of Wilson's draft also placed eight specific limits on the states, such as barring them from independently entering into treaties and from printing their own money, providing a certain degree of balance to the limits on the national government intended by Rutledge's list of enumerated powers.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=274\u201375}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|172}} In addition, Wilson's draft modified the language of the [[Supremacy Clause]] adopted by the Convention, to ensure that national law would take precedence over inconsistent state laws.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|172}}\n\nThese changes set the final balance between the national and state governments that would be entered into the final document, as the Convention never challenged this dual-sovereignty between nation and state that had been fashioned by Rutledge and Wilson.<ref name=\" Stewart\" />{{rp|172}}\n\nAnother set of radical changes introduced by the Committee of Detail proved far more contentious when the committee's report was presented to the Convention. On the day the Convention had agreed to appoint the committee, Southerner Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina, had warned of dire consequences should the committee fail to include protections for slavery in the Southern states, or allow for taxing of Southern agricultural exports.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=269, 275}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|173}} Pinckney and his fellow Southern delegates must have been delighted to see that the committee had included three provisions that explicitly restricted the Congress' authority in ways favorable to Southern interests. The proposed language would bar Congress from ever interfering with the slave trade. It would also prohibit taxation of exports, and would require that any legislation concerning regulation of foreign commerce through tariffs or quotas (that is, any laws akin to England's \"[[Navigation Acts]]\") pass only with two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress. While much of the rest of the committee's report would be accepted without serious challenge on the Convention floor, these last three proposals would provoke outrage from Northern delegates and slavery opponents.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=275}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|173\u201374}}\n\nThe final report of the committee, which became the first draft of the Constitution, was the first workable constitutional plan, as Madison's Virginia Plan had simply been an outline of goals and a broad structure. Even after it issued this report, the committee continued to meet off and on until early September.\n\n==Further modifications and concluding debate==\nAnother month of discussion and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several attempts were made to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|187}} Madison, in particular, wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.\n\nOne important change that did make it into the final version included the agreement between northern and southern delegates to empower Congress to end the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] starting in 1808. Southern and northern delegates also agreed to strengthen the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]] in exchange for removing a requirement that two-thirds of Congress agree on \"navigation acts\" (regulations of commerce between states and foreign governments). The two-thirds requirement was favored by southern delegates, who thought Congress might pass navigation acts that would be economically harmful to slaveholders.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|196}}\n\nOnce the Convention had finished amending the first draft from the Committee of Detail, a new set of unresolved questions were sent to several different committees for resolution. The Committee of Detail was considering several questions related to ''[[habeas corpus]]'', [[freedom of the press]], and an executive council to advise the president. Two committees addressed questions related to the slave trade and the assumption of war debts.\n\nA new committee was created, the Committee on Postponed Parts, to address other questions that had been postponed. Its members, such as Madison, were delegates who had shown a greater desire for compromise and were chosen for this reason as most in the Convention wanted to finish their work and go home.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|207}} The committee dealt with questions related to the taxes, war-making, patents and copyrights, relations with indigenous tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the House. The biggest issue they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|209}} They adopted Wilson's earlier plan for choosing the president by an electoral college, and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be \"nineteen times out of twenty\".\n\nThe committee also shortened the president's term from seven years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment trials]] from the courts to the Senate. They also created the office of the vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example, the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|212}} One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be [[term limit]]ed. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.\n\nNear the end of the Convention, Gerry, Randolph, and Mason emerged as the main force of opposition. Their fears were increased as the Convention moved from Madison's vague Virginia Plan to the concrete plan of Rutledge's Committee of Detail.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|235}} Some have argued that Randolph's attacks on the Constitution were motivated by political ambition, in particular his anticipation of possibly facing rival [[Patrick Henry]] in a future election. The main objection of the three was the compromise that would allow Congress to pass \"navigation acts\" with a simple majority in exchange for strengthened slave provisions.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|236}} Among their other objections was an opposition to the office of vice president.\n\nThough most of their complaints did not result in changes, a couple did. Mason succeeded in adding \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" to the impeachment clause. Gerry also convinced the Convention to include a second method for ratification of amendments. The report out of the Committee of Detail had included only one mechanism for constitutional amendment, in which two-thirds of the states had to ask Congress to convene a convention for consideration of amendments. Upon Gerry's urging, the Convention added back the Virginia Plan's original method whereby Congress would propose amendments that the states would then ratify.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|238}} All amendments to the Constitution, save the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st amendment]], have been made through this latter method.\n\nDespite their successes, these three dissenters grew increasingly unpopular as most other delegates wanted to bring the Convention's business to an end and return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a [[bill of rights]], which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|241}}\n\nFew at the time realized how important the issue would become, with the absence of a bill of rights becoming the main argument of the [[anti-Federalist]]s against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so there was no need to include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|243}}\n\n==Drafting and signing==\n{{further|Signing of the United States Constitution}}[[File: Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|''[[Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States]]'', by [[Howard Chandler Christy]] (1940)]]\n\nOnce the final modifications had been made, the Committee of Style and Arrangement was appointed \"to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house.\" Unlike other committees, whose members were named so the committees included members from different regions, this final committee included no champions of the small states. Its members were mostly in favor of a strong national government and unsympathetic to calls for states' rights.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|229\u201330}} They were [[William Samuel Johnson]] (Connecticut), [[Alexander Hamilton]] (New York), [[Gouverneur Morris]] (Pennsylvania), [[James Madison]] (Virginia), and [[Rufus King]] (Massachusetts). On Wednesday, September 12, the report of the \"committee of style\" was ordered printed for the convenience of the delegates. For three days, the Convention compared this final version with the proceedings of the Convention. The Constitution was then ordered engrossed on Saturday, September 15 by Jacob Shallus, and was submitted for signing on September 17. It made at least one important change to what the Convention had agreed to; King wanted to prevent states from interfering in contracts. Although the Convention never took up the matter, his language was now inserted, creating the [[contract clause]].<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|243}}\n\nGouverneur Morris is credited, both now and then, as the chief draftsman of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: [[Edmund Randolph]] of [[Virginia]], [[George Mason]] of [[Virginia]], and [[Elbridge Gerry]] of [[Massachusetts]]. [[George Mason]] demanded a [[Bill of rights|Bill of Rights]] if he was to support the Constitution. The Bill of Rights was not included in the Constitution submitted to the states for ratification, but many states ratified the Constitution with the understanding that a bill of rights would soon follow.<ref name=\"bor\">{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html|author=National Archives|title=Bill of Rights|accessdate=March 7, 2016|date=October 30, 2015}}</ref> Shortly before the document was to be signed, Gorham proposed to lower the size of congressional districts from 40,000 to 30,000 citizens. A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. [[George Washington]] spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate. Gorham would sign the document, although he had openly doubted whether the United States would remain a single, unified nation for more than 150 years.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|112}} Ultimately, 39 of the 55 delegates who attended (74 had been chosen from 12 states) ended up signing, but it is likely that none were completely satisfied.

Once Delaware's largest slaveholder, he had freed all of his slaves by 1787.]]\n\nWhether slavery was to be regulated under the new Constitution was a matter of such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states{{which|date=September 2019}} refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery be completely outlawed within the new nation. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=318\u201329}}\n\n===Three-Fifths Compromise===\n{{Main|Three-Fifths Compromise}}\n\nAnother contentious slavery-related question was whether slaves would be counted as part of the population in determining representation of the states in the Congress, or would instead be considered property and as such not be considered for purposes of representation.<ref name=\"CRF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crf-usa.org/lessons/slavery_const.htm |author=Constitutional Rights Foundation |title=The Constitution and Slavery |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040225183537/http://www.crf-usa.org/lessons/slavery_const.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 15, 2016 }}</ref> Delegates from states with a large population of slaves argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation, but as property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on the basis of population.<ref name=\"CRF\"/> Delegates from states where slavery had become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation, but not in determining representation.<ref name=\"CRF\"/>  Finally, delegate [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] proposed the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}} This was eventually adopted by the Convention.\n\n{{Anchor|Framers}}\n\n==Framers of the Constitution==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.

Although the Convention was intended to revise the league of states and first system of government under the [[Articles of Confederation]], the intention from the outset of many of its proponents, chief among them [[James Madison]] of Virginia and [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York, was to create a new government rather than fix the existing one.  The delegates elected [[George Washington]] of Virginia, former commanding general of the [[Continental Army]] in the late [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775\u20131783) and proponent of a stronger national government, to become President of the Convention. The result of the Convention was the creation of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]], placing the Convention among the most significant events in American history.\n\nAt the time, the convention was not referred to as a \"Constitutional\" convention, nor did most of the delegates arrive intending to draft a new constitution.  Many assumed that the purpose of the convention was to discuss and draft improvements to the existing Articles of Confederation, and would have not agreed to participate otherwise. Once the Convention began, however, most of the delegates \u2013 though not all \u2013 came to agree in general terms that the goal would be a new system of government, not simply a revised version of the Articles of Confederation.\n\nSeveral broad outlines were proposed and debated, most notably James Madison's [[Virginia Plan]] and [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]]'s [[New Jersey Plan]]. The Virginia Plan was selected as the basis for the new government. While the concept of a federal government with three branches (legislative, executive, and judicial) and the general role of each branch was not heavily disputed, several issues delayed further progress and put the success of the Convention in doubt. The most contentious disputes revolved around the composition and election of the [[United States Senate|Senate]] as the upper legislative house of a [[bicameral]] [[United States Congress|Congress]]; whether \"proportional representation\" was to be defined by a state's geography or by its population, and whether slaves were to be counted; whether to divide the [[Executive (government)|executive power]] among three people or vest the power in a single chief executive to be called the President; how a president would be elected, for what term, and whether to limit each president to a single term in office; what offenses should be impeachable; the nature of a fugitive slave clause, and whether to allow the abolition of the slave trade; and whether judges should be chosen by the legislature or the executive. Most of the time during the Convention was spent on deciding these issues.\n\nProgress was slow until mid-July, when the [[Connecticut Compromise]] resolved enough lingering arguments for a draft written by the [[Committee of Detail]] to gain acceptance. Though more modifications and compromises were made over the following weeks, most of the rough draft remained in place and can be found in the finished version of the Constitution. After several more issues were resolved, the Committee on Style produced the final version in early September. It was voted on by the delegates, inscribed on parchment with engraving for printing, and signed by thirty-nine of fifty-five delegates on September 17, 1787. The completed proposed Constitution was then released to the public to begin the debate and [[History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution|ratification process]].\n\n==Historical context==\n{{Further|History of the United States (1776\u20131789)}}\n[[File:United States 1789-03 to 1789-08 eastern.jpg|thumb]]\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the [[Thirteen states|thirteen American states]] replaced their [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies|colonial governments]] with [[republic]]an constitutions based on the principle of [[separation of powers]], organizing government into [[legislative]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches. At the same time, these revolutionary constitutions endorsed [[legislative supremacy]] by placing most power in the legislature\u2014since it was viewed as most representative of the people\u2014including power traditionally considered as belonging to the executive and judicial branches. State [[Governor (United States)|governors]] lacked significant authority, and state courts and judges were under the control of the legislative branch.{{Sfn|Wood|1998|pp=155\u2013156}}\n\nAfter [[United States Declaration of Independence|declaring independence]] from Britain in 1776, the thirteen states created a permanent alliance to coordinate American efforts to win the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. This alliance, the [[United States]], was to be governed according to the [[Articles of Confederation]], which was more of a treaty between independent countries than a national constitution.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=13\u201314}} The Articles were adopted by the [[Second Continental Congress]] in 1777 but not finally ratified by all states until 1781.{{Sfn|Van Cleve|2017|p=1}} During the [[Confederation Period]], the United States was essentially a federation of independent republics, with the Articles guaranteeing state sovereignty and independence. The Confederation was governed by the [[Congress of the Confederation]], a [[unicameral]] legislature whose members were chosen by the state legislatures and in which each state cast a single vote.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=4}} Congress was given a limited set of powers, mainly in the area of waging war and foreign affairs. It could not levy taxes or tariffs, and it could only request money from the states, with no power to force delinquent states to pay.{{Sfn|Van Cleve|2017|pp=4\u20135}} Since the Articles could only be amended by unanimous vote of the states, any state had effective [[veto]] power over any proposed change.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=5}} A [[super majority]] (nine of thirteen state delegations) was required for Congress to pass major legislation such as declaring war, making treaties, or borrowing money.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=41}} The Confederation had no executive or judicial branches, which meant the Confederation government lacked effective means to enforce its own laws and treaties against state non-compliance.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=47}} It soon became evident to nearly all that the Confederation government, as originally organized, was inadequate for managing the various problems confronting the United States.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=5}}\n\nOnce the immediate task of winning the war had passed, states began to look to their own interests rather than those of the whole country. By the mid-1780s, states were refusing to provide Congress with funding, which meant the Confederation government could not pay the interest on its foreign debt,  pay soldiers stationed along the Ohio River or defend American navigation rights on the Mississippi River against Spanish interference.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=20\u201321}} In 1782, Rhode Island vetoed an amendment that would have allowed Congress to levy taxes on imports in order to pay off federal debts. A second attempt was made to approve a federal impost in 1785; however, this time it was New York which disapproved.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=15}}\n\nThe Confederation Congress also  lacked the power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce. Britain, France and Spain imposed various restrictions on American ships and products, while the US was unable to coordinate retaliatory trade policies. When states like Massachusetts or Pennsylvania placed reciprocal duties on British trade, neighboring states such as Connecticut and Delaware established [[free port]]s to gain an economic advantage. In the 1780s, some states even began applying customs duties against the trade of neighboring states.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=21\u201323}} In 1784, Congress proposed an amendment to give it powers over foreign trade; however, it failed to receive unanimous approval by the states.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=34}}\n\nMany upper class Americans complained that state constitutions were too democratic and, as a result, legislators were more concerned with maintaining popular approval than doing what was best for the nation. The most pressing example was the way state legislatures responded to calls for economic relief in the 1780s. Many people were unable to pay taxes and debts due to a post-war economic depression that was exacerbated by a scarcity of gold and silver [[Coin|specie]]. States responded by issuing [[paper currency]], which had a tendency to [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|depreciate]] in value, and by making it easier to defer tax and debt payments. These policies favored debtors at the expense of creditors, and it was proposed that Congress be given power to prevent such [[Populism|populist]] laws.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|pp=74\u201388}}\n\nWhen the government of Massachusetts refused to enact similar relief legislation, rural farmers resorted to violence in [[Shays' Rebellion]] (1786\u20131787). This rebellion was led by a former Revolutionary War captain, [[Daniel Shays]], a small farmer with tax debts, who had never received payment for his service in the [[Continental Army]].  The rebellion took months for Massachusetts to put down completely, and some desired a federal army that would be able to put down such insurrections.{{Sfn|Richards|2003|pp=132\u2013139}}\n\nThese and other issues greatly worried many of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founders]] that the Union as it existed up to that point was in danger of breaking apart.{{Sfn|Palumbo|2009|pp=9\u201310}}{{Sfn|Kaminski|Leffler|1991|p=3}} In September 1786, delegates from five states met at the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] and invited all states to a larger convention to be held in Philadelphia in 1787. The Confederation Congress later endorsed this convention \"for the sole and express purpose of revising the Articles of Confederation\".{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=6}} Rhode Island was the only state that refused to send delegates, though it would become the last state to ratify the Constitution in May 1790.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|title=Observing Constitution Day|date=August 21, 2016|website=archives.gov|publisher=U.S. National Archives and Records Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817165833/https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|archive-date=August 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Operations and procedures ==\n[[File:Independence_Hall_10.jpg|thumb|Independence Hall's Assembly Room]]\nOriginally planned to begin on May 14, the Convention had to be postponed when very few of the selected delegates were present on that day due to the difficulty of travel in the late 18th century. On May 14, only delegates from Virginia and Pennsylvania were present.{{Sfn|Moehn|2003|p=37}} It was not until May 25 that a [[quorum]] of seven states was secured and the Convention could begin inside the [[Independence Hall (United States)|Pennsylvania State House]].{{Sfn|Moehn|2003|p=37}} New Hampshire delegates would not join the Convention until July 23, more than halfway through the proceedings.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=103}}\n\nThe first thing the Convention did was choose a presiding officer, unanimously electing [[George Washington]] president of the Convention.{{Sfn|Padover|Landynski|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}} The Convention then adopted rules to govern its proceedings. The rules gave each state delegation a single vote either for or against a proposal in accordance with the majority opinion of the state's delegates.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=83}} This rule increased the power of the smaller states.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=51}}\n\nWhen a state's delegates divided evenly on a motion, the state did not cast a vote. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30\u201340 being present on a typical day, and each state had its own quorum requirements. Maryland and Connecticut allowed a single delegate to cast its vote. New York required all three of its delegates to be present. If too few of a state's delegates were in attendance, the state did not cast a vote. After two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although [[Alexander Hamilton]] would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during the debates.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=83}}{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=51}}\n\nThe rules allowed delegates to demand reconsideration of any decision previously voted on. This allowed the delegates to take [[straw vote]]s in order to measure the strength of controversial proposals and to change their minds as they worked for consensus.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=82}} It was also agreed that the discussions and votes would be kept secret until the conclusion of the meeting.{{Sfn|Larson|Winship|2005|p=11}} Despite the sweltering summer heat, the windows of the meeting hall were nailed shut to keep the proceedings a secret from the public.<ref name=\"Pursuing American Ideals2\">{{cite book|title=History Alive!

Madison also believed the method of representation in Congress had to change. Since under Madison's plan, Congress would exercise authority over citizens directly\u2014not simply through the states\u2014representation ought to be apportioned by population, with larger states having more votes in Congress.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=130}}\n\nMadison was also concerned with preventing a [[tyranny of the majority]]. The government needed to be neutral between the various [[Political faction|factions]] or interest groups that divided society\u2014creditors and debtors, rich and poor, or farmers, merchants and manufacturers. Madison believed that a single faction could more easily control the government within a state but would have a more difficult time dominating a national government comprising many different interest groups. The government could be designed in such a way to further insulate officeholders from the pressures of a majority faction. To protect both national authority and minority rights, Madison believed Congress should be granted veto power over state laws.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=131\u2013132}}\n\n== Early debates ==\n[[File:Virginia Plan.png|thumb|Virginia Plan]]\n[[File:Pinckney Plan.png|thumb|Charles Pinckney Plan]]\nWhile waiting for the Convention to formally begin, Madison sketched out his initial proposal, which became known as the [[Virginia Plan]] and reflected his views as a strong [[American nationalism|nationalist]]. The Virginia and Pennsylvania delegates agreed with Madison's plan and formed what came to be the predominant coalition within the Convention.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=52}} The plan was modeled on the state governments and was written in the form of fifteen resolutions outlining basic principles. It lacked the system of [[Checks and Balances|checks and balances]] that would become central to the US Constitution.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=53}} It called for a supreme national government and was a radical departure from the Articles of Confederation.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=91}} On May 29, [[Edmund Randolph]], the governor of Virginia, presented the Virginia Plan to the Convention.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=86}}\n\nThe same day, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of South Carolina introduced his own plan that also greatly increased the power of the national government; however, the supporters of the Virginia Plan ensured that it, rather than Pinckney's plan, received the most consideration.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=99}} Many of Pinckney's ideas did appear in the final draft of the Constitution. His plan called for a bicameral legislature made up of a House of Delegates and a Senate. The popularly elected House would elect senators who would serve for four year terms and represent one of four regions. The national legislature would have veto power over state laws. The legislature would elect a chief executive called a president. The president and his cabinet would have veto power over legislation. The plan also included a national judiciary.{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}}\n\nOn May 30, the Convention agreed, at the request of [[Gouverneur Morris]], \"that a national government ought to be established consisting of a supreme Legislative, Executive and Judiciary\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=102}} This was the Convention's first move towards going beyond its mandate merely to amend the Articles of Confederation and instead produce an entirely new government.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=102\u2013104}} Once it had agreed to the idea of a supreme national government, the Convention began debating specific parts of the Virginia Plan.\n\n=== Congress ===\n[[File:EdmundRandolph.jpeg|thumb|Edmund Randolph, the Governor of Virginia, introduced the Virginia Plan]]\nThe Virginia Plan called for the unicameral Confederation Congress to be replaced with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] Congress. This would be a truly national legislature with power to make laws \"in all cases to which the separate states are incompetent\".{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=139}} It would also be able to veto state laws. Representation in both houses of Congress would be [[United States congressional apportionment|apportioned]] according either to \"quotas of contribution\" (a state's wealth as reflected in the taxes it paid) or the size of each state's non-slave population. The [[lower house]] of Congress would be directly elected by the people, while the [[upper house]] would be elected by the lower house from candidates nominated by state legislatures.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=139-140}}\n\n==== Proportional representation ====\nImmediately after agreeing to form a supreme national government, the delegates turned to the Virginia Plan's proposal for proportional representation in Congress.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=105}} Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, which were the largest states by population, were unhappy with the one vote per state rule in the Confederation Congress since combined they had almost half the nation's population but could be outvoted by the smaller states.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=56, 66}} Nevertheless, the delegates were divided over the best way to apportion representatives. Quotas of contribution appealed to southern delegates because they would include [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] property, but [[Rufus King]] of Massachusetts highlighted the impractical side of such a scheme. If the national government did not impose [[direct tax]]es (which for the next century it almost never did), he noted, representatives could not be assigned. Calculating such quotas would also be difficult due to lack of reliable data. Basing representation on the number of \"free inhabitants\" was unpopular with delegates from the South, where forty percent of the population was enslaved.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=56-58, 77|p=}} In addition, the small states were opposed to any change that decreased their own influence. Delaware's delegation threatened to leave the Convention if proportional representation replaced equal representation, so debate on apportionment was postponed.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=109}}\n\nOn June 9, [[William Paterson (judge)|William Paterson]] of New Jersey reminded the delegates that they were sent to Philadelphia to revise the Articles of Confederation, not to establish a national government. While he agreed that the Confederation Congress needed new powers, including the power to coerce the states, he was adamant that a confederation required equal representation for states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=149}} James Madison records his words as follows:{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|p=178}}\n\n{{quote|[The Articles of the Confederation] were therefore the proper basis of all the proceedings of the Convention. We ought to keep within its limits, or we should be charged by our constituents with usurpation . . . the Commissions under which we acted were not only the measure of our power. [T]hey denoted also the sentiments of the States on the subject of our deliberation. The idea of a national [Government] as contradistinguished from a federal one, never entered into the mind of any of them, and to the public mind we must accommodate ourselves. We have no power to go beyond the federal scheme, and if we had the people are not ripe for any other. We must follow the people; the people will not follow us.}}\n\n==== Bicameralism and elections ====\n{{quote box\n| quote = In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority. The Senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability.\n| salign = right\n| source = \u2014James Madison, as recorded by Robert Yates, Tuesday June 26, 1787{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|p=431}}\n| align = right\n| width = 25%\n}}\nOn May 31, the delegates discussed the structure of Congress and how its members would be selected. The division of the legislature into an upper and lower house was familiar and had wide support. The [[British Parliament]] had an elected [[House of Commons]] and a hereditary [[House of Lords]]. All the states had bicameral legislatures except for Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=89, 110}} The delegates quickly agreed that each house of Congress should be able to originate bills. They also agreed that the new Congress would have all the legislative powers of the Confederation Congress and veto power over state laws.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=121}}\n\nThere was some opposition to popular election of the lower house or [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. [[Elbridge Gerry]] of Massachusetts and [[Roger Sherman]] of Connecticut feared the people were too easily misled by [[demagogue]]s and that popular election could lead to mob rule and anarchy. [[Pierce Butler]] of South Carolina believed that only wealthy men of property could be trusted with political power. The majority of the Convention, however, supported popular election.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=110\u2013116}} [[George Mason]] of Virginia said the lower house was \"to be the grand depository of the democratic principle of the government.\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=117}}\n\nThere was general agreement that the upper house or [[United States Senate|Senate]] should be smaller and more selective than the lower house. Its members should be [[gentlemen]] drawn from the most intelligent and virtuous among the citizenry.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=122}} Experience had convinced the delegates that such an upper house was necessary to tame the excesses of the democratically elected lower house.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=89, 110}} The Virginia Plan's method of selecting the Senate was more controversial. Members concerned with preserving state power wanted state legislatures to select senators, while [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] of Pennsylvania proposed direct election by the people.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=119}} It was not until June 7 that the delegates unanimously decided that state legislatures would choose senators.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=64-65}}\n\n==== Three-Fifths ratio ====\nOn the question of proportional representation, the three large states still faced opposition from the eight small states. James Wilson realized that the large states needed the support of the [[Deep South]] states of Georgia and the Carolinas. For these southern delegates, the main priority was protection of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]].{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=67}} Working with [[John Rutledge]] of South Carolina, Wilson proposed the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] on June 11. This resolution apportioned seats in the House of Representatives on the basis of a state's free population plus three-fifths of its slave population. Nine states voted in favor, with only New Jersey and Delaware against.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=75-78}} This compromise would give the South at least a dozen additional congressmen and electoral college votes.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=79}} That same day, the large-state/slave-state alliance also succeeded in applying the three-fifths ratio to Senate seats (though this was later overturned).{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=80}}\n\n=== Executive branch ===\nAs English law had typically recognized government as having two separate functions\u2014law making embodied in the legislature and law executing embodied in the king and his courts\u2014the division of the legislature from the executive and judiciary was a natural and uncontested point.{{Sfn|Padover|Landynski|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}} Even so, the form the executive should take, its powers and its selection would be sources of constant dispute through the summer of 1789.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=124}} At the time, few nations had nonhereditary executives that could serve as models. The [[Dutch Republic]] was led by a [[stadtholder]], but this office was in practice inherited by members of the [[House of Orange]]. The [[Swiss Confederacy]] had no single leader, and the [[elective monarchies]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were viewed as corrupt.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=154}}\n\nAs a result of their colonial experience, Americans distrusted a strong chief executive. Under the Articles of Confederation, the closest thing to an executive was the [[Committee of the States]], which was empowered to transact government business while Congress was in recess. However, this body was largely inactive. The revolutionary state constitutions made the governors subordinate to the legislatures, denying them executive veto power over legislation. Without veto power, governors were unable to block legislation that threatened minority rights.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=125\u2013126}} States chose governors in different ways. Many state constitutions empowered legislatures to select them, but several allowed direct election by the people. In Pennsylvania, the people elected an executive council and the legislature appointed one of its members to be chief executive.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=154}}\n\nThe Virginia Plan proposed a national executive chosen by Congress. It would have power to execute national laws and be vested with the power to make war and treaties.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=140}} Whether the executive would be a single person or a group of people was not defined.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=90}} The executive together with a \"convenient number\" of federal judges would form a [[Council of Revision]] with the power to veto any act of Congress. This veto could be overridden by an unspecified number of votes in both houses of Congress.{{Sfn|Klarman|2016|p=140}}\n\n==== Unitary executive ====\n[[File:James-wilson.png|thumb|James Wilson's ideas shaped the American presidency more than any other delegate{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=127}}]]\n\nJames Wilson feared that the Virginia Plan made the executive too dependent on Congress. He argued that there should be a single, [[Unitary executive theory|unitary executive]]. Members of a multiple executive would most likely be chosen from different regions and represent regional interests. In Wilson's view, only a single executive could represent the nation as a whole while giving \"energy, dispatch, and responsibility\" to the government.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=127}}\n\nWilson used his understanding of civic virtue as defined by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] to help design the presidency. The challenge was to design a properly constituted executive that was fit for a republic and based on civic virtue by the general citizenry. He spoke 56 times calling for a chief executive who would be energetic, independent, and accountable. He believed that the moderate level of class conflict in American society produced a level of sociability and inter-class friendships that could make the presidency the symbolic leader of the entire American people.  Wilson did not consider the possibility of bitterly polarized [[Political parties in the United States|political parties]]. He saw [[popular sovereignty]] as the cement that held America together linking the interests of the people and of the presidential administration. The president should be a man of the people who embodied the national responsibility for the public good and provided transparency and accountability by being a highly visible national leader, as opposed to numerous largely anonymous congressmen.{{Sfn|Taylor|Hardwick|2009|pp=331\u2013346.}}{{Sfn|McCarthy|1987|pp=689\u2013696}}{{Sfn|DiClerico|1987|pp=301\u2013317}}\n\nOn June 1, Wilson proposed that \"the Executive consist of a single person.\" This motion was seconded by Charles Pinckney, whose plan called for a single executive and specifically named this official a \"president\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=127}} Roger Sherman objected in favor of something similar to a [[parliamentary system]] in which the executive should be appointed by and directly accountable to the legislature. Edmund Randolph agreed with Wilson that the executive needed \"vigor\", but he disapproved of a unitary executive, which he feared was \"the [[foetus]] of monarchy\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=128}} Randolph and George Mason led the opposition against a unitary executive, but most delegates agreed with Wilson. The prospect that George Washington would be the first president may have allowed the proponents of a unitary executive to accumulate a large coalition. Wilson's motion for a single executive passed on June 4.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=128, 134}} Initially, the convention set the executive's term of office to seven years, but this would be revisited.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=136}}\n\n==== Election, removal and the veto ====\nWilson also argued that the executive should be directly elected by the people. Only through direct election could the executive be independent of both Congress and the states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=129}} This view was unpopular. A few delegates such as Roger Sherman, Elbridge Gerry and Pierce Butler opposed direct election of the executive because they considered the people too easily manipulated. However, most delegates did not question the intelligence of the voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late 18th century. Due to a lack of information, the average voter would be too ignorant about the candidates to make an informed decision.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=130}}\n\nA majority of delegates favored the president's election by Congress for a seven-year term; though there was concern that this would give the legislature too much power. Southern delegates supported selection by state legislatures, but this was opposed by nationalists such as Madison who feared that such a president would become a [[Power broker (politics)|power broker]] between different state interests rather than a symbol of national unity. Realizing that direct election was impossible, Wilson proposed what would become the [[United States Electoral College|electoral college]]\u2014the states would be divided into districts in which voters would choose electors who would then elect the president. This would preserve the separation of powers and keep the state legislatures out of the selection process. Initially, however, this scheme received little support.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=135-136}}\n\nThe issue was one of the last major issues to be resolved, and was done so in the electoral college. At the time, before the formation of modern political parties, there was widespread concern that candidates would routinely fail to secure a majority of electors in the electoral college. The method of resolving this problem therefore was a contested issue. Most thought that the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] should then choose the president, since it most closely reflected the will of the people. This caused dissension among delegates from smaller states, who realized that this would put their states at a disadvantage. To resolve this dispute, the Convention agreed that the House would elect the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, but that each state delegation would vote as a bloc, rather than individually.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=136}}\n\nThe Virginia Plan made no provision for removing the executive. On June 2, [[John Dickinson]] of Delaware proposed that the president be removed from office by Congress at the request of a majority of state legislatures. Madison and Wilson opposed this state interference in the national executive branch. Sherman argued that Congress should be able to remove the president for any reason in what was essentially a [[vote of no-confidence]]. George Mason worried that would make the president a \"mere creature of the legislature\" and violate separation of powers. Dickinson's motion was rejected, but in the aftermath of the vote there was still no consensus over how an unfit president should be removed from office.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=141-142}}\n\nOn June 4, the delegates debated the Council of Revision. Wilson and [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York disagreed with the mixing of executive and judicial branches. They wanted the president to have an absolute veto to guarantee his independence from the legislative branch. Remembering how colonial governors used their veto to \"extort money\" from the legislature, [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania opposed giving the president an absolute veto. Gerry proposed that a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress be able to overrule any veto of the Council of Revision. This was amended to replace the council with the president alone, but Madison insisted on retaining a Council of Revision and consideration of the veto power was postponed.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=138-140}}\n\nThe office of [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] was also included later in the deliberations, mainly to provide the president a successor if he was unable to complete his term but also to provide presidential electors with an incentive to vote for at least one out of state candidate in addition to a \"favorite son\" from their own state or region.\n\n=== Judiciary ===\nIn the English tradition, judges were seen as being agents of the king and his court, who represented him throughout his realm. Madison believed that in the American states, this direct link between state executives and judges was a source of corruption through [[patronage]], and thought the link had to be severed between the two, thus creating the \"third branch\" of the judiciary which had been without any direct precedent before this point.{{Sfn|Padover|Landynski|1995|p=}}{{page needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nOn June 4, delegates unanimously agreed to a national judiciary \"of one supreme tribunal and one or more inferior tribunals\". The delegates disagreed on how federal judges should be chosen. The Virginia Plan called for the national legislature to appoint judges. James Wilson wanted the president to appoint judges to increase the power of that office.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=236}}\n\nOn June 13, the revised report on the Virginia Plan was issued. This report summarized the decisions made by the delegates in the first two weeks of the Convention. It was agreed that a \"national judiciary be established, to consist of one supreme tribunal\". Congress would have the power to create and appoint inferior courts. Judges were to hold office [[Good Behavior Clause|\"during good behavior\"]], and the Senate would appoint them.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=159}}\n\n=== Alternative plans ===\n[[File:New Jersey Plan.png|thumb|New Jersey Plan]]\nThe small state delegates were alarmed at the plan taking shape: a supreme national government that could override state laws and proportional representation in both houses of Congress.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=88}} William Paterson and other delegates from New Jersey, Connecticut, Maryland and New York created an alternative plan that consisted of several amendments to the Articles of Confederation. Under the [[New Jersey Plan]], as it was called, the Confederation Congress would remain unicameral with each state having one vote. Congress would be allowed to levy tariffs and other taxes as well as regulate trade and commerce. Congress would elect a plural \"federal executive\" whose members would serve a single term and could be removed by Congress at the request of a majority of state governors. There would also be a federal judiciary to apply US law. Federal judges would serve for life and be appointed by the executives. Laws enacted by Congress would take precedence over state laws. This plan was introduced on June 15.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=|pp=161-162}}{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=90-91}}{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}}\n[[File:Hamilton Plan.png|thumb|Hamilton's Plan]]\nOn June 18, [[Alexander Hamilton]] of New York presented his own plan that was at odds with both the Virginia and New Jersey plans. It called for the constitution to be modeled on the [[British Government|British government]]. The bicameral legislature included a lower house called the Assembly elected by the people for three year terms. The people would choose electors who would elect the members of a Senate who served for life. Electors would also choose a single executive called the governor who would also serve for life. The governor would have an absolute veto over bills. There would also be a national judiciary whose members would serve for life. Hamilton called for the abolition of the states (or at least their reduction to sub-jurisdictions with limited powers). Some scholars have suggested that Hamilton presented this radical plan in order to help secure passage of the Virginia Plan by making it seem moderate by comparison. The plan was so out of step with political reality that it was not even debated, and Hamilton would be troubled for years by accusations that he was a [[Monarchism|monarchist]].{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=|pp=94-95}}{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}}\n\nOn June 19, the delegates voted on the New Jersey Plan. With the support of the slave states and Connecticut, the large states were able to defeat the plan by a 7\u20133 margin. Maryland's delegation was divided, so it did not vote.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=96}} This did not end the debate over representation. Rather, the delegates found themselves in a stalemate that lasted into July.\n[[File:Roger Sherman 1721-1793 by Ralph Earl.jpeg|thumb|Roger Sherman of Connecticut]]\n\nOn several occasions, the Connecticut delegation\u2014Roger Sherman, [[Oliver Ellsworth]] and [[William Samuel Johnson]]\u2014proposed a compromise that the House would have proportional representation and the Senate equal representation.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=164}} A version of this compromise had originally been crafted and proposed by Sherman on June 11. He agreed with Madison that the Senate should be composed of the wisest and most virtuous citizens, but he also saw its role as defending the rights and interests of the states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=150}} James Madison recorded Sherman's June 11 speech as follows:{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|p=196}}\n\n{{quote|Mr. Sherman proposed that the proportion of suffrage in the 1st branch should be according to the respective numbers of free inhabitants; and that in the second branch or Senate, each State should have one vote and no more. He said as the States would remain possessed of certain individual rights, each State ought to be able to protect itself: otherwise a few large States will rule the rest. The House of Lords in England he observed had certain particular rights under the Constitution, and hence they have an equal vote with the House of Commons that they may be able to defend their rights.}}\n\nOn June 29, Johnson made a similar point: \"that in one branch, the people ought to be represented; in the other, the states.\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=181}} Neither side was ready yet to embrace the concept of [[divided sovereignty]] between the states and a federal government, however.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=173}} The distrust between large and small state delegates had reached a low point, exemplified by comments made on June 30 by [[Gunning Bedford Jr]]. As reported by Robert Yates, Bedford stated:{{Sfn|Farrand|1911|pp=500\u2013501}}\n\n{{quote|I do not, gentlemen, trust you. If you possess the power, the abuse of it could not be checked; and what then would prevent you from exercising it to our destruction? . . . Yes, sir, the larger states will be rivals but not against each other\u2014they will be rivals against the rest of the states . . . Will you crush the smaller states, or must they be left unmolested? Sooner than be ruined, there are foreign powers who will take us by the hand.}}\n\n==Compromising on apportionment==\n=== Grand Committee ===\n[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Siffrein Duplessis.jpg|thumb|Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania]]\nAs the Convention was entering its second full month of deliberations, it was decided that further consideration of the prickly question of how to apportion representatives in the national legislature should be referred to a committee composed of one delegate from each of the eleven states that were present at that time at the Convention. The members of this \"Grand Committee,\" as it has come to be known, included William Paterson of New Jersey, [[Robert Yates (politician)|Robert Yates]] of New York, [[Luther Martin]] of Maryland, Gunning Bedford, Jr. of Delaware, Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, [[Abraham Baldwin]] of Georgia, Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, George Mason of Virginia, [[William Davie]] of North Carolina, [[John Rutledge]] of South Carolina and [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Pennsylvania.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=200}} The committee's composition heavily favored the smaller states, as even the large state delegates tended to be more moderate.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=110}}\n\nWhile the Convention took a three-day recess in observance of the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] holiday, the Grand Committee began its work.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=110}} Franklin proposed and the committee adopted a compromise similar to the Connecticut plan. Membership in the House would be apportioned by population, with members elected from districts of forty thousand people. Each state would have an equal vote in the Senate. To gain large state support, however, Franklin proposed that the House of Representatives have exclusive power to originate bills concerned with raising money or government salaries (this would become the [[Origination Clause]]).{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=201}} This compromise has become known as the Great Compromise or the [[Connecticut Compromise]].{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=111}}\n\n=== Revisiting the three-fifths ratio ===\nThe committee presented its report on July 5, but the compromise was not immediately adopted by the Convention. For the next eleven days, the Convention stalled as delegates attempted to gain as many votes for their states as possible.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=115}} On July 6, a five-man committee was appointed to allocate specific numbers of representatives to each state. It called for a 56\u2013member House of Representatives and used \"[t]he number of blacks and whites with some regard to supposed wealth\" as a basis of allocating representatives to each state. The Northern states had 30 representatives while the Southern states had 26. Delegates from non-slave states objected to counting slaves as they could not vote.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=116\u2013117}}{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=208}}\n\nOn July 9, a new committee was chosen to reconsider the allocation of representatives. This time there were eleven members, one from each state. It recommended a 65\u2013member House with allocation of representatives based on the number of free inhabitants and three-fifths of slaves. Under this new scheme, Northern states had 35 representatives and the South had 30. Southern delegates protested the North's greater representation and argued that their growing populations had been underestimated. The Committee of Eleven's report was approved, but the divergent interests of the Northern and Southern states remained obstacles to reaching consensus.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=208}}\n\nOn July 10, Edmund Randolph called for a regular [[United States Census|census]] on which to base future reallocation of House seats.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|p=118}} During the debate on the census, South Carolina delegates Pierce Butler and Charles Cotesworth Pinckney sought to replace the three-fifths ratio with a full count of the slave population. They argued that slave property contributed to the wealth of the Southern states and as such should be used in calculating representation. This irritated Northern delegates who were already reluctant to support the three-fifths compromise. James Wilson, one of the authors of the three-fifths compromise, asked, \"Are slaves to be admitted as Citizens? Then why are they not admitted on an equality with White Citizens? Are they admitted as property? Then why is not other property admitted into the computation?\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=209\u2013210}}\n\nAfter fierce debate, the delegates voted to apportion representation and [[direct tax]]ation based on all white inhabitants and three-fifths of the slave population. This formula would apply to the existing states as well as any states created in the future. The first census would occur six years after the new federal government began operations and every ten years afterwards.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=211\u2013213}}\n\n=== Great Compromise ===\n{{Main|Connecticut Compromise}}\nOn July 14, John Rutledge and James Wilson attempted to secure proportional representation in the Senate. Charles Pinckney proposed a form of semi-proportional representation in which the smaller states would gain more representation than under a completely proportional system. This proposal was defeated.{{Sfn|Stewart|2007|pp=123\u2013124}}\n\nIn a close vote on July 16, the Convention adopted the Great Compromise as recommended by the Grand Committee. Nationalist delegates remained bitterly opposed, however, until on July 23 they succeeded in further modifying the compromise to give members of the Senate individual voting power, rather than having votes taken by each state's representatives [[wikt:en bloc|en bloc]], as had occurred in Congress under the Articles of Confederation.<ref name=\"RECORDS 1787 94 952\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N9OFAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA94|title=The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, Volume 2|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1911|editor-last=Farrand|editor-first=Max|location=New Haven|pages=94\u201395}}</ref> This accomplished the nationalist goal of preventing state governments from having a direct say in Congress's choice to make national laws.<ref name=\"Claus2\">See Laurence Claus, Power Enumeration and the Silences of Constitutional Federalism http://ssrn.com/abstract=2837390</ref> The final document was thus a mixture of Madison's original \"national\" constitution and the desired \"federal\" Constitution that many of the delegates sought.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=199}}\n\n==Further debate==\n===Federal supremacy===\nOn July 17, the delegates worked to define the powers of Congress. The Virginia Plan asserted the supremacy of the national government, giving Congress authority \"to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent\" and stating that congressional legislation would take precedence over conflicting state laws. In a motion introduced by Gunning Bedford, the Convention approved this provision with only South Carolina and Georgia voting against. Four small states\u2014Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware and Maryland\u2014accepted the expansion of congressional power. Later in life, Madison explained that this was a result of the Great Compromise. Once the small states were assured they would be represented in the new government, they \"exceeded all others in zeal\" for a strong national government.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=227\u2013228}}\n\nThe Virginia Plan also gave Congress veto power over state laws. Madison believed this provision was crucial to prevent the states from engaging in irresponsible behavior, such as had occurred under the Confederation government. Gouverneur Morris feared the congressional veto would alienate states that might otherwise support the Constitution. Luther Martin argued that it would be too impractical and time-consuming, asking \"Shall the laws of the states be sent up to the general legislature before they shall be permitted to operate?\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=228}}\n\nThe Convention rejected the congressional veto. In its place, Martin proposed language taken from the New Jersey Plan that was unanimously approved by the Convention: \"that the Legislative acts of the US made by virtue and pursuance of the articles of Union, and all treaties made and ratified under the authority of the US shall be the supreme law of the respective States . . . and that the . . . States shall be bound thereby in their decisions\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=229}}\n\n===Appointing judges===\nNeeding a break from discussing the presidency, the delegates once again considered the judicial branch on July 18. They were still divided over the method of appointment. Half of the Convention wanted the Senate to choose judges, while the other half wanted the president to do it. Luther Martin supported Senate appointment because he thought that body's members would defend the interests of the individual states.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=237}}\n\nNathaniel Gorham had suggested a compromise\u2014appointment by the president with the \"[[advice and consent]] of the Senate\". While the meaning of \"advice and consent\" was still undefined, the proposal gained some support. On July 21, Madison offered an alternative compromise\u2014the president would appoint judges but the Senate could veto an appointment by a two-thirds majority. This proposal would have made it very hard for the Senate to block judicial appointments. Madison's proposal failed to garner support, and the delegates ended by reaffirming that the Senate would appoint judges.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=238}}\n\nOn July 21, Wilson and Madison tried unsuccessfully to revive Madison's council of revision. While judges had a role in reviewing the constitutionality of laws, argued Gorham, mixing the policy judgments of the president with the legal judgments of a court would violate separation of powers. John Rutledge agreed, saying \"judges ought never to give their opinion on a law till it comes before them\".{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=237\u2013238}}\n\n==First draft==\nThe Convention adjourned from July 26 to August 6 to await the report of the [[Committee of Detail]], which was to produce a first draft of the Constitution. It was chaired by [[John Rutledge]], with the other members including [[Edmund Randolph]], [[Oliver Ellsworth]], [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]], and [[Nathaniel Gorham]].\n\nThough the committee did not record minutes of its proceedings, three key surviving documents offer clues to the committee's handiwork: an outline by Randolph with edits by Rutledge, extensive notes and a second draft by Wilson, also with Rutledge's edits, and the committee's final report to the Convention.<ref name=\"Stewart\">{{cite book|last= Stewart|first= David O.|title= The Summer of 1787|year= 2007|publisher= Simon & Schuster|location=New York|isbn= 978-0-7432-8692-3}}</ref>{{rp|168}} From this evidence it is thought that the committee used the original Virginia Plan, the decisions of the Convention on modifications to that plan, and other sources, such as the [[Articles of Confederation]], provisions of the state constitutions, and even [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney's]] plan, to produce the first full draft,{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=269\u201370}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|165}} which author [[David O. Stewart]] has called a \"remarkable copy-and-paste job.\"<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|165}}\n\nRandolph adopted two rules in preparing his initial outline: that the Constitution should only include essential principles, avoiding minor provisions that would change over time, and that it should be stated in simple and precise language.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=270}}\n\nMuch of what was included in the committee's report consisted of numerous details that the Convention had never discussed but which the committee correctly viewed as uncontroversial and unlikely to be challenged; and as such, much of the committee's proposal would ultimately be incorporated into the final version of the Constitution without debate.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|169}} Examples of these details included the [[Speech and Debate Clause]], which grants members of Congress immunity for comments made in their jobs, and the rules for organizing the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\nHowever, Rutledge, himself a former state governor, was determined that while the new national government should be stronger than the Confederation government had been, the national government's power over the states should not be limitless; and at Rutledge's urging, the committee went beyond what the Convention had proposed. As Stewart describes it, the committee \"hijacked\" and remade the Constitution, altering critical agreements the Convention delegates had already made, enhancing the powers of the states at the expense of the national government, and adding several far-reaching provisions that the Convention had never discussed.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|165}}\n\n[[File:John Rutledge.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[John Rutledge]], a judge and former governor of South Carolina, chaired the committee that wrote the first draft of the Constitution. He argued for a federal government of limited power.]]\n\nThe first major change, insisted on by Rutledge, was meant to sharply curtail the essentially unlimited powers to legislate \"in all cases for the general interests of the Union\" that the Convention only two weeks earlier had agreed to grant the Congress. Rutledge and Randolph worried that the broad powers implied in the language agreed on by the Convention would have given the national government too much power at the expense of the states. In Randolph's outline the committee replaced that language with a list of 18 specific \"enumerated\" powers, many adopted from the Articles of Confederation, that would strictly limit the Congress' authority to measures such as imposing taxes, making treaties, going to war, and establishing post offices.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=273\u201374}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|170\u201371}} Rutledge, however, was not able to completely convince all of the members of the committee to accept the change. Over the course of a series of drafts, a catchall provision (the \"[[Necessary and Proper Clause]]\") was eventually added, most likely by Wilson, a nationalist little concerned with the sovereignty of individual states, giving the Congress the broad power \"to make all Laws that shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.\"{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=274}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|171\u201372}} Another revision of Wilson's draft also placed eight specific limits on the states, such as barring them from independently entering into treaties and from printing their own money, providing a certain degree of balance to the limits on the national government intended by Rutledge's list of enumerated powers.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=274\u201375}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|172}} In addition, Wilson's draft modified the language of the [[Supremacy Clause]] adopted by the Convention, to ensure that national law would take precedence over inconsistent state laws.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|172}}\n\nThese changes set the final balance between the national and state governments that would be entered into the final document, as the Convention never challenged this dual-sovereignty between nation and state that had been fashioned by Rutledge and Wilson.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|172}}\n\nAnother set of radical changes introduced by the Committee of Detail proved far more contentious when the committee's report was presented to the Convention. On the day the Convention had agreed to appoint the committee, Southerner Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina, had warned of dire consequences should the committee fail to include protections for slavery in the Southern states, or allow for taxing of Southern agricultural exports.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=269, 275}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|173}} Pinckney and his fellow Southern delegates must have been delighted to see that the committee had included three provisions that explicitly restricted the Congress' authority in ways favorable to Southern interests. The proposed language would bar the Congress from ever interfering with the slave trade. It would also prohibit taxation of exports, and would require that any legislation concerning regulation of foreign commerce through tariffs or quotas (that is, any laws akin to England's \"[[Navigation Acts]]\") pass only with two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress. While much of the rest of the committee's report would be accepted without serious challenge on the Convention floor, these last three proposals would provoke outrage from Northern delegates and slavery opponents.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|p=275}}<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|173\u201374}}\n\nThe final report of the committee, which became the first draft of the Constitution, was the first workable constitutional plan, as Madison's Virginia Plan had simply been an outline of goals and a broad structure. Even after it issued this report, the committee continued to meet off and on until early September.\n\n==Further modifications and concluding debate==\nAnother month of discussion and relatively minor refinement followed, during which several attempts were made to alter the Rutledge draft, though few were successful. Some wanted to add property qualifications for people to hold office, while others wanted to prevent the national government from issuing paper money.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|187}} Madison in particular wanted to push the Constitution back in the direction of his Virginia plan.\n\nOne important change that did make it into the final version included the agreement between northern and southern delegates to empower Congress to end the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] starting in 1808. Southern and northern delegates also agreed to strengthen the [[Fugitive Slave Clause]] in exchange for removing a requirement that two-thirds of Congress agree on \"navigation acts\" (regulations of commerce between states and foreign governments). The two-thirds requirement was favored by southern delegates, who thought Congress might pass navigation acts that would be economically harmful to slaveholders.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|196}}\n\nOnce the Convention had finished amending the first draft from the Committee of Detail, a new set of unresolved questions were sent to several different committees for resolution. The Committee of Detail was considering several questions related to ''[[habeas corpus]]'', [[freedom of the press]], and an executive council to advise the president. Two committees addressed questions related to the slave trade and the assumption of war debts.\n\nA new committee was created, the Committee on Postponed Parts, to address other questions that had been postponed. Its members, such as Madison, were delegates who had shown a greater desire for compromise and were chosen for this reason as most in the Convention wanted to finish their work and go home.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|207}} The committee dealt with questions related to the taxes, war making, patents and copyrights, relations with indigenous tribes, and Franklin's compromise to require money bills to originate in the House. The biggest issue they addressed was the presidency, and the final compromise was written by Madison with the committee's input.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|209}} They adopted Wilson's earlier plan for choosing the president by an electoral college, and settled on the method of choosing the president if no candidate had an electoral college majority, which many such as Madison thought would be \"nineteen times out of twenty\".\n\nThe committee also shortened the president's term from seven years to four years, freed the president to seek re-election after an initial term, and moved [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment trials]] from the courts to the Senate. They also created the office of the vice president, whose only roles were to succeed a president unable to complete a term of office, to preside over the Senate, and to cast tie-breaking votes in the Senate. The committee transferred important powers from the Senate to the president, for example the power to make treaties and appoint ambassadors.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|212}} One controversial issue throughout much of the Convention had been the length of the president's term, and whether the president was to be [[term limit]]ed. The problem had resulted from the understanding that the president would be chosen by Congress; the decision to have the president be chosen instead by an electoral college reduced the chance of the president becoming beholden to Congress, so a shorter term with eligibility for re-election became a viable option.\n\nNear the end of the Convention, Gerry, Randolph, and Mason emerged as the main force of opposition. Their fears were increased as the Convention moved from Madison's vague Virginia Plan to the concrete plan of Rutledge's Committee of Detail.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|235}} Some have argued that Randolph's attacks on the Constitution were motivated by political ambition, in particular his anticipation of possibly facing rival [[Patrick Henry]] in a future election. The main objection of the three was the compromise that would allow Congress to pass \"navigation acts\" with a simple majority in exchange for strengthened slave provisions.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|236}} Among their other objections was an opposition to the office of vice president.\n\nThough most of their complaints did not result in changes, a couple did. Mason succeeded in adding \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" to the impeachment clause. Gerry also convinced the Convention to include a second method for ratification of amendments. The report out of the Committee of Detail had included only one mechanism for constitutional amendment, in which two-thirds of the states had to ask Congress to convene a convention for consideration of amendments. Upon Gerry's urging, the Convention added back the Virginia Plan's original method whereby Congress would propose amendments that the states would then ratify.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|238}} All amendments to the Constitution, save the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st amendment]], have been made through this latter method.\n\nDespite their successes, these three dissenters grew increasingly unpopular as most other delegates wanted to bring the Convention's business to an end and return home. As the Convention was drawing to a conclusion, and delegates prepared to refer the Constitution to the Committee on Style to pen the final version, one delegate raised an objection over civil trials. He wanted to guarantee the right to a jury trial in civil matters, and Mason saw in this a larger opportunity. Mason told the Convention that the constitution should include a [[bill of rights]], which he thought could be prepared in a few hours. Gerry agreed, though the rest of the committee overruled them. They wanted to go home, and thought this was nothing more than another delaying tactic.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|241}}\n\nFew at the time realized how important the issue would become, with the absence of a bill of rights becoming the main argument of the [[anti-Federalist]]s against ratification. Most of the Convention's delegates thought that states already protected individual rights, and that the Constitution did not authorize the national government to take away rights, so there was no need to include protections of rights. Once the Convention moved beyond this point, the delegates addressed a couple of last-minute issues. Importantly, they modified the language that required spending bills to originate in the House of Representatives and be flatly accepted or rejected, unmodified, by the Senate. The new language empowered the Senate to modify spending bills proposed by the House.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|243}}\n\n==Drafting and signing==\n{{further|Signing of the United States Constitution}}[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|''[[Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States]]'', by [[Howard Chandler Christy]] (1940)]]\n\nOnce the final modifications had been made, the Committee of Style and Arrangement was appointed \"to revise the style of and arrange the articles which had been agreed to by the house.\" Unlike other committees, whose members were named so the committees included members from different regions, this final committee included no champions of the small states. Its members were mostly in favor of a strong national government and unsympathetic to calls for states' rights.<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|229\u201330}} They were [[William Samuel Johnson]] (Connecticut), [[Alexander Hamilton]] (New York), [[Gouverneur Morris]] (Pennsylvania), [[James Madison]] (Virginia), and [[Rufus King]] (Massachusetts). On Wednesday, September 12, the report of the \"committee of style\" was ordered printed for the convenience of the delegates. For three days, the Convention compared this final version with the proceedings of the Convention. The Constitution was then ordered engrossed on Saturday, September 15 by Jacob Shallus, and was submitted for signing on September 17. It made at least one important change to what the Convention had agreed to; King wanted to prevent states from interfering in contracts. Although the Convention never took up the matter, his language was now inserted, creating the [[contract clause]].<ref name=\"Stewart\" />{{rp|243}}\n\nGouverneur Morris is credited, both now and then, as the chief draftsman of the final document, including the stirring preamble. Not all the delegates were pleased with the results; thirteen left before the ceremony, and three of those remaining refused to sign: [[Edmund Randolph]] of [[Virginia]], [[George Mason]] of [[Virginia]], and [[Elbridge Gerry]] of [[Massachusetts]].

A similar measure had been proposed earlier, and failed by one vote. [[George Washington]] spoke up here, making his only substantive contribution to the text of the Constitution in supporting this move. The Convention adopted it without further debate.

Once Delaware's largest slaveholder, he had freed all of his slaves by 1787.]]\n\nWhether slavery was to be regulated under the new Constitution was a matter of such intense conflict between the North and South that several Southern states{{which|date=September 2019}} refused to join the Union if slavery were not to be allowed. Delegates opposed to slavery were forced to yield in their demands that slavery be completely outlawed within the new nation. However, they continued to argue that the Constitution should prohibit the states from participating in the international slave trade, including in the importation of new slaves from Africa and the export of slaves to other countries. The Convention postponed making a final decision on the international slave trade until late in the deliberations because of the contentious nature of the issue. During the Convention's late July recess, the Committee of Detail had inserted language that would prohibit the federal government from attempting to ban international slave trading and from imposing taxes on the purchase or sale of slaves. The Convention could not agree on these provisions when the subject came up again in late August, so they referred the matter to an eleven-member committee for further discussion. This committee helped work out a compromise: Congress would have the power to ban the international slave trade, but not for another twenty years (that is, not until 1808). In exchange for this concession, the federal government's power to regulate foreign commerce would be strengthened by provisions that allowed for taxation of slave trades in the international market and that reduced the requirement for passage of navigation acts from two-thirds majorities of both houses of Congress to simple majorities.{{Sfn|Beeman|2009|pp=318\u201329}}\n\n===Three-Fifths Compromise===\n{{Main|Three-Fifths Compromise}}\n\nAnother contentious slavery-related question was whether slaves would be counted as part of the population in determining representation of the states in the Congress, or would instead be considered property and as such not be considered for purposes of representation.<ref name=\"crf\">{{cite web|url=http://www.crf-usa.org/lessons/slavery_const.htm |author=Constitutional Rights Foundation |title=The Constitution and Slavery |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040225183537/http://www.crf-usa.org/lessons/slavery_const.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2004 |accessdate=September 15, 2016 }}</ref> Delegates from states with a large population of slaves argued that slaves should be considered persons in determining representation, but as property if the new government were to levy taxes on the states on the basis of population.<ref name=\"crf\"/> Delegates from states where slavery had become rare argued that slaves should be included in taxation, but not in determining representation.<ref name=\"crf\"/>  Finally, delegate [[James Wilson (justice)|James Wilson]] proposed the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].{{Sfn|Mount|2012|p=}} This was eventually adopted by the Convention.\n\n{{Anchor|Framers}}\n\n==Framers of the Constitution==\n<!-- This Anchor tag serves to provide a permanent target for incoming section links.
