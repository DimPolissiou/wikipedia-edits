{"title_page": "Timeline of asexual history", "text_new": "[[File:Asexual Pride Flag.svg|thumb|The asexual pride flag]]\nThis is a '''timeline of asexual history''' worldwide. The briefness of this timeline can be attributed to the fact that acceptance of [[asexuality]] as a sexual orientation and field of [[scientific method|scientific research]] is still relatively new.<ref name=\"Helm\"/><ref name=\"Prause\"/><ref name=\"SexualOrientation\"/>\n\nSeveral of these events refer to historical essays and studies on [[Human sexual activity|sexual behaviour]].  While modern asexual discourse focuses on lack of [[sexual attraction]], rather than [[celibacy]] or [[sexual abstinence]], the [[Sexology|research on human sexuality]] and [[sexual orientation]] has only recently started making said distinction.<ref name=\"Timeline\"/>\n\n==19th century==\n===1860s===\n*1869: [[Karl-Maria Kertbeny]], in the same pamphlets arguing against Prussian sodomy law where he coined the terms \"homosexual\" and \"heterosexual\", also used the word \"monosexuals\" to refer to people who only masturbate.<ref name=\"Kertbeny\"/>\n\n===1890s===\n*1896: German sexologist [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] wrote the pamphlet ''Sappho und Sokrates,'' which mentions people without any sexual desire and links them to the concept of \"anesthesia sexual\".<ref name=\"Hirschfeld\"/>\n\n==20th Century==\n===1940s\u20131950s===\n*1948: The [[Kinsey scale|Kinsey Scale]] included the category \"X\" for males who reported no socio-sexual contacts or reactions, of which, according to the research, 1.5% of adult male subjects fell into this category.<ref name=\"KinseyScale\"/><ref name=\"KinseyMale\"/>\n*1953: The [[Kinsey scale|Kinsey Scale]] included the category \"X\" for females who reported no socio-sexual contacts or reactions, of which, according to the research, 19% of female interviewees fell into this category.<ref name=\"KinseyScale\"/><ref name=\"KinseyFemale1\"/><ref name=\"KinseyFemale2\"/>\n\n===1960s===\n*1969: [[Anton LaVey|Anton Szandor LaVey]] in his book ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' referenced asexuals and asexuality, stating that \"Satanism condones any type of sexual activity which properly satisfies your individual desires \u2013 be it heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, or even asexual\".<ref name=\"LaVey\"/>\n\n===1970s===\n*1972: The Asexual Manifesto written by Lisa Orlando is published by the [[New York Radical Feminists]] and circulates within feminist circles.<ref name=\"Manifesto\"/>\n*1973: Activists at [[Barnard College]] were pictured to include \"asexual\" on a board advocating to \"choose your own label\" and had their picture featured in February/March 1973 edition of ''[[off our backs]]''.<ref name=\"OOB1\"/>  The picture was intended to be released in the previous article which described asexuality to be \"an orientation that regards a partner as nonessential to sex, and sex as nonessential to a satisfying relationship.\"<ref name=\"OOB2\"/>\n*1974: Singer and composer [[David Bowie]] discussed asexuality in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in the article \"David Bowie in conversation on sexuality with [[William S.

Storms reimagined the [[Kinsey Scale]] as a two-dimensional map which included asexuality, defined as exhibiting little to no homo-eroticism nor hetero-eroticism. This type of scale accounted for asexuality for the first time.<ref name=\"CerankowskiMilks\"/>  Storms conjectured that many researchers following Kinsey's model could be mis-categorizing asexual subjects as bisexual, because both were simply defined by a lack of preference for gender in sexual partners.<ref name=\"Storms1979\"/><ref name=\"Storms1980\"/>\n\n===1980s===\n*1983: The first study that gave empirical data about asexuals was published in 1983 by Paula Nurius, concerning the relationship between sexual orientation and mental health. The study used a variant of Kinsey's model, and scored participants according to sexual behaviour and desire for it.<ref name=\"RuspiniMilks\"/>\n*1989: American talk show host [[Sally Jesse Raphael]] interviewed Toby (alias of [[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]]), a then self-described androgynous and nonsexual person.<ref name=\"Toby\"/>\n\n===1990s===\n*1993: The book ''Boston Marriages: Romantic but Asexual Relationships Among Contemporary Lesbians'' by Esther D.
