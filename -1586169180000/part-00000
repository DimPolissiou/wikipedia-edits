[[Fourier analysis]] converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the [[frequency domain]] and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by [[Matrix decomposition|factorizing]] the [[DFT matrix]] into a product of [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] (mostly zero) factors.<ref name=\"Loan_1992\"/> As a result, it manages to reduce the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computing the DFT from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math>, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to <math>O(N \\log N)</math>, where <math>N</math> is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]].\n\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for [[discrete Fourier transform#Applications|applications]] in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> In 1994, [[Gilbert Strang]] described the FFT as \"the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime\",<ref name=\"Strang_1994\"/><ref name=\"Kent_2002\"/> and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the [[IEEE]] magazine ''Computing in Science & Engineering''.<ref name=\"Dongarra_Sullivan_2000\"/>\n\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with [[Big O notation|O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')]] [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;''N''. Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-2\\pi i/N}</math> is an ''N''-th [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] and [[3 Juno|Juno]] from sample observations.<ref name=\"Gauss_1866\"/><ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1985\"/> His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by [[James Cooley]] and [[John Tukey]], who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even [[Joseph Fourier]]'s results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. [[Frank Yates]] in 1932 published his version called ''interaction algorithm'', which provided efficient computation of [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard and Walsh transforms]].<ref name=\"Yates_1937\"/> Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, [[G. C. Danielson]] and [[Cornelius Lanczos]] published their version to compute DFT for [[x-ray crystallography]], a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.<ref name=\"Danielson_Lanczos_1942\"/><ref name=\"Lanczos_1956\"/> While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get <math>O(N \\log N)</math> runtime.<ref name=\"Cooley_Lewis_Welch_1967\"/>\n\nJames Cooley and John Tukey published a [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm|more general version of FFT]] in 1965 that is applicable when ''N'' is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of [[President Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, an FFT algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, [[Richard Garwin]] recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.<ref name=\"Cooley_1987\"/> Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|IBM's Watson labs]]) for implementation.<ref name=\"Garwin_1969\"/> Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/> As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> be [[complex number]]s. The [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] is defined by the formula\n\n:<math> X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi k n/N} \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,N-1, </math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i 2\\pi/N}</math> is a [[Primitive root of unity|primitive]] {{mvar|N}}th root of 1.\n\nEvaluating this definition directly requires <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> operations. All known FFT algorithms require [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|\u0398]]<math>(N \\log N)</math> operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/>\n\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''<sup>2</sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N'' \u2212 1) complex additions, of which <math>O(N)</math> operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. On the other hand, the radix-2 [[#Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm|Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005),<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> but the overall improvement from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> to <math>O(N \\log N)</math> remains.\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm===\n{{main|Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm}}\n\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/>).\n\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965,<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> but it was later discovered<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805<ref name=\"Gauss_1805\"/> (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\n\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/>). These are called the ''radix-2'' and ''mixed-radix'' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\n\n===Other FFT algorithms===\n{{main|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm|Hexagonal fast Fourier transform}}\n\nThere are FFT algorithms other than Cooley\u2013Tukey. [[Cornelius Lanczos]] did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS ([[fast Fourier sampling]] method) with [[G. C. Danielson]] (1940).{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nFor ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976)<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''N''. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''z''<sup>2''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''az''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm,<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/><ref name=\"Winograd_1979\"/> which factorizes ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.\n\n[[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''N'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N'' \u2212 1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]] (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\n\n: <math>nk = -\\frac{(k-n)^2} 2 + \\frac{n^2} 2 + \\frac{k^2} 2.</math>\n\n[[Hexagonal fast Fourier transform]] aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\n\n==FFT algorithms specialized for real or symmetric data==\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\n\n:<math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*</math>\n\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/><ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_2\"/> One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.\n\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs.<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/> Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\n\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]]/[[discrete sine transform|sine transform(s)]] ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre- and post-processing.\n\n==Computational issues==\n\n===Bounds on complexity and operation counts===\n{{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than <math>O(N\\log N)</math>?}}\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') (i.e., order ''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'' or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.\n\nFollowing work by [[Shmuel Winograd]] (1978),<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/> a tight \u0398(''N'') lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only <math>4N - 2\\log_2^2(N) - 2\\log_2(N) - 4</math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length <math>N = 2^m</math>. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1986;<ref name=\"Heideman_Burrus_1986\"/> Duhamel, 1990<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/>). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990;<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/> Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/>\n\nA tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern<ref name=\"Morgenstern_1973\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of <math>\\sqrt N</math>), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix)  under the same scaling. [[Victor Pan|Pan]] (1986)<ref name=\"Pan_1986\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ''N'', [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] (1979)<ref name=\"Papadimitriou_1979\"/> argued that the number <math>N \\log_2 N</math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least <math>2N \\log_2 N</math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than <math>N \\log_2 N</math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires <math>4N\\log_2(N) - 6N + 8</math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1. This was recently reduced to <math>\\sim \\frac{34}{9} N \\log_2 N</math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007;<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/> Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007<ref name=\"Lundy_Buskirk_2007\"/>). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N'' \u2265 256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N'' \u2264 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal & Haynal, 2011).<ref name=\"Haynal_2011\"/>\n\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990).<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/>\n\n===Approximations===\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999)<ref name=\"Edelman_McCorquodale_Toledo_1999\"/> achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]]. A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996)<ref name=\"Guo_Burrus_1996\"/> takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).<ref name=\"Shentov_Mitra_Heute_Hossen_1995\"/> The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''{{nnbsp}}log(''N''){{nnbsp}}log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ''N''/''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;32 in a large-''N'' example (''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>22</sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).<ref name=\"Hassanieh_2012\"/>\n\n===Accuracy===\nEven the \"exact\" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(''\u03b5'' log ''N''), compared to O(''\u03b5N''<sup>3/2</sup>) for the na\u00efve DFT formula,<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/> where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|log ''N''}}) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|''N''}}) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).<ref name=\"Schatzman_1996\"/> These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\n\nIn [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O({{radic|''N''}}) for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).<ref name=\"Welch_1969\"/> Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).<ref name=\"Erg\u00fcn_1995\"/>\n\n==Multidimensional FFTs==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nAs defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=0}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\ntransforms an array ''x''<sub>'''n'''</sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices <math>\\mathbf{n} = \\left(n_1, \\ldots, n_d\\right)</math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over <math>n_j = 0 \\ldots N_j - 1</math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = \\left(n_1/N_1, \\ldots, n_d/N_d\\right)</math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\n\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> dimension, then along the ''n''<sub>2</sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity, where <math>N = N_1 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot N_d</math> is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are ''N''/''N''<sub>1</sub> transforms of size ''N''<sub>1</sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      & \\frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \\log N_1) + \\cdots + \\frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \\log N_d) \\\\[6pt]\n  ={} & O\\left(N \\left[\\log N_1 + \\cdots + \\log N_d\\right]\\right) = O(N \\log N).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn two dimensions, the ''x''<sub>'''k'''</sub> can be viewed as an <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\n\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> direction. More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups <math>(n_1, \\ldots, n_{d/2})</math> and <math>(n_{d/2+1}, \\ldots, n_d)</math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\right)</math> of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(1, \\ldots, 1, r, 1, \\ldots, 1\\right)</math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977),<ref name=\"Nussbaumer_1977\"/> which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990)<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/> for more information and references.\n\n==Other generalizations==\nAn O(''N''<sup>5/2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> with ''N''<sup>2</sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp,<ref name=\"Mohlenkamp_1999\"/> along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library.<ref name=\"libftsh\"/> A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''<sup>2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.<ref name=\"Rokhlin_Tygert_2006\"/>\n\nThe [[fast folding algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\n\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=\"Potts_Steidl_Tasche_2001\"/> Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of [[spectral estimation]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe FFT is used in digital recording, sampling, [[additive synthesis]] and [[pitch correction]] software.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Richard James |title=The History of Music Production |date=2014 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199357178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe FFT's importance derives from the fact that it has made working in the frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in the temporal or spatial domain. Some of the important applications of the FFT include:<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/><ref name=\"Chu_George_1999\"/>\n* Fast large-integer and polynomial multiplication\n* Efficient matrix-vector multiplication for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz]], [[Circulant matrix|circulant]] and other structured matrices\n* Filtering algorithms (see [[Overlap-add method|overlap-add]] and [[Overlap-save method|overlap-save]] methods)\n* Fast algorithms for [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]] or [[discrete sine transform|sine transforms]] (e.g. [[Discrete cosine transform|fast DCT]] used for [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]]/[[MP3]] encoding and decoding)\n* Fast [[Chebyshev approximation]]\n* Solving [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]]s\n* Computation of [[Mass spectrometry|isotopic distributions]].<ref name=\"Fernandez-de-Cossio_2012\"/>\n\n==Research areas==\n; Big FFTs: With the explosion of big data in fields such as astronomy, the need for 512k FFTs has arisen for certain interferometry calculations. The data collected by projects such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[LIGO]] require FFTs of tens of billions of points. As this size does not fit into main memory, so called out-of-core FFTs are an active area of research.<ref name=\"Cormen_Nicol_1998\"/>\n; Approximate FFTs: For applications such as MRI, it is necessary to compute DFTs for nonuniformly spaced grid points and/or frequencies. Multipole based approaches can compute approximate quantities with factor of runtime increase.<ref name=\"Dutt_Rokhlin_1993\"/>\n; [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Group FFTs]]: The FFT may also be explained and interpreted using [[Group representation|group representation theory]] that allows for further generalization. A function on any compact group, including non cyclic, has an expansion in terms of a basis of irreducible matrix elements. It remains active area of research to find efficient algorithm for performing this change of basis. Applications including efficient [[spherical harmonics|spherical harmonic]] expansion, analyzing certain [[Markov process]]es, robotics etc.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2004\"/>\n; [[Quantum Fourier transform|Quantum FFTs]]: Shor's fast algorithm for [[integer factorization]] on a quantum computer has a subroutine to compute DFT of a binary vector. This is implemented as sequence of 1- or 2-bit quantum gates now known as quantum FFT, which is effectively the Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT realized as a particular factorization of the Fourier matrix.

[[Fourier analysis]] converts a signal from its original domain (often time or space) to a representation in the [[frequency domain]] and vice versa. The DFT is obtained by decomposing a [[sequence]] of values into components of different frequencies.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> This operation is useful in many fields, but computing it directly from the definition is often too slow to be practical. An FFT rapidly computes such transformations by [[Matrix decomposition|factorizing]] the [[DFT matrix]] into a product of [[Sparse matrix|sparse]] (mostly zero) factors.<ref name=\"Loan_1992\"/> As a result, it manages to reduce the [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] of computing the DFT from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math>, which arises if one simply applies the definition of DFT, to <math>O(N \\log N)</math>, where <math>N</math> is the data size. The difference in speed can be enormous, especially for long data sets where ''N'' may be in the thousands or millions. In the presence of [[round-off error]], many FFT algorithms are much more accurate than evaluating the DFT definition directly or indirectly. There are many different FFT algorithms based on a wide range of published theories, from simple [[complex number|complex-number arithmetic]] to [[group theory]] and [[number theory]].\n\nFast Fourier transforms are widely used for [[discrete Fourier transform#Applications|applications]] in engineering, music, science, and mathematics. The basic ideas were popularized in 1965, but some algorithms had been derived as early as 1805.<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> In 1994, [[Gilbert Strang]] described the FFT as \"the most important [[numerical analysis|numerical algorithm]] of our lifetime\",<ref name=\"Strang_1994\"/><ref name=\"Kent_2002\"/> and it was included in Top 10 Algorithms of 20th Century by the [[IEEE]] magazine ''Computing in Science & Engineering''.<ref name=\"Dongarra_Sullivan_2000\"/>\n\nThe best-known FFT algorithms depend upon the [[factorization]] of ''N'', but there are FFTs with [[Big O notation|O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'')]] [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]] for all ''N'', even for [[prime number|prime]]&nbsp;''N''. Many FFT algorithms only depend on the fact that <math>e^{-2\\pi i/N}</math> is an ''N''-th [[primitive root of unity]], and thus can be applied to analogous transforms over any [[finite field]], such as [[number-theoretic transform]]s. Since the inverse DFT is the same as the DFT, but with the opposite sign in the exponent and a 1/''N'' factor, any FFT algorithm can easily be adapted for it.\n\n== History ==\nThe development of fast algorithms for DFT can be traced to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]'s unpublished work in 1805 when he needed it to interpolate the orbit of asteroids [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] and [[3 Juno|Juno]] from sample observations.<ref name=\"Gauss_1866\"/><ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1985\"/> His method was very similar to the one published in 1965 by [[James Cooley]] and [[John Tukey]], who are generally credited for the invention of the modern generic FFT algorithm. While Gauss's work predated even [[Joseph Fourier]]'s results in 1822, he did not analyze the computation time and eventually used other methods to achieve his goal.\n\nBetween 1805 and 1965, some versions of FFT were published by other authors. [[Frank Yates]] in 1932 published his version called ''interaction algorithm'', which provided efficient computation of [[Hadamard transform|Hadamard and Walsh transforms]].<ref name=\"Yates_1937\"/> Yates' algorithm is still used in the field of statistical design and analysis of experiments. In 1942, [[G. C. Danielson]] and [[Cornelius Lanczos]] published their version to compute DFT for [[x-ray crystallography]], a field where calculation of Fourier transforms presented a formidable bottleneck.<ref name=\"Danielson_Lanczos_1942\"/><ref name=\"Lanczos_1956\"/> While many methods in the past had focused on reducing the constant factor for <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> computation by taking advantage of \"symmetries\", Danielson and Lanczos realized that one could use the \"periodicity\" and apply a \"doubling trick\" to get <math>O(N \\log N)</math> runtime.<ref name=\"Cooley_Lewis_Welch_1967\"/>\n\nJames Cooley and John Tukey published a [[Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm|more general version of FFT]] in 1965 that is applicable when ''N'' is composite and not necessarily a power of 2.<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> Tukey came up with the idea during a meeting of [[President Kennedy]]'s Science Advisory Committee where a discussion topic involved detecting nuclear tests by the Soviet Union by setting up sensors to surround the country from outside. To analyze the output of these sensors, an FFT algorithm would be needed. In discussion with Tukey, [[Richard Garwin]] recognized the general applicability of the algorithm not just to national security problems, but also to a wide range of problems including one of immediate interest to him, determining the periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of Helium-3.<ref name=\"Cooley_1987\"/> Garwin gave Tukey's idea to Cooley (both worked at [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|IBM's Watson labs]]) for implementation.<ref name=\"Garwin_1969\"/> Cooley and Tukey published the paper in a relatively short time of six months.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/> As Tukey did not work at IBM, the patentability of the idea was doubted and the algorithm went into the public domain, which, through the computing revolution of the next decade, made FFT one of the indispensable algorithms in digital signal processing.\n\n==Definition==\nLet ''x''<sub>0</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''N''\u22121</sub> be [[complex number]]s. The [[discrete Fourier transform|DFT]] is defined by the formula\n\n:<math> X_k = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n e^{-i2\\pi k n/N} \\qquad k = 0,\\ldots,N-1, </math>\n\nwhere <math>e^{i 2\\pi/N}</math> is a [[Primitive root of unity|primitive]] {{mvar|N}}th root of 1.\n\nEvaluating this definition directly requires <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> operations: there are ''N'' outputs ''X''<sub>''k''</sub>, and each output requires a sum of ''N'' terms. An FFT is any method to compute the same results in <math>O(N \\log N)</math> operations. All known FFT algorithms require [[Big O notation#Use in computer science|\u0398]]<math>(N \\log N)</math> operations, although there is no known proof that a lower complexity score is impossible.<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/>\n\nTo illustrate the savings of an FFT, consider the count of complex multiplications and additions for N=4096 data points. Evaluating the DFT's sums directly involves ''N''<sup>2</sup> complex multiplications and ''N''(''N'' \u2212 1) complex additions, of which <math>O(N)</math> operations can be saved by eliminating trivial operations such as multiplications by 1, leaving about 30 million operations. On the other hand, the radix-2 [[#Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm|Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm]], for ''N'' a power of 2, can compute the same result with only (''N''/2)log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex multiplications (again, ignoring simplifications of multiplications by 1 and similar) and ''N''&nbsp;log<sub>2</sub>(''N'') complex additions, in total about 30,000 operations - a thousand times less than with direct evaluation. In practice, actual performance on modern computers is usually dominated by factors other than the speed of arithmetic operations and the analysis is a complicated subject (for example, see Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005),<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> but the overall improvement from <math>O\\left(N^2\\right)</math> to <math>O(N \\log N)</math> remains.\n\n==Algorithms==\n\n===Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm===\n{{main|Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT algorithm}}\n\nBy far the most commonly used FFT is the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm. This is a [[divide and conquer algorithm]] that [[recursion|recursively]] breaks down a DFT of any [[composite number|composite]] size ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> into many smaller DFTs of sizes ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, along with O(''N'') multiplications by complex [[roots of unity]] traditionally called [[twiddle factor]]s (after Gentleman and Sande, 1966<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/>).\n\nThis method (and the general idea of an FFT) was popularized by a publication of Cooley and Tukey in 1965,<ref name=\"Cooley_Tukey_1965\"/> but it was later discovered<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/> that those two authors had independently re-invented an algorithm known to [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] around 1805<ref name=\"Gauss_1805\"/> (and subsequently rediscovered several times in limited forms).\n\nThe best known use of the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is to divide the transform into two pieces of size ''N''/2 at each step, and is therefore limited to power-of-two sizes, but any factorization can be used in general (as was known to both Gauss and Cooley/Tukey<ref name=\"Heideman_Johnson_Burrus_1984\"/>). These are called the ''radix-2'' and ''mixed-radix'' cases, respectively (and other variants such as the [[split-radix FFT]] have their own names as well).  Although the basic idea is recursive, most traditional implementations rearrange the algorithm to avoid explicit recursion. Also, because the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT, such as those described below.\n\n===Other FFT algorithms===\n{{main|Prime-factor FFT algorithm|Bruun's FFT algorithm|Rader's FFT algorithm|Bluestein's FFT algorithm|Hexagonal fast Fourier transform}}\n\nThere are FFT algorithms other than Cooley\u2013Tukey. [[Cornelius Lanczos]] did pioneering work on the FFT and FFS ([[fast Fourier sampling]] method) with [[G. C. Danielson]] (1940).{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nFor ''N'' = ''N''<sub>1</sub>''N''<sub>2</sub> with [[coprime]] ''N''<sub>1</sub> and ''N''<sub>2</sub>, one can use the [[Prime-factor FFT algorithm|prime-factor]] (Good\u2013Thomas) algorithm (PFA), based on the [[Chinese remainder theorem]], to factorize the DFT similarly to Cooley\u2013Tukey but without the twiddle factors. The Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm (1976)<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> is a Cooley\u2013Tukey-like factorization but with purely imaginary twiddle factors, reducing multiplications at the cost of increased additions and reduced [[numerical stability]]; it was later superseded by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm|split-radix]] variant of Cooley\u2013Tukey (which achieves the same multiplication count but with fewer additions and without sacrificing accuracy). Algorithms that recursively factorize the DFT into smaller operations other than DFTs include the Bruun and [[Quick Fourier transform algorithm|QFT]] algorithms. (The Rader\u2013Brenner<ref name=\"Brenner_Rader_1976\"/> and QFT algorithms were proposed for power-of-two sizes, but it is possible that they could be adapted to general composite ''N''. Bruun's algorithm applies to arbitrary even composite sizes.) [[Bruun's FFT algorithm|Bruun's algorithm]], in particular, is based on interpreting the FFT as a recursive factorization of the [[polynomial]] ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1, here into real-coefficient polynomials of the form ''z''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 and ''z''<sup>2''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''az''<sup>''M''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\nAnother polynomial viewpoint is exploited by the Winograd FFT algorithm,<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/><ref name=\"Winograd_1979\"/> which factorizes ''z''<sup>''N''</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 into [[cyclotomic polynomial]]s\u2014these often have coefficients of 1,&nbsp;0,&nbsp;or&nbsp;\u22121, and therefore require few (if any) multiplications, so Winograd can be used to obtain minimal-multiplication FFTs and is often used to find efficient algorithms for small factors. Indeed, Winograd showed that the DFT can be computed with only O(''N'') irrational multiplications, leading to a proven achievable lower bound on the number of multiplications for power-of-two sizes; unfortunately, this comes at the cost of many more additions, a tradeoff no longer favorable on modern [[central processing unit|processors]] with [[floating-point unit|hardware multipliers]]. In particular, Winograd also makes use of the PFA as well as an algorithm by Rader for FFTs of ''prime'' sizes.\n\n[[Rader's FFT algorithm|Rader's algorithm]], exploiting the existence of a [[generating set of a group|generator]] for the multiplicative [[group (mathematics)|group]] modulo prime ''N'', expresses a DFT of prime size ''N'' as a cyclic [[convolution]] of (composite) size ''N'' \u2212 1, which can then be computed by a pair of ordinary FFTs via the [[convolution theorem]] (although Winograd uses other convolution methods). Another prime-size FFT is due to L. I. Bluestein, and is sometimes called the [[chirp-z algorithm]]; it also re-expresses a DFT as a convolution, but this time of the ''same'' size (which can be zero-padded to a [[power of two]] and evaluated by radix-2 Cooley\u2013Tukey FFTs, for example), via the identity\n\n: <math>nk = -\\frac{(k-n)^2} 2 + \\frac{n^2} 2 + \\frac{k^2} 2.</math>\n\n[[Hexagonal fast Fourier transform]] aims at computing an efficient FFT for the hexagonally sampled data by using a new addressing scheme for hexagonal grids, called Array Set Addressing (ASA).\n\n==FFT algorithms specialized for real or symmetric data==\nIn many applications, the input data for the DFT are purely real, in which case the outputs satisfy the symmetry\n\n:<math>X_{N-k} = X_k^*</math>\n\nand efficient FFT algorithms have been designed for this situation (see e.g. Sorensen, 1987).<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/><ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_2\"/> One approach consists of taking an ordinary algorithm (e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey) and removing the redundant parts of the computation, saving roughly a factor of two in time and memory. Alternatively, it is possible to express an ''even''-length real-input DFT as a complex DFT of half the length (whose real and imaginary parts are the even/odd elements of the original real data), followed by O(''N'') post-processing operations.\n\nIt was once believed that real-input DFTs could be more efficiently computed by means of the [[discrete Hartley transform]] (DHT), but it was subsequently argued that a specialized real-input DFT algorithm (FFT) can typically be found that requires fewer operations than the corresponding DHT algorithm (FHT) for the same number of inputs.<ref name=\"Sorensen_Jones_Heideman_Burrus_1987_1\"/> Bruun's algorithm (above) is another method that was initially proposed to take advantage of real inputs, but it has not proved popular.\n\nThere are further FFT specializations for the cases of real data that have [[even and odd functions|even/odd]] symmetry, in which case one can gain another factor of roughly two in time and memory and the DFT becomes the [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]]/[[discrete sine transform|sine transform(s)]] ([[discrete cosine transform|DCT]]/[[discrete sine transform|DST]]).  Instead of directly modifying an FFT algorithm for these cases, DCTs/DSTs can also be computed via FFTs of real data combined with O(''N'') pre- and post-processing.\n\n==Computational issues==\n\n===Bounds on complexity and operation counts===\n{{unsolved|computer science|What is the lower bound on the complexity of fast Fourier transform algorithms?  Can they be faster than <math>O(N\\log N)</math>?}}\nA fundamental question of longstanding theoretical interest is to prove lower bounds on the [[computational complexity theory|complexity]] and exact operation counts of fast Fourier transforms, and many open problems remain. It is not even rigorously proved whether DFTs truly require \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') (i.e., order ''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'' or greater) operations, even for the simple case of [[power of two]] sizes, although no algorithms with lower complexity are known. In particular, the count of arithmetic operations is usually the focus of such questions, although actual performance on modern-day computers is determined by many other factors such as [[Cache (computing)|cache]] or [[pipeline (computing)|CPU pipeline]] optimization.\n\nFollowing work by [[Shmuel Winograd]] (1978),<ref name=\"Winograd_1978\"/> a tight \u0398(''N'') lower bound is known for the number of real multiplications required by an FFT. It can be shown that only <math>4N - 2\\log_2^2(N) - 2\\log_2(N) - 4</math> irrational real multiplications are required to compute a DFT of power-of-two length <math>N = 2^m</math>. Moreover, explicit algorithms that achieve this count are known (Heideman & [[Charles Sidney Burrus|Burrus]], 1986;<ref name=\"Heideman_Burrus_1986\"/> Duhamel, 1990<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/>). However, these algorithms require too many additions to be practical, at least on modern computers with hardware multipliers (Duhamel, 1990;<ref name=\"Duhamel_1990\"/> Frigo & [[Steven G. Johnson|Johnson]], 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/>\n\nA tight lower bound is not known on the number of required additions, although lower bounds have been proved under some restrictive assumptions on the algorithms. In 1973, Morgenstern<ref name=\"Morgenstern_1973\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound on the addition count for algorithms where the multiplicative constants have bounded magnitudes (which is true for most but not all FFT algorithms). This result, however, applies only to the unnormalized Fourier transform (which is a scaling of a unitary matrix by a factor of <math>\\sqrt N</math>), and does not explain why the Fourier matrix is harder to compute than any other unitary matrix (including the identity matrix)  under the same scaling. [[Victor Pan|Pan]] (1986)<ref name=\"Pan_1986\"/> proved an \u03a9(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') lower bound assuming a bound on a measure of the FFT algorithm's \"asynchronicity\", but the generality of this assumption is unclear. For the case of power-of-two ''N'', [[Christos Papadimitriou|Papadimitriou]] (1979)<ref name=\"Papadimitriou_1979\"/> argued that the number <math>N \\log_2 N</math> of complex-number additions achieved by Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithms is ''optimal'' under certain assumptions on the [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] of the algorithm (his assumptions imply, among other things, that no additive identities in the roots of unity are exploited). (This argument would imply that at least <math>2N \\log_2 N</math> real additions are required, although this is not a tight bound because extra additions are required as part of complex-number multiplications.) Thus far, no published FFT algorithm has achieved fewer than <math>N \\log_2 N</math> complex-number additions (or their equivalent) for power-of-two&nbsp;''N''.\n\nA third problem is to minimize the ''total'' number of real multiplications and additions, sometimes called the \"arithmetic complexity\" (although in this context it is the exact count and not the asymptotic complexity that is being considered).  Again, no tight lower bound has been proven. Since 1968, however, the lowest published count for power-of-two ''N'' was long achieved by the [[split-radix FFT algorithm]], which requires <math>4N\\log_2(N) - 6N + 8</math> real multiplications and additions for ''N'' > 1. This was recently reduced to <math>\\sim \\frac{34}{9} N \\log_2 N</math> (Johnson and Frigo, 2007;<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2007\"/> Lundy and Van Buskirk, 2007<ref name=\"Lundy_Buskirk_2007\"/>). A slightly larger count (but still better than split radix for ''N'' \u2265 256) was shown to be provably optimal for ''N'' \u2264 512 under additional restrictions on the possible algorithms (split-radix-like flowgraphs with unit-modulus multiplicative factors), by reduction to a [[satisfiability modulo theories]] problem solvable by [[Proof by exhaustion|brute force]] (Haynal & Haynal, 2011).<ref name=\"Haynal_2011\"/>\n\nMost of the attempts to lower or prove the complexity of FFT algorithms have focused on the ordinary complex-data case, because it is the simplest. However, complex-data FFTs are so closely related to algorithms for related problems such as real-data FFTs, [[discrete cosine transform]]s, [[discrete Hartley transform]]s, and so on, that any improvement in one of these would immediately lead to improvements in the others (Duhamel & Vetterli, 1990).<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/>\n\n===Approximations===\nAll of the FFT algorithms discussed above compute the DFT exactly (i.e. neglecting [[floating-point]] errors). A few \"FFT\" algorithms have been proposed, however, that compute the DFT ''approximately'', with an error that can be made arbitrarily small at the expense of increased computations. Such algorithms trade the approximation error for increased speed or other properties. For example, an approximate FFT algorithm by Edelman et al. (1999)<ref name=\"Edelman_McCorquodale_Toledo_1999\"/> achieves lower communication requirements for [[parallel computing]] with the help of a [[fast multipole method]]. A [[wavelet]]-based approximate FFT by Guo and Burrus (1996)<ref name=\"Guo_Burrus_1996\"/> takes sparse inputs/outputs (time/frequency localization) into account more efficiently than is possible with an exact FFT. Another algorithm for approximate computation of a subset of the DFT outputs is due to Shentov et al. (1995).<ref name=\"Shentov_Mitra_Heute_Hossen_1995\"/> The Edelman algorithm works equally well for sparse and non-sparse data, since it is based on the compressibility (rank deficiency) of the Fourier matrix itself rather than the compressibility (sparsity) of the data. Conversely, if the data are sparse\u2014that is, if only ''K'' out of ''N'' Fourier coefficients are nonzero\u2014then the complexity can be reduced to O(''K''{{nnbsp}}log(''N''){{nnbsp}}log(''N''/''K'')), and this has been demonstrated to lead to practical speedups compared to an ordinary FFT for ''N''/''K''&nbsp;>&nbsp;32 in a large-''N'' example (''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2<sup>22</sup>) using a probabilistic approximate algorithm (which estimates the largest ''K'' coefficients to several decimal places).<ref name=\"Hassanieh_2012\"/>\n\n===Accuracy===\nEven the \"exact\" FFT algorithms have errors when finite-precision floating-point arithmetic is used, but these errors are typically quite small; most FFT algorithms, e.g. Cooley\u2013Tukey, have excellent numerical properties as a consequence of the [[pairwise summation]] structure of the algorithms.  The upper bound on the [[approximation error|relative error]] for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm is O(''\u03b5'' log ''N''), compared to O(''\u03b5N''<sup>3/2</sup>) for the na\u00efve DFT formula,<ref name=\"Gentleman_Sande_1966\"/> where \u03b5 is the machine floating-point relative precision. In fact, the [[root mean square]] (rms) errors are much better than these upper bounds, being only O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|log ''N''}}) for Cooley\u2013Tukey and O(''\u03b5'' {{radic|''N''}}) for the na\u00efve DFT (Schatzman, 1996).<ref name=\"Schatzman_1996\"/> These results, however, are very sensitive to the accuracy of the twiddle factors used in the FFT (i.e. the [[trigonometric function]] values), and it is not unusual for incautious FFT implementations to have much worse accuracy, e.g. if they use inaccurate [[generating trigonometric tables|trigonometric recurrence]] formulas. Some FFTs other than Cooley\u2013Tukey, such as the Rader\u2013Brenner algorithm, are intrinsically less stable.\n\nIn [[fixed-point arithmetic]], the finite-precision errors accumulated by FFT algorithms are worse, with rms errors growing as O({{radic|''N''}}) for the Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm (Welch, 1969).<ref name=\"Welch_1969\"/> Moreover, even achieving this accuracy requires careful attention to scaling to minimize loss of precision, and fixed-point FFT algorithms involve rescaling at each intermediate stage of decompositions like Cooley\u2013Tukey.\n\nTo verify the correctness of an FFT implementation, rigorous guarantees can be obtained in O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') time by a simple procedure checking the linearity, impulse-response, and time-shift properties of the transform on random inputs (Erg\u00fcn, 1995).<ref name=\"Erg\u00fcn_1995\"/>\n\n==Multidimensional FFTs==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Discrete Fourier transform]] -->\n\nAs defined in the [[Discrete Fourier transform#Multidimensional DFT|multidimensional DFT]] article, the multidimensional DFT\n\n:<math>X_\\mathbf{k} = \\sum_{\\mathbf{n}=0}^{\\mathbf{N}-1} e^{-2\\pi i \\mathbf{k} \\cdot (\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N})} x_\\mathbf{n}</math>\n\ntransforms an array ''x''<sub>'''n'''</sub> with a ''d''-dimensional [[coordinate vector|vector]] of indices <math>\\mathbf{n} = \\left(n_1, \\ldots, n_d\\right)</math> by a set of ''d'' nested summations (over <math>n_j = 0 \\ldots N_j - 1</math> for each ''j''), where the division '''n'''/'''N''', defined as <math>\\mathbf{n} / \\mathbf{N} = \\left(n_1/N_1, \\ldots, n_d/N_d\\right)</math>, is performed element-wise.  Equivalently, it is the composition of a sequence of ''d'' sets of one-dimensional DFTs, performed along one dimension at a time (in any order).\n\nThis compositional viewpoint immediately provides the simplest and most common multidimensional DFT algorithm, known as the '''row-column''' algorithm (after the two-dimensional case, below). That is, one simply performs a sequence of ''d'' one-dimensional FFTs (by any of the above algorithms): first you transform along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> dimension, then along the ''n''<sub>2</sub> dimension, and so on (or actually, any ordering works). This method is easily shown to have the usual O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity, where <math>N = N_1 \\cdot N_2 \\cdot \\cdots \\cdot N_d</math> is the total number of data points transformed. In particular, there are ''N''/''N''<sub>1</sub> transforms of size ''N''<sub>1</sub>, etcetera, so the complexity of the sequence of FFTs is:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n      & \\frac{N}{N_1} O(N_1 \\log N_1) + \\cdots + \\frac{N}{N_d} O(N_d \\log N_d) \\\\[6pt]\n  ={} & O\\left(N \\left[\\log N_1 + \\cdots + \\log N_d\\right]\\right) = O(N \\log N).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nIn two dimensions, the ''x''<sub>'''k'''</sub> can be viewed as an <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], and this algorithm corresponds to first performing the FFT of all the rows (resp. columns), grouping the resulting transformed rows (resp. columns) together as another <math>n_1 \\times n_2</math> matrix, and then performing the FFT on each of the columns (resp. rows) of this second matrix, and similarly grouping the results into the final result matrix.\n\nIn more than two dimensions, it is often advantageous for [[Cache (computing)|cache]] locality to group the dimensions recursively.  For example, a three-dimensional FFT might first perform two-dimensional FFTs of each planar \"slice\" for each fixed ''n''<sub>1</sub>, and then perform the one-dimensional FFTs along the ''n''<sub>1</sub> direction. More generally, an [[asymptotically optimal]] [[cache-oblivious]] algorithm consists of recursively dividing the dimensions into two groups <math>(n_1, \\ldots, n_{d/2})</math> and <math>(n_{d/2+1}, \\ldots, n_d)</math> that are transformed recursively (rounding if ''d'' is not even) (see Frigo and Johnson, 2005).<ref name=\"Frigo_Johnson_2005\"/> Still, this remains a straightforward variation of the row-column algorithm that ultimately requires only a one-dimensional FFT algorithm as the base case, and still has O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity.  Yet another variation is to perform matrix [[transpose|transpositions]] in between transforming subsequent dimensions, so that the transforms operate on contiguous data; this is especially important for [[out-of-core]] and [[distributed memory]] situations where accessing non-contiguous data is extremely time-consuming.\n\nThere are other multidimensional FFT algorithms that are distinct from the row-column algorithm, although all of them have O(''N''&nbsp;log&nbsp;''N'') complexity. Perhaps the simplest non-row-column FFT is the [[vector-radix FFT algorithm]], which is a generalization of the ordinary Cooley\u2013Tukey algorithm where one divides the transform dimensions by a vector <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(r_1, r_2, \\ldots, r_d\\right)</math> of radices at each step. (This may also have cache benefits.) The simplest case of vector-radix is where all of the radices are equal (e.g. vector-radix-2 divides ''all'' of the dimensions by two), but this is not necessary.  Vector radix with only a single non-unit radix at a time, i.e. <math>\\mathbf{r} = \\left(1, \\ldots, 1, r, 1, \\ldots, 1\\right)</math>, is essentially a row-column algorithm. Other, more complicated, methods include polynomial transform algorithms due to Nussbaumer (1977),<ref name=\"Nussbaumer_1977\"/> which view the transform in terms of convolutions and polynomial products. See Duhamel and Vetterli (1990)<ref name=\"Duhamel_Vetterli_1990\"/> for more information and references.\n\n==Other generalizations==\nAn O(''N''<sup>5/2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') generalization to [[spherical harmonics]] on the sphere ''S''<sup>2</sup> with ''N''<sup>2</sup> nodes was described by Mohlenkamp,<ref name=\"Mohlenkamp_1999\"/> along with an algorithm conjectured (but not proven) to have O(''N''<sup>2</sup> log<sup>2</sup>(''N'')) complexity; Mohlenkamp also provides an implementation in the libftsh library.<ref name=\"libftsh\"/> A spherical-harmonic algorithm with O(''N''<sup>2</sup>log&nbsp;''N'') complexity is described by Rokhlin and Tygert.<ref name=\"Rokhlin_Tygert_2006\"/>\n\nThe [[fast folding algorithm]] is analogous to the FFT, except that it operates on a series of binned waveforms rather than a series of real or complex scalar values. Rotation (which in the FFT is multiplication by a complex phasor) is a circular shift of the component waveform.\n\nVarious groups have also published \"FFT\" algorithms for non-equispaced data, as reviewed in Potts ''et al.'' (2001).<ref name=\"Potts_Steidl_Tasche_2001\"/> Such algorithms do not strictly compute the DFT (which is only defined for equispaced data), but rather some approximation thereof (a [[non-uniform discrete Fourier transform]], or NDFT, which itself is often computed only approximately). More generally there are various other methods of [[spectral estimation]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe FFT is used in digital recording, sampling, [[additive synthesis]] and [[pitch correction]] software.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Burgess |first1=Richard James |title=The History of Music Production |date=2014 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0199357178 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMKiAwAAQBAJ |accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe FFT's importance derives from the fact that it has made working in the frequency domain equally computationally feasible as working in the temporal or spatial domain. Some of the important applications of the FFT include:<ref name=\"Rockmore_2000\"/><ref name=\"Chu_George_1999\"/>\n* Fast large-integer and polynomial multiplication\n* Efficient matrix-vector multiplication for [[Toeplitz matrix|Toeplitz]], [[Circulant matrix|circulant]] and other structured matrices\n* Filtering algorithms (see [[Overlap-add method|overlap-add]] and [[Overlap-save method|overlap-save]] methods)\n* Fast algorithms for [[discrete cosine transform|discrete cosine]] or [[discrete sine transform|sine transforms]] (e.g. [[Discrete cosine transform|fast DCT]] used for [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]]/[[MP3]] encoding and decoding)\n* Fast [[Chebyshev approximation]]\n* Solving [[Recurrence relation|difference equation]]s\n* Computation of [[Mass spectrometry|isotopic distributions]].<ref name=\"Fernandez-de-Cossio_2012\"/>\n\n==Research areas==\n; Big FFTs: With the explosion of big data in fields such as astronomy, the need for 512k FFTs has arisen for certain interferometry calculations. The data collected by projects such as [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] and [[LIGO]] require FFTs of tens of billions of points. As this size does not fit into main memory, so called out-of-core FFTs are an active area of research.<ref name=\"Cormen_Nicol_1998\"/>\n; Approximate FFTs: For applications such as MRI, it is necessary to compute DFTs for nonuniformly spaced grid points and/or frequencies. Multipole based approaches can compute approximate quantities with factor of runtime increase.<ref name=\"Dutt_Rokhlin_1993\"/>\n; [[Fourier transform on finite groups|Group FFTs]]: The FFT may also be explained and interpreted using [[Group representation|group representation theory]] that allows for further generalization. A function on any compact group, including non cyclic, has an expansion in terms of a basis of irreducible matrix elements. It remains active area of research to find efficient algorithm for performing this change of basis. Applications including efficient [[spherical harmonics|spherical harmonic]] expansion, analyzing certain [[Markov process]]es, robotics etc.<ref name=\"Rockmore_2004\"/>\n; [[Quantum Fourier transform|Quantum FFTs]]: Shor's fast algorithm for [[integer factorization]] on a quantum computer has a subroutine to compute DFT of a binary vector. This is implemented as sequence of 1- or 2-bit quantum gates now known as quantum FFT, which is effectively the Cooley\u2013Tukey FFT realized as a particular factorization of the Fourier matrix. Extension to these ideas is currently being explored.\n\n==Language reference==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Language\n!Command/Method\n!Pre-requisites\n|-\n|[[R (programming

In Japan, the name of the series is officially in [[katakana]], but is often written in kanji (\u4f8d\u9b42), with the second character pronounced ''supirittsu'' (spirits), to better reflect the game's setting.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe stories in the series take place in 18th-century Japan, during the [[Sakoku]] or seclusion period of Japan (the first four games run across 1788 and 1789) with great artistic license so that foreign-born characters (including some from places that did not exist as such in 1788) and fictional monsters can also be part of the story. The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan.\n\n''Samurai Shodown'' consequently portrays snippets of the [[Japanese culture]] and language internationally with little edits. For instance, unlike most fighting games made in Japan, the characters in the series (including the announcer) generally speak only in Japanese, with dialects ranging from archaic formalities and theatricalism to modern-day slang, something that has been preserved for overseas releases. Win quotes and other cut scenes provide subtitles in several languages, including but not limited to English, Portuguese, and German. Much of the music includes traditional [[Japanese instruments]] (predominately the shakuhachi, shamisen, koto and taiko) and later ''[[enka]]''. Several characters are loosely based on real figures from Japanese history.\n\n==Development==\nThere are two main artists responsible for the character designs and illustrations.

The most famous among them includes [[Haohmaru]] and [[Nakoruru]], who are both considered the series' flagship characters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Mini SNK Companion|url=|journal=Retro Gamer|volume=187|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nA television special (later dubbed a ''motion picture'' for international release) {{nihongo|''[[Samurai Shodown: The Motion Picture]]''|SAMURAI SPIRITS \u301c\u7834\u5929\u964d\u9b54\u306e\u7ae0\u301c|Samurai Spirits: Haten G\u014dma no Sh\u014d}} loosely based on the first game aired in Japan in 1994. An English adaptation was produced by [[ADV Films]], on VHS in 1995 and on DVD in 2005. The plot means to reenact the events of [[Samurai Shodown (video game)]], but the characters\u2019 roles highly deviated from their original source. One of such bizarre changes made was switching Amakusa\u2019s gender from male to female. Another questionable change was the inclusion of the \u201cSeven Holy Warriors\u201d, skilled warriors who were resurrected to specifically fight Ambrosia, which is an idea never mentioned in any other continuity.\n\nSeveral manga adaptations of ''Samurai Spirits'' were produced in Japan. One of them, titled {{nihongo|''Makai Bukei J\u014d Samurai Spirits''|\u9b54\u754c\u6b66\u82b8\u5e16 \u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4|Samurai Spirits: Scrolls of the Demonic Arts|}}, written by Kyoichi Nanatsuki and illustrated by Yuki Miyoshi, was serialized in the ''Weekly Shonen Sunday'' in 1994. It was later adapted into English under the simplified titled ''Samurai Shodown'' by [[Viz Media]] in 1996, where it was serialized in the short-lived ''Game On! USA'' magazine and concluded in ''[[Animerica]]''. The story is meant to be a prequel to ''[[Samurai Shodown II]]'', establishing an original character, Yui Minbunosuke Shosetsu, as the main antagonist. Game characters Haohmaru, Nakoruru, Hanzo, Charlotte, and Genan remain the focal characters to the plot. They often interacted with several original characters in the story; the most prominent perhaps is the Koga kunoichi, Nagiri, who believed Haohmaru had killed her father during his travels and sought to avenge him.\n\nThe first [[Original Video Animation|OVA]], the two-part ''Spirits 2: Asura Zanmaeden'', serves as a preface to the events of ''[[Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage]]''. Character designs were done by [[Aoi Nanase]], a longtime fan of SNK. Unlike most game-based anime, the voices were supplied by the same actors as in the game. It is relatively obscure, never having been released in the U.S., and the prospect of licensing is dim at best, as it offers no introduction to any of the characters, assuming (not unreasonably) that anyone watching it is likely to be familiar with the series and its cast already. The story mainly revolves on Nakoruru and her humanistic ideals: she believes that anyone with a heart has the right to live peacefully. Shiki, though apparently free from Yuga\u2019s influence, is recognized as a threat for the sorcerer\u2019s return and it was through Nakoruru\u2019s reasonings that previously saved her life from Haohmaru. Nakoruru finds her and then struggles to peacefully defend her from her pursuers, which include Haohmaru, Galford, and Asura. Though torn because of her morals and pacifistic nature, Nakoruru eventually agrees to draw her blade and fight for those who need protecting. Despite being wounded in his final skirmish with Nakoruru, Asura stabs Shiki and they both sink into a portal to the underworld. Making peace with her blood-thirsty alter ego, the Ainu priestess leaves Kamui Kotan, hoping to find news of Shiki\u2019s safety.\n\nThe second 30-minute OVA centers, ''[[Nakoruru ~Ano hito kara no okurimono~ (OVA)]]'', around the ''Nakoruru ADV'' game, again using Nakoruru as the main heroine. Character designs were done by Yasuomi Umetsu, who is best known for his work in ''[[Mezzo Forte]]'' and ''[[Kite (1999 film)|Kite]]''. The events of the story are meant to take place during the time of peace between the first and second games of the series. The story introduces her childhood friends, Yamtamu and Manari, along with her younger sister, Rimururu, and the relentless enigma, Rera. Nakoruru, though glad that there is serenity, experiences several premonitions of devastation and is haunted by the thought of further bloodshed. The climax of the episode has Nakoruru protecting a deer from a rock slide, implied to be caused by evil entities. For undisclosed reasons, the OVA never released another episode and the story remains unfinished.\n\nIn 2006, [[Sabertooth Games]] released a ''Samurai Shodown V'' [[collectible card game]] set along with ''[[KOF: Maximum Impact 2|The King of Fighters 2006]]'' for its ''[[Universal Fighting System]]'' (''UFS'') collectibe card game. Featured character [[Starter pack|starter decks]] were also released for Haohmaru and Ukyo Tachibana. STG staff favorites from the ''Samurai Shodown'' side tend to favor towards characters Nakoruru and Hanzo Hattori.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[NeoGeo Battle Coliseum]]''\n*[[SNK vs. Capcom (series)|''SNK vs. Capcom'' (series)]]\n\n==References==\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2013}}\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal |date=November 2006 |title=Samurai Shodown Iroha PVC Figure |magazine=Newtype USA |volume=5 |issue=11 |page=126 |issn=1541-4817}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://samuraianiv.snkplaymore.co.jp/ ''Samurai Shodown'' official website]\n*[http://www.personal.triticom.com/%7Eerm/www.neogeo.co.jp/samurai/index.htm An archive of the ''Samurai Shodown'' old official website]\n*[http://game.snkplaymore.co.jp/official/nbc/museum/samuraispirits/ ''Samurai Spirits 1-4''] at NBC Museum of SNK Playmore\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070114095401/http://www.m-2.jp/gamemagazine/character/backnumber/bgr_nak_00.htm ''GameMagazine'' article on Nakoruru ADV]\n\n{{Samurai Shodown series}}\n{{Neo Geo}}\n\n[[Category:Samurai Shodown| ]]\n[[Category:ADV Films]]\n[[Category:Ninja video games]]\n[[Category:Fighting video games by series]]\n[[Category:SNK games]]\n[[Category:SNK Playmore games]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1993]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox VG series\n| title = Samurai Shodown\n| image = [[Image:Shodownlogo.png|256px]]\n| caption = ''Samurai Shodown'' logo\n| genre = [[Fighting game|Fighting]]\n| developer = [[SNK]], [[Yuki Enterprise]] (''V'', ''V Special'')\n| publisher = SNK, [[Sega]] (''VI'' in U.S.)\n| composer = Tate Norio\n| creator = \n| platforms = [[Arcade game|Arcade]], Various platforms\n| first release version = ''[[Samurai Shodown (video game)|Samurai Shodown]]''\n| first release date = July 7, 1993\n| latest release version = ''[[Samurai Shodown (2019 video game)|Samurai Shodown]]''\n| latest release date = June 25, 2019\n}}\n\n'''''Samurai Shodown''''', known in [[Japan]] as {{nihongo|'''''Samurai Spirits'''''|\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4|Samurai Tamashii}}, is a [[fighting game]] series by [[SNK]]. In Japan, the name of the series is officially in [[katakana]], but is often written in kanji (\u4f8d\u9b42), with the second character pronounced ''supirittsu'' (spirits), to better reflect the game's setting.\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe stories in the series take place in 18th-century Japan, during the [[Sakoku]] or seclusion period of Japan (the first four games run across 1788 and 1789) with great artistic license so that foreign-born characters (including some from places that did not exist as such in 1788) and fictional monsters can also be part of the story. The plot of each game is quite different, but they circle a central group of characters and a region in Japan.\n\n''Samurai Shodown'' consequently portrays snippets of the [[Japanese culture]] and language internationally with little edits. For instance, unlike most fighting games made in Japan, the characters in the series (including the announcer) generally speak only in Japanese, with dialects ranging from archaic formalities and theatricalism to modern-day slang, something that has been preserved for overseas releases. Win quotes and other cut scenes provide subtitles in several languages, including but not limited to English, Portuguese, and German. Much of the music includes traditional [[Japanese instruments]] (predominately the shakuhachi, shamisen, koto and taiko) and later ''[[enka]]''. Several characters are loosely based on real figures from Japanese history.\n\n==Development==\nThere are two main artists responsible for the character designs and illustrations. For the early games (Part 1 to 4), the characters are created and illustrated by Eiji Shiroi. His illustrations featured a distinctive, traditional Japanese calligraphy style. While he continues to design for a few of the later games, they are illustrated by another artist named Senri Kita until the fifth title.\n\nThe ''Samurai Shodown'' games are most famous for their \"Rage\" (\u6012) gauge, a meter that only increases as a player receives damage, and which when fully activated has numerous effects depending on game. Earlier games also have a referee in the background, officiating the match.\n\n==Games==\n<!--To edit the text of this article, skip past the table.-->\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!English title\n!Japanese title\n!width=35% | Platforms\n!Release Date\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown (video game)|Samurai Shodown]]''\n|''Samurai Spirits''<br>(\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4)\n|[[Arcade game|Arcade]], [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer|3DO]], [[FM Towns]], [[Sega Game Gear|Game Gear]], [[Game Boy]], [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]], [[Neo-Geo CD]], [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]], [[Sega CD]], [[Super NES]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Wii]], [[Virtual Console]], [[PlayStation Network]] (PS3 and PSP), [[Mobile/I-play]]\n|07-07-1993\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown II]]''\n|''Shin Samurai Spirits Ha\u014dmaru Jigokuhen''<br>(\u771f\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4 \u8987\u738b\u4e38\u5730\u7344\u5909)\n|Arcade, [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo]], [[Neo-Geo CD]], [[Neo Geo Pocket Color]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], PlayStation Network, Wii, Virtual Console, [[Xbox Live Arcade]], [[Neo Geo X]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]]\n|10-28-1994\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown III: Blades of Blood]]''\n|''Samurai Spirits Zankur\u014d Mus\u014dken''<br>(\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4 \u65ac\u7d05\u90ce\u7121\u53cc\u5263)\n|Arcade, [[Neo Geo]], [[Neo-Geo CD]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], PlayStation Network, Virtual Console\n|11-15-1995\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown IV: Amakusa's Revenge]]''\n|''Samurai Spirits Amakusa K\u014drin''<br>(\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4 \u5929\u8349\u964d\u81e8)\n|Arcade, [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]], PlayStation Network, Virtual Console\n|10-25-1996\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown RPG]]''\n|''Shinsetsu Samurai Spirits Bushid\u014d Retsuden''<br>(\u771f\u8aac\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4 \u6b66\u58eb\u9053\u5217\u4f1d)\n|[[Neo Geo CD]], [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], [[Sega Saturn]]\n|06-27-1997\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown 64]]''\n|''Samurai Spirits''<br>(\u4f8d\u9b42 ~SAMURAI SPIRITS~)\n|[[Hyper Neo Geo 64]]\n|12-19-1997\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage]]''\n|''Samurai Spirits 2 Asura Zanmaden''<br>(SAMURAI SPIRITS 2 \u30a2\u30b9\u30e9\u65ac\u9b54\u4f1d)\n|[[Hyper Neo Geo 64]]\n|10-16-1998\n|-\n|''Samurai Shodown!''\n|''Samurai Spirits!''<br>(\u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4!)\n|[[Neo Geo Pocket]]\n|12-25-1998\n|-\n|''[[Samurai Shodown!

The most famous among them includes [[Haohmaru]] and [[Nakoruru]], who are both considered the series' flagship characters.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=The Mini SNK Companion|url=|journal=Retro Gamer|volume=187|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Adaptations==\nA television special (later dubbed a ''motion picture'' for international release) {{nihongo|''[[Samurai Shodown: The Motion Picture]]''|SAMURAI SPIRITS \u301c\u7834\u5929\u964d\u9b54\u306e\u7ae0\u301c|Samurai Spirits: Haten G\u014dma no Sh\u014d}} loosely based on the first game aired in Japan in 1994. An English adaptation was produced by [[ADV Films]], on VHS in 1995 and on DVD in 2005. The plot means to reenact the events of [[Samurai Shodown (video game)]], but the characters\u2019 roles highly deviated from their original source. One of such bizarre changes made was switching Amakusa\u2019s gender from male to female. Another questionable change was the inclusion of the \u201cSeven Holy Warriors\u201d, skilled warriors who were resurrected to specifically fight Ambrosia, which is an idea never mentioned in any other continuity.\n\nSeveral manga adaptations of ''Samurai Spirits'' were produced in Japan. One of them, titled {{nihongo|''Makai Bukei J\u014d Samurai Spirits''|\u9b54\u754c\u6b66\u82b8\u5e16 \u30b5\u30e0\u30e9\u30a4\u30b9\u30d4\u30ea\u30c3\u30c4|Samurai Spirits: Scrolls of the Demonic Arts|}}, written by Kyoichi Nanatsuki and illustrated by Yuki Miyoshi, was serialized in the ''Weekly Shonen Sunday'' in 1994. It was later adapted into English under the simplified titled ''Samurai Shodown'' by [[Viz Media]] in 1996, where it was serialized in the short-lived ''Game On! USA'' magazine and concluded in ''[[Animerica]]''. The story is meant to be a prequel to ''[[Samurai Shodown II]]'', establishing an original character, Yui Minbunosuke Shosetsu, as the main antagonist. Game characters Haohmaru, Nakoruru, Hanzo, Charlotte, and Genan remain the focal characters to the plot. They often interacted with several original characters in the story; the most prominent perhaps is the Koga kunoichi, Nagiri, who believed Haohmaru had killed her father during his travels and sought to avenge him.\n\nThe first [[Original Video Animation|OVA]], the two-part ''Spirits 2: Asura Zanmaeden'', serves as a preface to the events of ''[[Samurai Shodown 64: Warriors Rage]]''. Character designs were done by [[Aoi Nanase]], a longtime fan of SNK. Unlike most game-based anime, the voices were supplied by the same actors as in the game. It is relatively obscure, never having been released in the U.S., and the prospect of licensing is dim at best, as it offers no introduction to any of the characters, assuming (not unreasonably) that anyone watching it is likely to be familiar with the series and its cast already. The story mainly revolves on Nakoruru and her humanistic ideals: she believes that anyone with a heart has the right to live peacefully. Shiki, though apparently free from Yuga\u2019s influence, is recognized as a threat for the sorcerer\u2019s return and it was through Nakoruru\u2019s reasonings that previously saved her life from Haohmaru. Nakoruru finds her and then struggles to peacefully defend her from her pursuers, which include Haohmaru, Galford, and Asura. Though torn because of her morals and pacifistic nature, Nakoruru eventually agrees to draw her blade and fight for those who need protecting. Despite being wounded in his final skirmish with Nakoruru, Asura stabs Shiki and they both sink into a portal to the underworld. Making peace with her blood-thirsty alter ego, the Ainu priestess leaves Kamui Kotan, hoping to find news of Shiki\u2019s safety.\n\nThe second 30-minute OVA centers, ''[[Nakoruru ~Ano hito kara no okurimono~ (OVA)]]'', around the ''Nakoruru ADV'' game, again using Nakoruru as the main heroine. Character designs were done by Yasuomi Umetsu, who is best known for his work in ''[[Mezzo Forte]]'' and ''[[Kite (1999 film)|Kite]]''. The events of the story are meant to take place during the time of peace between the first and second games of the series. The story introduces her childhood friends, Yamtamu and Manari, along with her younger sister, Rimururu, and the relentless enigma, Rera. Nakoruru, though glad that there is serenity, experiences several premonitions of devastation and is haunted by the thought of further bloodshed. The climax of the episode has Nakoruru protecting a deer from a rock slide, implied to be caused by evil entities. For undisclosed reasons, the OVA never released another episode and the story remains unfinished.\n\nIn 2006, [[Sabertooth Games]] released a ''Samurai Shodown V'' [[collectible card game]] set along with ''[[KOF: Maximum Impact 2|The King of Fighters 2006]]'' for its ''[[Universal Fighting System]]'' (''UFS'') collectibe card game. Featured character [[Starter pack|starter decks]] were also released for Haohmaru and Ukyo Tachibana. STG staff favorites from the ''Samurai Shodown'' side tend to favor towards characters Nakoruru and Hanzo Hattori.\n\n==See also==\n*''[[NeoGeo Battle Coliseum]]''\n*[[SNK vs. Capcom (series)|''SNK vs. Capcom'' (series)]]\n\n==References==\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2013}}\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite journal |date=November 2006 |title=Samurai Shodown Iroha PVC Figure |magazine=Newtype USA |volume=5 |issue=11 |page=126 |issn=1541-4817}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://samuraianiv.snkplaymore.co.jp/ ''Samurai Shodown'' official website]\n*[http://www.personal.triticom.com/%7Eerm/www.neogeo.co.jp/samurai/index.htm An archive of the ''Samurai Shodown'' old official website]\n*[http://game.snkplaymore.co.jp/official/nbc/museum/samuraispirits/ ''Samurai Spirits 1-4''] at NBC Museum of SNK Playmore\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070114095401/http://www.m-2.jp/gamemagazine/character/backnumber/bgr_nak_00.htm ''GameMagazine'' article on Nakoruru ADV]\n\n{{Samurai Shodown series}}\n{{Neo Geo}}\n\n[[Category:Samurai Shodown| ]]\n[[Category:ADV Films]]\n[[Category:Ninja video games]]\n[[Category:Fighting video games by series]]\n[[Category:SNK games]]\n[[Category:SNK Playmore games]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises]]\n[[Category:Video game franchises introduced in 1993]]\n", "name_user": "\u53e4\u7530\u4fe1\u4ecb", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eGames:Samurai Shodown (1993 video game)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samurai_Shodown"}

The closing ceremony was created by [[Kim Gavin]], [[Es Devlin]], [[Stephen Daldry]], [[David Arnold]] and [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]]. The worldwide broadcast began at 21:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[UTC+01:00|UTC+1]]) and finished on 13 August 2012 at 00:11, lasting three hours and eleven minutes.\n\nThe stadium had been turned into a giant representation of the Union Flag, designed by [[Damien Hirst]]. Around 4,100 people partook in the ceremony; which reportedly cost \u00a320 million. The 2012 Summer Olympics were officially closed by [[Jacques Rogge]], who called London's games \"happy and glorious.\" The ceremony included a handover to the next host city for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and saw the Olympic flame extinguished and the [[Olympic flag]] lowered. The main part of the evening featured a one-hour symphony of British Music as a number of British Pop acts appeared. Tributes to [[John Lennon]] and [[Freddie Mercury]] and the fashion industry were included in the section.  Rio marked the handover with an eight-minute section known as \"Embrace\" created by [[Cao Hamburger]] and [[Daniela Thomas]], featuring [[Pel\u00e9]]. [[Sebastian Coe]] gave a speech, and the volunteers of London 2012 were thanked.\n\nAn average of 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an estimated 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted that it was not as good as the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. [[George Michael]] was roundly criticised for his song choice while [[Kate Moss]], [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Russell Brand]] were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. [[NBC]] in the United States and [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime TV]] in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to close the Olympics, featuring [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], and [[The Specials]].<ref name=p4khyde>{{cite web|title=Blur, New Order to Play Olympics Closing Ceremony|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/45497-blur-new-order-to-play-olympics-closing-ceremony/|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=21 February 2012|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{2012 Summer Olympics}}\n\n==Production==\nThe creative director and choreographer was [[Kim Gavin]],<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|title=Profile: Kim Gavin, director of Olympic closing ceremony|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19094398|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kim Gavin: profile of Cultural Olympiad ceremony director|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/cultural-olympiad/8332914/Kim-Gavin-profile-of-Cultural-Olympiad-ceremony-director.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref> with [[Es Devlin]] responsible for design and [[David Arnold]] as musical director.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/18/kim-gavin-london-2012-closing-ceremonies|title=Kim Gavin named artistic director for London 2012 closing ceremonies|first=Amelia|last=Hill|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=24 February 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> When Arnold was announced in his role he said that doing the closing ceremony was an honour and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/cultural-olympiad/8332882/James-Bond-composer-David-Arnold-will-be-2012-musical-director.html|title=Bond composer will be 2012 musical director|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=1 March 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> while Gavin stated that he was really excited and honoured to be involved.

The audience then completed a 10-second countdown to the start of the ceremony, to the chimes of [[Big Ben]].  The arena had been transformed into a huge representation of the [[Union Flag]] in black and white, with ramps and famous London landmarks such as the [[London Eye]], Big Ben, [[Battersea Power Station]] and the [[30 St Mary Axe|Gherkin]]. Newspaper cutouts on both the set and road vehicles sought to show a \"day in the life of London\", with words from British literary figures such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Carol Ann Duffy]].<ref name=\"Del Boy\"/>\n\n[[Emeli Sand\u00e9]] appeared on a truck and sang a verse and the chorus of \"[[Read All About It, Pt. III]]\". The Urban Voices Collective (the choir for the ceremony) sang [[The Beatles|The Beatles']] \"[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]\", which merged into cellist [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] (sitting upon the [[Royal Albert Hall]]) playing [[Elgar]]'s [[Salut d'amour]], accompanied by [[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]] performing on household items such as pots, pans and dustbins while suspended on the sculptures of the landmarks.\n\n===God Save the Queen===\nAt the same time, [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Timothy Spall]]) appeared at the top of [[Elizabeth Tower|Big Ben]] and reprised Caliban's \"Be not afeard\" speech from ''[[The Tempest]]'', first read by [[Kenneth Branagh]] in the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. More paper-covered motor vehicles entered. After Churchill finished his speech, people dressed in newspaper print began to fill the arena, ranging from office workers to school children. The beat of the music got faster and noisier, symbolising the London rush hour.  As the noise reached a crescendo, Churchill cried out for all to stop, bringing this section to an end.\n\nPrince Henry of Wales ([[Prince Harry]]), representing the Queen, arrived with the President of the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[Jacques Rogge]]. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the Urban Voice Choir performed the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem of the United Kingdom]] whilst the Union flag was raised by the armed forces and the performers waved mini Union flags in the stadium. Once the flag was raised Hirst's artwork was revealed as the grey clouds were removed.\n\n===Street Party (21:09\u201321:20)===\nThis section started off with footage of [[Michael Caine]] in ''[[The Italian Job]]'' counting down from five, whereupon the [[Reliant Regal]] from ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' exploded with Del Boy and Rodney jumping out dressed as [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]].  Caine's words, \"You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!\", echoed around the stadium. All the lorries had the newspaper removed and a colourful street party erupted, while [[Madness (band)|Madness]] performed \"[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]\". This was followed by the Massed Bands of the [[Household Division]] marching whilst playing [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Parklife (song)|Parklife]]\". Entering on [[cycle rickshaw|rickshaws]], the [[Pet Shop Boys]] performed their hit \"[[West End Girls]]\", and then [[One Direction]] performed \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\" from the back of a lorry. Next there was another performance by Stomp.\n\n===Waterloo Sunset (21:20\u201321:30)===\nThe centre of the arena was then cleared to reveal ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' 2010 winners [[Spelbound]], who performed gymnastics to [[The Beatles]] \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", were inspired by the idea of a commuter on the way to work, by forming a bed and a London Bus. [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]] arrived in a [[Hackney carriage|black cab]] and played \"[[Waterloo Sunset]]\", as Spelbound continued and local school children formed the Thames.  The section closed with Sand\u00e9 reprising \"Read All About It (Pt. III)\" as a montage of athletes crying in victory or defeat was shown on the screens.\n\n===Parade of Athletes (21:30\u201321:53)===\n{{Main|2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers}}\n[[File:Athletes at the 2012 Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Olympic athletes assembled in the shape of the [[Union Flag]]]]\n[[Greece at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Greece]] led the Entrance of the Flags, as all 204 flags filed in to the strains of \"Parade of the Athletes\" (composed by Arnold) and marched up the central cross of the union flag, with [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] bringing up the rear. Meanwhile, volunteer marshals wearing blue suits and blue bowler hats with light bulbs on top marched into the stadium. The athletes then walked in from the several entrances, with some filtering down through the lower stands. At the same time [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] performed \"Open Arms\" and \"[[One Day Like This (song)|One Day Like This]]\". The volunteer marshals helped to usher the athletes into pens between the ramps of the arena. As the last athletes streamed into the stadium and the flags were moved by volunteers closer to the Olympic flame, a reprise of some of the songs from the opening section was played.\n\n===Here Comes the Sun (21:53\u201322:07)===\n16 [[dhol]] drummers opened this segment as the performers entered carrying 303 white boxes to symbolise every event in the Olympic Games. The drumming merged into the newly recorded version of [[Kate Bush]]'s \"[[Running Up that Hill#2012 remix|Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)]]\", as performers arranged the boxes to form a pyramid while video highlights from the previous 16 days of competition were shown on the screens.\n\nThis was followed by the victory ceremony for the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's marathon|Men's Marathon]], by tradition the final medal ceremony of the Games. Rogge and [[Lamine Diack]], president of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], awarded the medals before the [[Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty|Ugandan national anthem]] was played.\n\nSix athletes including [[Katherine Grainger]] and [[Katie Taylor]] presented flowers to six volunteers in a symbolic recognition of the 70,000 volunteers' contribution to the Games.  This part of the ceremony was accompanied by The Beatles' \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\".\n\n===A Symphony of British Music (22:07\u201323:21)===\n[[File:John Lennon face sculpture, 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|A sculpture of the face of [[John Lennon]] at the closing ceremony.]]\nThe section commenced with Queen's \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" being played and a graphic equaliser being shown on the pixel screen.  [[John Lennon]] then appeared on the big screens and was joined by Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Choir and the Liverpool Signing Choir in singing \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" as a bust of Lennon's face was created. Balloons were released at the end of this and [[George Michael]] followed singing \"[[Freedom! '90]]\" and \"[[White Light (George Michael song)|White Light]]\" (one of his last public concert appearances). A group of [[Mod (subculture)|mods]] on [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] followed invading the arena; one of them carried [[Ricky Wilson (British musician)|Ricky Wilson]] to the stage where his band the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] proceeded to cover [[The Who|The Who's]] \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\"; during the song the scooters continued to circle the arena.

The closing ceremony was created by [[Kim Gavin]], [[Es Devlin]], [[Stephen Daldry]], [[David Arnold]] and [[Mark Fisher (architect)|Mark Fisher]]. The worldwide broadcast began at 21:00 [[British Summer Time|BST]] ([[UTC+01:00|UTC+1]]) and finished on 13 August 2012 at 00:11, lasting three hours and eleven minutes.\n\nThe stadium had been turned into a giant representation of the Union Flag, designed by [[Damien Hirst]]. Around 4,100 people partook in the ceremony; which reportedly cost \u00a320 million. The 2012 Summer Olympics were officially closed by [[Jacques Rogge]], who called London's games \"happy and glorious.\" The ceremony included a handover to the next host city for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], [[Rio de Janeiro]] and saw the Olympic flame extinguished and the [[Olympic flag]] lowered. The main part of the evening featured a one-hour symphony of British Music as a number of British Pop acts appeared. Tributes to [[John Lennon]] and [[Freddie Mercury]] and the fashion industry were included in the section.  Rio marked the handover with an eight-minute section known as \"Embrace\" created by [[Cao Hamburger]] and [[Daniela Thomas]], featuring [[Pel\u00e9]]. [[Sebastian Coe]] gave a speech, and the volunteers of London 2012 were thanked.\n\nAn average of 23.2 million viewers in the United Kingdom watched the event, with an estimated 750 million worldwide. Critics were generally positive, but noted that it was not as good as the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. Some of the foreign reviews questioned whether everyone would have understood the nods to British film and television. [[George Michael]] was roundly criticised for his song choice while [[Kate Moss]], [[Naomi Campbell]] and [[Russell Brand]] were criticised for not demonstrating the Olympic ethos in their past behaviour. Some performers were initially reluctant to appear, and other high-profile acts turned down invitations to perform at the ceremony. [[NBC]] in the United States and [[Prime (New Zealand)|Prime TV]] in New Zealand were criticised by viewers for their broadcasts of the ceremony. There was also a concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] to close the Olympics, featuring [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[New Order (band)|New Order]], and [[The Specials]].<ref name=p4khyde>{{cite web|title=Blur, New Order to Play Olympics Closing Ceremony|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/45497-blur-new-order-to-play-olympics-closing-ceremony/|work=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=21 February 2012|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n{{2012 Summer Olympics}}\n\n==Production==\nThe creative director and choreographer was [[Kim Gavin]],<ref name=bbc>{{cite web|title=Profile: Kim Gavin, director of Olympic closing ceremony|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-19094398|work=[[BBC News]]|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kim Gavin: profile of Cultural Olympiad ceremony director|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/cultural-olympiad/8332914/Kim-Gavin-profile-of-Cultural-Olympiad-ceremony-director.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=11 August 2012}}</ref> with [[Es Devlin]] responsible for design and [[David Arnold]] as musical director.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2011/feb/18/kim-gavin-london-2012-closing-ceremonies|title=Kim Gavin named artistic director for London 2012 closing ceremonies|first=Amelia|last=Hill|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=24 February 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> When Arnold was announced in his role he said that doing the closing ceremony was an honour and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/cultural-olympiad/8332882/James-Bond-composer-David-Arnold-will-be-2012-musical-director.html|title=Bond composer will be 2012 musical director|date=18 February 2011|accessdate=1 March 2013|work=The Daily Telegraph}}</ref> while Gavin stated that he was really excited and honoured to be involved.

The audience then completed a 10-second countdown to the start of the ceremony, to the chimes of [[Big Ben]].  The arena had been transformed into a huge representation of the [[Union Flag]] in black and white, with ramps and famous London landmarks such as the [[London Eye]], Big Ben, [[Battersea Power Station]] and the [[30 St Mary Axe|Gherkin]]. Newspaper cutouts on both the set and road vehicles sought to show a \"day in the life of London\", with words from British literary figures such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom|Poet Laureate]] [[Carol Ann Duffy]].<ref name=\"Del Boy\"/>\n\n[[Emeli Sand\u00e9]] appeared on a truck and sang a verse and the chorus of \"[[Read All About It, Pt. III]]\". The Urban Voices Collective (the choir for the ceremony) sang [[The Beatles|The Beatles']] \"[[Because (The Beatles song)|Because]]\", which merged into cellist [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] (sitting upon the [[Royal Albert Hall]]) playing [[Elgar]]'s [[Salut d'amour]], accompanied by [[Stomp (dance troupe)|Stomp]] performing on household items such as pots, pans and dustbins while suspended on the sculptures of the landmarks.\n\n===God Save the Queen===\nAt the same time, [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Timothy Spall]]) appeared at the top of [[Elizabeth Tower|Big Ben]] and reprised Caliban's \"Be not afeard\" speech from ''[[The Tempest]]'', first read by [[Kenneth Branagh]] in the [[2012 Summer Olympics opening ceremony|opening ceremony]]. More paper-covered motor vehicles entered. After Churchill finished his speech, people dressed in newspaper print began to fill the arena, ranging from office workers to school children. The beat of the music got faster and noisier, symbolising the London rush hour.  As the noise reached a crescendo, Churchill cried out for all to stop, bringing this section to an end.\n\nPrince Henry of Wales ([[Prince Harry]]), representing the Queen, arrived with the President of the [[International Olympic Committee]] [[Jacques Rogge]]. The [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the Urban Voice Choir performed the [[God Save the Queen|national anthem of the United Kingdom]] whilst the Union flag was raised by the armed forces and the performers waved mini Union flags in the stadium. Once the flag was raised Hirst's artwork was revealed as the grey clouds were removed.\n\n===Street Party (21:09\u201321:20)===\nThis section started off with footage of [[Michael Caine]] in ''[[The Italian Job]]'' counting down from five, whereupon the [[Reliant Regal]] from ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' exploded with Del Boy and Rodney jumping out dressed as [[Batman]] and [[Robin (character)|Robin]].  Caine's words, \"You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off!\", echoed around the stadium. All the lorries had the newspaper removed and a colourful street party erupted, while [[Madness (band)|Madness]] performed \"[[Our House (Madness song)|Our House]]\". This was followed by the Massed Bands of the [[Household Division]] marching whilst playing [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s \"[[Parklife (song)|Parklife]]\". Entering on [[cycle rickshaw|rickshaws]], the [[Pet Shop Boys]] performed their hit \"[[West End Girls]]\", and then [[One Direction]] performed \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\" from the back of a lorry. Next there was another performance by Stomp.\n\n===Waterloo Sunset (21:20\u201321:30)===\nThe centre of the arena was then cleared to reveal ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' 2010 winners [[Spelbound]], who performed gymnastics to [[The Beatles]] \"[[A Day in the Life]]\", were inspired by the idea of a commuter on the way to work, by forming a bed and a London Bus. [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]] arrived in a [[Hackney carriage|black cab]] and played \"[[Waterloo Sunset]]\", as Spelbound continued and local school children formed the Thames.  The section closed with Sand\u00e9 reprising \"Read All About It (Pt. III)\" as a montage of athletes crying in victory or defeat was shown on the screens.\n\n===Parade of Athletes (21:30\u201321:53)===\n{{Main|2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony flag bearers}}\n[[File:Athletes at the 2012 Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|Olympic athletes assembled in the shape of the [[Union Flag]]]]\n[[Greece at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Greece]] led the Entrance of the Flags, as all 204 flags filed in to the strains of \"Parade of the Athletes\" (composed by Arnold) and marched up the central cross of the union flag, with [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] bringing up the rear. Meanwhile, volunteer marshals wearing blue suits and blue bowler hats with light bulbs on top marched into the stadium. The athletes then walked in from the several entrances, with some filtering down through the lower stands. At the same time [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] performed \"Open Arms\" and \"[[One Day Like This (song)|One Day Like This]]\". The volunteer marshals helped to usher the athletes into pens between the ramps of the arena. As the last athletes streamed into the stadium and the flags were moved by volunteers closer to the Olympic flame, a reprise of some of the songs from the opening section was played.\n\n===Here Comes the Sun (21:53\u201322:07)===\n16 [[dhol]] drummers opened this segment as the performers entered carrying 303 white boxes to symbolise every event in the Olympic Games. The drumming merged into the newly recorded version of [[Kate Bush]]'s \"[[Running Up that Hill#2012 remix|Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)]]\", as performers arranged the boxes to form a pyramid while video highlights from the previous 16 days of competition were shown on the screens.\n\nThis was followed by the victory ceremony for the [[Athletics at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's marathon|Men's Marathon]], by tradition the final medal ceremony of the Games. Rogge and [[Lamine Diack]], president of the [[International Association of Athletics Federations]], awarded the medals before the [[Oh Uganda, Land of Beauty|Ugandan national anthem]] was played.\n\nSix athletes including [[Katherine Grainger]] and [[Katie Taylor]] presented flowers to six volunteers in a symbolic recognition of the 70,000 volunteers' contribution to the Games.  This part of the ceremony was accompanied by The Beatles' \"[[Here Comes the Sun]]\".\n\n===A Symphony of British Music (22:07\u201323:21)===\n[[File:John Lennon face sculpture, 2012 London Olympics closing ceremony.jpg|thumb|A sculpture of the face of [[John Lennon]] at the closing ceremony.]]\nThe section commenced with Queen's \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" being played and a graphic equaliser being shown on the pixel screen.  [[John Lennon]] then appeared on the big screens and was joined by Liverpool Philharmonic Youth Choir and the Liverpool Signing Choir in singing \"[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]\" as a bust of Lennon's face was created. Balloons were released at the end of this and [[George Michael]] followed singing \"[[Freedom! '90]]\" and \"[[White Light (George Michael song)|White Light]]\" (one of his last public concert appearances). A group of [[Mod (subculture)|mods]] on [[Scooter (motorcycle)|scooters]] followed invading the arena; one of them carried [[Ricky Wilson (British musician)|Ricky Wilson]] to the stage where his band the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] proceeded to cover [[The Who|The Who's]] \"[[Pinball Wizard]]\"; during the song the scooters continued to circle the arena.

The proposed state includes the hill regions of the [[Darjeeling district]] and the Kalimpong and Duwars areas. A demand for a [[Proposed states and territories of India|separate administrative unit]] in [[Darjeeling district|Darjeeling]] has existed since 1909, when the Hillmen's Association of Darjeeling submitted a memorandum to [[Minto-Morley Reforms]] demanding a separate administrative setup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darjeelingtimes.com/opinions/political/1810-the-parliament-is-the-supreme-and-ultimate-authority-of-india.html |title=The Parliament is the supreme and ultimate authority of India |work=Darjeeling Times |date=23 November 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101132713/http://www.darjeelingtimes.com/opinions/political/1810-the-parliament-is-the-supreme-and-ultimate-authority-of-india.html |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Subhash Ghisingh]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thedarjeelingchronicle.com/subash-ghising-man-legend-legacy/|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> raised the demand for the creation of a state called Gorkhaland within India to be carved out of the hills of Darjeeling and areas of Dooars and Siliguri terai contiguous to Darjeeling. The Gorkhas have been demanding for separation from West Bengal since 1907 on the grounds that they are culturally, ethnically different from West Bengal .

The DGHC administered the Darjeeling hills for 23 years with some degree of autonomy.\n[[File:Gorkhaland map.jpg|thumb|Proposed map of Gorkhaland state in India]] \nA new violent movement for a separate state of Gorkhaland was started in 1986 by [[Gorkha National Liberation Front]] (GNLF) led by [[Subhash Ghisingh]]. The agitation ultimately led to the establishment of a semiautonomous body in 1988 called the [[Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council]] (DGHC) to govern certain areas of [[Darjeeling district]]. However, in 2007, a new party called the [[Gorkha Janmukti Morcha]] (GJM) raised the demand for a separate state of Gorkhaland once again.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/11/16/stories/2007111662691500.htm|title=Demand for Gorkhaland raised again|work=The Hindu|date=16 November 2007|accessdate=20 March 2012|location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nThe fourth DGHC elections were due in 2004. However, the government decided not to hold elections and instead made Subhash Ghisingh the sole caretaker of the DGHC till a new Sixth Schedule tribal council was established. Resentment among the former councillors of DGHC grew rapidly. Among them, [[Bimal Gurung]], once the trusted aide of Ghising, decided to break away from the GNLF. Riding on a mass support for [[Prashant Tamang]], an [[Indian Idol]] contestant from Darjeeling, Bimal quickly capitalized on the public support he received for supporting Prashant, and was able to overthrow Ghisingh from the seat of power.
