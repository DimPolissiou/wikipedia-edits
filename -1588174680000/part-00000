{"title_page": "Flyby anomaly", "text_new": "{{unsolved|physics|What causes the unexpected change in [[acceleration]] for [[gravitational slingshot|flybys]] of spacecraft?}}\n\nThe '''flyby anomaly''' is a discrepancy between current scientific models and the actual increase in speed (i.e. increase in ''[[kinetic energy]]'') observed during a [[gravity assist|planetary flyby]] (usually of Earth) by a spacecraft. In multiple cases, spacecraft have been observed to gain greater speed than scientists had predicted, but thus far no convincing explanation has been found. This anomaly has been observed as shifts in the [[s band|S-band]] and [[x band|X-band]] [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] and ranging [[telemetry]].  The largest discrepancy noticed during a flyby has been 13&nbsp;mm/s.<ref name=\"Rosetta\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=29609 |title=ESA's Rosetta spacecraft may help unravel cosmic mystery |date=November 12, 2009 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Observations==\n[[gravitational slingshot|Gravitational assists]] are valuable techniques for [[Timeline of Solar System exploration|Solar System exploration]]. Because the success of such flyby maneuvers depends on the exact geometry of the [[trajectory]], the position and velocity of a spacecraft during its encounter with a planet is continually tracked with great precision by the [[Deep Space Network]] (DSN).\n\n[[Image:AntreasianGuinn199803b.jpg|thumb|Range residuals during the Earth flyby of NEAR]]\n[[File:Mdis depart anot.ogv|thumb|During its flyby, MESSENGER did not observe any anomalies]]\n\nThe flyby anomaly was first noticed during a careful inspection of DSN Doppler data shortly after the Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] on 8 December 1990. While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66&nbsp;[[millihertz|mHz]] shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92&nbsp;mm/s at [[Apsis|perigee]]. Investigations of this effect at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the [[University of Texas]] have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. \n\nNo such anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303&nbsp;km.  However, the drag estimates had large error bars, and so an anomalous acceleration could not be ruled out.<ref name=\"GAL2\">{{cite journal |title=TRACKING GALILEO AT EARTH-2 PERIGEE USING THE TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM |author=C, Edwards, J. Anderson, P, Beyer, S. Bhaskaran, J. Borders, S. DiNardo, W. Folkner, R. Haw, S. Nandi, F. Nicholson, C. 0ttenhoff, S. Stephens |date=1993|citeseerx=10.1.1.38.4256 }}.  The two [measurement] methods yielded similar fits to the data. Within an uncertainty of eight percent, both methods yielded a decrease in velocity along track of \u22125.9\u00b10.2 mm/s. A priori predictions for the drag-induced velocity change, based on the Jacchia\u2013Roberts model, were \u22126.2\u00b14.O mm/s [5], clearly consistent with the observed velocity change. In contrast, DSN data from the December 1990 Earth flyby, at altitude 956 km, indicated an unexplained increase in along-track velocity of 4 mm/s, after accounting for the much smaller drag effects.  Given the uncertainty in drag models, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that a similar increase occurred at Earth 2. For example, an unmodeled increase of 4 mm/s and a drag decrease of \u221210 mm/s would be compatible with our results and our a priori atmospheric model. Significantly larger anomalous velocity increases, however, would appear inconsistent with the drag model.</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 1998 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR]]) spacecraft experienced an anomalous velocity increase of 13.46&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth encounter. [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] gained around 0.11&nbsp;mm/s in August 1999, and [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] gained 1.82&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth flyby in March 2005.\n\nAn analysis of the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft (studying [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) did not reveal any significant unexpected velocity increase. This may be because MESSENGER both approached and departed Earth symmetrically about the equator (see data and proposed equation below).  This suggests that the anomaly may be related to Earth's rotation.\n\nIn November 2009, ESA's [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta spacecraft]] was tracked closely during flyby in order to precisely measure its velocity, in an effort to gather further data about the anomaly, but no significant anomaly was found.<ref name=\"ESA\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nav.ei.tum.de/fileadmin/w00bkq/layout/colloquium_biele_slides.pdf |title=Navigation of the interplanetary Rosetta and Philae spacecraft and the determination of the gravitational field of comets and asteroids - (DLR) @ TU M\u00fcnchen, 2012 |author=J.

In multiple cases, spacecraft have been observed to gain greater speed than scientists had predicted, but thus far no convincing explanation has been found. This anomaly has been observed as shifts in the [[s band|S-band]] and [[x band|X-band]] [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] and ranging [[telemetry]].  The largest discrepancy noticed during a flyby has been 13&nbsp;mm/s.<ref name=\"Rosetta\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=29609 |title=ESA's Rosetta spacecraft may help unravel cosmic mystery |date=November 12, 2009 |publisher=European Space Agency |accessdate=13 March 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Observations==\n[[gravitational slingshot|Gravitational assists]] are valuable techniques for [[Timeline of Solar System exploration|Solar System exploration]]. Because the success of such flyby maneuvers depends on the exact geometry of the [[trajectory]], the position and velocity of a spacecraft during its encounter with a planet is continually tracked with great precision by the [[Deep Space Network]] (DSN).\n\n[[Image:AntreasianGuinn199803b.jpg|thumb|Range residuals during the Earth flyby of NEAR]]\n[[File:Mdis depart anot.ogv|thumb|During its flyby, MESSENGER did not observe any anomalies]]\n\nThe flyby anomaly was first noticed during a careful inspection of DSN Doppler data shortly after the Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] on 8 December 1990. While the Doppler residuals (observed minus computed data) were expected to remain flat, the analysis revealed an unexpected 66&nbsp;[[millihertz|mHz]] shift, which corresponds to a velocity increase of 3.92&nbsp;mm/s at [[Apsis|perigee]]. Investigations of this effect at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] (JPL), the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) and the [[University of Texas]] have not yielded a satisfactory explanation. \n\nNo such anomaly was detected after the second Earth flyby of the [[Galileo spacecraft]] in December 1992, where the measured velocity decrease matched that expected from atmospheric drag at the lower altitude of 303&nbsp;km.  However, the drag estimates had large error bars, and so an anomalous acceleration could not be ruled out.<ref name=\"GAL2\">{{cite journal |title=TRACKING GALILEO AT EARTH-2 PERIGEE USING THE TRACKING AND DATA RELAY SATELLITE SYSTEM |author=C, Edwards, J. Anderson, P, Beyer, S. Bhaskaran, J. Borders, S. DiNardo, W. Folkner, R. Haw, S. Nandi, F. Nicholson, C. 0ttenhoff, S. Stephens |date=1993|citeseerx=10.1.1.38.4256 }}.  The two [measurement] methods yielded similar fits to the data. Within an uncertainty of eight percent, both methods yielded a decrease in velocity along track of \u22125.9\u00b10.2 mm/s. A priori predictions for the drag-induced velocity change, based on the Jacchia\u2013Roberts model, were \u22126.2\u00b14.O mm/s [5], clearly consistent with the observed velocity change. In contrast, DSN data from the December 1990 Earth flyby, at altitude 956 km, indicated an unexplained increase in along-track velocity of 4 mm/s, after accounting for the much smaller drag effects.  Given the uncertainty in drag models, we cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that a similar increase occurred at Earth 2. For example, an unmodeled increase of 4 mm/s and a drag decrease of \u221210 mm/s would be compatible with our results and our a priori atmospheric model. Significantly larger anomalous velocity increases, however, would appear inconsistent with the drag model.</ref>\n\nOn 23 January 1998 the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous ([[NEAR]]) spacecraft experienced an anomalous velocity increase of 13.46&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth encounter. [[Cassini\u2013Huygens]] gained around 0.11&nbsp;mm/s in August 1999, and [[Rosetta space probe|Rosetta]] gained 1.82&nbsp;mm/s after its Earth flyby in March 2005.\n\nAn analysis of the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft (studying [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]) did not reveal any significant unexpected velocity increase. This may be because MESSENGER both approached and departed Earth symmetrically about the equator (see data and proposed equation below).  This suggests that the anomaly may be related to Earth's rotation.\n\nIn November 2009, ESA's [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|Rosetta spacecraft]] was tracked closely during flyby in order to precisely measure its velocity, in an effort to gather further data about the anomaly, but no significant anomaly was found.<ref name=\"ESA\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nav.ei.tum.de/fileadmin/w00bkq/layout/colloquium_biele_slides.pdf |title=Navigation of the interplanetary Rosetta and Philae spacecraft and the determination of the gravitational field of comets and asteroids - (DLR) @ TU M\u00fcnchen, 2012 |author=J.
