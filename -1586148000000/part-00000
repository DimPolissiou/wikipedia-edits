[[Riki Choshu]], head booker of [[NJPW]], was blamed for their departure and removed from his position by president [[Antonio Inoki]] in February. Furious with Inoki's decision to do this, Choshu left the promotion altogether in May 2002 and blasted both Inoki and chairman [[Tatsumi Fujinami]] in interviews. At the same time Mutoh had left NJPW, Choshu's longtime friend Katsuji Nagashima, who worked as a booker and head of NJPW's advertising department, had also left the company and formed his own agency, Nagashima Promotions, working with [[Pro Wrestling Zero1]] as a third party liaison to freelance wrestlers as well as a booking agency. Choshu proposed a partnership with Nagashima, and Nagashima Promotions was soon renamed \"The Riki Nagashima Project\". Shortly after this, the two began seeking a sponsor to fund their own promotion. They were backed by Seiji Fukuda, a well known entrepreneur from [[Hokkaido, Japan|Hokkaido]]. Fukuda joined their project as president and representative director, Nagashima became managing director, and Choshu became the director. In November, Choshu officially announced the formation of '''Fighting of World Japan Pro Wrestling''' in a press conference.\n\nWith WJ Pro Wrestling established, Choshu began seeking talent to sign to the newborn promotion. [[Kensuke Sasaki]], a trainee of Choshu and the former ace of NJPW, had grown disillusioned with New Japan's focus on [[MMA]] fighters over pro wrestlers, and announced his departure from NJPW in October 2002 once his contract expired in January. [[Shiro Koshinaka]], [[Kenzo Suzuki]] and referee Masao \"Tiger\" Hattori also announced they would not be renewing their contracts with New Japan in January, and the three committed to join WJ in December. [[Yoshiaki Yatsu]] (who had been Choshu's ally in New Japan, [[Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance]], and [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] in the 1980s), was also brought in as the head of the sales division, along with some of the talent from his regional SPWF promotion. Choshu filled his roster with young independent stars such as [[Tomohiro Ishii]] and [[Takashi Uwano]], freelancers such as [[Genichiro Tenryu]], [[Takao Omori]] and [[Atsushi Onita]], gaijin including [[Big Van Vader|Vader]], [[The Road Warriors]], [[\"Dr. Death\" Steve Williams]] and [[Big Vito]], and young American wrestlers such as Lex Lovett, [[Steve Madison]], [[The S.A.T.|The Maximos]], and [[The Shane Twins]]. Choshu himself also announced he would wrestle for the promotion, and booked himself into the main event of the first show against longtime rival Tenryu.\n\n=== Debut show and initial setbacks ===\n\nWith the roster established, WJ began planning its debut show for March 2003. It had originally been planned to debut in November 2002, however, Choshu had to wait until some of his wrestler's contracts with NJPW had expired, and as a result, WJ's debut show MAGMA01 was postponed many times. It eventually took place on March 1, 2003 in [[Yokohama Arena]], running the same day that [[Pro Wrestling Noah]] and [[K-1]] were also promoting major events in [[Nippon Budokan]] and [[Ariake Coliseum]], respectively. This was the only day a major arena could be booked in March, and Nagashima and Choshu could not postpone the debut any longer as they had already done so several times and lost bookings in other arenas as a result. Despite competition, MAGMA01 drew a respectable 13,000 fans to Yokohama, and the promotion soon set out on its first tour the same month. They suffered their first setback on that very tour, when Choshu himself was injured during the third match of his planned six-match series with Genichiro Tenryu and forced to pull out of all events for the foreseeable future. In addition, [[Atsushi Onita]] withdrew from all future events due to commitments to his political career. WJ began pushing [[Kensuke Sasaki]] as their top star, but struggled to gain a fanbase and attendance and interest soon began to dwindle. WJ struggled to turn a profit with any shows they ran, and Choshu's excessive spending soon became a problem; this had been a worry of investors for months, as Choshu had spent over \u00a5200 million ($1.8 million USD) before they had even ran a show on building a dojo, a tour bus, a new car for himself, and an expensive year-end party attended by many celebrities and high profile figures.\n\nA tournament took place in July to crown the first WMG (World Magma Greatest) Champion, won by Sasaki, but did not receive the belt until weeks later due to it remaining incomplete by the supplier.\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nOn July 28, 2003, MMA fighter turned pro wrestler [[Giant Ochiai]] was training under [[Kenzo Suzuki]] in the WJ dojo when he lost consciousness and eventually fell into a coma, dying of an [[acute subdural hematoma]] on August 8, 2003. Choshu, Nagashima and Suzuki were all present in the dojo when he lost consciousness, but none of them were charged in relation to his death. However, WJ faced severe media scrutiny for refusing to accept responsibility for the incident. \n\nIn the fallout of Ochiai's death, Kenzo Suzuki and Yoshiaki Yatsu both left the promotion, with Yatsu, in particular, blasting Choshu in interviews with the media, famously telling Nikkan Sports \"Riki Choshu has no idea how independent wrestling works\". WJ's numerous financial issues also became greater and greater public knowledge around this time; Choshu's spending had not slowed down, and he continued to make extravagant purchases with investors money, including sending \u00a51 million JPY a month to both of his daughters who were studying in the United Kingdom at the time. Numerous wrestlers began to claim they were owed money by Choshu, with [[Kensuke Sasaki]] putting up \u00a55 million of his own money and cancelling his life insurance to help continue to promote events. WJ's unpaid salaries were later parodied in the promotion, with [[Shiro Koshinaka]] forming the \"Labour Union\" stable and feuding with Choshu in kayfabe over his numerous debts to them.\n\nIn a bid to recoup money and replicate the success of [[Pride FC]] and [[K-1]], Choshu announced \"X1\" in September, a sister MMA promotion of WJ which drew some attention after they announced [[Katsuhiko Nakajima]], then 15 years old, would debut as the youngest MMA fighter ever on the card. Despite the attention, the show was heavily panned by fans who criticised the inexperienced fighters and low level of competition. In addition to this, the cage itself began to collapse during the show and had to be held up by ringside assistants during the last fights. Choshu himself walked out on the event and refused to talk to media before the end of the show, to the anger of Sasaki and Nagashima.\n\n=== Closure ===\nAfter the colossal failure of X1, many WJ events would be promoted and then suddenly cancelled just days before; it was later revealed that Nagashima had either lied about booking the venues or not paid the money owed to hire them, and when he was unable to secure them, simply cancelled the events. The most infamous of these happened on October 22, 2003, when WJ had announced they were running Korakuen Hall; however, it was quickly pointed out that a boxing show was scheduled to take place in Korakuen on that day and Nagashima had once again lied about the booking. \n\nBy the end of 2003, Shiro Koshinaka and Takao Omori had both left for other organisations, and WJ's ace Kensuke Sasaki returned to NJPW in December. The failure of WJ severely damaged the former close relationship between Sasaki and Choshu; Sasaki lost over \u00a55 million JPY and cancelled his life insurance to fund WJ events, leading to he and his wife [[Akira Hokuto]] facing severe money issues in late 2003 and Sasaki having to work up to two independent shows a day just to support his family. \n\nWorld Japan was ultimately viewed by Japanese fans as just another independent promotion in the saturated world of pro wrestling, so it was not able to make a dent in the major promotions' fanbases. It officially closed in mid-2004 and was eventually succeeded by Riki Pro, a small-time independent promotion that mainly ran in Korakuen Hall.\n\n==Championships==\n===World Magma the Greatest Championship===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Wrestler:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=3%|'''Reigns:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=17%|'''Date:''' \n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Place:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=40%|'''Notes:'''\n|-\n|[[Kensuke Sasaki]]\n|1\n|July 20, 2003\n|[[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]\n|Defeated [[Kenzo Suzuki]] in a tournament final to win the title; vacated title in December 2003 when he left the promotion<ref>{{cite web|title=World Magma the Greatest Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/others/wmg-s.html|accessdate=2009-12-30|publisher=Wrestling Titles}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===World Magma the Greatest Tag Team Championship===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Wrestlers:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=3%|'''Reigns:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=17%|'''Date:''' \n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Place:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=40%|'''Notes:'''\n|-\n|[[Riki Choshu]] & [[Genichiro Tenryu]]\n|1\n|August 21, 2003\n|[[Osaka]], [[Japan]]\n|Defeated [[Shiro Koshinaka]] and [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] in a tournament final to win the title; vacated title in 2004 due to lack of defenses<ref name=tag>{{cite web|title=World Magma the Greatest Tag Team Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/others/wmg-t.html|accessdate=2009-12-30|publisher=Wrestling Titles}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Kintaro Kanemura]] & Badboy Hido\n|1\n|August 19, 2004\n|Osaka, Japan\n|Defeated [[Tomohiro Ishii]] and [[Kendo Kashin]] to win the vacant title; title vacated when team split up<ref name=tag/>\n|-\n|Tetsuhiro Kuroda & Badboy Hido {{small|(2)}}\n|1\n|April 16, 2005\n|[[Tokyo]], Japan\n|Defeated Kanemura and Ishii to win vacant title<ref name=tag/>\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan}}\n*[[Professional wrestling in Japan]]\n*[[List of professional wrestling promotions in Japan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Professional wrestling in Japan}}\n\n[[Category:Japanese professional wrestling promotions]]\n[[Category:2003 establishments in Japan]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Professional wrestling promotion}}\n{{Infobox wrestling promotion\n|name        = Fighting of World Japan Pro Wrestling\n|image       = File:201\uff13 WJ\u30d7\u30ed\u30ec\u30b9.jpg\n|caption     =\n|acronym     = WJ\n|established = 2002\n|folded      = 2003\n|style       = [[Puroresu]]\n|location    =\n|founder     = [[Riki Choshu]]<br />Katsuji Nagashima\n|owner       = Riki Choshu<br />Katsuji Nagashima\n|parent      =\n|sister      =\n|formerly    =\n|website     =\n}}\n'''Fighting of World Japan Pro-Wrestling''', frequently shortened to '''World Japan''' or '''WJ''' was a [[professional wrestling]] [[professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] formed in Japan in 2002 by former [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] employees [[Riki Choshu]] and Katsuji Nagashima.\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation ===\nIn January 2002, [[New Japan Pro Wrestling]] (NJPW) ace [[Keiji Mutoh]] left the promotion, jumping to rival [[All Japan Pro Wrestling]] (AJPW) along with [[Satoshi Kojima]] and [[Kendo Kashin]].

This was the only day a major arena could be booked in March, and Nagashima and Choshu could not postpone the debut any longer as they had already done so several times and lost bookings in other arenas as a result. Despite competition, MAGMA01 drew a respectable 13,000 fans to Yokohama, and the promotion soon set out on its first tour the same month. They suffered their first setback on that very tour, when Choshu himself was injured during the third match of his planned six-match series with Genichiro Tenryu and forced to pull out of all events for the foreseeable future. In addition, [[Atsushi Onita]] withdrew from all future events due to commitments to his political career. WJ began pushing [[Kensuke Sasaki]] as their top star, but struggled to gain a fanbase and attendance and interest soon began to dwindle. WJ struggled to turn a profit with any shows they ran, and Choshu's excessive spending soon became a problem; this had been a worry of investors for months, as Choshu had spent over \u00a5200 million ($1.8 million USD) before they had even ran a show on building a dojo, a tour bus, a new car for himself, and an expensive year-end party attended by many celebrities and high profile figures.\n\nA tournament took place in July to crown the first WMG (World Magma Greatest) Champion, won by Sasaki, but did not receive the belt until weeks later due to it remaining incomplete by the supplier.\n\n=== Decline ===\n\nOn July 28, 2003, MMA fighter turned pro wrestler [[Giant Ochiai]] was training under [[Kenzo Suzuki]] in the WJ dojo when he lost consciousness and eventually fell into a coma, dying of an [[acute subdural hematoma]] on August 8, 2003. Choshu, Nagashima and Suzuki were all present in the dojo when he lost consciousness, but none of them were charged in relation to his death. However, WJ faced severe media scrutiny for refusing to accept responsibility for the incident. \n\nIn the fallout of Ochiai's death, Kenzo Suzuki and Yoshiaki Yatsu both left the promotion, with Yatsu, in particular, blasting Choshu in interviews with the media, famously telling Nikkan Sports \"Riki Choshu has no idea how independent wrestling works\". WJ's numerous financial issues also became greater and greater public knowledge around this time; Choshu's spending had not slowed down, and he continued to make extravagant purchases with investors money, including sending \u00a51 million JPY a month to both of his daughters who were studying in the United Kingdom at the time. Numerous wrestlers began to claim they were owed money by Choshu, with [[Kensuke Sasaki]] putting up \u00a55 million of his own money and cancelling his life insurance to help continue to promote events. WJ's unpaid salaries were later parodied in the promotion, with [[Shiro Koshinaka]] forming the \"Labour Union\" stable and feuding with Choshu in kayfabe over his numerous debts to them.\n\nIn a bid to recoup money and replicate the success of [[Pride FC]] and [[K-1]], Choshu announced \"X1\" in September, a sister MMA promotion of WJ which drew some attention after they announced [[Katsuhiko Nakajima]], then 15 years old, would debut as the youngest MMA fighter ever on the card. Despite the attention, the show was heavily panned by fans who criticised the inexperienced fighters and low level of competition. In addition to this, the cage itself began to collapse during the show and had to be held up by ringside assistants during the last fights. Choshu himself walked out on the event and refused to talk to media before the end of the show, to the anger of Sasaki and Nagashima.\n\n=== Closure ===\nAfter the colossal failure of X1, many WJ events would be promoted and then suddenly cancelled just days before; it was later revealed that Nagashima had either lied about booking the venues or not paid the money owed to hire them, and when he was unable to secure them, simply cancelled the events. The most infamous of these happened on October 22, 2003, when WJ had announced they were running Korakuen Hall; however, it was quickly pointed out that a boxing show was scheduled to take place in Korakuen on that day and Nagashima had once again lied about the booking. \n\nBy the end of 2003, Shiro Koshinaka and Takao Omori had both left for other organisations, and WJ's ace Kensuke Sasaki returned to NJPW in December. The failure of WJ severely damaged the former close relationship between Sasaki and Choshu; Sasaki lost over \u00a55 million JPY and cancelled his life insurance to fund WJ events, leading to he and his wife [[Akira Hokuto]] facing severe money issues in late 2003 and Sasaki having to work up to two independent shows a day just to support his family. \n\nWorld Japan was ultimately viewed by Japanese fans as just another independent promotion in the saturated world of pro wrestling, so it was not able to make a dent in the major promotions' fanbases. It officially closed in mid-2004 and was eventually succeeded by Riki Pro, a small-time independent promotion that mainly ran in Korakuen Hall.\n\n==Championships==\n===World Magma the Greatest Championship===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Wrestler:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=3%|'''Reigns:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=17%|'''Date:''' \n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Place:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=40%|'''Notes:'''\n|-\n|[[Kensuke Sasaki]]\n|1\n|July 20, 2003\n|[[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]\n|Defeated [[Kenzo Suzuki]] in a tournament final to win the title; vacated title in December 2003 when he left the promotion<ref>{{cite web|title=World Magma the Greatest Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/others/wmg-s.html|accessdate=2009-12-30|publisher=Wrestling Titles}}</ref>\n|}\n\n===World Magma the Greatest Tag Team Championship===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Wrestlers:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=3%|'''Reigns:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=17%|'''Date:''' \n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=20%|'''Place:'''\n!style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\" width=40%|'''Notes:'''\n|-\n|[[Riki Choshu]] & [[Genichiro Tenryu]]\n|1\n|August 21, 2003\n|[[Osaka]], [[Japan]]\n|Defeated [[Shiro Koshinaka]] and [[Jinsei Shinzaki]] in a tournament final to win the title; vacated title in 2004 due to lack of defenses<ref name=tag>{{cite web|title=World Magma the Greatest Tag Team Title|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/japan/others/wmg-t.html|accessdate=2009-12-30|publisher=Wrestling Titles}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Kintaro Kanemura]] & Badboy Hido\n|1\n|August 19, 2004\n|Osaka, Japan\n|Defeated [[Tomohiro Ishii]] and [[Kendo Kashin]] to win the vacant title; title vacated when team split up<ref name=tag/>\n|-\n|Tetsuhiro Kuroda & Badboy Hido {{small|(2)}}\n|1\n|April 16, 2005\n|[[Tokyo]], Japan\n|Defeated Kanemura and Ishii to win vacant title<ref name=tag/>\n|}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Japan}}\n*[[Professional wrestling in Japan]]\n*[[List of professional wrestling promotions in Japan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Professional wrestling in Japan}}\n\n[[Category:Japanese professional wrestling promotions]]\n[[Category:2003 establishments in Japan]]\n", "name_user": "Premeditated Chaos", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing link(s):Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lex Lovettclosed as soft delete (XFDcloser)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_of_World_Japan_Pro_Wrestling"}

He also had a successful career in semi-professional football playing in the New England Football League. He played five seasons with the New England Stars becoming a 2-time NEFL All-Pro and named \"Special Teams player of the Year\" in 2000.\n\nDellaGatta was a longtime star of [[NWA New England]] and, following [[Tony Rumble]]'s death in 1999, adopted the \"Boston Bad Boy\" [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] in honor of his mentor. He was promoted as Tony's [[kayfabe]] son, at the request of the Magliaro family, and considered the \"face\" of the company for much of its remaining seven years in operation. DellaGatta also briefly served as the [[booker (professional wrestling)|booker]] for NWA New England, succeeding Jeff Katz and [[Knuckles Nelson]], and headed a second incarnation of Tony Rumble's [[heel (professional wrestling)|\"heel\"]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] '''[[The Brotherhood (professional wrestling)|The Brotherhood]]''' consisting of himself, [[Rick Fuller]], and The DarkAngel. He has held the [[NWA New England Heavyweight Championship]] (3 times), [[NWA New England Junior Heavyweight Championship]] (5 times), [[NWA New England X Division Championship]] (1 time), and [[NWA New England Tag Team Championship]] (2 times) with [[Slyck Wagner Brown]] and Luis Ortiz;<ref name=\"Mindbender\">{{cite web |url=http://mindbenders.ca/wrestling/R.htm |title=Mindbender's Wrestling Greats: \"R\" |accessdate=2010-04-28 |author=Simpson, Greg |authorlink= |work=Mindbenders Wrestling Greats |publisher=Mindbenders.ca |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> at the [[Tony Rumble Memorial Show|2005 Tony Rumble Memorial Show]], he won the Heavyweight, Cruiserweight, and Division X titles.\n\nA former 3-time [[NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship|NWA World Junior Heavyweight Champion]], DellaGatta was considered one of the top [[cruiserweight (professional wrestling)|light heavyweight]] wrestlers in the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] during the 2000s. He represented NWA New England at the [[NWA Anniversary Show]]s from 2000 to 2005, headlining three of his five appearances. In addition, he competed in the [[Jersey J-Cup#2002|2002 Jersey J-Cup]] as well as participating in international tours to Canada and the United Kingdom. DellaGatta also had brief stints in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], participating in the WWE's [[Master Lock Challenge]] during 2005.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, DellaGatta teamed with Darling Damon as The Crown Jewels in [[New England Championship Wrestling]] and [[List of NWA territories|NWA On Fire]] winning the tag team titles in both promotions; they held the [[NECW Tag Team Championship]] for 15 months making them the longest reigning champions in the company's history. They proved to be a controversial duo, especially given the \"[[family friendly]]\" style of the former company, as two [[metrosexual|\"flamboyant\"]] men whose ring style was similar to the [[Christopher Street Connection]] or [[WWE]]'s [[Billy and Chuck]]. They were joined by \"Mr. Fabulous\" Tony Ulysses, who employed a similar persona in [[Killer Kowalski]]'s All Star Wrestling during the 1980s, as their stylist and lifestyle consultant.\n\nIn recent years, DellaGatta has been closely associated with Victory Championship Wrestling, a member of the recently revived Century Wrestling Alliance. In 2010, he and several other wrestlers established the Bell Time Club, a private social club and training facility open to both pro wrestlers and members of the public, which runs wrestling events though VCW.\n\nHe's also had a brand new fascination with Cocoa Puffs.\n\nIn 2016, Rumble returned to Independent Wrestling Entertainment in Brewer,  Maine as the new booker and head trainer for the Cruiserweight Division.\n\nJason Rumble also has been making appearances for Canadian Wrestling Promotions in New Brunswick, Canada since 2016 for NWE Pro Wrestling and Mainstream Wrestling NB.\n\n==Early life==\nA native of [[Malden, Massachusetts]], Jason DellaGatta was born to Joseph R. Dellagatta and Mary Kelliher. He was extensively involved in [[little league]] and [[Amateur baseball in the United States#School baseball|high school baseball]], [[High school basketball|basketball]], and [[High school football|football]] throughout his childhood. After his graduation from [[Malden High School]] in 1992, DellaGatta initially worked for a local [[moving company]] while continuing to compete [[amateur sports]]. He formed his own team to play in a Boston night league around 1994. Their performance in the league, consisting primarily of [[college football]] players, impressed a scout from a semi-professional football organization, the New England Football League. DellaGatta and several of his teammates were eventually recruited with DellaGatta playing for the New England Stars. He would go on to play five seasons with the league becoming a 2-time NEFL All-Pro, the equivalent of an [[All-star game|All-Star player]], and named \"[[Special teams]] player of the Year\" in his final season. He also developed a close friendship with league owner Joe Monaco.<ref name=\"OTS\">{{Cite episode|title=On The Spot |url=http://blip.tv/onthespot/on-the-spot-with-host-chris-bartolo-3453334 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130418172859/http://blip.tv/onthespot/on-the-spot-with-host-chris-bartolo-3453334 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 18, 2013 |credits=Presenter: Chris Bartolo |series=On the spot with host Chris Bartolo |network=[[Blip.tv]] |station=MATV |date=April 2, 2010 |minutes=58:50 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career===\nIt was while playing for the NEFL that, at age 25, he began working out at the famed Malden Square training facility run by [[Killer Kowalski|Water \"Killer\" Kowalski]]. DellaGatta later admitted that he had regularly walked past the building while attending Malden High and, despite being a wrestling fan, was unaware that it was a wrestling school. He often attended [[World Wrestling Federation]] events at the old [[Boston Garden]] during the 1980s and considered [[Jimmy Snuka|\"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka]] a childhood hero. He often watched the Savoldi family's [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|International Championship Wrestling]] and later became a fan of the [[Century Wrestling Alliance]], the predecessor of [[NWA New England]]. He first gave serious thought to becoming a pro wrestler after attending his first-ever CWA live event in [[Revere, Massachusetts]]. A gifted student, DellaGatta completed his training under Kowalski within four months<ref name=\"OTS\"/> and made his pro debut as \"Jason Rage\" on February 14, 1997. He continued working at Kowalski's \"Institute of Professional Wrestling\", as did many New England independent wrestlers, for years afterwards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnrodeo.com/archives/archive.html |title=Sunday, September 23, 2001 |author=Rodeo, John |work=The Hollywood Grapevine Archive |publisher=JohnRodeo.com |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128093318/http://www.johnrodeo.com/archives/archive.html |archive-date=November 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn the five years he played semi-pro football, DellaGatta was offered tryouts with [[Canadian Football League]], [[National Football League]], and the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]]. A broken collarbone suffered while playing football put a sudden stop to his wrestling career after four months, and kept him out of action for the next six months. Worried that future injuries might hurt his pro wrestling career, he decided to retire from the NEFL to wrestle full-time. A year after his debut Kowalski arranged for DellaGatta to wrestle his first major opponent, [[Tony Atlas|\"Mr. USA\" Tony Atlas]]. He also started traveling to Maine two to three times a month<ref name=\"OTS\"/> to wrestle for Eastern Wrestling Alliance<ref>{{cite video | people=Eastern Wrestling Alliance (Producer) | date=1999 | title=1999 EWA CHAMPIONSHIP WRESTLING TV | url=http://www.tctapes.net/ewatv.htm | medium=VHS | location=Maine | publisher=TCTapes.net}}</ref> and later on appeared in other states such as the Florida-based [[Future of Wrestling]] promotion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futureofwrestling.com/htm/results.htm |title=Results |author=Future of Wrestling |authorlink=Future of Wrestling |publisher=FutureofWrestling.com |accessdate=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809141728/http://www.futureofwrestling.com/htm/results.htm |archivedate=August 9, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===NWA New England (1999-2000)===\nIt was during this period that many of Kowalski's students were now competing in the local independent circuit and DellaGatta found it difficult to get booked after returning from his collarbone injury. A Malden basketball coach, who also trained at Kowalski's school as Tre the Smooth Operating Gangsta, recommended DellaGatta when [[Tony Rumble]] was looking for talent for the newly established [[NWA New England]]; DellaGatta has since credited his old coach whose introduction led to the close relationship he later enjoyed with Rumble and his family.<ref name=\"OTS\"/>\n\nDellaGatta began wrestling for the promotion in early 1999.

It is the first such club opened to members of the general public.\n\nThe club was officially established on February 8, 2010, and held a free exhibition show at the Everett Rec Center a few weeks later.

He also had a successful career in semi-professional football playing in the New England Football League. He played five seasons with the New England Stars becoming a 2-time NEFL All-Pro and named \"Special Teams player of the Year\" in 2000.\n\nDellaGatta was a longtime star of [[NWA New England]] and, following [[Tony Rumble]]'s death in 1999, adopted the \"Boston Bad Boy\" [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] in honor of his mentor. He was promoted as Tony's [[kayfabe]] son, at the request of the Magliaro family, and considered the \"face\" of the company for much of its remaining seven years in operation. DellaGatta also briefly served as the [[booker (professional wrestling)|booker]] for NWA New England, succeeding Jeff Katz and [[Knuckles Nelson]], and headed a second incarnation of Tony Rumble's [[heel (professional wrestling)|\"heel\"]] [[stable (professional wrestling)|stable]] '''[[The Brotherhood (professional wrestling)|The Brotherhood]]''' consisting of himself, [[Rick Fuller]], and The DarkAngel.

He represented NWA New England at the [[NWA Anniversary Show]]s from 2000 to 2005, headlining three of his five appearances. In addition, he competed in the [[Jersey J-Cup#2002|2002 Jersey J-Cup]] as well as participating in international tours to Canada and the United Kingdom. DellaGatta also had brief stints in [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] and [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], participating in the WWE's [[Master Lock Challenge]] during 2005.\n\nFrom 2008 to 2010, DellaGatta teamed with Darling Damon as The Crown Jewels in [[New England Championship Wrestling]] and [[List of NWA territories|NWA On Fire]] winning the tag team titles in both promotions; they held the [[NECW Tag Team Championship]] for 15 months making them the longest reigning champions in the company's history. They proved to be a controversial duo, especially given the \"[[family friendly]]\" style of the former company, as two [[metrosexual|\"flamboyant\"]] men whose ring style was similar to the [[Christopher Street Connection]] or [[WWE]]'s [[Billy and Chuck]]. They were joined by \"Mr. Fabulous\" Tony Ulysses, who employed a similar persona in [[Killer Kowalski]]'s All Star Wrestling during the 1980s, as their stylist and lifestyle consultant.\n\nIn recent years, DellaGatta has been closely associated with Victory Championship Wrestling, a member of the recently revived Century Wrestling Alliance. In 2010, he and several other wrestlers established the Bell Time Club, a private social club and training facility open to both pro wrestlers and members of the public, which runs wrestling events though VCW.\n\nHe's also had a brand new fascination with Cocoa Puffs.\n\nIn 2016, Rumble returned to Independent Wrestling Entertainment in Brewer,  Maine as the new booker and head trainer for the Cruiserweight Division.\n\nJason Rumble also has been making appearances for Canadian Wrestling Promotions in New Brunswick, Canada since 2016 for NWE Pro Wrestling and Mainstream Wrestling NB.\n\n==Early life==\nA native of [[Malden, Massachusetts]], Jason DellaGatta was born to Joseph R. Dellagatta and Mary Kelliher. He was extensively involved in [[little league]] and [[Amateur baseball in the United States#School baseball|high school baseball]], [[High school basketball|basketball]], and [[High school football|football]] throughout his childhood. After his graduation from [[Malden High School]] in 1992, DellaGatta initially worked for a local [[moving company]] while continuing to compete [[amateur sports]]. He formed his own team to play in a Boston night league around 1994. Their performance in the league, consisting primarily of [[college football]] players, impressed a scout from a semi-professional football organization, the New England Football League. DellaGatta and several of his teammates were eventually recruited with DellaGatta playing for the New England Stars. He would go on to play five seasons with the league becoming a 2-time NEFL All-Pro, the equivalent of an [[All-star game|All-Star player]], and named \"[[Special teams]] player of the Year\" in his final season. He also developed a close friendship with league owner Joe Monaco.<ref name=\"OTS\">{{Cite episode|title=On The Spot |url=http://blip.tv/onthespot/on-the-spot-with-host-chris-bartolo-3453334 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130418172859/http://blip.tv/onthespot/on-the-spot-with-host-chris-bartolo-3453334 |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 18, 2013 |credits=Presenter: Chris Bartolo |series=On the spot with host Chris Bartolo |network=[[Blip.tv]] |station=MATV |date=April 2, 2010 |minutes=58:50 }}</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n\n===Early career===\nIt was while playing for the NEFL that, at age 25, he began working out at the famed Malden Square training facility run by [[Killer Kowalski|Water \"Killer\" Kowalski]]. DellaGatta later admitted that he had regularly walked past the building while attending Malden High and, despite being a wrestling fan, was unaware that it was a wrestling school. He often attended [[World Wrestling Federation]] events at the old [[Boston Garden]] during the 1980s and considered [[Jimmy Snuka|\"Superfly\" Jimmy Snuka]] a childhood hero. He often watched the Savoldi family's [[International World Class Championship Wrestling|International Championship Wrestling]] and later became a fan of the [[Century Wrestling Alliance]], the predecessor of [[NWA New England]]. He first gave serious thought to becoming a pro wrestler after attending his first-ever CWA live event in [[Revere, Massachusetts]]. A gifted student, DellaGatta completed his training under Kowalski within four months<ref name=\"OTS\"/> and made his pro debut as \"Jason Rage\" on February 14, 1997.

Chamberlain High School]], lettering four years in baseball. Madison was offered several baseball scholarships to small colleges, but turned them down to start wrestling. Steve decided to attend the [[University of South Florida]] while starting his professional wrestling training. Favata was scheduled to finish his degree in [[business administration]] in the fall of 2006.\n\nHis wrestling training started in the summer of 2001 with current WWE Talent Agent [[Steve Keirn]] and [[Jimmy Del Ray]] of the tag team, [[The Heavenly Bodies]]. Steve adopted the \"Madison\" last name over a lunch meeting with former NWA President Howard Brody, after deciding that the last name \"Favata\" would not suit him well in the wrestling business.\n\nOn December 28, 2001, Madison wrestled future tag team partner Lex Lovett at a house show for [[Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling]], a [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-based promotion owned by [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], and was pinned by Lovett after a modified DDT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/articles/100964598788416.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020210233945/http://www.lordsofpain.net/news/articles/100964598788416.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-02-10 |title=Turnbuckle Championship Wrestling Results from Deland, Florida 12-28-01 |access-date= |author=Wilen, Jeff |authorlink= |author2=Calvin Martin |date=2001-12-28 |work= |publisher=LordsOfPain.net |pages= |language= |quote= |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn November 2002, Madison and David Babylon were the co-winners of an interpromotional [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|NWA Florida]] vs. [[Future of Wrestling]] [[battle royal]] in which the winners would receive a title shot against the NWA Florida Unified Cruiserweight Champion Naphtali.

Looking for younger American wrestlers unfamiliar to Japanese fans, Choshu had become interested in several students from Keirn's wrestling school. [[Tiger Hattori]], the American booker for Fighting World of Japan, had visited the school scouting for wrestlers to tour the country.

During his brief stint, he wrestled against [[Glacier (wrestler)|Glacier]] and teamed with [[Nick Dinsmore]] against [[Joseph James, Jr.|Scott]] and [[Steve Armstrong]]. During a match with [[Scott Hall (wrestler)|Scott Hall]], he was attacked by members of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Returning to the independent circuit the following year, he participated in the [[ECWA Super 8 Tournament#2001|2001 ECWA Super 8 Tournament]] losing to [[Chikara (professional wrestling)|Reckless Youth]] in the opening rounds. His performance in the tournament later resulted in [[East Coast Wrestling Alliance]] promoter [[Jim Ketner]] and announcer [[Kevin Kelly (announcer)|Kevin Kelly]] to arrange a tryout match for the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] later facing [[Low Ki]] at [[Madison Square Garden]]. He would appear on ''[[WWF Jakked/Metal|WWF Jakked]]'' three times between 2000 and 2001 facing [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]], [[Bob Holly|Hardcore Holly]] and [[Test (wrestler)|Test]]. He also took part in television tapings for Jimmy Hart's [[X Wrestling Federation]] in matches against [[Jerry Tuite|The Wall]] and [[Lenny Lane]].\n\n===Return to Florida===\nCompeting under his real name, he eventually returned to IPW Hardcore where he regained the IPW Heavyweight Championship winning the title a record four times. He also made several unsuccessful attempts to win the [[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]]. When the title was vacant in November 2000, he lost to Buck Quartermain in a four-way match with Pepe Prado and Scoot Andrews on January 23, 2001. Three months later, he and Buck Quartermain lost their titles to Scoot Andrews who became a triple crown winner with the IPW, FOW and NWA Florida Heavyweight Championships. At the [[NWA Anniversary Show#2001|NWA 53rd Anniversary show]] in St. Petersburg on October 13, he and Andrews took part in the main event, an interpromotional match between IPW Hardcore and NWA Florida, which had (Scoot Andrews, Mike Sullivan, Jet Jaguar, Chaos and The [[Shane Twins]]) in a \"[[WarGames match|Wargames]]\"-style match against Team NWA Florida (Buck Q, Rod Steel, [[Lex Lovett]] and [[The Heavenly Bodies#DeNucci and Nelson|The New Heavenly Bodies]]). The match ended in a no-contest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive2001/oct14_nwa-can.html|title=SLAM!

During an interpromotional event between IPW Hardcore and NWA Florida held at the [[Fort Homer W. Hesterly Armory]] on April 24, 2001, he and Andrews defeated NWA Florida's Pepe Prado and Billy Fives. After the match, they turned ''\"[[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]\"'' upset at the fans who were cheering for the Strong Brothers while they were ''\"[[Face (professional wrestling)|babyfaces]]\"''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrestlingclassics.com/radio.html|title=NWA Title Change play-by-play and complete supercard coverage|author=Ringside Live|date=2001-04-28|work=([[Podcast]])|publisher=WrestlingClassics.com}}</ref><ref>McNeill, Pat.

The two eventually defeated the Strong Brothers for the titles in a steel cage match at the supercard ''Extreme Intentions'' on September 20, 2002. The following month at ''No More Games'', he and Andrews defeated The Shane Twins ([[Mike Shane|Mike]] and [[Todd Shane]]) to unify the IPW and NWA Florida Tag Team Championship on October 11, 2002. He and Andrews were scheduled to meet the Shane Twins at ''Valentine's Massacre'' on February 8, 2003. Sullivan was unable to compete due to a family emergency, however, and he was replaced by referee turned wrestler Mikey Tenderfoot and lost the unified titles to the Shane Twins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alanwojcik.tripod.com/archives/id5.html|title=Interview with Mike Sullivan|author=Wojcik, Alan|date=February 2003|work=Alan Wojcik Archives|publisher=AlanWojcik.com}}</ref>\n\nHe and Andrews became founding members of the Alliance of Defiance with Billy Fives, Rod Steel and later Sullivan's valet Jenni Lee. Defeated Rod Steel to become the number one contender for the NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship, he also won a five-way match between Sedrick Strong, David Babylon, [[Lex Lovett]] and [[Danny Doring]] on February 28, 2004. After pursuing him for over three months, Sullivan finally defeated [[Steve Corino]] for the title on March 20. He was forced to vacate the title five months later due to injury.\n\nAt a NWA Florida card, Sullivan faced Scoot Andrews and Billy Fives in a three-way match on February 26, 2005 and which went to a 30 min. time limit draw. This was Andrews final match as he had officially announced his retirement earlier that night. Later that year, he defeated Lex Lovett, Buck Quartermain and Bruce Steel in a four-way match at an IPW Hardcore show on September 17.\n\nOn December 17, he made his debut for Elite Wrestling Entertainment and fought to a no-contest with Buck Quartermain. During early 2006, Sullivan faced Donovan Morgan and Steve Madison and, on April 28, he defeated [[D'Lo Brown]] in a grudge match and who was accompanied by Scoot Andrews in Brown's corner.\n\n==Championships and accomplishments==\n*'''Independent Pro Wrestling'''\n:*IPW Heavyweight Championship (4 times)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/htipw2.html|title=Independent Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Title History|author=Westcott, Brian|author2=Kriss Knights|year=2003|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n:*IPW Tag Team Championship (2 times) - with Buck Quartermain and Scoot Andrews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/ttipw2.html|title=Independent Pro Wrestling Heavyweight Title History|author=Westcott, Brian|year=2003|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n\n*'''Future of Wrestling'''\n:*[[FOW Heavyweight Championship]] (1 time)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solie.org/titlehistories/htfow.html|title=FOW Heavyweight Title History|year=2002|publisher=Solie's Title Histories}}</ref>\n\n*'''[[National Wrestling Alliance|NWA Florida]]'''\n:*[[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship]] ([[NWA Florida Tag Team Championship#Title history|1 time]]) - with Scoot Andrews<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/fl/fl-t.html|title=Florida Tag Team Title|year=2003|publisher=Puroresu Dojo}}</ref>\n:*[[NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Florida version)|NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship ''(Florida version)'']] ([[NWA Southern Heavyweight Championship (Florida version)#Title history|1 time]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/nwa/others/south-h.html|title=N.W.A.

The other being for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] between the champions, [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] ([[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] and [[James Storm]]) (AMW), and [[Kid Kash]] and [[Lance Hoyt]]; AMW claimed victory in the match.\n\nThe event marked the debut of the Full Metal Mayhem match, which later became one of TNA's most successful [[Professional wrestling match types|match types]]. The professional wrestling section of the ''[[Canadian Online Explorer]]'' website rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 stars, which was the same rating as the [[Against All Odds (2006)|2006 event]].\n\nIn October 2017, with the launch of the [[Global Wrestling Network]], the event became available to stream on demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/fighting/article178087906.html|title=Anthem, Impact announce Global Wrestling Network launch|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe event featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, [[Plot (narrative)|plots]], and [[Narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] or [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]] in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe main event at Against All Odds was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which Jeff Jarrett defended the championship against his on-screen rival Kevin Nash.

Styles]], and the challenger, [[Christopher Daniels]], in a thirty-minute [[Iron Man match]]. An Iron Man match involves two competitors fighting for a predetermined amount of time, in this case thirty-minutes, after which whoever gained more [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfalls]] or [[Submission (combat sport)|submissions]] is the victor. The rivalry for this match began on the January 21 episode of ''Impact!'', when Daniels challenged Styles to a match that night, in which if Styles could not defeat him in under ten-minutes then Daniels got a X Division Championship match at Against All Odds.<ref name=\"WrestleViewImpact0121\"/> The match ended in a time limit draw, which meant per the pre-match stipulation Daniels gained a championship match at Against All Odds.<ref name=\"WrestleViewImpact0121\"/> Dusty Rhodes then entered the arena after the match and announced that the contest would be a thirty-minute Iron Man match.<ref name=\"WrestleViewImpact0121\"/>\n\nA featured match heading into Against All Odds was the debuting of [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match#Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|Full Metal Mayhem]], in which [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] fought [[Jeff Hardy]], with the winner becoming number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In a Full Metal Mayhem match, two or more competitors fight to either gain a pinfall, submission, or climb a ladder to retrieve an envelope or a [[Championship (professional wrestling)|championship belt]] in no [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] rules.

Early in the match, Abyss placed two tables side-by-side and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside. Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table at the top of the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#High-angle senton bomb|Swanton Bomb]]. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match. Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO1\"/>\n\nThe next bout was between the team of [[Diamond Dallas Page]] (DDP) and [[Monty Brown]] and [[Team Canada (TNA)|Team Canada]] ([[Robert Roode|Bobby Roode]] and [[Eric Young (wrestler)|Eric Young]]), who were accompanied by Coach D'Amore and [[Johnny Devine]].

Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles following bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head between his legs, tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, lifted him up, turned 90\u00b0, and dropped to the mat to force Styles' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the [[Facebuster#Lifting double underhook facebuster|Angel's Wings]].<ref name=\"WrestleViewAAO\"/> Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece.<ref name=\"SlamAAO\"/> Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out. Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime/sudden death, which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes. The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, lift him up, hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind his legs, and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into the mat in a move Styles dubbed the [[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]] to retain the X Division Championship.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO2\"/>\n\nThe main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which defending champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a [[cello]].<ref name=\"SlamAAO\"/> Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello and placed it on the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the [[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife Powerbomb]]. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. [[Billy Gunn|Monty Sopp]] then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO1\"/> After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. [[Sean Waltman]] then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO2\"/> A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the [[Facebuster#Forward Russian legsweep|Stroke]]. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO1\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nAfter Against All Odds, Jarrett went on to fight Diamond Dallas Page at [[Destination X (2005)|Destination X]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Lumberjack match|Ringside Revenge match]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.

One saw [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] defeat [[Jeff Hardy]] in a match where the competitors had to climb a ladder and retrieve an envelope to become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in what is called a [[Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match#Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|Full Metal Mayhem match]]. The other being for the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship]] between the champions, [[America's Most Wanted (professional wrestling)|America's Most Wanted]] ([[Chris Harris (wrestler)|Chris Harris]] and [[James Storm]]) (AMW), and [[Kid Kash]] and [[Lance Hoyt]]; AMW claimed victory in the match.\n\nThe event marked the debut of the Full Metal Mayhem match, which later became one of TNA's most successful [[Professional wrestling match types|match types]]. The professional wrestling section of the ''[[Canadian Online Explorer]]'' website rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 stars, which was the same rating as the [[Against All Odds (2006)|2006 event]].\n\nIn October 2017, with the launch of the [[Global Wrestling Network]], the event became available to stream on demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/fighting/article178087906.html|title=Anthem, Impact announce Global Wrestling Network launch|publisher=|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe event featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, [[Plot (narrative)|plots]], and [[Narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villains]] or [[Face (professional wrestling)|heroes]] in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.\n\nThe main event at Against All Odds was a [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|standard wrestling match]] for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which Jeff Jarrett defended the championship against his on-screen rival Kevin Nash.

An Iron Man match involves two competitors fighting for a predetermined amount of time, in this case thirty-minutes, after which whoever gained more [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfalls]] or [[Submission (combat sport)|submissions]] is the victor.

Mid-way through the match, Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table at the top of the entrance ramp, he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front-flip, landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#High-angle senton bomb|Swanton Bomb]]. In the final minutes of the match, Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes, however, it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match. Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope. While he was climbing again, Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down, he then threw Hardy against the ropes. When Hardy connected with the ropes, he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match.

Styles, defended the title against Christopher Daniels. The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles following bending Styles forward, placing Styles' head between his legs, tucked Styles' arms behind Styles' back, lifted him up, turned 90\u00b0, and dropped to the mat to force Styles' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the [[Facebuster#Lifting double underhook facebuster|Angel's Wings]].<ref name=\"WrestleViewAAO\"/> Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll-up, tying the match one fall apiece.<ref name=\"SlamAAO\"/> Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place, the thirty-minute time limit ran out.

The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels, lift him up, hold him upside down, trap Daniels' arms behind his legs, and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into the mat in a move Styles dubbed the [[Facebuster#Belly-to-back inverted mat slam|Styles Clash]] to retain the X Division Championship.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO2\"/>\n\nThe main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which defending champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a [[cello]].<ref name=\"SlamAAO\"/> Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello and placed it on the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the [[Powerbomb#Release powerbomb|Jackknife Powerbomb]]. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. [[Billy Gunn|Monty Sopp]] then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, which led to a fight between the two.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO1\"/> After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. [[Sean Waltman]] then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them.<ref name=\"PWTorchAAO2\"/> A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the [[Facebuster#Forward Russian legsweep|Stroke]].

The entire district was an extensive [[Pastoral lease|pastoral property]] named Gottlieb's Well Station (also ''Gottlieb Well'' \u2013 German: 'Loved by God'), first taken up in the 1840s under Occupation Licence, and then from 1851 under Crown Lease.<ref name=\"plb\"/> By the 1860s, under leaseholder Alexander McCulloch, this run had expanded to a total area of 407 square miles, grazing 40,000 sheep.<ref>''Bailliere's South Australian Gazetteer'', Adelaide 1866, page 90.</ref>  The busy Gottliebs Well head station, which also catered for travellers and stagecoaches, was just a few kilometres southwest of present Terowie township. From the early 1870s many large pastoral properties of South Australia were broken up into smaller parcels through land reform. In the case of Gottliebs Well, this resulted in the proclamation of the [[Lands administrative divisions of South Australia|Hundred of Terowie]].<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article39269175/3989860 Government Gazette 22 February 1872] ''South Australian Register'' 23 February 1872 p. 6 accessed 24 August 2011</ref> Thus obscured, the Gottliebs Well name was consigned to further obscurity in 1918 when, due to [[Australian place names changed from German names|anti-German sentiment]] of World War I, it was renamed Parnggi Well.\n\nThe town of '''Terowie''' was founded as a private venture around 1875 by John A.

The [[broad gauge]] line from the south (via [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]]) ended at Terowie.  Soon a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] line continued 20&nbsp;km north to [[Peterborough railway station, South Australia|Peterborough]], where lines from [[Perth]], [[Alice Springs]], [[Broken Hill]] and later [[Sydney]] met. Thus Terowie functioned for decades as the [[transshipment]] point at the railway [[break-of-gauge]].\n\nThe broad gauge line was extended from Terowie to Peterborough in the 1970s, and Terowie went from a thriving township into something of a perfectly preserved ghost-town.<ref>Chambers, T.F. (1971) \"The Railways and Terowie\", [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], February 1971, pp. 25\u221235</ref> The railway line was closed and removed in the early 1990s; many relics remain and have been well preserved in the Museum and the Walking Trail.\n\nWhen in 1898 the town hosted a busy [[break of gauge]] its population was about 800\u2013900 people, many of whom worked on the railways.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article87780780 |title=Deputations |newspaper=[[The Chronicle (Adelaide)|The Chronicle]] |location=Adelaide |date=6 August 1898 |accessdate=30 May 2013 |page=21 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nThe town was home to a busy staging camp during [[World War II]], due to the break-of-gauge for the busy railway traffic going to Alice Springs and thus much of northern Australia.\n\n=== Elevation ===\n\nElevation is {{convert|1634|ft|m}}.<ref>SAR Timetable 1954 p96</ref>\n\n== People ==\n\nThe pioneering Hollywood filmmaker [[J.P.

It has been speculated that McGowan's decades-long film interest in steam rail would have stemmed from early exposure in the then-bustling rail terminus.\n\n==General Douglas MacArthur==\n[[File:McArthur monument Terowie.JPG|thumb|McArthur monument Terowie]]\nWhilst transferring trains in Terowie on 20 March 1942, U.S. [[Douglas MacArthur|General Douglas MacArthur]] made his famous speech regarding the [[Battle of the Philippines (1942)|Battle of the Philippines]] in which he said: \"I came out of [[Bataan]] and I shall return\". He subsequently repeated the line \"I shall return\" in a number of other speeches, in a number of other places. The event is commemorated by a plaque on the now disused railway platform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://monumentaustralia.org.au/australian_monument/display/51790 |publisher=Monument Australia |work=Monument Australia Display |title=I Came out of Bataan and I Shall Return |accessdate=20 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Bob the Railway Dog==\n\n[[File:Terowie Bob information Board.jpg|thumb| Bob's Trail \u2013 Terowie SA]] [[Bob the Railway Dog|Bob, also known as Terowie Bob]], first lived with Seth Ferry at Terowie, whilst Ferry was a Special Porter.<ref name=Manning/>\n\nBob is commemorated in Terowie via a series of information boards, the \"Bob the Railway Dog Trail\", at various points of interest in the town.\n\n==Asbestos and water contamination==\n\nFor the last 40 years the town has been littered with broken asbestos pieces and has even been referred to as an 'asbestos wasteland'. The South Australian government owns the land where significant quantities of asbestos has been dumped on the ground, open to the air with no signage fences or other warnings to stop people going near, nor stopping children playing in and around the extremely hazardous material. The town also has a significant problem with water quality, with the towns from Terowie to Cockburn on the Barrier Highway receiving water from SA Water containing \"unacceptable levels of lead\" in the tap water along with water tests commonly showing high levels of e-coli. The water, unfit for consumption, costs residents four times more than the uncontaminated water in Adelaide, the water itself is pumped through asbestos pipes from a local dam. The supply of contaminated water to residents of Terowie goes against basic international human rights as outlined by the United Nations. <ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-26/residents-of-forgotten-town-want-asbestos-wasteland-gone/4541540</ref><ref>https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Old post office Terowie.JPG|post office (former)\nFile:Old wooden shop Terowie.JPG|Old Shop \nFile:Terowie old shops.JPG|Old Shops\nFile:Terowie Imperial Hotel.JPG|Imperial Hotel \nFile:Country Womens Association Terowie.JPG|CWA \n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/terowie.htm South Australian history \u2013 Terowie]\n\n{{Regional Council of Goyder localities}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Mid North (South Australia)]]\n[[Category:Towns in South Australia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Australian English|date=June 2013}}\n{{Infobox Australian place\n| type     = town\n| name     = Terowie\n| state    = sa\n| image    = Terowie railway station.JPG\n| caption  = A portion of the remains of [[Terowie railway station]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|33.155538|S|138.918589|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| coord_ref = <ref name=\"LMV\">{{cite web|title=Search results for 'Terowie, LOCB' with the following datasets selected - 'Suburbs and localities', 'Counties', \"Government Tows', 'Hundreds', 'Local Government Areas', 'SA Government Regions' and 'Gazetteer'|url= http://location.sa.gov.au/viewer/?map=roads&x=138.98298&y=-33.16368&z=12&uids=19,2,8,11,20,105&pinx=138.919920&piny=-33.154070&pinTitle=Location&pinText=Terowie,+Locb |website=Location SA Map Viewer|publisher=South Australian Government|accessdate=25 December 2018}}</ref>\n| pushpin_label_position = top\n\n| pop      = 131\n| pop_year = {{CensusAU|2016}}\n| pop_footnotes = <ref name=\"Census2016\">{{Census 2016 AUS| id=SSC41425\n|name=Terowie (State Suburb) | accessdate=25 December 2018|quick=on}}</ref>\n\n\n| established              = \n| established_footnotes    = \n| postcode                 =  5421\n| elevation                = 534\n| elevation_footnotes      = \n| area                     = \n| area_footnotes           = \n| timezone                 = \n| utc                      = \n| timezone-dst             = \n| utc-dst                  = \n\n| dist1    = 220\n| dir1     = N\n| location1= [[Adelaide]]\n| dist2    = 103\n| dir2     = E\n| location2= [[Port Pirie, South Australia|Port Pirie]]\n| dist3    = 24\n| dir3     = SE\n| location3= [[Peterborough, South Australia|Peterborough]]\n\n| county   = [[County of Victoria | Victoria]]<ref name=\"LMV\"/><br/>[[County of Kimberley| Kimberley]]<ref name=\"LMV\"/>\n| region   = [[Yorke and Mid North]]<ref name=\"LMV\"/>\n| lga      = Regional Council of Goyder<ref name=\"LMV\"/>\n| stategov = [[electoral district of Stuart| Stuart]]<ref name=ECSA>{{cite web|title=District of Stuart Background Profile (2014-2018 boundaries) |url=https://www.ecsa.sa.gov.au/component/edocman/2014-sa-country-map/download |publisher=Electoral Commission SA|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref>\n| fedgov = [[division of Grey|Grey]] <ref name=AEC>{{cite web|title=Federal electoral division of Grey |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/sa/files/2011/2011-aec-a4-map-sa-grey.pdf  |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=27 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n| maxtemp                  = \n| maxtemp_footnotes        = \n| mintemp                  = \n| mintemp_footnotes        = \n| rainfall                 = \n| rainfall_footnotes       =\n\n| near-e    = [[Franklyn, South Australia|Franklyn]]\n| near-se   = [[Wonna, South Australia|Wonna]]\n| near-s    = [[Whyte Yarcowie, South Australia|Whyte Yarcowie]]<br/>[[Wonna, South Australia|Wonna]]\n| near-sw   = [[Whyte Yarcowie, South Australia|Whyte Yarcowie]]\n| near-w    = [[Canowie Belt, South Australia|Canowie Belt]]\n| near-nw   = [[Canowie Belt, South Australia|Canowie Belt]]<br/>[[Sunnybrae, South Australia|Sunnybrae]]\n| near-n    = [[Sunnybrae, South Australia|Sunnybrae]]<br/>[[Ucolta, South Australia|Ucolta]]\n| near-ne   = [[Parnaroo, South Australia|Parnaroo]]\n| near =\n|footnotes=Adjoining localities<ref name=\"LMV\"/><ref name=\"plb\">{{cite web | url=http://maps.sa.gov.au/plb/# | title=Search result(s) for Terowie, LOCB(Record No.SA0045562) with the following layers being selected - \"Suburbs and Localities\" and \"Place names (gazetteer)\"| publisher=Government of South Australia | work=Property Location Browser | accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n'''Terowie''' (formerly '''Gottliebs Well''' and '''Shebbear''') is a small town in the [[Mid North]] region of [[South Australia]] located {{convert|220|km|mi|0}} north of the state capital of [[Adelaide city centre|Adelaide]].

The entire district was an extensive [[Pastoral lease|pastoral property]] named Gottlieb's Well Station (also ''Gottlieb Well'' \u2013 German: 'Loved by God'), first taken up in the 1840s under Occupation Licence, and then from 1851 under Crown Lease.<ref name=\"plb\"/> By the 1860s, under leaseholder Alexander McCulloch, this run had expanded to a total area of 407 square miles, grazing 40,000 sheep.<ref>''Bailliere's South Australian Gazetteer'', Adelaide 1866, page 90.</ref>  The busy Gottliebs Well head station, which also catered for travellers and stagecoaches, was just a few kilometres southwest of present Terowie township. From the early 1870s many large pastoral properties of South Australia were broken up into smaller parcels through land reform.

The [[broad gauge]] line from the south (via [[Burra, South Australia|Burra]]) ended at Terowie.  Soon a [[narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] line continued 20&nbsp;km north to [[Peterborough railway station, South Australia|Peterborough]], where lines from [[Perth]], [[Alice Springs]], [[Broken Hill]] and later [[Sydney]] met. Thus Terowie functioned for decades as the [[transshipment]] point at the railway [[break-of-gauge]].\n\nThe broad gauge line was extended from Terowie to Peterborough in the 1970s, and Terowie went from a thriving township into something of a perfectly preserved ghost-town.<ref>Chambers, T.F.

The South Australian government owns the land where significant quantities of asbestos has been dumped on the ground, open to the air with no signage fences or other warnings to stop people going near, nor stopping children playing in and around the extremely hazardous material. The town also has a significant problem with water quality, with the towns from Terowie to Cockburn on the Barrier Highway receiving water from SA Water containing \"unacceptable levels of lead\" in the tap water along with water tests commonly showing high levels of e-coli. The water, unfit for consumption, costs residents four times more than the uncontaminated water in Adelaide, the water itself is pumped through asbestos pipes from a local dam. The supply of contaminated water to residents of Terowie goes against basic international human rights as outlined by the United Nations. <ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-02-26/residents-of-forgotten-town-want-asbestos-wasteland-gone/4541540</ref><ref>https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/human_right_to_water.shtml</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Old post office Terowie.JPG|post office (former)\nFile:Old wooden shop Terowie.JPG|Old Shop \nFile:Terowie old shops.JPG|Old Shops\nFile:Terowie Imperial Hotel.JPG|Imperial Hotel \nFile:Country Womens Association Terowie.JPG|CWA \n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n{{Commons}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.southaustralianhistory.com.au/terowie.htm South Australian history \u2013 Terowie]\n\n{{Regional Council of Goyder localities}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2011}}\n\n[[Category:Mid North (South Australia)]]\n[[Category:Towns in South Australia]]\n", "name_user": "60.227.99.139", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terowie,_South_Australia"}

As such, Indian nationals that for years have received the majority of H-1B visas,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/USCIS/Resources/Reports%20and%20Studies/Immigration%20Forms%20Data/BAHA/h-1b-2007-2017-trend-tables.pdf|title=Number of H-1B Petition Filings FY2007 - FY2017|last=|first=|date=|website=www.uscis.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> despite receiving about 20% of the annual Employment-based green cards<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://travel.state.gov/content/dam/visas/Statistics/AnnualReports/FY2018AnnualReport/FY18AnnualReport%20-%20TableV.pdf|title=Immigrant Visas Issued and Adjustments of Status Subject to Numerical Limitations Fiscal Year 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=www.travel.state.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dhs.gov/immigration-statistics/yearbook|title=Yearbook of Immigration Statistics|date=2009-07-09|website=Department of Homeland Security|language=en|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref> have to wait decades before receiving one. A similar situation holds for immigrants applying for family-based green cards where millions of people, mostly from the Philippines, Mexico, India, and China, have to wait years before receiving a green card. The fundamental cause of the green card backlog is that annual demand for green cards is much higher than ones available annually and not, as some may assume, the per-country caps.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@goodarzm/what-are-the-implications-of-the-fairness-for-high-skilled-immigrants-act-of-2019-e8dce7b2ab6d|title=What are the Implications of the \u201cFairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act of 2019\u201d (H.R.1044/S.386)?|last=Mehr|first=Goodarz|date=2019-08-29|website=Medium|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> It is estimated that currently there are 4.7 million people waiting in the green card backlog, 3.9 million of whom are waiting for a family-based green card and the rest waiting for an employment-based green card.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/immigration-wait-times-quotas-have-doubled-green-card-backlogs-are-long|title=Immigration Wait Times from Quotas Have Doubled: Green Card Backlogs Are Long, Growing, and Inequitable|date=2019-06-18|website=Cato Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Provisions ==\nThe bill would, after a five-year transition period, remove the per-country caps for employment-based green cards and increase the per-country caps for family-sponsored green cards from 7% to 15%, while increasing the number of total available green cards.
