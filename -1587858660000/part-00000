Joseph Duhr, \u201cLe concile de Ravenne in 898: la r\u00e9habilitation du pape Formose,\u201d ''Recherches de science religieuse'' 22 (1932), p. 541 note 1</ref>  The trial was conducted by [[Pope Stephen VI]], the successor to Formosus' successor, [[Pope Boniface VI]]. Stephen had Formosus' corpse exhumed and brought to the papal court for judgment. He accused Formosus of [[perjury]] and of having acceded to the papacy illegally. At the end of the trial, Formosus was pronounced guilty and his papacy retroactively declared null.\n\n==Remote context==\nThe Cadaver Synod and related events took place during a period of political instability in Italy.  This period, which lasted from the middle of the 9th century to the middle of the 10th century, was marked by a rapid succession of [[pontiff]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Wilkes, Jr. | first = Donald E. | title = The Cadaver Synod: Strangest Trial in History | journal = Flagpole Magazine | pages = 8 | location = Athens, Georgia, USA | date = 31 October 2001 | url = http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1045&context=fac_pm | accessdate =8 October 2010}}</ref>  Often, these brief papal reigns were the result of the political machinations of local Roman factions, about which few sources survive.\n\n[[Pope Formosus|Formosus]] became bishop of [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina|Porto-Santa Rufina]] in 864 during the pontificate of [[Pope Nicholas I]]. He carried out missionary activity among the [[Bulgarians]], and was so successful that they requested him for their bishop. Nicholas refused to give permission, because the appointment would have required Formosus to leave his [[Episcopal see|see]] in [[Porto]], and the fifteenth [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]] of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] forbade a bishop from leaving his own see to administer another.\n\nIn 875, shortly after [[Charles the Bald]]'s imperial coronation, Formosus fled Rome in fear of then-pope [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]].  A few months later in 876, at a synod in Santa Maria Rotunda, John VIII issued a series of accusations against Formosus and some of his associates. He asserted that Formosus had corrupted the mind of the Bulgarians \"so that, so long as [Formosus] was alive, [they] would not accept any other bishop from the apostolic see,\"<ref>John VIII, JE 3041, ed. E.L.E. Caspar, ''MGH Epistolae Karolini Aevi'', vol. 5, p. 327</ref> that he and his fellow conspirators had attempted to usurp the papacy from John, and finally that he had deserted his see in Porto and was conspiring \"against the salvation of the state{{Verify source|date=September 2010}}<!-- Did they have republics there and then, or should \"res publica\" not better be translated as \"public good/issues/affairs\" or simply \"[state]\"? --> and of our beloved Charles [the Bald].\"<ref>John VIII, ''Epistolae'', ed. Caspar, p. 327</ref> Formosus and his associates were [[excommunication|excommunicated]].\n\nIn 879, at another council held at [[Troyes]], John may have confirmed the excommunications. He also legislated more generally against those who \"plunder\" ecclesiastical goods.<ref>The council ''acta'' do not survive, but the proceedings are described by Hincmar,''Annales'', entry for 878, ed. in Monumenta Germaniae Historica ''Scriptores'' vol. I, p. 507</ref> According to the tenth-century author [[Auxilius of Naples]], Formosus was also present at this council. Auxilius says he begged the bishops for their forgiveness, and in return for removal of the excommunication, swore an oath to remain a layman for the rest of his life, to never again enter Rome, and to make no attempts to resume his former see at Porto.<ref>Auxilius,''Auxilius, ''In defensionem sacrae ordinationis papae Formosi'', I.4, ed. D\u00fcmmler, ''Auxilius und Vulgarius'' (Leipzig, 1866), p. 64</ref> This story is doubtful: another description of the synod does not mention Formosus\u2019s presence and says instead that John confirmed his excommunication.<ref>Hubert Mordek and Gerhard Schmitz, \"Papst Johannes VIII. und das Konzil von Troyes,\" in ''Geschichtsschreibung und Geistiges Leben im Mittelalter: Festschrift f\u00fcr Heinz L\u00f6we zum 65. Geburtstag,'' ed. Karl Hauck and Hubert Mordeck (Cologne, 1978), p. 212 n 22.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of John VIII in December 882, Formosus' troubles ended. He resumed his bishopric at Porto, where he remained until elected pope on 6 October 891.<ref>D\u00fcmmler, Auxilius und Vulgarius, p. 6 nn. 5 and 6</ref>  Yet this earlier quarrel with John VIII formed the basis of the accusations made at the Cadaver Synod. According to the tenth-century historian [[Liutprand of Cremona]], Stephen VI asked Formosus' corpse why he \"usurped the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition\" after the death of John VIII, echoing John VIII's own assertion that Formosus had tried to seize the papal throne while he was alive.<ref>Liutprand, ''Antapodosis'', I.30, ed. in [[Corpus Christianorum]]: Continuatio Medievalis, vol 156, p. 23, lines 639-43</ref> Two further accusations were also made against Formosus at the Cadaver Synod: that he had committed perjury and that he had attempted to exercise the office of bishop as a layman.<ref>Council of Ravenna in 898, ''acta'' edited by J.D. Mansi,''Sacrorum conciliorum, nova, et amplissima collectio'', vol. 18, col. 221</ref> These are related to the oath Formosus is said to have sworn before the council at Troyes in 878.\n\n==Immediate context==\nThe Cadaver Synod is generally presumed to have been politically motivated. Formosus crowned [[Lambert of Spoleto]] co-ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 892; Lambert's father, [[Guy III of Spoleto]], had earlier been crowned by John VIII.<ref name=\"williams\">Williams, George L. 2004. ''Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes''. McFarland & Company. {{ISBN|0-7864-2071-5}}. p. 10.</ref>  In 893 Formosus, apparently nervous about Guy's aggression, invited the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] to invade Italy and receive the imperial crown.  Arnulf's invasion failed, and Guy III died shortly afterwards.  Yet Formosus renewed his invitation to Arnulf in 895, and early the next year Arnulf crossed the Alps and entered Rome, where Formosus crowned him as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  Afterwards the Frankish army departed, and Arnulf and Formosus died within months of each other in 896. Formosus was succeeded by [[Pope Boniface VI]], who himself died two weeks later.  Lambert and his mother, the empress [[Angiltrude]], entered Rome around the time that [[Pope Stephen VI|Stephen VI]] became pope, and the Cadaver Synod was conducted directly afterwards, at the beginning of 897.\n\nThe dominant interpretation of these events until the early twentieth century was straightforward: Formosus had always been a pro-Carolingian, and his crowning of Lambert in 892 was coerced. After the death of Arnulf and the collapse of Carolingian authority in Rome, Lambert entered the city and forced Stephen to convene the Cadaver Synod, both to re-assert his claim to the imperial crown and perhaps also to exact posthumous revenge upon Formosus.<ref>Cf., for example, Duchesne, ''Les premiers temps de l\u2019\u00e9tat pontifical'' (Paris, 1904), p. 301; and the detailed account in the old ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06139b.htm Pope Formosus]</ref>\n\nThis view is now considered obsolete, following the arguments put forth by [[Joseph Duhr]] in 1932.  Duhr pointed out that Lambert was in attendance at the [[Ravenna Council of 898]], convened under [[Pope John IX]].  It was at this proceeding that the decrees of the Cadaver Synod were revoked.  According to the written ''acta'' of the council, Lambert actively approved of the nullification.  If Lambert and Angiltrude had been the architects of Formosus\u2019s degradation, Duhr asked, \u201chow [...] was John IX able to submit to the canons which condemned the odious synod for approbation of the emperor [i.e., Lambert] and his bishops?  How could John IX have dared to broach the matter [...] before the guilty parties, without even making the least allusion to the emperor\u2019s participation?\u201d<ref>Joseph Duhr, \u201cLa concile de Ravenne in 898: la r\u00e9habilitation du pape Formose,\u201d ''Recherches de science religieuse'' 22 (1932), p. 546</ref>  This position has been accepted by another scholar: Girolamo Arnaldi argued that Formosus did not pursue an exclusively pro-Carolingian policy, and that he even had friendly relations with Lambert as late as 895.  Their relations only soured when Lambert's cousin, [[Guy IV of Spoleto]], marched on [[Benevento]] and expelled the Byzantines there.  Formosus panicked at the aggression and sent emissaries into Bavaria seeking Arnulf's help.<ref>Girolamo Arnaldi, \u201cPapa Formoso e gli imperatori della casa di Spoleto,\u201d ''Annali della facolt\u00e0 di lettere e filosofia di Napoli'' 1 (1951), p. 85ff. Portions of this view had been argued earlier by G. Fasoli, ''I re d\u2019Italia'' (Florence, 1949), 32ff</ref>  Arnaldi argues that it was Guy IV, who had entered Rome along with Lambert and his mother [[Angiltrude]] in January 897, who provided the impetus for the synod.<ref>Arnaldi, \"Papa Formoso,\" p. 103</ref>\n\n==The synod==\n[[File:Tafel paepste.jpg|thumb|The list of popes buried in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] includes the recovered body of [[Pope Formosus]]]]\n\nProbably around January 897, Stephen VI ordered that the corpse of his predecessor Formosus be removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgment. With the corpse propped up on a throne, a [[deacon]] was appointed to answer for the deceased pontiff.\n\nFormosus was accused of transmigrating sees in violation of canon law, of perjury, and of serving as a bishop while actually a layman. Eventually, the corpse was found guilty.  Liutprand and other sources say that, after having the corpse stripped of its papal vestments, Stephen then cut off the three fingers of the right hand that it had used in life for blessings, next formally invalidating all of Formosus' acts and ordinations (including his ordination of Stephen VI as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Anagni-Alatri|bishop of Anagni]]). The body was finally interred in a graveyard for foreigners, only to be dug up once again, tied to weights, and cast into the [[Tiber|Tiber River]].\n\nAccording to Liutprand\u2019s version of the story, Stephen VI said: \"When you were bishop of [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina|Porto]], why did you usurp the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition?\u201d<ref>\u201cQuo constituto...formosum e sepulcro extrahere atque in sedem Romani...collocare praecepit. Cui et ait: \u2018Cum Portuensis esses episcopus, cur ambitionis spiritu Romanam universalem usurpasti sedem?\u201d Liutprand, Antapodosis, I.30 (CCCM 156, p. 23, ll. 639-43). Liutprand of Cremona\u2019s is perhaps the most convenient account of synod, though many additional details are furnished by the pro-Formosan Auxilius. Cf. D\u00fcmmler\u2019s edition, Auxilius und Vulgarius (Leipzig, 1866), chs. IV (p. 63ff) and X (p. 70ff) especially.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe macabre spectacle turned public opinion in Rome against Stephen. Formosus' body washed up on the banks of the [[Tiber River|Tiber]],<ref>{{cite web|publisher= JStor |work=CABINET OF CURIOSITIES |title=The Cadaver Synod: Putting a Dead Pope on Trial:\nWhy did Pope Stephen VI go to such great lengths to destroy an enemy who was already dead?|date=February 7, 2019 |author=Amelia Soth}}</ref> and and rumor said it had had begun to perform [[miracle]]s. A public uprising deposed and imprisoned Stephen. He was strangled in prison in July or August 897.\n\nIn December 897 [[Pope Theodore II]] (897) convened a synod that annulled the Cadaver Synod, rehabilitated Formosus, and ordered that his body, which had been recovered from the Tiber, be reburied in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[pontifical vestments]]. In 898, [[Pope John IX|John IX]] (898\u2013900) also nullified the Cadaver Synod, convening one synod in Rome, and another in [[Ravenna]]. The two synods which affirmed the findings of Theodore II's synod, ordered the ''acta'' of the Cadaver Synod destroyed, [[List of excommunicated cardinals|excommunicated seven cardinals]] involved in the Cadaver Synod, and prohibited any future trial of a [[cadaver|corpse]].\n\nHowever, [[Pope Sergius III]] (904\u2013911), who as bishop had taken part in the Cadaver Synod as a co-judge, overturned the rulings of Theodore II and John IX, reaffirming Formosus's conviction,<ref>Williams, 2004, p. 11.</ref> and had a laudatory epitaph inscribed on the tomb of Stephen VI.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Damnatio memoriae]]''\n* [[Devil's advocate]]\n* [[List of excommunicable offences in the Catholic Church]]\n* [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church]]\n* [[Posthumous execution]]\n*[[Criticism of the Catholic Church#Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties|Criticism of the Catholic Church \u00a7 Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Cummins, Joseph. 2006.

At the end of the trial, Formosus was pronounced guilty and his papacy retroactively declared null.\n\n==Remote context==\nThe Cadaver Synod and related events took place during a period of political instability in Italy.

He carried out missionary activity among the [[Bulgarians]], and was so successful that they requested him for their bishop. Nicholas refused to give permission, because the appointment would have required Formosus to leave his [[Episcopal see|see]] in [[Porto]], and the fifteenth [[Canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]] of the [[Second Council of Nicaea]] forbade a bishop from leaving his own see to administer another.\n\nIn 875, shortly after [[Charles the Bald]]'s imperial coronation, Formosus fled Rome in fear of then-pope [[Pope John VIII|John VIII]].  A few months later in 876, at a synod in Santa Maria Rotunda, John VIII issued a series of accusations against Formosus and some of his associates. He asserted that Formosus had corrupted the mind of the Bulgarians \"so that, so long as [Formosus] was alive, [they] would not accept any other bishop from the apostolic see,\"<ref>John VIII, JE 3041, ed. E.L.E. Caspar, ''MGH Epistolae Karolini Aevi'', vol. 5, p. 327</ref> that he and his fellow conspirators had attempted to usurp the papacy from John, and finally that he had deserted his see in Porto and was conspiring \"against the salvation of the state{{Verify source|date=September 2010}}<!-- Did they have republics there and then, or should \"res publica\" not better be translated as \"public good/issues/affairs\" or simply \"[state]\"? --> and of our beloved Charles [the Bald].\"<ref>John VIII, ''Epistolae'', ed. Caspar, p. 327</ref> Formosus and his associates were [[excommunication|excommunicated]].\n\nIn 879, at another council held at [[Troyes]], John may have confirmed the excommunications. He also legislated more generally against those who \"plunder\" ecclesiastical goods.<ref>The council ''acta'' do not survive, but the proceedings are described by Hincmar,''Annales'', entry for 878, ed. in Monumenta Germaniae Historica ''Scriptores'' vol. I, p. 507</ref> According to the tenth-century author [[Auxilius of Naples]], Formosus was also present at this council. Auxilius says he begged the bishops for their forgiveness, and in return for removal of the excommunication, swore an oath to remain a layman for the rest of his life, to never again enter Rome, and to make no attempts to resume his former see at Porto.<ref>Auxilius,''Auxilius, ''In defensionem sacrae ordinationis papae Formosi'', I.4, ed. D\u00fcmmler, ''Auxilius und Vulgarius'' (Leipzig, 1866), p. 64</ref> This story is doubtful: another description of the synod does not mention Formosus\u2019s presence and says instead that John confirmed his excommunication.<ref>Hubert Mordek and Gerhard Schmitz, \"Papst Johannes VIII. und das Konzil von Troyes,\" in ''Geschichtsschreibung und Geistiges Leben im Mittelalter: Festschrift f\u00fcr Heinz L\u00f6we zum 65. Geburtstag,'' ed. Karl Hauck and Hubert Mordeck (Cologne, 1978), p. 212 n 22.</ref>\n\nAfter the death of John VIII in December 882, Formosus' troubles ended. He resumed his bishopric at Porto, where he remained until elected pope on 6 October 891.<ref>D\u00fcmmler, Auxilius und Vulgarius, p. 6 nn. 5 and 6</ref>  Yet this earlier quarrel with John VIII formed the basis of the accusations made at the Cadaver Synod. According to the tenth-century historian [[Liutprand of Cremona]], Stephen VI asked Formosus' corpse why he \"usurped the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition\" after the death of John VIII, echoing John VIII's own assertion that Formosus had tried to seize the papal throne while he was alive.<ref>Liutprand, ''Antapodosis'', I.30, ed. in [[Corpus Christianorum]]: Continuatio Medievalis, vol 156, p. 23, lines 639-43</ref> Two further accusations were also made against Formosus at the Cadaver Synod: that he had committed perjury and that he had attempted to exercise the office of bishop as a layman.<ref>Council of Ravenna in 898, ''acta'' edited by J.D. Mansi,''Sacrorum conciliorum, nova, et amplissima collectio'', vol. 18, col. 221</ref> These are related to the oath Formosus is said to have sworn before the council at Troyes in 878.\n\n==Immediate context==\nThe Cadaver Synod is generally presumed to have been politically motivated. Formosus crowned [[Lambert of Spoleto]] co-ruler of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 892; Lambert's father, [[Guy III of Spoleto]], had earlier been crowned by John VIII.<ref name=\"williams\">Williams, George L. 2004. ''Papal Genealogy: The Families and Descendants of the Popes''. McFarland & Company. {{ISBN|0-7864-2071-5}}. p. 10.</ref>  In 893 Formosus, apparently nervous about Guy's aggression, invited the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] [[Arnulf of Carinthia]] to invade Italy and receive the imperial crown.  Arnulf's invasion failed, and Guy III died shortly afterwards.  Yet Formosus renewed his invitation to Arnulf in 895, and early the next year Arnulf crossed the Alps and entered Rome, where Formosus crowned him as [[Holy Roman Emperor]].  Afterwards the Frankish army departed, and Arnulf and Formosus died within months of each other in 896. Formosus was succeeded by [[Pope Boniface VI]], who himself died two weeks later.  Lambert and his mother, the empress [[Angiltrude]], entered Rome around the time that [[Pope Stephen VI|Stephen VI]] became pope, and the Cadaver Synod was conducted directly afterwards, at the beginning of 897.\n\nThe dominant interpretation of these events until the early twentieth century was straightforward: Formosus had always been a pro-Carolingian, and his crowning of Lambert in 892 was coerced. After the death of Arnulf and the collapse of Carolingian authority in Rome, Lambert entered the city and forced Stephen to convene the Cadaver Synod, both to re-assert his claim to the imperial crown and perhaps also to exact posthumous revenge upon Formosus.<ref>Cf., for example, Duchesne, ''Les premiers temps de l\u2019\u00e9tat pontifical'' (Paris, 1904), p. 301; and the detailed account in the old ''Catholic Encyclopedia'' [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06139b.htm Pope Formosus]</ref>\n\nThis view is now considered obsolete, following the arguments put forth by [[Joseph Duhr]] in 1932.  Duhr pointed out that Lambert was in attendance at the [[Ravenna Council of 898]], convened under [[Pope John IX]].  It was at this proceeding that the decrees of the Cadaver Synod were revoked.  According to the written ''acta'' of the council, Lambert actively approved of the nullification.  If Lambert and Angiltrude had been the architects of Formosus\u2019s degradation, Duhr asked, \u201chow [...] was John IX able to submit to the canons which condemned the odious synod for approbation of the emperor [i.e., Lambert] and his bishops?  How could John IX have dared to broach the matter [...] before the guilty parties, without even making the least allusion to the emperor\u2019s participation?\u201d<ref>Joseph Duhr, \u201cLa concile de Ravenne in 898: la r\u00e9habilitation du pape Formose,\u201d ''Recherches de science religieuse'' 22 (1932), p. 546</ref>  This position has been accepted by another scholar: Girolamo Arnaldi argued that Formosus did not pursue an exclusively pro-Carolingian policy, and that he even had friendly relations with Lambert as late as 895.  Their relations only soured when Lambert's cousin, [[Guy IV of Spoleto]], marched on [[Benevento]] and expelled the Byzantines there.  Formosus panicked at the aggression and sent emissaries into Bavaria seeking Arnulf's help.<ref>Girolamo Arnaldi, \u201cPapa Formoso e gli imperatori della casa di Spoleto,\u201d ''Annali della facolt\u00e0 di lettere e filosofia di Napoli'' 1 (1951), p. 85ff. Portions of this view had been argued earlier by G. Fasoli, ''I re d\u2019Italia'' (Florence, 1949), 32ff</ref>  Arnaldi argues that it was Guy IV, who had entered Rome along with Lambert and his mother [[Angiltrude]] in January 897, who provided the impetus for the synod.<ref>Arnaldi, \"Papa Formoso,\" p. 103</ref>\n\n==The synod==\n[[File:Tafel paepste.jpg|thumb|The list of popes buried in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] includes the recovered body of [[Pope Formosus]]]]\n\nProbably around January 897, Stephen VI ordered that the corpse of his predecessor Formosus be removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgment. With the corpse propped up on a throne, a [[deacon]] was appointed to answer for the deceased pontiff.\n\nFormosus was accused of transmigrating sees in violation of canon law, of perjury, and of serving as a bishop while actually a layman. Eventually, the corpse was found guilty.  Liutprand and other sources say that, after having the corpse stripped of its papal vestments, Stephen then cut off the three fingers of the right hand that it had used in life for blessings, next formally invalidating all of Formosus' acts and ordinations (including his ordination of Stephen VI as [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Anagni-Alatri|bishop of Anagni]]). The body was finally interred in a graveyard for foreigners, only to be dug up once again, tied to weights, and cast into the [[Tiber|Tiber River]].\n\nAccording to Liutprand\u2019s version of the story, Stephen VI said: \"When you were bishop of [[Roman Catholic Suburbicarian Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina|Porto]], why did you usurp the universal Roman See in such a spirit of ambition?\u201d<ref>\u201cQuo constituto...formosum e sepulcro extrahere atque in sedem Romani...collocare praecepit.

Liutprand of Cremona\u2019s is perhaps the most convenient account of synod, though many additional details are furnished by the pro-Formosan Auxilius. Cf. D\u00fcmmler\u2019s edition, Auxilius und Vulgarius (Leipzig, 1866), chs. IV (p. 63ff) and X (p. 70ff) especially.</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Refimprove section|date=April 2008}}\n\nThe macabre spectacle turned public opinion in Rome against Stephen.

A public uprising deposed and imprisoned Stephen. He was strangled in prison in July or August 897.\n\nIn December 897 [[Pope Theodore II]] (897) convened a synod that annulled the Cadaver Synod, rehabilitated Formosus, and ord ered that his body, which had been recovered from the Tiber, be reburied in [[Saint Peter's Basilica]] in [[pontifical vestments]]. In 898, [[Pope John IX|John IX]] (898\u2013900) also nullified the Cadaver Synod, convening one synod in Rome, and another in [[Ravenna]]. The two synods which affirmed the findings of Theodore II's synod, ordered the ''acta'' of the Cadaver Synod destroyed, [[List of excommunicated cardinals|excommunicated seven cardinals]] involved in the Cadaver Synod, and prohibited any future trial of a [[cadaver|corpse]].\n\nHowever, [[Pope Sergius III]] (904\u2013911), who as bishop had taken part in the Cadaver Synod as a co-judge, overturned the rulings of Theodore II and John IX, reaffirming Formosus's conviction,<ref>Williams, 2004, p. 11.</ref> and had a laudatory epitaph inscribed on the tomb of Stephen VI.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Damnatio memoriae]]''\n* [[Devil's advocate]]\n* [[List of excommunicable offences in the Catholic Church]]\n* [[List of people excommunicated by the Catholic Church]]\n* [[Posthumous execution]]\n*[[Criticism of the Catholic Church#Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties|Criticism of the Catholic Church \u00a7 Excommunication, the interdict, and other penalties]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Cummins, Joseph. 2006.

Much of the activity to produce k\u016bmara became ritualised \u2013 it was even associated with Rongom\u0101t\u0101ne (Rongo), a high-ranking {{lang|mi|atua}} (god).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kumara/page-4|title=K\u016bmara \u2013 Religious aspects|last=Adds|first=Peter|encyclopedia=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref> K\u016bmara featured in some {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}} (proverbs): \"{{lang|mi|Kaore te k\u016bmara e k\u014drero mo t\u014dna m\u0101ngaro}}\" (the k\u016bmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.\n\nSeasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds.

At the same time, M\u0101ori groups became less [[nomadic]], more settled in defined territories, and more dependent on gardening as a food source. Reliance on stored food such as k\u016bmara tubers meant that stores needed to be protected from marauding neighbours. The widespread construction of large fortifications called {{lang|mi|[[p\u0101]]}} on prominent hills and spurs dates from this time, as evidence of the development of a more martial, tribal culture.{{sfn|King|2003|page=72}} All aspects of this culture were not universally adopted, particularly in the South Island where k\u016bmara could not be easily grown.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last1=Bunce|first1=Michael|last2=Beavan|first2=Nancy R.|last3=Oskam|first3=Charlotte L.|last4=Jacomb|first4=Christopher|last5=Allentoft|first5=Morten E.|last6=Holdaway|first6=Richard N.|date=2014-11-07|title=An extremely low-density human population exterminated New Zealand moa|journal= Nature Communications|language=en|volume=5|pages=5436|bibcode=2014NatCo...5.5436H|doi=10.1038/ncomms6436|issn=2041-1723|pmid=25378020|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n=== Cultural change by contact with Europeans c.1800 AD===\nBecause of the very small number of Europeans who visited New Zealand in the 18th and early 19th century, the core values of M\u0101ori culture were little altered. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] estimated there were only 1100 Europeans in the North Island in 1839, with 200 being missionaries, and a total of about 500\u2013600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=101}} The northern M\u0101ori population at the time has been estimated at about 30,000 to 40,000, down from about 100,000, fifty years before.<ref name=\":1\" /> This drop in population was mostly due to [[Measles|disease]] and the [[Musket Wars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/171949|title=2. \u2013 Taupori M\u0101ori \u2013 M\u0101ori population change \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nFor decades, European missionaries, mostly living in the north of the North Island, had very little influence over M\u0101ori behaviour. Missionaries report being appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of M\u0101ori behaviour. This included warfare, slavery, cannibalism, sexual abuse of women, killing of female children and revenge killings. However, by 1840, many of these customs were all but abolished or not publicly practised.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=220}}\n\nIn the coastal South Island, the M\u0101ori population was very small. Whalers set up shore stations along the southern and eastern coasts and formed M\u0101ori\u2013European working communities. In the early 1800s, it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with M\u0101ori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 M\u0101ori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island \u2013 in fact, M\u0101ori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=320}}\n\nContact with Europeans enabled M\u0101ori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove M\u0101ori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=32}} Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. M\u0101ori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with M\u0101ori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}<ref>''Climates of War''. E. Bohan. p 29</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Marion Du Fresne gave northern M\u0101ori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of M\u0101ori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with M\u0101ori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by [[k\u016bmara]]. Later, as M\u0101ori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands, in particular, to trade for fresh supplies.\n\nOne significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition M\u0101ori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, M\u0101ori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in M\u0101ori culture. Gifts were given to recognise {{lang|mi|mana}} (power or authority).{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=112}}\n\nBurial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with M\u0101ori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack.

In 1900 few M\u0101ori lived in European urban settlements. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 M\u0101ori in Auckland in 1935. In 1936 only 11.2% of M\u0101ori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment \u2013 from working on rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning M\u0101ori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help M\u0101ori make better use of their remaining tribal land. M\u0101ori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much M\u0101ori land was steep, remote, erosion-prone with high rainfall.{{sfn|King|2001|pages=101\u2013107}} European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanised to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. M\u0101ori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave M\u0101ori a steady income but this was spread among many people. M\u0101ori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.{{sfn|King|2001|page=103}}\n\nApart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many M\u0101ori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a \"fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration\".{{sfn|King|2001|page=104}}\nOther changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the M\u0101ori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time, M\u0101ori had fewer qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of M\u0101ori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non-M\u0101ori. As a result, only 3.36% of M\u0101ori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non-M\u0101ori.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}} M\u0101ori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made M\u0101ori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower M\u0101ori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}}\n\nThese ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as \"M\u0101ori problems\". By the 1970s and 1980s, enough urbanised M\u0101ori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use [[M\u0101ori protest movement|vigorous protest to push Mana M\u0101ori]].

The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\". However, the term was often used by M\u0101ori to express the idea of political rights for all M\u0101ori, not just the {{lang|mi|rangatira}} class, or the idea of M\u0101ori sovereignty or M\u0101ori independence.\n\nEducated urban M\u0101ori advocated the teaching of M\u0101ori language and the inclusion of a M\u0101ori point of view in all aspects of education. M\u0101ori began to express their ideas in new political movements with M\u0101ori voters switching from supporting the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour party]] to alternatives such as the M\u0101ori lead [[New Zealand First|New Zealand First party]] in 1992. The introduction of [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] (Mixed Member Proportional) elections in 1996 had the effect of giving minority groups of any shades, more influence.

Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or {{lang|mi|tohunga}}. While the {{lang|mi|mana}} itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=15}} Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the {{lang|mi|mana}} of {{lang|mi|whanau}} and {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and loyalty within the group is unquestionably at the heart of M\u0101ori cultural concepts. She says that M\u0101ori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted<ref>Stories Without End. J. Binney, p 182</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} to the M\u0101ori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hap\u016b that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth.\n\nA key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).<ref>Stories Without End, J Binney, pp. 78\u201385</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In M\u0101ori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hap\u016b changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hap\u016b moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical-cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hap\u016b with many well-known ancestors was important for protection and survival. As M\u0101ori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hap\u016b or whanau.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Whakapapa}} (genealogy) ===\n{{lang|mi|[[Whakapapa]]}} is the origin and path of descent of a person, object or geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/whakapapa-genealogy|title=Whakapapa \u2013 genealogy \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref> A person's {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} establishes their mana and tribal connections.

Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly, a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift. Thirdly the system demanded that further social obligation had now been established to continue the exchanges. Failure to respond meant loss of mana or influence. Where parties had travelled a long way to give a present it was expected that the return gift be immediate but often due to seasonal food supplies it was accepted that a return gift would be given at some later date when supplies allowed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Firth|first=R.|title=Primitive Economics of the New Zealand Maori|year=1929}}</ref> While a gift conveyed an obligation to return the favour, so did an insult.

A {{lang|mi|marae}} is the centre for much of M\u0101ori community life. Generally the [[M\u0101ori language]] is used in ceremonies and speeches, although translations and explanations are provided when the primary participants are not M\u0101ori speakers.

The {{lang|mi|marae}} symbolises group unity and generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house, along with a dining hall and other facilities necessary to provide a comfortable stay for visiting groups. On the {{lang|mi|marae}} official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and {{lang|mi|[[tangihanga]]}} (funerals). The older people have the authority on the {{lang|mi|marae}}, and they impart, primarily through [[oral tradition]], traditions and cultural practices to the young people. These include [[genealogy]], [[spirituality]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], and politics, and arts such as [[music composition]], performance, [[weaving]], or carving.\n\nThe {{lang|mi|hui}} or meeting, usually on a marae. It begins with a {{lang|mi|[[p\u014dwhiri]]}} (a welcoming ceremony). If a visitor is noteworthy, he or she may be welcomed with an aggressive challenge by a warrior armed with a {{lang|mi|[[taiaha]]}} (traditional fighting staff), who then offers a token of peace, such as a fern frond, to the visitor. Acceptance of the token in the face of such aggression is a demonstration of the courage and {{lang|mi|[[mana]]}} of the visitor. The {{lang|mi|p\u014dwhiri}} is highly structured, with speeches from both hosts and guests following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the {{lang|mi|kawa}} (protocol) of that place, and followed by {{lang|mi|[[M\u0101ori music|waiata]]}}, songs. {{lang|mi|Hui}} are held for business, for festivities or for rites of passage such as baptism, marriage and death.

The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} consists of a shallow hole dug in the ground, in which a fire is prepared and stones are placed on the top. When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as k\u016bmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of {{lang|mi|[[Phormium tenax|harakeke]]}}, or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} to seal in the heat to cook the food.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Marae}} events ===\nLike in pre-European times, {{lang|mi|marae}} continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.

As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, \"the importance of the {{lang|mi|tangihanga}} and its central place in {{lang|mi|marae}} custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the {{lang|mi|marae}}\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Ki te whaiao: An introduction to M\u0101ori culture and society|last1=Ka'ai|first1=T.

It almost always takes place on the home {{lang|mi|marae}} of the deceased. The rituals followed are essentially Christian. The {{lang|mi|tangi}} begins with a {{lang|mi|powhiri}} to welcome guests. It is normal for M\u0101ori to travel very long distances to attend the {{lang|mi|tangi}} of a loved one. Often black clothes are worn, following Victorian practices. Guests will speak formally about the deceased on the {{lang|mi|marae atea}} often referring to tribal history and using humour. Pathos is commonly used to create a feeling of comfort and unity. Speeches are supported by {{lang|mi|waiata}} (songs). The {{lang|mi|whanau}} of the deceased sit by the coffin on the {{lang|mi|wharenui}} porch but do not speak or reply. The family may often hold or display photos of the deceased or important ancestors. A {{lang|mi|tangi}} may go on for several days, especially for a person of great {{lang|mi|mana}}.

Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korero.maori.nz/forlearners/proverbs.html|title=Whakatauk\u012b \u2013 Proverbs|work=korero.maori.nz website}}</ref> Oral traditions include songs, calls, chants, {{lang|mi|haka}} and formalised speech patterns that recall the history of the people.\n\n=== Other traditional buildings ===\n[[File:Pataka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|Pataka}} with {{lang|mi|[[tekoteko]]}}|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori Village.jpg|thumb|A M\u0101ori village, {{circa|late 1800s}}|alt=|260x260px]]\nThe standard building in a classic M\u0101ori settlement was a simple sleeping {{lang|mi|whare puni}} (house/hut) about 2 metres x 3 metres with a low roof, an earth floor, no window and a single low doorway. Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.\n\nMaterial used in construction varied between areas, but raupo reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common.<ref>Te Papa Museum of NZ. Wharepuni.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Similar small {{lang|mi|whare}}, but with interior drains, were used to store k\u016bmara on sloping racks.\n\nIn the classic period a higher proportion of {{lang|mi|whare}} were located inside {{lang|mi|p\u0101}} than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief's {{lang|mi|whare}} was similar but larger \u2014 often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a {{lang|mi|whare}} on the {{lang|mi|tihi}} or summit of a hill {{lang|mi|p\u0101}}. In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for {{lang|mi|whare}} to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.\n\nFood was not cooked in the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}} but in the open or under a {{lang|mi|kauta}} (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called {{lang|mi|pataka}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=John|author-link=John White (ethnographer)|title=The Ancient History of the Maori, His Mythology and Traditions|volume=V1|year=1888|publisher=Pataka.

This practice was done in order to express the buildings' significance and to secure the gods' protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=13}}\n\nThe traditional M\u0101ori {{lang|mi|whare}} continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post-contact period. They were usually very small with a dirt floor and full of vermin, especially fleas.

Moon Penguin 2014</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Even as late as 1849 George Cooper, the assistant private secretary to George Grey, described a village in the relatively affluent lower Eastern Waihou River area as \"a wretched place, containing about a dozen miserable raupo huts all tumbling to pieces\".<ref>Voyages.p 211.

In the 19th century settlements were {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}-based, and 5 buildings became standardised: the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}}, {{lang|mi|kauta}} or communal cookhouse/shelter, {{lang|mi|whata}} or wood store, {{lang|mi|pataka}} or storehouse, and increasingly from the 1870s {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} or community meeting house. Significant finance and {{lang|mi|mana}} was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} or {{lang|mi|iwi}} pride and prestige.\n\nA meeting house was likely to have outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the M\u0101ori MPs in the Young M\u0101ori party. Itinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meetinghouses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance {{lang|mi|mana}} with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} were common and averaged 18\u201324m long by 8m wide. There were no M\u0101ori buildings of this size in pre-European days. As M\u0101ori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the M\u0101ori MPs Pomare and Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of M\u0101ori dwellings over their many years in office.{{sfn|King|2001|page=47}}<ref>Maori MPs.NZ History online.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Mythology and religion ==\n{{main|M\u0101ori mythology|M\u0101ori religion|Taniwha}}\n{{Tall image|KupeWheke.jpg|150|300|alt=Tall wooden carving showing Kupe above two tentacled sea creatures|Late 20th-century [[whakairo|carving]] depicting the mythological navigator [[Kupe]] fighting two sea creatures|right}}\nTraditional M\u0101ori religion, has deviated little from its tropical Eastern [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] roots on the island of [[Hawaiki|Hawaiki Nui]].

The early European explorer and painter Earle noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His M\u0101ori advisers said the diseases were very old.\n\nEarle recognised that {{lang|mi|tohunga}} used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in M\u0101ori medicine.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Missionaries===\n[[File:Whare Karakia o Onuku.jpg|thumb|Church near Onuku marae, Banks Peninsula. Opened in 1878 as the first non-denominational church in New Zealand.]]\nCMS missionaries insisted M\u0101ori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified M\u0101ori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further {{lang|mi|moko}}, taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}} Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence M\u0101ori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.\n\nMissionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834\u20135. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.\n\n=== First M\u0101ori interpretation of Christianity===\nIn the 1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and M\u0101ori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves {{lang|mi|Hurai}} or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a {{lang|mi|tohunga}} figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}}\n\n== Children and education ==\n[[File:SwingAngas1847.JPG|thumb|A group of M\u0101ori children on a morere swing (1847)]]\n\n=== Childhood ===\nEarly European reports suggest that M\u0101ori children were indulged and led a carefree and playful life. A French explorer in 1772 commented that \"[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern-root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: \"The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} The killing of children could be the ''take'' (cause) of war.

Bishop Selwyn took adult M\u0101ori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.\n\nBy 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 M\u0101ori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading.<ref>Voyagers.p63. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce M\u0101ori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly M\u0101ori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti-government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in M\u0101ori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young M\u0101ori Party M\u0101ori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential M\u0101ori MPs [[\u0100pirana Ngata|Ngata]] and [[M\u0101ui P\u014dmare|P\u014dmare]] insisted that M\u0101ori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. P\u014dmare, in particular, worked hard to banish ancient M\u0101ori concepts and practices that caused harm in the M\u0101ori community.<ref>The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Maui Pomare.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Mount hobson Auckland kumara pits.jpg|thumb|Pits where kumara were stored to protect them over the winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/218774|title=K\u016bmara storage pits, 1930|last=Godber|first=Albert Percy|publisher= New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|work=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori earth oven.svg|thumb|{{lang|mi|H\u0101ngi}} or earth ovens are still used today to cook food|alt=|260x260px]]\n{{See also|M\u0101ori cuisine|H\u0101ngi}}\n\n=== Traditional M\u0101ori foods ===\nEating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or {{lang|mi|[[Lygodium articulatum|mangemange]]}} hooks, 2-piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using {{lang|mi|hinaki}}, a long cone-shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfil social gift obligations. M\u0101ori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate [[Miro (tree)|miro]] berries which made them thirsty. M\u0101ori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in miro trees to catch these large birds.\n\nEvidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata Beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use from 1450 up to 1660 AD, well into the Classic period. The coastal sites showed that M\u0101ori had created man-made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large (over 100m<sup>2</sup>). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus-rich soil near the surface.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\">{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=Ian|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|date=Dec 2012|title=Gardens of Rongo|doi=10.1086/667834}}</ref> This practice was widespread in M\u0101ori communities where k\u016bmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus-rich loam. K\u016bmara are slow-growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining subsoils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north-facing slopes were favoured.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\" />\n\nThe warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as k\u016bmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.\n\nMany special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store k\u016bmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of {{lang|mi|tapu}} was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed k\u016bmara in particular were highly {{lang|mi|tapu}}. The main problem for k\u016bmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that M\u0101ori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. M\u0101ori continued to use traditional fern roots \u2014 {{lang|mi|aruhe}} \u2014 as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.\n\n=== Introduced foods ===\nThe introduction of European foods changed many aspects of M\u0101ori agriculture. Under tradition, M\u0101ori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} although M\u0101ori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. M\u0101ori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato, the traditional varieties of which are still grown and known as {{lang|mi|taewa}} or [[M\u0101ori potatoes]].\n\nEuropean farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for M\u0101ori{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, M\u0101ori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled M\u0101ori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.\n\n== Trade and travel ==\n\n===Transport===\n{{main|Waka (canoe)}}\n[[File:Abaconda New Zealand maori waka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|Waka]]}} (canoes) are built in a variety of sizes depending on their purpose, including deep-sea fishing, river crossings or historically war and migration.]]\nThe normal M\u0101ori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many {{lang|mi|iwi}} and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with M\u0101ori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller.<ref>Tainui. L. Kelly.2002.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey travelled inland with the aid of M\u0101ori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from M\u0101ori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travellers sometimes found M\u0101ori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.<ref>Voyages. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nCanoes ({{lang|mi|[[waka (canoe)|waka]]}}) were used extensively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/page-1|title=Waka \u2013 canoes |work=Te Ara}}</ref> These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large {{lang|mi|waka taua}} sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/3|title=Waka taua|work=Te Ara}}</ref> Waka were used extensively for long-range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822\u201323 [[Te Rauparah\u0101]], who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitred the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ng\u0101i Tahu and Rangit\u0101ne iwi. Te Rauparah\u0101 later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour.{{sfn|King|2003}} This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own  goals. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70\u201380 ships per year. Many M\u0101ori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight M\u0101ori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by M\u0101ori. They could be both rowed and sailed.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}} In the 1850s as M\u0101ori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori.\n\n[[File:Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing.jpg|thumb|Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing, [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]], 1769]]\nDuring the mid 19th century Auckland and Northland M\u0101ori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853\u201356. M\u0101ori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland\u2013Waikato\u2013Hauraki area.<ref>Climates of War. E. Bohan. pp 36\u201337.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori, isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these {{lang|mi|whare}} as hotbeds for rats and vermin.<ref>P. Moon. p. 111. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Trade===\nWith the arrival of Europeans M\u0101ori gradually started to trust the value of British money and use it as a medium of exchange instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more M\u0101ori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=West|first=Jonathan|title=The Face of Nature: An Environmental History of the Otago Peninsula|date=March 2018|publisher=[[University of Otago|Otago University]] Press|isbn=978-1-92732238-3|location=Dunedin|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Az_ltwEACAAJ&dq=face+of+nature}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/economic-history/page-2|title=2. \u2013 Economic history \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nBy 1839 a large proportion of the M\u0101ori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with M\u0101ori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern M\u0101ori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north M\u0101ori economy with M\u0101ori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where M\u0101ori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|pages=130\u2013135}}\n \nThe effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organisational head of the {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. This gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. In pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=203}} Early European observers noted that at {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|whanuau hui}} (meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great {{lang|mi|mana}}, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.\n \nNot all {{lang|mi|iwi}} had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local M\u0101ori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans\u2014they seemed to know about firearms\u2014the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern M\u0101ori.{{sfn|Moon|2012|page=128}}\n\nIn the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ng\u0101ti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands, bringing back with him Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.\n\nBy 1859 trade was the main area in which M\u0101ori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that M\u0101ori expected to control. From first contact, they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high-value goods such as axes and later for money. George Grey was keen to encourage M\u0101ori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. M\u0101ori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=E.|title=Climates of War|year=2005|publisher=Hazard Press|page=36}}</ref> M\u0101ori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour. In 1886 banknotes were printed (but not issued) by Te Peeke o Aotearoa, a bank established by [[T\u0101whiao]] the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|M\u0101ori King]]. The text on these notes was M\u0101ori and there was also a picture of a flax bush. The bank's cheques had M\u0101ori figures and native birds and plants drawn on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/213266|title=1. \u2013 Coins and banknotes \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Land negotiations ===\n{{main|M\u0101ori Land Court|Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements}}\nThe M\u0101ori relationship with the land is complex. Traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of {{lang|mi|mana}} (power) and {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} (ancestral right). The land itself was both sacred and abstract. In many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain. Oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century many Europeans entered into dealings with M\u0101ori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; M\u0101ori claimed that the various deeds signed by M\u0101ori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. It has been argued that the use of the word {{lang|mi|tuku}} in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. This and other interpretations of early 19th century New Zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] process and outside it.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, [https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68635760/Muriwhenua%20Land.pdf Muriwhenua Land Report], p. 394</ref>{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nM\u0101ori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge and trade. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal \"protectors\", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Settlers allowed M\u0101ori to stay on the land they had \"bought\" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nAnother reason for M\u0101ori to \"sell\" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. M\u0101ori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who M\u0101ori trusted to allow them continued access and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz/WhyaTreaty.html|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|website=www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1840 generally, older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as M\u0101ori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from M\u0101ori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with M\u0101ori owners for much larger areas of land. Short-term leases gave M\u0101ori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the M\u0101ori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sorrenson|first=M. P.

These claims against the government were to become a major feature of {{lang|mi|iwi}} politics. Each generation of leaders were judged based on their ability to progress a land claim.{{sfn|Belgrave|2013}}\n\n== Leadership and politics ==\n{{see also|M\u0101ori politics}}\n\n=== M\u0101ori kingship ===\n{{Main|M\u0101ori King Movement}}\nFrom the time of their arrival in New Zealand, M\u0101ori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs.

Many edible plants were brought from the home islands and of these [[Sweet potato|''k\u016bmara'' (sweet potato)]] was to become the most important. In the far South, however, it was too cold to grow any of these crops. Large quantities of [[Cordyline australis|t\u012b]] tubers were eaten that were slow-cooked in large {{lang|mi|umu}} or {{lang|mi|[[h\u0101ngi]]}} (earth ovens) to get rid of the poison and to produce a slightly sweet pulp. Shellfish, fish, sharks and seals were also common foods. Native dogs ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) and rats were brought from the Pacific Islands.

Its cold climate meant that tropical staple crops needed careful cultivation to survive, and some failed to grow locally. [[Sweet potato|K\u016bmara]] was an important crop that arrived with the Polynesian settlers. Much of the activity to produce k\u016bmara became ritualised \u2013 it was even associated with Rongom\u0101t\u0101ne (Rongo), a high-ranking {{lang|mi|atua}} (god).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/kumara/page-4|title=K\u016bmara \u2013 Religious aspects|last=Adds|first=Peter|encyclopedia=Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref> K\u016bmara featured in some {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}} (proverbs): \"{{lang|mi|Kaore te k\u016bmara e k\u014drero mo t\u014dna m\u0101ngaro}}\" (the k\u016bmara does not speak of its own sweetness) encouraged people to be modest.\n\nSeasonal activities included gardening, fishing and the hunting of birds.

[[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]] estimated there were only 1100 Europeans in the North Island in 1839, with 200 being missionaries, and a total of about 500\u2013600 Europeans in the Bay of Islands.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=101}} The northern M\u0101ori population at the time has been estimated at about 30,000 to 40,000, down from about 100,000, fifty years before.<ref name=\":1\" /> This drop in population was mostly due to [[Measles|disease]] and the [[Musket Wars]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/171949|title=2. \u2013 Taupori M\u0101ori \u2013 M\u0101ori population change \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nFor decades, European missionaries, mostly living in the north of the North Island, had very little influence over M\u0101ori behaviour. Missionaries report being appalled at the violent, seemingly arbitrary nature of M\u0101ori behaviour. This included warfare, slavery, cannibalism, sexual abuse of women, killing of female children and revenge killings. However, by 1840, many of these customs were all but abolished or not publicly practised.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=220}}\n\nIn the coastal South Island, the M\u0101ori population was very small. Whalers set up shore stations along the southern and eastern coasts and formed M\u0101ori\u2013European working communities. In the early 1800s, it was common for chiefs to provide whalers with M\u0101ori wives, often their daughters. By the 1820s, European men had married about 200 M\u0101ori women in the coastal area between modern Christchurch and Invercargill, about half of all the marriageable aged women in the South Island \u2013 in fact, M\u0101ori men were finding it hard to compete for wives.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=320}}\n\nContact with Europeans enabled M\u0101ori to access the material culture of England, then the most advanced industrial nation in the world. By 1800, the desire for iron objects such as large ships' nails overcame apprehension about boarding an anchored ship and this drove M\u0101ori trading behaviour, lasting until 1840.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=32}} Desirable steel objects and blankets were at first traded for fish. M\u0101ori were generally very curious about European culture after initial misunderstandings and apprehension, with M\u0101ori showing great ability to accept changes and integrating these into their normal way of life{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}}<ref>''Climates of War''. E. Bohan. p 29</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Marion Du Fresne gave northern M\u0101ori potatoes, wheat, onions, goats, pigs, chickens and other food to raise. Potatoes and pigs rapidly became a key part of M\u0101ori agriculture in the north, but the new food was almost exclusively reserved for trading purposes, with M\u0101ori still eating fish and fern roots, supplemented by [[k\u016bmara]]. Later, as M\u0101ori grew large areas of potatoes (Hongi Hika had a 40-acre potato field), whalers would call into the Bay of Islands, in particular, to trade for fresh supplies.\n\nOne significant change was the immediacy of reciprocation in trade. In tradition M\u0101ori tikanga, when an item was given there was no expectation of immediate response as gifted items were mainly food, which was governed by seasonal supply. When dealing with Europeans, M\u0101ori learnt that immediate payment was expected. Gift giving was a different matter in M\u0101ori culture. Gifts were given to recognise {{lang|mi|mana}} (power or authority).{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=112}}\n\nBurial practices also changed to incorporate aspects of Christianity. Bodies were usually buried in the ground by the mid 1840s although sometimes coffins, decorated with M\u0101ori motifs were used, suspended in trees or on poles as drawn by J. Polack.

In 1900 few M\u0101ori lived in European urban settlements. This changed very slowly. There were only 1,766 M\u0101ori in Auckland in 1935. In 1936 only 11.2% of M\u0101ori lived in urban areas. By 1945 this had risen to 19% and by 1971 to 68%. These changes reflect a significant alteration in the basis for income and employment \u2013 from working on rural land to working mainly in construction, freezing works or labouring. The dominant factors influencing this shift were the burgeoning M\u0101ori population and the inability of the land to support the increasing population.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, MP Ngata had passed land legislation to help M\u0101ori make better use of their remaining tribal land. M\u0101ori were handicapped in using and developing the land for modern agriculture as much M\u0101ori land was steep, remote, erosion-prone with high rainfall.{{sfn|King|2001|pages=101\u2013107}} European farmers who owned their land freehold mechanised to gain higher productivity, using bank loans for the new equipment. M\u0101ori were unable to gain loans as their land was generally tribal land and could not be used for securing individual loans. Leasing land to European farmers gave M\u0101ori a steady income but this was spread among many people. M\u0101ori farming was often based on a different system of values and not driven by European goals of efficiency and high productivity.{{sfn|King|2001|page=103}}\n\nApart from jobs, another attraction to urban migration were the monetary, recreational and lifestyle attractions of the city. Many M\u0101ori felt that success lay in the city rather than the country. King describes this as a \"fantasy contagion-the realty did not live up to the myth but this did not stop the fantasy or the migration\".{{sfn|King|2001|page=104}}\nOther changes were a rising birth rate. In 1955, the M\u0101ori birth rate was nearly double the European rate at 43.6 compared to 26 per 1000. At the same time, M\u0101ori had fewer qualifications. In 1956 6.5% of M\u0101ori held professional, managerial or clerical jobs compared to 26.7% non-M\u0101ori. As a result, only 3.36% of M\u0101ori earned 700 pounds or more per annum compared to 18.6% for non-M\u0101ori.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}} M\u0101ori were significantly impacted by changing economic circumstances such as the drop in wool prices. This made M\u0101ori more vulnerable to economic and social deprivation. King says that the lower M\u0101ori educational attainment lead to lower income jobs, which led to lower income, poor housing, and poor health, which in turn led to higher rates of crime.{{sfn|King|2001|page=105}}\n\nThese ingredients were potential causes of racial tension. They were seen by the wider community as \"M\u0101ori problems\". By the 1970s and 1980s, enough urbanised M\u0101ori had reached positions of influence to bring about a gradual but radical change to the thinking of governments. Their advocacy was underscored by an increasing willingness to use [[M\u0101ori protest movement|vigorous protest to push Mana M\u0101ori]].

The expression, an abstraction of the word for aristocracy, had been coined by Henry Williams in the Treaty of Waitangi to convey the idea of \"chieftainship\". However, the term was often used by M\u0101ori to express the idea of political rights for all M\u0101ori, not just the {{lang|mi|rangatira}} class, or the idea of M\u0101ori sovereignty or M\u0101ori independence.\n\nEducated urban M\u0101ori advocated the teaching of M\u0101ori language and the inclusion of a M\u0101ori point of view in all aspects of education.

Mana is sacred power bestowed by the gods on the ancestral lineage of chiefs, or {{lang|mi|tohunga}}. While the {{lang|mi|mana}} itself is a supernatural gift, the chief is free to waste or magnify it.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=15}} Historian Judith Binney says that maintaining and increasing the {{lang|mi|mana}} of {{lang|mi|whanau}} and {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and loyalty within the group is unquestionably at the heart of M\u0101ori cultural concepts. She says that M\u0101ori cultural history is confusing to the uninformed as it consists of narrative-myths that stretch far back in time. Also confusing is that chronological time is irrelevant or distorted<ref>Stories Without End. J. Binney, p 182</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} to the M\u0101ori cultural story, so a person living in the present may narrate a story about their family or hap\u016b that happened centuries ago; nonetheless, the narrator appears as a contemporary figure in the myth.\n\nA key element of cultural leadership is to link the narrator to a well known historical figure with mana (prestige/authority power).<ref>Stories Without End, J Binney, pp. 78\u201385</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} This is why being able to recite the family history is so important. In M\u0101ori culture names of people and places are fluid. Individuals may change their name several times or have several different names that they use depending on the cultural situation. In the past, hap\u016b changed names if they moved to another area where an alternative name was more positive. One of the main reasons for name fluidity was access to resources. As a hap\u016b moved seasonally to utilise different resources its name changed to reflect an ancestor who had historical-cultural rights to that resource. Binney says that being connected to a powerful hap\u016b with many well-known ancestors was important for protection and survival. As M\u0101ori communication was almost totally oral until well into the contact period, oral myth-narratives became more varied to match the needs of each hap\u016b or whanau.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Whakapapa}} (genealogy) ===\n{{lang|mi|[[Whakapapa]]}} is the origin and path of descent of a person, object or geographic area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/whakapapa-genealogy|title=Whakapapa \u2013 genealogy \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|last=Taonga|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-12}}</ref> A person's {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} establishes their mana and tribal connections.

In the context of a gift exchange, {{lang|mi|utu}} creates and preserves social connections and commitments. {{lang|mi|Utu}} recovers balance in the event that social relations are interrupted.

Firstly giving had to have the appearance of being free and spontaneous, without stipulation of a return present. Secondly, a strict system of obligation was in force whereby the receiver was bound to not only reciprocate but to increase the value of the reciprocated gift.

A {{lang|mi|marae}} is the centre for much of M\u0101ori community life. Generally the [[M\u0101ori language]] is used in ceremonies and speeches, although translations and explanations are provided when the primary participants are not M\u0101ori speakers.

The {{lang|mi|marae}} symbolises group unity and generally consists of an open cleared area in front of a large carved meeting house, along with a dining hall and other facilities necessary to provide a comfortable stay for visiting groups. On the {{lang|mi|marae}} official functions take place including formal welcomes, celebrations, weddings, christenings, reunions, and {{lang|mi|[[tangihanga]]}} (funerals). The older people have the authority on the {{lang|mi|marae}}, and they impart, primarily through [[oral tradition]], traditions and cultural practices to the young people. These include [[genealogy]], [[spirituality]], [[Public speaking|oratory]], and politics, and arts such as [[music composition]], performance, [[weaving]], or carving.\n\nThe {{lang|mi|hui}} or meeting, usually on a marae. It begins with a {{lang|mi|[[p\u014dwhiri]]}} (a welcoming ceremony). If a visitor is noteworthy, he or she may be welcomed with an aggressive challenge by a warrior armed with a {{lang|mi|[[taiaha]]}} (traditional fighting staff), who then offers a token of peace, such as a fern frond, to the visitor. Acceptance of the token in the face of such aggression is a demonstration of the courage and {{lang|mi|[[mana]]}} of the visitor. The {{lang|mi|p\u014dwhiri}} is highly structured, with speeches from both hosts and guests following a traditional format, their sequence dictated by the {{lang|mi|kawa}} (protocol) of that place, and followed by {{lang|mi|[[M\u0101ori music|waiata]]}}, songs. {{lang|mi|Hui}} are held for business, for festivities or for rites of passage such as baptism, marriage and death.

The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} consists of a shallow hole dug in the ground, in which a fire is prepared and stones are placed on the top. When the stones are hot, prepared food is placed on top of them, meat first and then vegetables such as k\u016bmara, potatoes and pumpkin. The {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} is then covered with leaves or mats woven out of {{lang|mi|[[Phormium tenax|harakeke]]}}, or wet sacks, and soil is then heaped over the {{lang|mi|h\u0101ngi}} to seal in the heat to cook the food.\n\n=== {{lang|mi|Marae}} events ===\nLike in pre-European times, {{lang|mi|marae}} continue to be the location of many ceremonial events, including birthdays, weddings, and anniversaries.

As indicated by Ka'ai and Higgins, \"the importance of the {{lang|mi|tangihanga}} and its central place in {{lang|mi|marae}} custom is reflected in the fact that it takes precedence over any other gathering on the {{lang|mi|marae}}\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Ki te whaiao: An introduction to M\u0101ori culture and society|last1=Ka'ai|first1=T.

It almost always takes place on the home {{lang|mi|marae}} of the deceased. The rituals followed are essentially Christian. The {{lang|mi|tangi}} begins with a {{lang|mi|powhiri}} to welcome guests. It is normal for M\u0101ori to travel very long distances to attend the {{lang|mi|tangi}} of a loved one. Often black clothes are worn, following Victorian practices. Guests will speak formally about the deceased on the {{lang|mi|marae atea}} often referring to tribal history and using humour. Pathos is commonly used to create a feeling of comfort and unity. Speeches are supported by {{lang|mi|waiata}} (songs). The {{lang|mi|whanau}} of the deceased sit by the coffin on the {{lang|mi|wharenui}} porch but do not speak or reply. The family may often hold or display photos of the deceased or important ancestors. A {{lang|mi|tangi}} may go on for several days, especially for a person of great {{lang|mi|mana}}.

Oratory, the making of speeches, is especially important in the rituals of encounter, and it is regarded as important for a speaker to include allusions to traditional narrative and to a complex system of proverbial sayings, called {{lang|mi|whakatauk\u012b}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.korero.maori.nz/forlearners/proverbs.html|title=Whakatauk\u012b \u2013 Proverbs|work=korero.maori.nz website}}</ref> Oral traditions include songs, calls, chants, {{lang|mi|haka}} and formalised speech patterns that recall the history of the people.\n\n=== Other traditional buildings ===\n[[File:Pataka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|Pataka}} with {{lang|mi|[[tekoteko]]}}|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori Village.jpg|thumb|A M\u0101ori village, {{circa|late 1800s}}|alt=|260x260px]]\nThe standard building in a classic M\u0101ori settlement was a simple sleeping {{lang|mi|whare puni}} (house/hut) about 2 metres x 3 metres with a low roof, an earth floor, no window and a single low doorway. Heating was provided by a small open fire in winter. There was no chimney.\n\nMaterial used in construction varied between areas, but raupo reeds, flax and totara bark shingles for the roof were common.<ref>Te Papa Museum of NZ. Wharepuni.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Similar small {{lang|mi|whare}}, but with interior drains, were used to store k\u016bmara on sloping racks.\n\nIn the classic period a higher proportion of {{lang|mi|whare}} were located inside {{lang|mi|p\u0101}} than was the case after contact with Europeans. A chief's {{lang|mi|whare}} was similar but larger \u2014 often with full headroom in the centre, a small window and a partly enclosed front porch. In times of conflict the chief lived in a {{lang|mi|whare}} on the {{lang|mi|tihi}} or summit of a hill {{lang|mi|p\u0101}}. In colder areas, such as in the North Island central plateau, it was common for {{lang|mi|whare}} to be partly sunk into the ground for better insulation.\n\nFood was not cooked in the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}} but in the open or under a {{lang|mi|kauta}} (lean-to). Saplings with branches and foliage removed were used to store and dry items such as fishing nets or cloaks. Valuable items were stored in pole-mounted storage shelters called {{lang|mi|pataka}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=White|first=John|author-link=John White (ethnographer)|title=The Ancient History of the Maori, His Mythology and Traditions|volume=V1|year=1888|publisher=Pataka.

This practice was done in order to express the buildings' significance and to secure the gods' protection. For smaller buildings, small animals were sacrificed to distinguish it from other buildings and to exhibit its uniqueness.{{sfn|Mol|1981|page=13}}\n\nThe traditional M\u0101ori {{lang|mi|whare}} continued to be used in rural areas in particular well into the post-contact period. They were usually very small with a dirt floor and full of vermin, especially fleas.

Moon Penguin 2014</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Even as late as 1849 George Cooper, the assistant private secretary to George Grey, described a village in the relatively affluent lower Eastern Waihou River area as \"a wretched place, containing about a dozen miserable raupo huts all tumbling to pieces\".<ref>Voyages.p 211.

In the 19th century settlements were {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}-based, and 5 buildings became standardised: the sleeping {{lang|mi|whare}}, {{lang|mi|kauta}} or communal cookhouse/shelter, {{lang|mi|whata}} or wood store, {{lang|mi|pataka}} or storehouse, and increasingly from the 1870s {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} or community meeting house. Significant finance and {{lang|mi|mana}} was invested in increasingly elaborate meeting houses which became a source of {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} or {{lang|mi|iwi}} pride and prestige.\n\nA meeting house was likely to have outside carvings and increasingly as European tools were used, intricate interior carving and woven panels depicting tribal history. Rotorua became a centre of carving excellence under the encouragement of the M\u0101ori MPs in the Young M\u0101ori party. Itinerant specialist carvers travelled widely, employing their skills in many locations. Meetinghouses became places for tribal celebrations or political meetings, especially after the 1860s Land Wars. They were a place to display largesse and enhance {{lang|mi|mana}} with elaborate feasts and entertainment. By the 20th century {{lang|mi|wharepuni}} were common and averaged 18\u201324m long by 8m wide. There were no M\u0101ori buildings of this size in pre-European days. As M\u0101ori became familiar with European building construction and design they incorporated features such as chimneys and fireplaces and made use of bigger doorways and windows as well as sawn timber but even by the turn of the 19th century toilet facilities were often primitive, despite the urgings of the M\u0101ori MPs Pomare and Ngata who worked hard to improve the standard of M\u0101ori dwellings over their many years in office.{{sfn|King|2001|page=47}}<ref>Maori MPs.NZ History online.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Mythology and religion ==\n{{main|M\u0101ori mythology|M\u0101ori religion|Taniwha}}\n{{Tall image|KupeWheke.jpg|150|300|alt=Tall wooden carving showing Kupe above two tentacled sea creatures|Late 20th-century [[whakairo|carving]] depicting the mythological navigator [[Kupe]] fighting two sea creatures|right}}\nTraditional M\u0101ori religion, has deviated little from its tropical Eastern [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] roots on the island of [[Hawaiki|Hawaiki Nui]].

The early European explorer and painter Earle noted in 1827 that these diseases were common even in isolated inland districts such as Taupo. His M\u0101ori advisers said the diseases were very old.\n\nEarle recognised that {{lang|mi|tohunga}} used a range of plants to treat minor skin ailments. Much later European doctors advocated investigation of the medicinal properties of plants commonly used in M\u0101ori medicine.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n===Missionaries===\n[[File:Whare Karakia o Onuku.jpg|thumb|Church near Onuku marae, Banks Peninsula. Opened in 1878 as the first non-denominational church in New Zealand.]]\nCMS missionaries insisted M\u0101ori abandon cannibalism and child infanticide before they could be baptised. They tried to discourage polygamy. Some early missionaries had sympathy for abandoned wives but Henry Williams was adamant that polygamy disqualified M\u0101ori from baptism. CMS missionaries also outlawed the use of further {{lang|mi|moko}}, taking part in lewd dances and practising customary funeral rites.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}} Catholic missionaries who arrived 20 years after the Church of England CMS missionaries were less concerned with stopping these customary practices before Christian conversion. They reasoned that they could influence M\u0101ori more effectively after baptism and were subsequently successful in attracting many converts in the western Hokianga district, away from the dominant CMS influence.\n\nMissionaries did not arrive in the Waikato until about 1834\u20135. CMS Mission Stations were established at Manakau, Maraetai, Waikato Heads, Kaitotehe opposite Tuapiri, Te Awamutu, Kopua and Kawhia. Missionaries helped explain the Treaty of Waitangi to Tainui in 1840.\n\n=== First M\u0101ori interpretation of Christianity===\nIn the 1830s Te Atua Wera started the Papahurihia Faith in opposition to the missionaries. It mixed Christian, Judaic and M\u0101ori customary influences. They held services on Saturday and called themselves {{lang|mi|Hurai}} or Jews. Te Atua Wera reverted to the more customary role of a {{lang|mi|tohunga}} figure by the late 1830s. Te Atua Wera taught that heaven was a place where there was happiness, no cold or hunger with an abundance of flour, sugar, muskets, ships, murder and voluptuousness.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=175}}\n\n== Children and education ==\n[[File:SwingAngas1847.JPG|thumb|A group of M\u0101ori children on a morere swing (1847)]]\n\n=== Childhood ===\nEarly European reports suggest that M\u0101ori children were indulged and led a carefree and playful life. A French explorer in 1772 commented that \"[the women] seemed to be good mothers and showed affection for their offspring. I have often seen them play with the children, caress them, chew the fern-root, pick at the stringy parts, and then take it out of their mouth to put it into that of their nurslings. The men were also very fond of and kind to their children.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} French missionary Jean-Simon Bernard wrote, disapprovingly, in 1844: \"The children here are completely free; the parents never do anything to them. They never beat them and do not allow anyone else to beat them.\"{{sfn|Salmond|1991|page=422}} The killing of children could be the ''take'' (cause) of war.

Bishop Selwyn took adult M\u0101ori to Sydney where they experienced limited schooling to learn English. When missionaries back in arrived in the Bay of Islands they realised that if they were going to introduce Christianity and change what they considered to be barbaric practices like cannibalism, slavery, lewd dancing and having multiple wives, they would need to establish schools. Both the missionaries and their wives constructed schools and provided slates and bibles as reading material. The first school was established by T. Kendal in 1816. Recently original slates and written material from that period in the Bay of Islands has been located, photographed and published. Some adults attended school but most pupils were the sons or daughter of chiefs or other persons of status.\n\nBy 1853 Mr and Mrs Ashwell had been running a mission school at Taupiri in the Waikato for 50 M\u0101ori girls for 3 years. The girls learnt arithmetic and reading.<ref>Voyagers.p63. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} In the early 1860s Governor Grey had provided money to support a trade school near Te Awamutu in the Waikato. The aim was to produce M\u0101ori workers who were literate but could also work with, and repair, agricultural machinery as used on farms and in the new flour mills. In 1863 the renegade Rewi Maniapoto attacked and burnt down the school, stealing the printing press. He aimed to kill leading Europeans in the area but they had been warned by friendly M\u0101ori and left before the attack. Because of the negative influence of Maniapoto and other anti-government factions, the school had previously had poor attendance, with as few as 10 boys attending regularly. All teaching by missionaries was in M\u0101ori and this continued in the native schools until 1900 when at the insistence of the Young M\u0101ori Party M\u0101ori MPs, schools started teaching in English. Influential M\u0101ori MPs [[\u0100pirana Ngata|Ngata]] and [[M\u0101ui P\u014dmare|P\u014dmare]] insisted that M\u0101ori be taught modern ways and sponsored the Suppression of Tohungaism Act in parliament. P\u014dmare, in particular, worked hard to banish ancient M\u0101ori concepts and practices that caused harm in the M\u0101ori community.<ref>The Encyclopedia of New Zealand, Maui Pomare.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Food ==\n[[File:Mount hobson Auckland kumara pits.jpg|thumb|Pits where kumara were stored to protect them over the winter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/218774|title=K\u016bmara storage pits, 1930|last=Godber|first=Albert Percy|publisher= New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|work=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref>|alt=|260x260px]]\n[[File:Maori earth oven.svg|thumb|{{lang|mi|H\u0101ngi}} or earth ovens are still used today to cook food|alt=|260x260px]]\n{{See also|M\u0101ori cuisine|H\u0101ngi}}\n\n=== Traditional M\u0101ori foods ===\nEating shellfish such as mussels and oysters was very common. During summer sea fish such as kahawai were caught using bone or {{lang|mi|[[Lygodium articulatum|mangemange]]}} hooks, 2-piece lures or large flax nets. In creeks and lakes, eels were caught in large numbers when migrating along known waterways using {{lang|mi|hinaki}}, a long cone-shaped net. Birds such as ducks were targeted during the moulting season and young birds such as Petrels and Gannets were taken from nests and cooked in their own fat to preserve them. Such preserved birds were favourite gifts to fulfil social gift obligations. M\u0101ori closely observed the natural world to take advantage of seasonal opportunities. Native pigeons ate [[Miro (tree)|miro]] berries which made them thirsty. M\u0101ori carved wooden bowls equipped with multiple neck snares and placed these in miro trees to catch these large birds.\n\nEvidence from many recent Eastern Golden Bay excavations, especially at Tata Beach, shows that in middens local shellfish and fish bones were most prominent, followed by dog ({{lang|mi|kur\u012b}}) bones and rat bones. Less common were bones from small birds and sea mammals. The Tata Beach site and other nearby sites such as Takapou were in use from 1450 up to 1660 AD, well into the Classic period. The coastal sites showed that M\u0101ori had created man-made soils in the sand dunes ranging from small to very large (over 100m<sup>2</sup>). The natural soil A horizons had been modified by placing dark, humus-rich soil near the surface.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\">{{cite journal|last=Barber|first=Ian|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=53|date=Dec 2012|title=Gardens of Rongo|doi=10.1086/667834}}</ref> This practice was widespread in M\u0101ori communities where k\u016bmara was grown, although in many cases free-draining sand, gravels and pumice were mixed with humus-rich loam. K\u016bmara are slow-growing in the temperate NZ climate and need free-draining subsoils. In the Eastern Golden Bay north-facing slopes were favoured.<ref name=\"gardensofrongo\" />\n\nThe warmer climate of the north and northern and central coastal regions allowed better growth of subtropical plants such as k\u016bmara, yam and gourds. In Auckland, and on Mayor Island, volcanic land was cleared of rocks which were used for low shelter walls. In some areas piles of volcanic rock which kept warm at night, were used to train the vines of gourds.\n\nMany special techniques had been devised to grow and especially to store k\u016bmara so it did not rot. Careful storage and use of {{lang|mi|tapu}} was essential to prevent unauthorised use. Seed k\u016bmara in particular were highly {{lang|mi|tapu}}. The main problem for k\u016bmara growers were native caterpillars. Early European explorers reported that M\u0101ori often ringed a garden with burning vegetation in an attempt to control caterpillars. M\u0101ori continued to use traditional fern roots \u2014 {{lang|mi|aruhe}} \u2014 as a normal part of their diet into the mid-19th century.\n\n=== Introduced foods ===\nThe introduction of European foods changed many aspects of M\u0101ori agriculture. Under tradition, M\u0101ori agriculture land was abandoned after a few crops because of reduced production. This was the common pattern apart from a few very fertile alluvial river valleys. Fertiliser was not used{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} although M\u0101ori had devised various techniques to enhance production such as the addition of pumice or similar materials to improve drainage on heavy soils. M\u0101ori allowed gardens to revert to shrubs and plantations were shifted to another area. The introduction of foreign weeds which thrived was a significant issue from the 1820s but offset by the widespread growth of the introduced potato, the traditional varieties of which are still grown and known as {{lang|mi|taewa}} or [[M\u0101ori potatoes]].\n\nEuropean farms and the methods they used became a cultural and economic magnet for M\u0101ori{{sfn|Belgrave|2013|page=110}} in the North, in Auckland and later in the Te Awamutu area of the Waikato. Under the tuition of missionaries, M\u0101ori learnt to mass-produce food, especially potatoes, far in excess of their own needs for trading into the late 1850s. In 1858 European numbers equalled M\u0101ori numbers and increasingly European farmers were able to supply towns such as Auckland. At the same time the strong market demand for supplying food to the gold rush markets in Australia and California ended.\n\n== Trade and travel ==\n\n===Transport===\n{{main|Waka (canoe)}}\n[[File:Abaconda New Zealand maori waka.jpg|thumb|{{lang|mi|[[Waka (canoe)|Waka]]}} (canoes) are built in a variety of sizes depending on their purpose, including deep-sea fishing, river crossings or historically war and migration.]]\nThe normal M\u0101ori method of travel was on foot. The North Island had an extensive network of single lane one metre wide tracks that traversed beaches, plains, valleys and mountain passes. Some of these tracks were used by many {{lang|mi|iwi}} and were considered neutral territory. Missionaries who travelled with M\u0101ori guides found that at river crossings canoes were left for the use of any traveller.<ref>Tainui. L. Kelly.2002.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} Between 1840 and 1850 numbers of explorers, artists, government officials including Governor Grey travelled inland with the aid of M\u0101ori guides. The guides carried heavy loads and would carry Europeans across creeks. Crossing swamps was common. Although they carried some food they relied on purchasing basic foodstuffs such as potatoes or native pigeons from M\u0101ori settlements. The most popular payment was in tobacco which was in great demand. In more remote areas travellers sometimes found M\u0101ori living by themselves and growing a few potatoes.<ref>Voyages. P. Moon. Penguin. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\nCanoes ({{lang|mi|[[waka (canoe)|waka]]}}) were used extensively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/page-1|title=Waka \u2013 canoes |work=Te Ara}}</ref> These ranged from small river-going boats, to the large {{lang|mi|waka taua}} sea-going war vessels carrying up to 80 paddlers, and up to {{convert|40|m|ft}} long.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waka-canoes/3|title=Waka taua|work=Te Ara}}</ref> Waka were used extensively for long-range travel down the east coast and to cross Cook Strait. In 1822\u201323 [[Te Rauparah\u0101]], who had established a base by capturing Kapiti Island, reconnoitred the upper South Island in waka before launching a seaborne invasion the following year against Ng\u0101i Tahu and Rangit\u0101ne iwi. Te Rauparah\u0101 later hired a European ship to attack Akaroa Harbour.{{sfn|King|2003}} This showed that Te Rauparaha was prepared to use Western technology to further his own  goals. [[Henry Williams (missionary)|Henry Williams]], who followed several war parties, reported as many as 50 waka taua travelling together at one time, although he reported they only went out to sea in relatively calm weather. From 1835 large numbers of European ships entered the Bay of Islands every year with Henry Williams reporting an average of 70\u201380 ships per year. Many M\u0101ori men worked on the ships, with a reported average of eight M\u0101ori seamen per whaling ship. Ten metre long whaleboats began to be used by M\u0101ori. They could be both rowed and sailed.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012}} In the 1850s as M\u0101ori with the active encouragement of Grey embraced trade were gradually able to develop a large fleet of small trading schooners and similar craft. All the initial European centres had been supported by Maori.\n\n[[File:Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing.jpg|thumb|Maori war canoe, drawing by Alexander Sporing, [[First voyage of James Cook|Cook's first voyage]], 1769]]\nDuring the mid 19th century Auckland and Northland M\u0101ori dominated shipping trade. In 1851 51 vessels were registered and 30 smaller vessels licensed. By 1857 there were 37 schooners. The fleet increased steadily during the Tasman trade boom of 1853\u201356. M\u0101ori paid customs duties to the government and invested heavily in vessels, so suffered considerably when a dramatic market slump hit New Zealand especially effecting the Auckland\u2013Waikato\u2013Hauraki area.<ref>Climates of War. E. Bohan. pp 36\u201337.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}} During the musket war period and for a time afterwards, Maori, isolated from their tribal support by these devastating conflicts, hid in isolated places, living off patches of vegetables they grew in tiny gardens. This practice was very common in Taranaki which had been devastated by Waikato attacks in particular. European explorers, such as Dieffenbach, often stumbled upon these survivors while exploring. He described these {{lang|mi|whare}} as hotbeds for rats and vermin.<ref>P. Moon. p. 111. 2014.</ref>{{cnf|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Trade===\nWith the arrival of Europeans M\u0101ori gradually started to trust the value of British money and use it as a medium of exchange instead of goods. This was rare before 1834 but became increasingly common as more M\u0101ori worked as sailors on European ships, where they gained a good reputation as being strong capable workers.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=West|first=Jonathan|title=The Face of Nature: An Environmental History of the Otago Peninsula|date=March 2018|publisher=[[University of Otago|Otago University]] Press|isbn=978-1-92732238-3|location=Dunedin|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Az_ltwEACAAJ&dq=face+of+nature}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/economic-history/page-2|title=2. \u2013 Economic history \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\nBy 1839 a large proportion of the M\u0101ori trade in goods was paid for in cash, with M\u0101ori showing a strong preference for coins rather than paper banknotes. Northern M\u0101ori learnt that they could more easily hide cash from their relatives avoiding the traditional obligatory sharing of goods with their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. The period 1835 to 1840 completed the revolution in the north M\u0101ori economy with M\u0101ori abandoning many of their former trading habits and adopting those of the Europeans to the point where M\u0101ori became dependent on the flow of European goods to maintain their new way of life.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|pages=130\u2013135}}\n \nThe effect of trading increased the influence of chiefs over their {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}}. Northern traders assumed that the chief was the organisational head of the {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and all trade went through him including payments for goods purchased. This gave chiefs much more influence, especially after 1835, because trade was so regular. In pre-contact times the power of chiefs was never very great, largely being restricted to directing warfare.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=203}} Early European observers noted that at {{lang|mi|hap\u016b}} and {{lang|mi|whanuau hui}} (meetings) every person, including women, had their say and the chief had no more influence than any other person on the final decision. Where a chief had great {{lang|mi|mana}}, especially powers of persuasion, chiefs had more influence because of their personality rather than any recognised authority.\n \nNot all {{lang|mi|iwi}} had regular contact with Europeans. The French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visited Tasman Bay in 1827 and using knowledge he had picked up at the Bay of Islands was able to communicate with local M\u0101ori. He found that although they had some passing awareness of Europeans\u2014they seemed to know about firearms\u2014the extent of their understanding was far less than that of the Northern M\u0101ori.{{sfn|Moon|2012|page=128}}\n\nIn the Waikato regular contact did not start until five decades after contact in the north of New Zealand. It was not until Ng\u0101ti Toa was forced out of Kawhia in 1821 that the bulk of the Tainui people had contact with Europeans. In 1823 a man called Te Puaha visited the Bay of Islands, bringing back with him Captain Kent who arrived by ship at Kawhia.\n\nBy 1859 trade was the main area in which M\u0101ori interacted with Europeans. Trade was an area that M\u0101ori expected to control. From first contact, they had sold or exchanged fresh foodstuffs initially for high-value goods such as axes and later for money. George Grey was keen to encourage M\u0101ori trade and commerce and established new laws to empower them in 1846. M\u0101ori brought numerous cases under this legislation and won. This was their first and most successful legal experience.<ref>{{cite book|last=Burke|first=E.|title=Climates of War|year=2005|publisher=Hazard Press|page=36}}</ref> M\u0101ori had begun to include European concepts into their own cultural behaviour. In 1886 banknotes were printed (but not issued) by Te Peeke o Aotearoa, a bank established by [[T\u0101whiao]] the [[M\u0101ori King Movement|M\u0101ori King]]. The text on these notes was M\u0101ori and there was also a picture of a flax bush. The bank's cheques had M\u0101ori figures and native birds and plants drawn on them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/213266|title=1. \u2013 Coins and banknotes \u2013 Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu Taonga|website=teara.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2019-01-11}}</ref>\n\n=== Land negotiations ===\n{{main|M\u0101ori Land Court|Treaty of Waitangi claims and settlements}}\nThe M\u0101ori relationship with the land is complex. Traditionally the resources the land held were controlled based on systems of {{lang|mi|mana}} (power) and {{lang|mi|whakapapa}} (ancestral right). The land itself was both sacred and abstract. In many cases multiple groups would express a connection with the same important river or mountain. Oral tradition would record the migrations of groups from one area to another and their connection with an ancestral location.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn the early 19th century many Europeans entered into dealings with M\u0101ori to obtain land for their use. In some cases settlers thought they were buying land to obtain equivalent to freehold title under British law; M\u0101ori claimed that the various deeds signed by M\u0101ori were more limited and conditional, stopping short of outright alienation. It has been argued that the use of the word {{lang|mi|tuku}} in deeds, meaning to let or allow or give freely, was not the same as selling. This and other interpretations of early 19th century New Zealand land deals have been the source of much disagreement both within the [[Waitangi Tribunal]] process and outside it.<ref>Waitangi Tribunal, [https://forms.justice.govt.nz/search/Documents/WT/wt_DOC_68635760/Muriwhenua%20Land.pdf Muriwhenua Land Report], p. 394</ref>{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nM\u0101ori, especially after 1830, were eager to have Europeans living on their land under their protection so they could benefit from European knowledge and trade. Missionaries on the other hand were keen to buy land so they could grow their own food to make them less dependent on tribal \"protectors\", who sometimes used food supplies to coerce them. Settlers allowed M\u0101ori to stay on the land they had \"bought\" and often continued to give presents to tribal chiefs, often prompted by the chiefs themselves, in order to maintain friendly relationships. These compromises stopped with the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi.{{sfn|O'Malley|2012|page=147}}\n\nAnother reason for M\u0101ori to \"sell\" land to missionaries was to protect the title of the land from other tribal competitors. M\u0101ori who had converted to Christianity wanted to protect their land without resorting to warfare. Some degree of control passed to the missionaries who M\u0101ori trusted to allow them continued access and use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz/WhyaTreaty.html|title=The Treaty of Waitangi|website=www.treatyofwaitangi.net.nz|access-date=2017-07-27}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1840 generally, older chiefs were reluctant to sell while younger chiefs were in favour. The situation was complicated as M\u0101ori often had overlapping rights on poorly defined land. The settlers and the government also had very limited access to trained surveyors and even freehold land boundaries were ill-defined. Surveying was a relatively new skill and involved much hard physical work especially in hill country. New farmers were able to purchase a small freehold farm from M\u0101ori on which they established their homestead and farm buildings. They then entered into leases with M\u0101ori owners for much larger areas of land. Short-term leases gave M\u0101ori a powerful position as there was a large demand for grazing land.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\nThe Native Lands Act was a policy enforced by the government in 1865, which allowed the M\u0101ori people to obtain individual titles for their land to sell. This act abolished the traditional shared landholdings and made it easier for European settlers to directly purchase land for themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sorrenson|first=M. P.

These claims against the government were to become a major feature of {{lang|mi|iwi}} politics. Each generation of leaders were judged based on their ability to progress a land claim.{{sfn|Belgrave|2013}}\n\n== Leadership and politics ==\n{{see also|M\u0101ori politics}}\n\n=== M\u0101ori kingship ===\n{{Main|M\u0101ori King Movement}}\nFrom the time of their arrival in New Zealand, M\u0101ori lived in tribes that functioned independently under the leadership of their own chiefs.

{"title_page": "Target Luna", "text_new": "{{EngvarB|date=November 2017}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2017}}\n{{italic title}}\n'''''Target Luna''''' was a British television serial broadcast by [[ABC Weekend TV]] in April 1960. It was written by [[Malcolm Hulke]] and Eric Paice, directed by Adrian Brown and produced by [[Sydney Newman]] who went on to co-create ''[[Doctor Who]]'' for the [[BBC]]. The first serial featured [[Frank Finlay]] as Conway Henderson and [[Michael Craze]] as Geoffrey Wedgwood. The show was successful and spawned three sequels: '''''Pathfinders in Space''''' (September 1960), '''''Pathfinders to Mars''''' (December 1960 \u2013 January 1961), and '''''Pathfinders to Venus''''' (March 1961) starring [[Gerald Flood]] and [[Stewart Guidotti]] in the recast roles.\n\n==Serials==\nOver four serials, ''Target Luna'' and the ''Pathfinders'' proved tremendously successful with the viewing public, with episode 4 of ''Pathfinders to Mars'' getting to second place in audience ratings on New Year's Day 1961.\n\n==''Target Luna''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 6'''\n\n* ''The Rocket Station''\n* ''Count Down''\n* ''The Strange Illness''\n* ''Storm in Space''\n* ''Solar Flare''\n* ''The Falling Star''\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nProfessor Norman Wedgwood ([[David Markham]]) is the head of an experimental rocket group on remote Buchan Island in Scotland. His children, Geoff ([[Michael Craze]]), Valerie ([[Sylvia Davies]]) and Jimmy ([[Michael Hammond (actor)|Michael Hammond]]) visit him to watch the launch of his latest rocket, along with journalist Conway Henderson ([[Frank Finlay]]). When the pilot is taken ill, Jimmy finds himself taking his place on a mission to the Moon along with his pet hamster, Hamlet. After several harrowing hours in space, Jimmy, Hamlet and the rocket are finally brought down to earth.\n\nNote: No tape recordings of the serial are known to exist.\n\n==''Pathfinders in Space''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 7'''\n\n* ''Convoy to the Moon''\n* ''Spaceship from Nowhere''\n* ''Luna Bridgehead''\n* ''The Man in the Moon''\n* ''The World of Lost Toys''\n* ''Disaster on the Moon''\n* ''Rescue in Space''\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nProfessor Norman Wedgwood (now [[Peter Brian Williams|Peter Williams]]) and his team are planning another rocket mission to the Moon. Once again, Geoff, Valerie and Jimmy (now [[Stewart Guidotti]], [[Gillian Ferguson]] and [[Richard Dean (actor)|Richard Dean]]) are on hand to witness the launch of a new rocket MR1 (Moon Rocket 1), along with journalist friend Conway Henderson (now [[Gerald Flood]]). However, when the automatic supply ship MR2 (Moon Rocket 2) fails to launch Henderson and the children make a desperate rescue attempt with Jimmy's pet Hamlet (now a guinea pig).\n\nHenderson, Geoff and Jimmy (and Hamlet) set off in MR2, only to discover Valerie has stowed away. MR1 lands first with MR2 preparing to land via radio control. But on entry, MR2 nearly collides with an unknown object. Having landed safely, but a hundred miles off, the two parties set off to meet each other. On the way, Jimmy (and Hamlet) fall down a hole which turns out to be an airshaft that leads to a large cavern.\n\nInside, the MRI group discover an airlock, which leads them all to discover an alien craft. After the party of MR2 arrive, they discover the fossilised body of a man and find an ancient journal regarding the man was once part an alternative human, among others, who fled earth from a war only to die from lack of supplies on the Moon.\n\nElsewhere, meteors strike MR1 and the rocket explodes, meaning that only two members of the expedition of can leave in MR2. Then Wedgwood makes an attempt to fly the alien vessel. Eventually, the entire group return safely to earth. Once back home, Wedgwood remarks ''\"As man reaches out to towards the stars, who knows what he might find...\"''\n\n==''Pathfinders to Mars''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 6'''\n\n* ''The Imposter''\n* ''Sabotage in Space''\n* ''The Hostage''\n* ''Lichens!'' (live broadcast)\n* ''Zero Hour on the Red Planet'' (live broadcast)\n* ''Falling into the Sun'' (live broadcast)\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nA secondary mission in a new rocket, MR4 (Moon Rocket 4), to the Moon takes off from Buchan Island. This time Henderson takes the lead role as pilot accompanied by Professor Wedgwood's oldest son Geoff as radio operator, Professor Mary Meadows, Henderson's niece Margret ([[Hester Cameron]]) along with Hamlet. However one of the crew turns out to be science writer named Harcourt Brown ([[George Coulouris]]) who has plans to divert the ship to Mars determined there is life on the planet. Brown succeeds in getting MR4 to Mars, but with the length of the journey, the crew decide that the only way to get home is to find water on Mars.\n\nThankfully, MR4 has landed within a hundred miles of the polar ice cap so the group set off, Brown too, believing there to be life on Mars. Encountering [[Lichens]], crevasses and other perils, Brown is devastated when he discovers no intelligent life and feels cheated by the others. In doing so, he intends to leave the others behind on the planet. However, lichens manage to infiltrate MR4, stopping Brown and giving the Rocket crew a chance to overpower him.\n\nHowever, Earth has moved out of the Martian orbit, thus, making the journey home impossible. Yet Brown creates a theory that if they can use the gravity pull of the [[Sun]] to get home. Some time after setting off, the crew all slowly succumb to gamma rays from the Sun one-by-one. By a miracle, there is a total [[eclipse]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] shuts of the rays from the Sun but they quickly find themselves being pulled into Mercury's gravity pull.\n\nThe crew then realise that Buchan Island has made various satellite fixes on Mercury, thus enabling MR4 to make the home journey to Earth. As MR4 falls out of danger from the Sun's gamma rays, Brown ponders of the idea of other life on another planet and sees [[Venus]] as a possibility...\n\n==''Pathfinders to Venus''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 8'''\n\n* ''S.O.S From Venus''\n* ''Into the Poison Cloud''\n* ''The Living Planet''\n* ''The Creature''\n* ''The Venus People''\n* ''The City''\n* ''The Valley of the Monsters''\n* ''Planet on Fire''\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nReturning from their unexpected trip to Mars the crew of MR4 intercept a distress signal from Captain Wilson, a U.S astronaut, and must change course for Venus to attempt a rescue in space. However, through the space periscope, Brown sees what appears to be a settlement or a city of some sort. Desperate to investigate, Brown edits Wilson's message and tricks the crew into landing Venus so as they can rescue him.\n\nLanding on Venus, the crew discover, much to Brown's delight, that the planet is capable is sustaining life and is a vast jungle. Investigating further, the party find Wilson's rocket-capsule, the ''US V7'', ransacked and ripped apart from the inside by something. Brown gets separated from the others and finds Wilson, who then tricks him into finding his 'city'.\n\nHenderson, Meadows, Geoff, Rosie and Hamlet find the trail leading into the caves of the volcano and get separated. Whilst separated, Henderson, Geoff and Meadows find cavemen whilst Margret (and Hamlet) finds Wilson, Brown and a Venusian cave-child whom she names 'Kiki'. Reunited, the group are forced to escape the lava flow and find themselves in a desert.\n\nKeeping to the left and through the desert, the Wedgwood party discover dinosaurs, diamonds and uranium. When they get nearer Brown's city, they find it to be nothing but an ancient burial ground for Kiki's ancestors. As the journey progresses, the party realise that Venus is a living duplicate of Earth, with dinosaurs and prehistoric humans existing parallel to each other.\n\nFinally returning to the jungle, they discover the lava has set the jungle alight in the direction of MR4. Brown, determined that the planet must not be ruined from what they've seen, decides to set the rocket to overload. However, Henderson turns the tables on him, just in time to see a Russian rocket land nearby. The pilot, Colonel Korolyov, explains they have extra fuel for MR4, in exchange for Wilson's secret mission, which was in fact, an experiment in telecommunications.\n\nPreparing to leave, Brown announces he is remaining behind, since Kiki has lost her parents and aware of the responsibilities of hijacking MR4 in the first place and that to him, Venus is an unspoiled paradise.\n\nTaking off, MR4 is given fuel for the return journey in Space. Finally after months away from home, the Wedgwood party plus Wilson finally return to Earth on Buchan Island.\n\n==Full cast==\n\n===''Target Luna''===\nThe director for ''Target Luna'' was [[Adrian Brown (director)|Adrian Brown]].\n\n*[[David Markham]] as Professor Norman Wedgwood\n*[[John Cairney]] as Ian Murray\n*[[Frank Finlay]] as Conway Henderson\n*[[Michael Craze]] as Geoffrey Wedgwood\n*[[Sylvia Davies]] as Valerie Wedgwood\n*[[Michael Hammond (actor)|Michael Hammond]] as Jimmy Wedgwood\n*[[William Ingram (actor)|William Ingram]] as Flt.

Another key addition was that Jimmy's pet hamster, Hamlet, was also made into a guinea pig so it would be noticeable on screen. Despite the mass recast, many references were alluded of the previous serial, making this serial and the follow-ups canonical.\n\n*[[Peter Brian Williams|Peter Williams]] as Professor Norman Wedgwood\n*[[Harold Goldblatt]] as Dr. O'Connell\n*[[Gerald Flood]] as Conway Henderson\n*[[Stewart Guidotti]] as Geoffrey Wedgwood\n*[[Gillian Ferguson]] as Valerie Wedgwood\n*[[Richard Dean (actor)|Richard Dean]] as Jimmy Wedgwood\n*[[Pamela Barney]] as Professor Mary Meadows\n*[[Irene Sutcliffe]] as Jean Cary\n*[[Hugh Evans (actor)|Hugh Evans]] as Ian Murray\n*[[Astor Sklair]] as John Field\n*[[Michael Guest (actor)|Michael Guest]] as Michael Kennedy\n\n===''Pathfinders to Mars''===\n\nAs with the previous serial, Guy Verney remained as director.\n\nIn the sequel, Professor Wedgwood was retired in the first chapter leaving Conway Henderson as the lead character and Ian Murray as Buchan Island Controller. Also dropped were the characters of Valerie and Jimmy and a new character, Margret Henderson; Conway's niece was introduced. Another introduction was Harcourt Brown, a scientific writer and extraterrestrial theorist. The serial was written that the characters of Conway Henderson and Mary Meadows would be attracted to each other, despite the fact that the two characters hardly exchanged a word between each other in the previous serial.\n\n*Gerald Flood as Conway Henderson\n*[[George Coulouris]] as Harcourt Brown (Credited as 'The Imposter' in ''The Imposter'')\n*Stewart Guidotti as Geoffrey Wedgwood\n*Pamela Barney as Professor Mary Meadows\n*[[Hester Cameron]] as Margret Henderson\n*Hugh Evans as Ian Murray\n*Astor Sklair as John Field\n*[[Bernard Horsfall]] as Professor Hawkins\n*Peter Williams as Professor Norman Wedgwood (Episode 1 ''The Imposter'' only)\n\n===''Pathfinders to Venus''===\nGuy Verney continued as director for episodes 1\u20135 and 7.

[[Malcolm Hulke]] and Eric Paice wrote all four serials. ''Target Luna'' was directed by Adrian Brown. The three ''Pathfinders'' serials were directed by Guy Verney with two chapters directed by Reginald Collins. ''Pathfinders to Venus'' included scenes of animated Dinosaurs from the Czech film ''[[Journey to the Beginning of Time]]''. Midway through ''Pathfinders to Mars'' at the last minute, it was decided to have the last three episodes filmed live owing to timing reasons.\n\n==Reception and influence==\n''Target Luna'' and the three sequels were enormously popular at the time.<ref name=WipedNews.com>{{cite web|title=Pathfinders in Space finally comes to DVD|url=http://wipednews.com/2011/06/29/pathfinders-in-space/|work=Pathfinders in Space finally comes to DVD|publisher=wipednews.com|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> One episode was broadcast on Christmas Day 1960 and the production team claimed it had the second highest audience of the day after the [[Queen's Speech]].<ref name=\"The Pathfinders in Space series guide\">{{cite book|last=Pixley|first=Andrew|title=The Pathfinders in Space series guide|year=2011|publisher=Network DVD}}</ref>\n\nProfessor Wedgwood and his experimental rocket group appears to be a direct reference to the character and success of Professor Bernard [[Quatermass]] on the BBC.\n\nThe seventh episode of Pathfinders to Venus (''The Valley of Monsters'') was used in an academic study of children's attitudes to television viewing. The experiments included showing several on-screen mistakes which were explained at the end of the episode by onscreen-rolling captions:\n\n''The mistakes in this episode which you may have noticed are not accidental. They are part of a research project into children's perceptions which the Department of Education of Cambridge University is carrying out in co-operation with the Drama Department of A.B.C. Television.''\n\nThe study was organised by the Department of Education at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The results suggested that children could forgive minor errors and effects as long as the story was compelling. [[Sydney Newman]] later commented ''\"The most important thing we learnt is that if anyone thinks a young audience can be fooled or won sloppily or 'on the cheap' he is sadly mistaken\"''. He also described his audiences as ''\"discerning, intelligent and capable to handle new and innovative subject matter\"''<ref name=\"Museum of TV Sydney Newman biography\">{{cite web|title=Newman, Sydney.

It was written by [[Malcolm Hulke]] and Eric Paice, directed by Adrian Brown and produced by [[Sydney Newman]] who went on to co-create ''[[Doctor Who]]'' for the [[BBC]]. The first serial featured [[Frank Finlay]] as Conway Henderson and [[Michael Craze]] as Geoffrey Wedgwood. The show was successful and spawned three sequels: '''''Pathfinders in Space''''' (September 1960), '''''Pathfinders to Mars''''' (December 1960 \u2013 January 1961), and '''''Pathfinders to Venus''''' (March 1961) starring [[Gerald Flood]] and [[Stewart Guidotti]] in the recast roles.\n\n==Serials==\nOver four serials, ''Target Luna'' and the ''Pathfinders'' proved tremendously successful with the viewing public, with episode 4 of ''Pathfinders to Mars'' getting to second place in audience ratings on New Year's Day 1961.\n\n==''Target Luna''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 6'''\n\n* ''The Rocket Station''\n* ''Count Down''\n* ''The Strange Illness''\n* ''Storm in Space''\n* ''Solar Flare''\n* ''The Falling Star''\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nProfessor Norman Wedgwood ([[David Markham]]) is the head of an experimental rocket group on remote Buchan Island in Scotland. His children, Geoff ([[Michael Craze]]), Valerie ([[Sylvia Davies]]) and Jimmy ([[Michael Hammond (actor)|Michael Hammond]]) visit him to watch the launch of his latest rocket, along with journalist Conway Henderson ([[Frank Finlay]]). When the pilot is taken ill, Jimmy finds himself taking his place on a mission to the Moon along with his pet hamster, Hamlet. After several harrowing hours in space, Jimmy, Hamlet and the rocket are finally brought down to earth.\n\nNote: No tape recordings of the serial are known to exist.\n\n==''Pathfinders in Space''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 7'''\n\n* ''Convoy to the Moon''\n* ''Spaceship from Nowhere''\n* ''Luna Bridgehead''\n* ''The Man in the Moon''\n* ''The World of Lost Toys''\n* ''Disaster on the Moon''\n* ''Rescue in Space''\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nProfessor Norman Wedgwood (now [[Peter Brian Williams|Peter Williams]]) and his team are planning another rocket mission to the Moon. Once again, Geoff, Valerie and Jimmy (now [[Stewart Guidotti]], [[Gillian Ferguson]] and [[Richard Dean (actor)|Richard Dean]]) are on hand to witness the launch of a new rocket MR1 (Moon Rocket 1), along with journalist friend Conway Henderson (now [[Gerald Flood]]). However, when the automatic supply ship MR2 (Moon Rocket 2) fails to launch Henderson and the children make a desperate rescue attempt with Jimmy's pet Hamlet (now a guinea pig).\n\nHenderson, Geoff and Jimmy (and Hamlet) set off in MR2, only to discover Valerie has stowed away. MR1 lands first with MR2 preparing to land via radio control. But on entry, MR2 nearly collides with an unknown object. Having landed safely, but a hundred miles off, the two parties set off to meet each other. On the way, Jimmy (and Hamlet) fall down a hole which turns out to be an airshaft that leads to a large cavern.\n\nInside, the MRI group discover an airlock, which leads them all to discover an alien craft. After the party of MR2 arrive, they discover the fossilised body of a man and find an ancient journal regarding the man was once part an alternative human, among others, who fled earth from a war only to die from lack of supplies on the Moon.\n\nElsewhere, meteors strike MR1 and the rocket explodes, meaning that only two members of the expedition of can leave in MR2. Then Wedgwood makes an attempt to fly the alien vessel. Eventually, the entire group return safely to earth. Once back home, Wedgwood remarks ''\"As man reaches out to towards the stars, who knows what he might find...\"''\n\n==''Pathfinders to Mars''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 6'''\n\n* ''The Imposter''\n* ''Sabotage in Space''\n* ''The Hostage''\n* ''Lichens!'' (live broadcast)\n* ''Zero Hour on the Red Planet'' (live broadcast)\n* ''Falling into the Sun'' (live broadcast)\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nA secondary mission in a new rocket, MR4 (Moon Rocket 4), to the Moon takes off from Buchan Island. This time Henderson takes the lead role as pilot accompanied by Professor Wedgwood's oldest son Geoff as radio operator, Professor Mary Meadows, Henderson's niece Margret ([[Hester Cameron]]) along with Hamlet. However one of the crew turns out to be science writer named Harcourt Brown ([[George Coulouris]]) who has plans to divert the ship to Mars determined there is life on the planet. Brown succeeds in getting MR4 to Mars, but with the length of the journey, the crew decide that the only way to get home is to find water on Mars.\n\nThankfully, MR4 has landed within a hundred miles of the polar ice cap so the group set off, Brown too, believing there to be life on Mars. Encountering [[Lichens]], crevasses and other perils, Brown is devastated when he discovers no intelligent life and feels cheated by the others. In doing so, he intends to leave the others behind on the planet. However, lichens manage to infiltrate MR4, stopping Brown and giving the Rocket crew a chance to overpower him.\n\nHowever, Earth has moved out of the Martian orbit, thus, making the journey home impossible. Yet Brown creates a theory that if they can use the gravity pull of the [[Sun]] to get home. Some time after setting off, the crew all slowly succumb to gamma rays from the Sun one-by-one. By a miracle, there is a total [[eclipse]] and [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] shuts of the rays from the Sun but they quickly find themselves being pulled into Mercury's gravity pull.\n\nThe crew then realise that Buchan Island has made various satellite fixes on Mercury, thus enabling MR4 to make the home journey to Earth. As MR4 falls out of danger from the Sun's gamma rays, Brown ponders of the idea of other life on another planet and sees [[Venus]] as a possibility...\n\n==''Pathfinders to Venus''==\n\n'''Number of episodes: 8'''\n\n* ''S.O.S From Venus''\n* ''Into the Poison Cloud''\n* ''The Living Planet''\n* ''The Creature''\n* ''The Venus People''\n* ''The City''\n* ''The Valley of the Monsters''\n* ''Planet on Fire''\n\n===Synopsis===\n\nReturning from their unexpected trip to Mars the crew of MR4 intercept a distress signal from Captain Wilson, a U.S astronaut, and must change course for Venus to attempt a rescue in space. However, through the space periscope, Brown sees what appears to be a settlement or a city of some sort. Desperate to investigate, Brown edits Wilson's message and tricks the crew into landing Venus so as they can rescue him.\n\nLanding on Venus, the crew discover, much to Brown's delight, that the planet is capable is sustaining life and is a vast jungle. Investigating further, the party find Wilson's rocket-capsule, the ''US V7'', ransacked and ripped apart from the inside by something. Brown gets separated from the others and finds Wilson, who then tricks him into finding his 'city'.\n\nHenderson, Meadows, Geoff, Rosie and Hamlet find the trail leading into the caves of the volcano and get separated. Whilst separated, Henderson, Geoff and Meadows find cavemen whilst Margret (and Hamlet) finds Wilson, Brown and a Venusian cave-child whom she names 'Kiki'. Reunited, the group are forced to escape the lava flow and find themselves in a desert.\n\nKeeping to the left and through the desert, the Wedgwood party discover dinosaurs, diamonds and uranium. When they get nearer Brown's city, they find it to be nothing but an ancient burial ground for Kiki's ancestors. As the journey progresses, the party realise that Venus is a living duplicate of Earth, with dinosaurs and prehistoric humans existing parallel to each other.\n\nFinally returning to the jungle, they discover the lava has set the jungle alight in the direction of MR4. Brown, determined that the planet must not be ruined from what they've seen, decides to set the rocket to overload. However, Henderson turns the tables on him, just in time to see a Russian rocket land nearby. The pilot, Colonel Korolyov, explains they have extra fuel for MR4, in exchange for Wilson's secret mission, which was in fact, an experiment in telecommunications.\n\nPreparing to leave, Brown announces he is remaining behind, since Kiki has lost her parents and aware of the responsibilities of hijacking MR4 in the first place and that to him, Venus is an unspoiled paradise.\n\nTaking off, MR4 is given fuel for the return journey in Space. Finally after months away from home, the Wedgwood party plus Wilson finally return to Earth on Buchan Island.\n\n==Full cast==\n\n===''Target Luna''===\nThe director for ''Target Luna'' was [[Adrian Brown (director)|Adrian Brown]].\n\n*[[David Markham]] as Professor Norman Wedgwood\n*[[John Cairney]] as Ian Murray\n*[[Frank Finlay]] as Conway Henderson\n*[[Michael Craze]] as Geoffrey Wedgwood\n*[[Sylvia Davies]] as Valerie Wedgwood\n*[[Michael Hammond (actor)|Michael Hammond]] as Jimmy Wedgwood\n*[[William Ingram (actor)|William Ingram]] as Flt.

Another key addition was that Jimmy's pet hamster, Hamlet, was also made into a guinea pig so it would be noticeable on screen. Despite the mass recast, many references were alluded of the previous serial, making this serial and the follow-ups canonical.\n\n*[[Peter Brian Williams|Peter Williams]] as Professor Norman Wedgwood\n*[[Harold Goldblatt]] as Dr. O'Connell\n*[[Gerald Flood]] as Conway Henderson\n*[[Stewart Guidotti]] as Geoffrey Wedgwood\n*[[Gillian Ferguson]] as Valerie Wedgwood\n*[[Richard Dean (actor)|Richard Dean]] as Jimmy Wedgwood\n*[[Pamela Barney]] as Professor Mary Meadows\n*[[Irene Sutcliffe]] as Jean Cary\n*[[Hugh Evans (actor)|Hugh Evans]] as Ian Murray\n*[[Astor Sklair]] as John Field\n*[[Michael Guest (actor)|Michael Guest]] as Michael Kennedy\n\n===''Pathfinders to Mars''===\n\nAs with the previous serial, Guy Verney remained as director.\n\nIn the sequel, Professor Wedgwood was retired in the first chapter leaving Conway Henderson as the lead character and Ian Murray as Buchan Island Controller. Also dropped were the characters of Valerie and Jimmy and a new character, Margret Henderson; Conway's niece was introduced. Another introduction was Harcourt Brown, a scientific writer and extraterrestrial theorist. The serial was written that the characters of Conway Henderson and Mary Meadows would be attracted to each other, despite the fact that the two characters hardly exchanged a word between each other in the previous serial.\n\n*Gerald Flood as Conway Henderson\n*[[George Coulouris]] as Harcourt Brown (Credited as 'The Imposter' in ''The Imposter'')\n*Stewart Guidotti as Geoffrey Wedgwood\n*Pamela Barney as Professor Mary Meadows\n*[[Hester Cameron]] as Margret Henderson\n*Hugh Evans as Ian Murray\n*Astor Sklair as John Field\n*[[Bernard Horsfall]] as Professor Hawkins\n*Peter Williams as Professor Norman Wedgwood (Episode 1 ''The Imposter'' only)\n\n===''Pathfinders to Venus''===\nGuy Verney continued as director for episodes 1\u20135 and 7.

[[Malcolm Hulke]] and Eric Paice wrote all four serials. ''Target Luna'' was directed by Adrian Brown. The three ''Pathfinders'' serials were directed by Guy Verney with two chapters directed by Reginald Collins. ''Pathfinders to Venus'' included scenes of animated Dinosaurs from the Czech film ''[[Journey to the Beginning of Time]]''. Midway through ''Pathfinders to Mars'' at the last minute, it was decided to have the last three episodes filmed live owing to timing reasons.\n\n==Reception and influence==\n''Target Luna'' and the three sequels were enormously popular at the time.<ref name=WipedNews.com>{{cite web|title=Pathfinders in Space finally comes to DVD|url=http://wipednews.com/2011/06/29/pathfinders-in-space/|work=Pathfinders in Space finally comes to DVD|publisher=wipednews.com|accessdate=10 April 2012}}</ref> One episode was broadcast on Christmas Day 1960 and the production team claimed it had the second highest audience of the day after the [[Queen's Speech]].<ref name=\"The Pathfinders in Space series guide\">{{cite book|last=Pixley|first=Andrew|title=The Pathfinders in Space series guide|year=2011|publisher=Network DVD}}</ref>\n\nProfessor Wedgwood and his experimental rocket group appears to be a direct reference to the character and success of Professor Bernard [[Quatermass]] on the BBC.\n\nThe seventh episode of Pathfinders to Venus (''The Valley of Monsters'') was used in an academic study of children's attitudes to television viewing. The experiments included showing several on-screen mistakes which were explained at the end of the episode by onscreen-rolling captions:\n\n''The mistakes in this episode which you may have noticed are not accidental. They are part of a research project into children's perceptions which the Department of Education of Cambridge University is carrying out in co-operation with the Drama Department of A.B.C. Television.''\n\nThe study was organised by the Department of Education at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The results suggested that children could forgive minor errors and effects as long as the story was compelling. [[Sydney Newman]] later commented ''\"The most important thing we learnt is that if anyone thinks a young audience can be fooled or won sloppily or 'on the cheap' he is sadly mistaken\"''. He also described his audiences as ''\"discerning, intelligent and capable to handle new and innovative subject matter\"''<ref name=\"Museum of TV Sydney Newman biography\">{{cite web|title=Newman, Sydney.
