The prefix ''South'' serves to distinguish it from [[North Queensferry]], on the opposite shore of the Forth. Both towns derive their name from the ferry service established by [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Queen Margaret]] in the 11th century, which continued to operate at the town until 1964, when the Road Bridge was opened.\n\nIts population at the 2011 census was 9,026 based on the 2010 definition of the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Localities|locality]] which in addition to the burgh includes [[Dalmeny]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-scotland.php?cityid=433001 |title=Queensferry (City of Edinburgh) |accessdate=2014-06-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name ''Taobh a Deas Chas Chaolais'' means \"[the] Southern Side of [the] Steep Strait\". The name \"Cas Chaolas\" (Steep Strait) is older than the English name; it can be applied to either North or South Queensferry, or both. The queen referred to is [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]] who is believed to have established a ferry at this point for pilgrims on their way north to St Andrews. She died in 1093 and made her final journey by ferry to [[Dunfermline Abbey]]. Her son, [[David I of Scotland]], awarded the ferry rights to the abbey.\n\n== Local traditions ==\n\n=== The Ferry Fair ===\nA local fair dates from the 12th century. The modern fair, dating from the 1930s, takes place each August and includes the crowning of a local school-girl as the Ferry Fair Queen, a procession of floats, pipe bands, and competitive events such as the Boundary Race. The Fair had a dedicated radio station, [[Jubilee1]], which in May 2007 was awarded a licence to evolve into a full Public Service Community Station for North and South Queensferry.\n\n=== The Burry Man ===\n[[File:Queensferry Burryman.jpg|thumb|250px|The Burry Man takes a rest supported by his two attendants.]]\n{{main|The Burryman}}\nQueensferry hosts the strange annual procession of the Burry Man during the Ferry Fair. This unique cultural event is over three hundred years old, and likely pagan in origin. The name 'Burry Man' almost certainly refers to the hooked fruits of the [[burdock]] plant - burrs - in which he is covered, although some have suggested that it is a corruption of 'Burgh Man', since the town is traditionally a royal burgh.\n\nA local man is covered from head-to-toe in sticky burrs which adhere to undergarments covering his entire body, leaving only the shoes, hands and two eye holes exposed. On top of this layer he wears a sash, flowers and a floral hat and he grasps two staves.  His ability to bend his arms or sit down is very restricted during the long day and his progress is a slow walk with frequent pauses. Two attendants in ordinary clothes assist him throughout the ordeal, helping him hold the staves, guiding his route, and fortifying him with whisky sipped through a straw, whilst enthusiastic children go from door-to-door collecting money on his behalf. The key landmarks on the tour are the Provost's office and each pub in the village.\n\n=== The Loony Dook ===\n[[File:stoatsdook1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Annual Stoats Loony Dook held on 1 January.]]\n{{main|Stoats Loony Dook}}\n\nThe name \"Loony dook\" is a combination of \"Loony\" (short for \"[[lunatic]]\") and \"dook\", a [[Scots language|Scots]] term meaning \"dip\" or \"bathe\". It is sponsored by porridge maker [[Stoats Porridge Bars|Stoats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghshogmanay.com/events/the-stoats-loony-dook/|title=The Stoats Loony Dook - brought to you by the Porridge Pioneers|publisher=EdinburghHogmanay.com|date=2016-01-01|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160212040707/http://edinburghshogmanay.com/events/the-stoats-loony-dook/|archivedate=12 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is a recently instituted event whereby people dive into the freezing waters of the Firth of Forth on [[New Year's Day]], often in fancy dress. In recent years the event has attracted people from all over the world, including many people visiting Edinburgh to celebrate [[Hogmanay]]. A proposal to charge people to participate in this event was recently announced, the proceeds of which will benefit [[RNLI]] Queensferry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/topstories/You39d-be-barking-to-splash.6600946.jp |title=You'd be barking to splash out \u00a36 on the Loony Dook! - News - Scotsman.com |publisher=Edinburghnews.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-13}}</ref>\n\nThe event was conceived in 1986 as a joking suggestion by three locals for a New Year's Day hangover cure. The following year it was decided to repeat the event for charity. It has grown to become part of the official Edinburgh Hogmanay celebrations.

The prefix ''South'' serves to distinguish it from [[North Queensferry]], on the opposite shore of the Forth. Both towns derive their name from the ferry service established by [[Saint Margaret of Scotland|Queen Margaret]] in the 11th century, which continued to operate at the town until 1964, when the Road Bridge was opened.\n\nIts population at the 2011 census was 9,026 based on the 2010 definition of the [[List of towns and cities in Scotland by population#Localities|locality]] which in addition to the burgh includes [[Dalmeny]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/uk-scotland.php?cityid=433001 |title=Queensferry (City of Edinburgh) |accessdate=2014-06-19 }}</ref>\n\n==Toponymy==\nThe [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] name ''Taobh a Deas Chas Chaolais'' means \"[the] Southern Side of [the] Steep Strait\". The name \"Cas Chaolas\" (Steep Strait) is older than the English name; it can be applied to either North or South Queensferry, or both. The queen referred to is [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]] who is believed to have established a ferry at this point for pilgrims on their way north to St Andrews. She died in 1093 and made her final journey by ferry to [[Dunfermline Abbey]]. Her son, [[David I of Scotland]], awarded the ferry rights to the abbey.\n\n== Local traditions ==\n\n=== The Ferry Fair ===\nA local fair dates from the 12th century. The modern fair, dating from the 1930s, takes place each August and includes the crowning of a local school-girl as the Ferry Fair Queen, a procession of floats, pipe bands, and competitive events such as the Boundary Race. The Fair had a dedicated radio station, [[Jubilee1]], which in May 2007 was awarded a licence to evolve into a full Public Service Community Station for North and South Queensferry.\n\n=== The Burry Man ===\n[[File:Queensferry Burryman.jpg|thumb|250px|The Burry Man takes a rest supported by his two attendants.]]\n{{main|The Burryman}}\nQueensferry hosts the strange annual procession of the Burry Man during the Ferry Fair. This unique cultural event is over three hundred years old, and likely pagan in origin. The name 'Burry Man' almost certainly refers to the hooked fruits of the [[burdock]] plant - burrs - in which he is covered, although some have suggested that it is a corruption of 'Burgh Man', since the town is traditionally a royal burgh.\n\nA local man is covered from head-to-toe in sticky burrs which adhere to undergarments covering his entire body, leaving only the shoes, hands and two eye holes exposed. On top of this layer he wears a sash, flowers and a floral hat and he grasps two staves.  His ability to bend his arms or sit down is very restricted during the long day and his progress is a slow walk with frequent pauses. Two attendants in ordinary clothes assist him throughout the ordeal, helping him hold the staves, guiding his route, and fortifying him with whisky sipped through a straw, whilst enthusiastic children go from door-to-door collecting money on his behalf. The key landmarks on the tour are the Provost's office and each pub in the village.\n\n=== The Loony Dook ===\n[[File:stoatsdook1.jpg|thumb|250px|The Annual Stoats Loony Dook held on 1 January.]]\n{{main|Stoats Loony Dook}}\n\nThe name \"Loony dook\" is a combination of \"Loony\" (short for \"[[lunatic]]\") and \"dook\", a [[Scots language|Scots]] term meaning \"dip\" or \"bathe\".

The game was a rematch from the previous season when the [[2014 Oregon Ducks football team|Ducks]] beat the [[2014 Michigan State Spartans football team|Spartans]] at [[Autzen Stadium]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. The loss returned the all-time record between Oregon and Michigan State to a tie at 3\u20133.\n\nThis game foreshadowed the finger injury that would keep Oregon quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. sidelined or completely ineffective for a month. Adams injured the index finger on his throwing hand during the fourth quarter of the previous week's game against Eastern Washington. For the game against Michigan State, Adams wore gloves on both hands and was seen inspecting his hand while on the sideline. It was conjectured during the game by the announcers that the lack of touch caused by both his broken finger and the glove were to blame for several inaccurate medium to long distance passes thrown by Adams, including missing a wide open [[Byron Marshall]] in the end-zone from the Michigan State 33-yard line with 1:24 left in the game that would've put the Ducks up 35\u201331.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay?gameId=400757018|title=Oregon vs. Michigan State - Play-By-Play - September 12, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Georgia State====\n{{See also|2015 Georgia State Panthers football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Oregon Ducks}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title= Georgia State Panthers at Oregon Ducks \u2013 Game summary\n|date=Saturday September 19, 2015\n|time= 11 AM\n|road= Georgia State\n|R1=7|R2=0|R3=21|R4=0\n|home= #12 '''Oregon'''\n|H1=13|H2=20|H3=14|H4=14\n|stadium= Autzen Stadium \u2022 Eugene, OR\n|attendance= \n|weather= \n|referee=\n|TV= Pac-12 Network\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|reference=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/game?gameId=400757030|title=Georgia State vs. Oregon - Game Summary - September 19, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 Tyree Robinson 41-yard interception return (Aiden Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 26-yard field goal\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 40-yard field goal\n*GSU \u2013 Nick Arbuckle 1-yard run (Wil Lutz Kick)\n;Second Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]] 22-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Dwayne Stanford 35-yard pass from [[Jeff Lockie]] (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 40-yard field goal\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 40-yard field goal\n;Third Quarter\n*GSU \u2013 Todd Boyd 14-yard pass from Arbuckle (Lutz Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Taj Griffin 3-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n*GSU \u2013 Robert Davis 75-yard pass from Arbuckle (Lutz Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Johnny Mundt 11-yard pass from Lockie (Schneider Kick)\n*GSU \u2013 Keith Rucker 6-yard pass from Arbuckle (Lutz Kick)\n;Fourth Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 Joe Walker 52-yard fumble return (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Taylor Alie 87-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n|stats=\n'''Passing'''\n*GSU \u2013 Nick Arbuckle, 25/32, 318 yards, 3 TD, 2 INT\n*UO \u2013 Jeff Lockie, 23/32, 228 yards, 2 TD\n'''Rushing'''\n*GSU \u2013 Demarcus Kick, 6 carries, 42 yards\n*UO \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]], 10 carries, 101 yards, TD\n'''Receiving'''\n*GSU \u2013 Penny Hart, 9 receptions, 128 yards\n*UO \u2013 Dwayne Stanford, 3 receptions, 48 yards, TD\n;Defense\n*GSU \u2013 T.

In 2014, Oregon defeated Utah 51\u201327 at [[Rice Eccles Stadium]] in [[Salt Lake City, UT]]. Oregon maintained their lead in the all-time series with 20\u20139; this was the first time that Utah defeated Oregon since joining the Pac-12.\n\nThe 42 point loss was the third largest margin of defeat for the Ducks at Autzen Stadium, with the 62 points the most ever allowed by the Ducks in Eugene and the first loss of this magnitude at home since the [[1977 Oregon Webfoots football team|1977 season]]. During the game, Oregon star wide receiver/running back Byron Marshall suffered a lower leg injury and was driven off the field in a cart. Additionally, during the second quarter the Ducks replaced starting quarterback Vernon Adams, Jr. with Jeff Lockie due to Adams' ineffective play caused by a broken index finger on his throwing hand. Because of the broken finger, Adams was unable to complete accurate downfield passes which allowed the Utes to totally focus on defending the run and short passes, effectively neutralizing the Oregon offense. While Lockie was able to generate a spark on his first series, he was unable to generate significant plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=400757039|title=Utah vs. Oregon - Game Recap - September 26, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Colorado====\n{{See also|2015 Colorado Buffaloes football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Oregon Ducks}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Oregon Ducks at Colorado Buffaloes \u2013 Game summary\n|date= Saturday October 3, 2015\n|time=8:35 pm\n|road='''Oregon'''\n|R1=7|R2=10|R3=14|R4=10\n|home=Colorado\n|H1=7|H2=10|H3=0|H4=7\n|stadium= [[Folsom Field]] \u2022 [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]\n|attendance= \n|weather= Cloudy\n|referee=\n|TV= ESPN\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|reference=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/game?gameId=400757043|title=Oregon vs. Colorado - Game Summary - October 3, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]] 29-yard run (Aidan Schneider Kick)\n*COL \u2013 Christian Powell 2-yard run (Diego Gonzalez Kick)\n;Second Quarter\n*COL \u2013 Shay fields 8-yard pass from Sefo Liufau (Gonzalez Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Charles Nelson 39-yard pass from Bralon Addison (Schneider Kick)\n*COL \u2013 Gonzalez 52-yard field goal\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 39-yard field goal\n;Third Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 [[Royce Freeman|Freeman]] 3-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Taj Griffin 2-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n;Fourth Quarter\n*COL \u2013 Sefo Liufau 7-yard run (Gonzalez Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Jalen Brown 43-yard pass from Taylor Alie (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 33-yard field goal\n|stats=\n'''Passing'''\n*UO \u2013 Taylor Alie, 4/9, 83 yards, TD\n*UC \u2013 Sefo Liufau, 25/42, 231 yards, TD, INT\n'''Rushing'''\n*UO \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]], 27 carries, 163 yards, 2 TD\n*UC \u2013 P.

The game was a rematch from the previous season when the [[2014 Oregon Ducks football team|Ducks]] beat the [[2014 Michigan State Spartans football team|Spartans]] at [[Autzen Stadium]] in [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]]. The loss returned the all-time record between Oregon and Michigan State to a tie at 3\u20133.\n\nThis game foreshadowed the finger injury that would keep Oregon quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. sidelined or completely ineffective for a month. Adams injured the index finger on his throwing hand during the fourth quarter of the previous week's game against Eastern Washington. For the game against Michigan State, Adams wore gloves on both hands and was seen inspecting his hand while on the sideline. It was conjectured during the game by the announcers that the lack of touch caused by both his broken finger and the glove were to blame for several inaccurate medium to long distance passes thrown by Adams, including missing a wide open [[Byron Marshall]] in the end-zone from the Michigan State 33-yard line with 1:24 left in the game that would've put the Ducks up 35\u201331.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/playbyplay?gameId=400757018|title=Oregon vs. Michigan State - Play-By-Play - September 12, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Georgia State====\n{{See also|2015 Georgia State Panthers football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Oregon Ducks}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title= Georgia State Panthers at Oregon Ducks \u2013 Game summary\n|date=Saturday September 19, 2015\n|time= 11 AM\n|road= Georgia State\n|R1=7|R2=0|R3=21|R4=0\n|home= #12 '''Oregon'''\n|H1=13|H2=20|H3=14|H4=14\n|stadium= Autzen Stadium \u2022 Eugene, OR\n|attendance= \n|weather= \n|referee=\n|TV= Pac-12 Network\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|reference=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/game?gameId=400757030|title=Georgia State vs. Oregon - Game Summary - September 19, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 Tyree Robinson 41-yard interception return (Aiden Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 26-yard field goal\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 40-yard field goal\n*GSU \u2013 Nick Arbuckle 1-yard run (Wil Lutz Kick)\n;Second Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]] 22-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Dwayne Stanford 35-yard pass from [[Jeff Lockie]] (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 40-yard field goal\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 40-yard field goal\n;Third Quarter\n*GSU \u2013 Todd Boyd 14-yard pass from Arbuckle (Lutz Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Taj Griffin 3-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n*GSU \u2013 Robert Davis 75-yard pass from Arbuckle (Lutz Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Johnny Mundt 11-yard pass from Lockie (Schneider Kick)\n*GSU \u2013 Keith Rucker 6-yard pass from Arbuckle (Lutz Kick)\n;Fourth Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 Joe Walker 52-yard fumble return (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Taylor Alie 87-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n|stats=\n'''Passing'''\n*GSU \u2013 Nick Arbuckle, 25/32, 318 yards, 3 TD, 2 INT\n*UO \u2013 Jeff Lockie, 23/32, 228 yards, 2 TD\n'''Rushing'''\n*GSU \u2013 Demarcus Kick, 6 carries, 42 yards\n*UO \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]], 10 carries, 101 yards, TD\n'''Receiving'''\n*GSU \u2013 Penny Hart, 9 receptions, 128 yards\n*UO \u2013 Dwayne Stanford, 3 receptions, 48 yards, TD\n;Defense\n*GSU \u2013 T.

In 2014, Oregon defeated Utah 51-27 at [[Rice Eccles Stadium]] in [[Salt Lake City, UT]]. Oregon maintained their lead in the all-time series with 20\u20139; this was the first time that Utah defeated Oregon since joining the Pac-12.\n\nThe 42 point loss was the third largest margin of defeat for the Ducks at Autzen Stadium, with the 62 points the most ever allowed by the Ducks in Eugene and the first loss of this magnitude at home since the [[1977 Oregon Webfoots football team|1977 season]]. During the game, Oregon star wide receiver/running back Byron Marshall suffered a lower leg injury and was driven off the field in a cart. Additionally, during the second quarter the Ducks replaced starting quarterback Vernon Adams, Jr. with Jeff Lockie due to Adams' ineffective play caused by a broken index finger on his throwing hand. Because of the broken finger, Adams was unable to complete accurate downfield passes which allowed the Utes to totally focus on defending the run and short passes, effectively neutralizing the Oregon offense. While Lockie was able to generate a spark on his first series, he was unable to generate significant plays.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=400757039|title=Utah vs. Oregon - Game Recap - September 26, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Colorado====\n{{See also|2015 Colorado Buffaloes football team}}\n{{Americanfootballbox\n|titlestyle= {{CollegePrimaryStyle|Oregon Ducks}} ;text-align:center;\n|state=autocollapse\n|title=Oregon Ducks at Colorado Buffaloes \u2013 Game summary\n|date= Saturday October 3, 2015\n|time=8:35 pm\n|road='''Oregon'''\n|R1=7|R2=10|R3=14|R4=10\n|home=Colorado\n|H1=7|H2=10|H3=0|H4=7\n|stadium= [[Folsom Field]] \u2022 [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder, CO]]\n|attendance= \n|weather= Cloudy\n|referee=\n|TV= ESPN\n|TVAnnouncers=\n|reference=<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/game?gameId=400757043|title=Oregon vs. Colorado - Game Summary - October 3, 2015 - ESPN|website=ESPN.com|access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>\n|scoring=\n;First Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]] 29-yard run (Aidan Schneider Kick)\n*COL \u2013 Christian Powell 2-yard run (Diego Gonzalez Kick)\n;Second Quarter\n*COL \u2013 Shay fields 8-yard pass from Sefo Liufau (Gonzalez Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Charles Nelson 39-yard pass from Bralon Addison (Schneider Kick)\n*COL \u2013 Gonzalez 52-yard field goal\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 39-yard field goal\n;Third Quarter\n*ORE \u2013 [[Royce Freeman|Freeman]] 3-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Taj Griffin 2-yard run (Schneider Kick)\n;Fourth Quarter\n*COL \u2013 Sefo Liufau 7-yard run (Gonzalez Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Jalen Brown 43-yard pass from Taylor Alie (Schneider Kick)\n*ORE \u2013 Schneider 33-yard field goal\n|stats=\n'''Passing'''\n*UO \u2013 Taylor Alie, 4/9, 83 yards, TD\n*UC \u2013 Sefo Liufau, 25/42, 231 yards, TD, INT\n'''Rushing'''\n*UO \u2013 [[Royce Freeman]], 27 carries, 163 yards, 2 TD\n*UC \u2013 P.

This rhythm was developed from the [[danz\u00f3n-mambo]]. The name of the dance is an [[onomatopoeia]] derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps (correctly, on the fourth count of each measure) that characterize the dance.<ref>Jorr\u00edn, Enrique 1971. Origen ddwadel chachach\u00e1. ''Signos 3'' Vil esparza, p. 49.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the [[charanga (Cuba)|charanga]] group [[Orquesta Am\u00e9rica]]. The group performed at dance halls in [[Havana]] where they played [[danz\u00f3n]], danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less [[syncopation|syncopated]].<ref>Orovio, Helio. 1981. Diccionario de la M\u00fasica Cubana. La Habana, Editorial Letras Cubanas. {{ISBN|959-10-0048-0}}</ref> When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana, it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a [[triple step]] in their footwork producing the sound \"cha-cha-cha\". Thus, the new style came to be known as \"cha-cha-ch\u00e1\" and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step.<ref>Sanchez-Coll, Israel (February 8, 2006). \"Enrique Jorr\u00edn\". Conexi\u00f3n Cubana. Retrieved 2007-01-31</ref>\n\nThe basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (one, two, three, cha-cha) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the [[Santer\u00eda]] religion. For example, one of the steps used in the dance for the [[orisha]] [[Ogun]] uses an identical footwork pattern. These Afro-Cuban dances predate the development of Cha Cha and were known by many Cubans in the 1950s, especially those of African origin.<ref>Sublette (2004) Cuba and its Music, Chapter 15</ref> Thus, the footwork of the Cha Cha was likely inspired by these Afro-Cuban dances.<ref>Schweitzer (2013)The Artistry of Afro-Cuban Bata Drumming Aesthetics, transmission, Bonding, and creativity</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Orquesta Am\u00e9rica released two of Jorrin's compositions, \"[[La Enga\u00f1adora]]\" and \"Silver Star\", on the Cuban record label [[Panart]]. These were the first cha-cha-ch\u00e1 compositions ever recorded. They immediately became hits in Havana, and other Cuban charanga orchestras quickly imitated this new style. Soon, there was a cha-cha-ch\u00e1 craze in Havana's dance halls, popularizing both the music and the associated dance. This craze soon spread to [[Mexico City]], and by 1955 the music and dance of the cha cha cha had become popular in Latin America, the United States, and Western Europe, following in the footsteps of the [[mambo (dance)|mambo]], which had been a worldwide craze a few years earlier.<ref>Sublette (2007) 'The Kingsmen and the cha cha cha.;</ref>\n\n==Description==\nCha Cha is danced to authentic [[Cuban music]], although in ballroom competitions it is often danced to [[Latin pop]] or [[Rock en espa\u00f1ol|Latin rock]]. The music for the [[Ballroom dance|international ballroom]] Cha Cha is energetic and with a steady beat. The music may involve complex [[polyrhythm|polyrhythms]].\n\n[[File:Dance reedit 2.webm|right|thumb|A Cha Cha dance video]]\n\nStyles of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 dance may differ in the place of the [[Glossary of ballroom dance terms#Chasse|chasse]] in the rhythmical structure.<ref>Cuban rhythms are usually scored in 2/4 time, whereas in North America the music would typically be scored in 4/4. This does not affect the sense of the text.</ref> The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha count is \"one, two, three, cha-cha\", or \"one, two, three, four-and.\"<ref name=\"Laird 2003\">Laird, Walter 2003. ''The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing''. International Dance Publications Ltd.</ref>  A \"street version\" comes about because many social dancers count \"one, two, cha-cha-cha\" and thus shift the timing of the dance by a full beat of music.  Note that the dance known as Salsa is the result of a similar timing shift of Mambo.\n\n===Pattern===\nIn the International School of [[Ballroom Dance]], the basic pattern involves the lead (usually the man) taking a [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Check|checked]] forward step with the left foot, [[partial weight transfer|retaining some weight]] on the right foot. The knee of the right leg must stay bent and close to the back of the left knee, the left leg having straightened just prior to receiving part weight. This step is taken on the second beat of the bar. Full weight is returned to the right leg on the second step (beat three).\n\nThe fourth beat is split in two so the count of the next three steps is 4-and-1. These three steps constitute the ''cha-cha chasse''. A step to the side is taken with the left foot, the right foot is half closed towards the left foot (typically leaving both feet under the hips or perhaps closed together), and finally there is a last step to the left with the left foot. The length of the steps in the chasse depends very much on the effect the dancer is attempting to make.<ref name=\"Laird 2003\"/>\n\nThe partner takes a step back on the right foot, the knee being straightened as full weight is taken. The other leg is allowed to remain straight. It is possible it will shoot slightly but no deliberate flexing of the free leg is attempted. This is quite different from technique associated with [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], for instance. On the next beat (beat three) weight is returned to the left leg. Then a chasse is danced RLR.\n\nEach partner is now in a position to dance the bar their partner just danced. Hence the fundamental construction of Cha-cha extends over two bars.\n\nThe checked first step is a later development in the \"international cha-cha\" style. Because of the action used during the forward step (the one taking only part weight) the basic pattern turns left, whereas in earlier times Cha-cha was danced without rotation of the alignment. Hip actions are allowed to occur at the end of every step. For steps taking a single beat the first half of the beat constitutes the foot movement and the second half is taken up by the hip movement. The hip sway eliminates any increase in height as the feet are brought towards each other.\nIn general, steps in all directions should be taken first with the ball of the foot in contact with the floor, and then with the heel lowering when the weight is fully transferred; however, some steps require that the heel remain lifted from the floor. When weight is released from a foot, the heel should release from the floor first, allowing the toe to maintain contact with the floor.\n\nIn the American School of Ballroom Dance, the basic step spans two measures of music (frequently counted \"one, two, three, four-and, five, six, seven, eight-and\" with \"five\" marking the beginning of the second measure.  The leader steps sideways to the left on count 1, back onto the right foot on count 2, forward with the left foot on count 3, then a cha-cha consisting of a step sideways to the right on count 4 followed by a step in place on the left foot on \"and\" between count four and count 5 to permit another step sideways to the right on count 5 (or count 1 of the second measure), a step forward with the left foot on count 6, a step backward with the right foot on count 7, and an cha-cha to the left on the \"eight-and\" to set up another step sideways to the left to begin the next repetition of the pattern.\n\n===Hip movement===\n[[File:Ballroom dance competition cha cha.jpg|thumb|A young girl dancing cha-cha-ch\u00e1 The girl moves her hips while holding the torso relatively still.]]\n\nIn traditional [[Glossary of partner dance terms#American Rhythm|American Rhythm]] style, Latin hip movement is achieved through the alternate bending and straightening action of the knees, though in modern competitive dancing, the technique is virtually identical to the [[Latin dance|\"international Latin\"]] style.\n\nIn the international Latin style, the weighted leg is almost always straight. The free leg will bend, allowing the hips to naturally settle into the direction of the weighted leg. As a step is taken, a free leg will straighten the instant before it receives weight.

La Habana. p. 281</ref> It is danced to [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)|the music of the same name]] introduced by Cuban composer and violinist [[Enrique Jorrin]] in the early 1950s. This rhythm was developed from the [[danz\u00f3n-mambo]]. The name of the dance is an [joemama[onomatopoeia]] derived from the shuffling sound of the dancers' feet when they dance two consecutive quick steps (correctly, on the fourth count of each measure) that characterize the dance.<ref>Jorr\u00edn, Enrique 1971. Origen ddwadel chachach\u00e1. ''Signos 3'' Vil esparza, p. 49.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1950s, Enrique Jorr\u00edn worked as a violinist and composer with the [[charanga (Cuba)|charanga]] group [[Orquesta Am\u00e9rica]]. The group performed at dance halls in [[Havana]] where they played [[danz\u00f3n]], danzonete, and danzon-mambo for dance-oriented crowds. Jorr\u00edn noticed that many of the dancers at these gigs had difficulty with the syncopated rhythms of the danz\u00f3n-mambo. To make his music more appealing to dancers, Jorr\u00edn began composing songs where the melody was marked strongly on the first downbeat and the rhythm was less [[syncopation|syncopated]].<ref>Orovio, Helio. 1981. Diccionario de la M\u00fasica Cubana. La Habana, Editorial Letras Cubanas. {{ISBN|959-10-0048-0}}</ref> When Orquesta Am\u00e9rica performed these new compositions at the Silver Star Club in Havana, it was noticed that the dancers had improvised a [[triple step]] in their footwork producing the sound \"cha-cha-cha\". Thus, the new style came to be known as \"cha-cha-ch\u00e1\" and became associated with a dance where dancers perform a triple step.<ref>Sanchez-Coll, Israel (February 8, 2006). \"Enrique Jorr\u00edn\". Conexi\u00f3n Cubana. Retrieved 2007-01-31</ref>\n\nThe basic footwork pattern of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (one, two, three, cha-cha) is also found in several Afro-Cuban dances from the [[Santer\u00eda]] religion. For example, one of the steps used in the dance for the [[orisha]] [[Ogun]] uses an identical footwork pattern. These Afro-Cuban dances predate the development of Cha Cha and were known by many Cubans in the 1950s, especially those of African origin.<ref>Sublette (2004) Cuba and its Music, Chapter 15</ref> Thus, the footwork of the Cha Cha was likely inspired by these Afro-Cuban dances.<ref>Schweitzer (2013)The Artistry of Afro-Cuban Bata Drumming Aesthetics, transmission, Bonding, and creativity</ref>\n\nIn 1953, Orquesta Am\u00e9rica released two of Jorrin's compositions, \"[[La Enga\u00f1adora]]\" and \"Silver Star\", on the Cuban record label [[Panart]]. These were the first cha-cha-ch\u00e1 compositions ever recorded. They immediately became hits in Havana, and other Cuban charanga orchestras quickly imitated this new style. Soon, there was a cha-cha-ch\u00e1 craze in Havana's dance halls, popularizing both the music and the associated dance. This craze soon spread to [[Mexico City]], and by 1955 the music and dance of the cha cha cha had become popular in Latin America, the United States, and Western Europe, following in the footsteps of the [[mambo (dance)|mambo]], which had been a worldwide craze a few years earlier.<ref>Sublette (2007) 'The Kingsmen and the cha cha cha.;</ref>\n\n==Description==\nCha Cha is danced to authentic [[Cuban music]], although in ballroom competitions it is often danced to [[Latin pop]] or [[Rock en espa\u00f1ol|Latin rock]]. The music for the [[Ballroom dance|international ballroom]] Cha Cha is energetic and with a steady beat. The music may involve complex [[polyrhythm|polyrhythms]].\n\n[[File:Dance reedit 2.webm|right|thumb|A Cha Cha dance video]]\n\nStyles of cha-cha-ch\u00e1 dance may differ in the place of the [[Glossary of ballroom dance terms#Chasse|chasse]] in the rhythmical structure.<ref>Cuban rhythms are usually scored in 2/4 time, whereas in North America the music would typically be scored in 4/4. This does not affect the sense of the text.</ref> The original Cuban and the ballroom cha-cha count is \"one, two, three, cha-cha\", or \"one, two, three, four-and.\"<ref name=\"Laird 2003\">Laird, Walter 2003. ''The Laird Technique of Latin Dancing''. International Dance Publications Ltd.</ref>  A \"street version\" comes about because many social dancers count \"one, two, cha-cha-cha\" and thus shift the timing of the dance by a full beat of music.  Note that the dance known as Salsa is the result of a similar timing shift of Mambo.\n\n===Pattern===\nIn the International School of [[Ballroom Dance]], the basic pattern involves the lead (usually the man) taking a [[Glossary of partner dance terms#Check|checked]] forward step with the left foot, [[partial weight transfer|retaining some weight]] on the right foot. The knee of the right leg must stay bent and close to the back of the left knee, the left leg having straightened just prior to receiving part weight. This step is taken on the second beat of the bar. Full weight is returned to the right leg on the second step (beat three).\n\nThe fourth beat is split in two so the count of the next three steps is 4-and-1. These three steps constitute the ''cha-cha chasse''. A step to the side is taken with the left foot, the right foot is half closed towards the left foot (typically leaving both feet under the hips or perhaps closed together), and finally there is a last step to the left with the left foot. The length of the steps in the chasse depends very much on the effect the dancer is attempting to make.<ref name=\"Laird 2003\"/>\n\nThe partner takes a step back on the right foot, the knee being straightened as full weight is taken. The other leg is allowed to remain straight. It is possible it will shoot slightly but no deliberate flexing of the free leg is attempted. This is quite different from technique associated with [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]], for instance. On the next beat (beat three) weight is returned to the left leg. Then a chasse is danced RLR.\n\nEach partner is now in a position to dance the bar their partner just danced. Hence the fundamental construction of Cha-cha extends over two bars.\n\nThe checked first step is a later development in the \"international cha-cha\" style. Because of the action used during the forward step (the one taking only part weight) the basic pattern turns left, whereas in earlier times Cha-cha was danced without rotation of the alignment. Hip actions are allowed to occur at the end of every step. For steps taking a single beat the first half of the beat constitutes the foot movement and the second half is taken up by the hip movement. The hip sway eliminates any increase in height as the feet are brought towards each other.\nIn general, steps in all directions should be taken first with the ball of the foot in contact with the floor, and then with the heel lowering when the weight is fully transferred; however, some steps require that the heel remain lifted from the floor. When weight is released from a foot, the heel should release from the floor first, allowing the toe to maintain contact with the floor.\n\nIn the American School of Ballroom Dance, the basic step spans two measures of music (frequently counted \"one, two, three, four-and, five, six, seven, eight-and\" with \"five\" marking the beginning of the second measure.  The leader steps sideways to the left on count 1, back onto the right foot on count 2, forward with the left foot on count 3, then a cha-cha consisting of a step sideways to the right on count 4 followed by a step in place on the left foot on \"and\" between count four and count 5 to permit another step sideways to the right on count 5 (or count 1 of the second measure), a step forward with the left foot on count 6, a step backward with the right foot on count 7, and an cha-cha to the left on the \"eight-and\" to set up another step sideways to the left to begin the next repetition of the pattern.\n\n===Hip movement===\n[[File:Ballroom dance competition cha cha.jpg|thumb|A young girl dancing cha-cha-ch\u00e1 The girl moves her hips while holding the torso relatively still.]]\n\nIn traditional [[Glossary of partner dance terms#American Rhythm|American Rhythm]] style, Latin hip movement is achieved through the alternate bending and straightening action of the knees, though in modern competitive dancing, the technique is virtually identical to the [[Latin dance|\"international Latin\"]] style.\n\nIn the international Latin style, the weighted leg is almost always straight. The free leg will bend, allowing the hips to naturally settle into the direction of the weighted leg. As a step is taken, a free leg will straighten the instant before it receives weight. It should then remain straight until it is completely free of weight again.\n\n==International Latin style Cha Cha==\nCha Cha is one of the five dances of the \"Latin American\" program of international ballroom competitions.\n\nAs described above, the basis of the modern dance was laid down in the 1950s by Pierre & Lavelle<ref>Lavelle, Doris 1983. ''Latin & American dances''. 3rd ed, Black, London.</ref> and developed in the 1960s by [[Walter Laird]] and other top competitors of the time. The basic steps taught to learners today are based on these accounts.\n\nIn general, steps are kept compact and the dance is danced generally without any [[Rises and falls|rise and fall]]; this is the modern ballroom technique of Cha Cha (and other Latin dances).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cha-cha-ch\u00e1 (music)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wiktionary|cha-cha}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8LYNlvXeRQ Former Latin champions Bryan Watson and Karen Hardy give a demo]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZgC4FSAjcU Video of cha cha ballroom competition]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYuIAPFvKew Video of cha cha social dancing at 2010 New York Salsa Congress (first 2 minutes of video)]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89JrmpUI9yE&t=7s Video of cha cha social dancing by Joel Dominguez and Yesenia Peralta]\n\n{{Dance}}\n\n[[Category:Ballroom dance]]\n[[Category:Latin dances]]\n[[Category:Dance in Cuba]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Cha-cha-cha| ]]\n[[Category:Dance terminology]]\n", "name_user": "WoefulMinion", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed joke edit", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cha-cha-cha_(dance)"}
