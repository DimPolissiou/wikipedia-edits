Robert Greene was a popular Elizabethan dramatist and pamphleteer known for his negative critiques of his colleagues. He is said to have been born in [[Norwich]].{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} He attended [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], receiving a BA in 1580, and an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|M.A.]] in 1583 before moving to London, where he arguably became the first professional author in England. Greene was prolific and published in many genres including romances, plays and autobiography.\n\n==Family==\nAccording to Richardson, \"The chief problem in compiling a biography of Robert Greene is the name. ''Robert'' must have been almost the most popular Elizabethan Christian name and ''Greene'' is no unusual surname\".{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=165}} Newcomb states that Robert Greene\n\n<blockquote>was probably the Robert Greene, son of Robert Greene, baptized on 11 July 1558 at St George's, Tombland, Norwich. Greene later described himself as from Norwich on his title-pages, and the year is appropriate for the Robert Greene who matriculated at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], as a [[sizar]] on 26 November 1575. The author's father was probably one of two Robert Greenes found later in parish records: either a saddler who lived modestly in the parish until 1599, or a [[cordwainer]] who kept an inn in Norwich from the late 1570s until his death in 1591. The saddler appeals to biographers who attribute the writer's later low-life sympathies to a humble birth; the innkeeper, a more prosperous man possibly related to landowners, interests scholars who note the social ambitions of Greene's early works. However, in his will proved in 1591, the innkeeper did not mention a son Robert, although he may have disinherited that son (as the writer implied in one autobiographical statement).</blockquote>\n\nBoth the Norwich cordwainer-turned-innkeeper and the Norwich saddler left wills, proved in 1591 and 1596 respectively, but neither will mentions a son named Robert.{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=166}}\n\n==Career==\nGreene is thought to have attended the [[Norwich Grammar School]], although this cannot be confirmed as enrolment documents for the relevant years are lost.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], provided scholarships for students from the Norwich grammar school, and for this reason Greene's matriculation as a [[sizar]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], has been considered \"strange\".{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=170}}{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Parr|1962|pp=536\u20137}} A reason offered for Greene's enrolment at St John's is that some of the gentry of South Yorkshire attended St John's, and among the dedicatees of, or authors of [[commendatory verse]]s for Greene's books were members of the Darcy, Portington, Lee, Stapleton, and Rogers families, all centred at [[Snaith]], Yorkshire; according to Richardson, the Robert Greene from Norwich who was an innkeeper may have been an immigrant from Yorkshire connected to 'a large family of Greenes' who lived in the parish of [[Snaith]], and may actually have left Norwich to reside at Snaith from 1571 to 1577.{{sfn|Richardson|1980|pp=160\u20133, 170\u20131}}{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\nThere is no record of Greene's having taken part in the dramatic productions at Cambridge in 1579 and 1580, although 18 of his classmates and Fellows of the Cambridge colleges acted in ''Hymenaeus'', and 46 in ''[[Richardus Tertius]]''.{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=542}}{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=175}} His academic performance as an undergraduate at Cambridge was mediocre; on 22 January 1580 he took his BA, graduating 38th out of 41 students in his college, and 115th out of the total university graduating class that year of 205 students.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}} He \"apparently transferred to [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] for his 1583 MA\", where he placed 5th out of 12 students in his college, and 29th of the 129 students at the university.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}}<ref>{{acad|id=GRN575R|name=Greene, Robert}}</ref> It was \"rare for a student to migrate to another college (as Greene did) after he had received the baccalaureate\",{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=538}} and no record of Greene's transfer to Clare College has been discovered, nor does his name appear in the Clare Hall Buttery Book for 1580\u201384.{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}} Greene's claim to association with Clare College is found in the second part of ''Mamillia'', which was not published until 1593, after Greene's death, in which the dedicatory epistle to Robert Lee and Roger Portington is signed \"Robert Greene. From my Studie in Clarehall the vii. Of Julie\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}<ref>Newcomb states that 7 July was \"the very date in 1583 on which Greene graduated MA from Clare College\"; however according to Parr, Pruvost \"mistakenly contends that the M.A. was always awarded in July\", and there is no record of the time of year at which M.A. degrees were awarded in 1583, although \"those of 1577\u201380 were awarded in March and April\" (p. 540).</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenes-Farewell-to-Folly.png|thumb|Title page of ''Greene's Farewell to Folly'', 1591]]\n\nAccording to Newcomb, \"Other events of [Greene's] youth must be derived from autobiographical remarks that may not be reliable\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} In ''The Repentance of Robert Greene'', written in the first person, Greene claimed to have travelled to Italy and Spain; however, no evidence of Greene's continental trip has been found, \"or\u2014unless we take merely his word for it\u2014that he ever made the trip at all\".{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}} Further doubt is cast on Greene's continental journey by Norbert Bolz, who after undertaking a computer analysis of the vocabulary of ''The Repentance'', concluded that \"''The Repentance of Robert Greene'' was in fact not written by Robert Greene\".{{sfn|Bolz|1979|pp=66\u20137}}\n\nIn ''The Repentance'', Greene claimed to have married a gentleman's daughter, whom he abandoned after having had a child by her and spent her dowry, after which she went to [[Lincolnshire]], and he to London.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} In ''Four Letters'' (1592), [[Gabriel Harvey]] prints a letter allegedly written by Greene to his wife in which he addresses her as \"Doll\". However, \"[E]xtensive searches of London and Norwich records by successive biographers have failed finally to locate the record of Greene's marriage\".{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=173}}\n\nAfter his move to [[London]], Greene published over twenty-five works in prose in a variety of genres, becoming \"England's first celebrity author\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\nIn 1588, he was granted an MA from [[Oxford University]], \"almost certainly a courtesy degree\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} Thereafter the title pages of some of his published works bore the phrase ''Utruisq. Academiae in Artibus Magister''', \"Master of Arts in both Universities\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\nGreene died 3 September 1592,{{sfn|Dyce|1874|p=57}}<ref>Dyce appears to be the first to give the specific date of Greene's death, but cites no source.</ref> (aged 34 if he was the Robert Greene baptised in 1558). His death and burial were announced by Gabriel Harvey in a letter to Christopher Bird of [[Saffron Walden]] dated 5 September, first published as a \"butterfly pamphlet\" about 8 September, and later expanded as ''Four Letters and Certain Sonnets'', entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 4 December 1592.{{sfn|McKerrow I|1958|pp=151\u2013153}}{{sfn|McKerrow II|1958|pp=81\u201382, 87}} Harvey attributed Greene's demise to \"a surfeit of pickle herring and Rhenish wine\",{{sfn|McKerrow II|1958|p=82}} and claimed he had been buried in \"the [[New_Churchyard|new churchyard]] near [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]\" on 4 September.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Hartle|2017|pp= 40\u201341}} No record of Greene's burial has been found.\n\nAccording to ''The Repentance of Robert Greene'', Greene is alleged to have written ''Groatsworth'' during the month prior to his death, including in it a letter to his wife asking her to forgive him and stating that he was sending their son to her. No record of Greene's son by his wife has been found; however, in ''Four Letters'', [[Gabriel Harvey]] claimed that Greene kept a mistress, Em, the sister of a criminal known as \"[[Cutting Ball]]\" hanged at [[Tyburn]]. Harvey described her as \"a sorry ragged quean of whom [Greene] had his base son Infortunatus Greene\". According to Newcomb, a Fortunatus Greene was buried at [[Shoreditch]] on 12 August 1593, \"whose folk-tale name might lie behind Harvey's jest\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\n==Writing==\n[[File:Greene Bacon and Bungay 1594.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Greene's ''[[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]]'' (1594 edition)]]\nAccording to Newcomb, '[Greene's] works evince an inexhaustible linguistic facility, grounded in wide (if not painstaking) reading in the classics, and extra-curricular reading in the modern continental languages'.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} He wrote prolifically: From 1583 to 1592, he published more than twenty-five works in prose, becoming one of the first authors in England to support himself with his pen in an age when professional authorship was virtually unknown.\n\nGreene's literary career began with the publication of a long romance, ''Mamillia'', entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 3 October 1580.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} Greene's romances were written in a highly wrought style which reached its highest level in ''[[Pandosto]]'' (1588) and ''Menaphon'' (1589). Short poems and songs incorporated in some of the romances attest to his ability as a lyric poet. One song from ''Menaphon'', ''Weep not my wanton, smile upon my knee'', (a mother's lullaby to her baby son),  enjoyed immense success, and is now probably his best-known work.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''  7th Edition Dinah Birch ed.  (2009) p.634</ref>\n\nIn his later \"[[coney-catching]]\" pamphlets, Greene fashioned himself into a well-known public figure, telling colourful inside stories of [[Rake (character)|rake]]s and rascals duping young gentlemen and solid citizens out of their hard-earned money. These stories, told from the perspective of a repentant former rascal, have been considered autobiographical, and have been thought to incorporate many facts of Greene's own life thinly veiled as fiction: his early riotous living, his marriage and desertion of his wife and child for the sister of a notorious character of the London underworld, his dealings with players, and his success in the production of plays for them. However, according to Newcomb, in his later prose works \"Greene himself built his persona around a myth of prodigal decline that cannot be taken at face value\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} His plays earned himself the title as one of the \"[[University Wits]]\", including [[George Peele]], [[Thomas Nashe]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]].\n\nRichardson makes a similar argument, concluding that Greene's later works 'prejudice the examination of all the work before them', and that the prose works prior to the cony-catching and repentance pamphlets establish that 'initially at least Greene was respectable'. Richardson considers that Greene:{{sfn|Richardson|1980|pp=178\u20139}}\n\n<blockquote>claimed from the outset a moral or civilizing purpose in his writing. His tales repeatedly illustrate the disastrous disruptions caused in life by passion and laud the life of restraint. His views are basically conservative&nbsp;... He equivocates and hesitates over the defence of the values of a conservative culture, virginity, true devotion, strict moral probity.</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to his prose works, Greene also wrote several plays, none of them published in his lifetime,{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} including ''[[The Scottish History of James IV]]'', ''[[Alphonsus (play)|Alphonsus]]'', and his greatest popular success, ''[[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]]'', as well as ''[[Orlando Furioso (play)|Orlando Furioso]]'', based on [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]''.\n\nIn addition to the plays published under his name after his death, Greene has been proposed as the author of several other dramas, including a second part to ''Friar Bacon'' which may survive as ''[[John of Bordeaux]]'', ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'', ''[[George a Greene]]'', ''[[Fair Em]]'', ''[[A Knack to Know a Knave]]'', ''[[Locrine]]'', ''[[Selimus (play)|Selimus]]'', and ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'', and even [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and Henry VI plays.<ref>Logan and Smith, pp. 81\u201385.</ref>{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\n==Greene and Shakespeare==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2008}}\n{{original research|section|date=October 2008}}\n{{main article|Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit}}\n[[File:Greenes-Groats-worth.png|thumb|''Greene's Groats-worth'']]\nGreene is most familiar to Shakespeare scholars for his pamphlet ''Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit'', which alludes to a line, \"O tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\", found in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' ({{circa}} 1591\u201392):\n\n{{quote|... for there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and being an absolute [[Jack of all trades, master of none|Johannes fac totum]], is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey.}}\n\nGreene evidently complains of an actor who believes he can write as well as university-educated playwrights, alludes to the actor with a quotation that appears in both the ''True Tragedy'' quarto and Shakespeare's Folio version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', and uses the term \"Shake-scene\", a unique term never used before or after Greene's screed, to refer to the actor. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' notes that it is \"Of uncertain or vague meaning: used by Greene in his attack on Shakespeare.\"\n\nSome scholars have hypothesized that all or part of ''Groatsworth'' was written shortly after Greene's death by [[Henry Chettle]] or another one of his fellow writers, hoping to capitalise on a lurid tale of death-bed repentance.{{sfn|Schoone-Jongen|2008|pp=21\u201328}}{{sfn|Carroll|1994|pp=1\u201331}} Hanspeter Born argues that Greene wrote the whole of ''Groatsworth'', and that his deathbed attack on the \"upstart Crow\" was provoked by Shakespeare's interference with a play attributed to Greene, ''A Knack to Know a Knave''.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Why+Greene+was+angry+at+Shakespeare.-a0304726829 Born, Hanspeter, \"Why Greene was Angry at Shakespeare\", ''Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England'' 25 (2012), 133\u2013173].</ref>\n\nGreene's colourful and irresponsible character has led some, including [[Stephen Greenblatt]], to speculate that Greene may have served as the model for Shakespeare's [[Falstaff]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} His quotation has also been used as the title for the 2016 sitcom ''[[Upstart Crow]]'' on Shakespeare's life, written by [[Ben Elton]], its story commencing in 1592 (the year the quotation was written) and featuring Greene as a character (played by [[Mark Heap]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-12-08/david-mitchell-to-play-shakespeare-in-new-bbc2-sitcom|title=David Mitchell to play Shakespeare in new BBC2 sitcom|newspaper=RadioTimes|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Some Prose works==\n*''Mamillia: A Mirror or Looking-glass for the Ladies of England'' (1583), dedicated to Lord Darcy of the North\n*''Mamillia: The Second Part of the Triumph of Pallas'' (1593), dedicated to Robert Lee and Roger Portington\n*''The Anatomy of Lovers' Flatteries'' (1584), dedicated to Mary Rogers, wife to Master Hugh Rogers of Everton{{sfn|Laoutaris|2008|p=88}}\n*''The Myrrour of Modestie'' (1584), dedicated to [[Margaret Stanley, Countess of Derby|Margaret, Countess of Derby]]\n*''Arbasto;

Robert Greene was a popular Elizabethan dramatist and pamphleteer known for his negative critiques of his colleagues. He is said to have been born in [[Norwich]].{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} He attended [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], receiving a BA in 1580, and an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|M.A.]] in 1583 before moving to London, where he arguably became the first professional author in England. Greene was prolific and published in many genres including romances, plays and autobiography.\n\n==Family==\nAccording to Richardson, \"The chief problem in compiling a biography of Robert Greene is the name. ''Robert'' must have been almost the most popular Elizabethan Christian name and ''Greene'' is no unusual surname\".{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=165}} Newcomb states that Robert Greene\n\n<blockquote>was probably the Robert Greene, son of Robert Greene, baptized on 11 July 1558 at St George's, Tombland, Norwich. Greene later described himself as from Norwich on his title-pages, and the year is appropriate for the Robert Greene who matriculated at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], as a [[sizar]] on 26 November 1575. The author's father was probably one of two Robert Greenes found later in parish records: either a saddler who lived modestly in the parish until 1599, or a [[cordwainer]] who kept an inn in Norwich from the late 1570s until his death in 1591. The saddler appeals to biographers who attribute the writer's later low-life sympathies to a humble birth; the innkeeper, a more prosperous man possibly related to landowners, interests scholars who note the social ambitions of Greene's early works. However, in his will proved in 1591, the innkeeper did not mention a son Robert, although he may have disinherited that son (as the writer implied in one autobiographical statement).</blockquote>\n\nBoth the Norwich cordwainer-turned-innkeeper and the Norwich saddler left wills, proved in 1591 and 1596 respectively, but neither will mentions a son named Robert.{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=166}}\n\n==Career==\nGreene is thought to have attended the [[Norwich Grammar School]], although this cannot be confirmed as enrolment documents for the relevant years are lost.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], provided scholarships for students from the Norwich grammar school, and for this reason Greene's matriculation as a [[sizar]] at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], has been considered \"strange\".{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=170}}{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Parr|1962|pp=536\u20137}} A reason offered for Greene's enrolment at St John's is that some of the gentry of South Yorkshire attended St John's, and among the dedicatees of, or authors of [[commendatory verse]]s for Greene's books were members of the Darcy, Portington, Lee, Stapleton, and Rogers families, all centred at [[Snaith]], Yorkshire; according to Richardson, the Robert Greene from Norwich who was an innkeeper may have been an immigrant from Yorkshire connected to 'a large family of Greenes' who lived in the parish of [[Snaith]], and may actually have left Norwich to reside at Snaith from 1571 to 1577.{{sfn|Richardson|1980|pp=160\u20133, 170\u20131}}{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\nThere is no record of Greene's having taken part in the dramatic productions at Cambridge in 1579 and 1580, although 18 of his classmates and Fellows of the Cambridge colleges acted in ''Hymenaeus'', and 46 in ''[[Richardus Tertius]]''.{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=542}}{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=175}} His academic performance as an undergraduate at Cambridge was mediocre; on 22 January 1580 he took his BA, graduating 38th out of 41 students in his college, and 115th out of the total university graduating class that year of 205 students.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}} He \"apparently transferred to [[Clare College, Cambridge|Clare College]] for his 1583 MA\", where he placed 5th out of 12 students in his college, and 29th of the 129 students at the university.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}}<ref>{{acad|id=GRN575R|name=Greene, Robert}}</ref> It was \"rare for a student to migrate to another college (as Greene did) after he had received the baccalaureate\",{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=538}} and no record of Greene's transfer to Clare College has been discovered, nor does his name appear in the Clare Hall Buttery Book for 1580\u201384.{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}} Greene's claim to association with Clare College is found in the second part of ''Mamillia'', which was not published until 1593, after Greene's death, in which the dedicatory epistle to Robert Lee and Roger Portington is signed \"Robert Greene. From my Studie in Clarehall the vii. Of Julie\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}<ref>Newcomb states that 7 July was \"the very date in 1583 on which Greene graduated MA from Clare College\"; however according to Parr, Pruvost \"mistakenly contends that the M.A. was always awarded in July\", and there is no record of the time of year at which M.A. degrees were awarded in 1583, although \"those of 1577\u201380 were awarded in March and April\" (p. 540).</ref>\n\n[[File:Greenes-Farewell-to-Folly.png|thumb|Title page of ''Greene's Farewell to Folly'', 1591]]\n\nAccording to Newcomb, \"Other events of [Greene's] youth must be derived from autobiographical remarks that may not be reliable\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} In ''The Repentance of Robert Greene'', written in the first person, Greene claimed to have travelled to Italy and Spain; however, no evidence of Greene's continental trip has been found, \"or\u2014unless we take merely his word for it\u2014that he ever made the trip at all\".{{sfn|Parr|1962|p=540}} Further doubt is cast on Greene's continental journey by Norbert Bolz, who after undertaking a computer analysis of the vocabulary of ''The Repentance'', concluded that \"''The Repentance of Robert Greene'' was in fact not written by Robert Greene\".{{sfn|Bolz|1979|pp=66\u20137}}\n\nIn ''The Repentance'', Greene claimed to have married a gentleman's daughter, whom he abandoned after having had a child by her and spent her dowry, after which she went to [[Lincolnshire]], and he to London.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} In ''Four Letters'' (1592), [[Gabriel Harvey]] prints a letter allegedly written by Greene to his wife in which he addresses her as \"Doll\". However, \"[E]xtensive searches of London and Norwich records by successive biographers have failed finally to locate the record of Greene's marriage\".{{sfn|Richardson|1980|p=173}}\n\nAfter his move to [[London]], Greene published over twenty-five works in prose in a variety of genres, becoming \"England's first celebrity author\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\nIn 1588, he was granted an MA from [[Oxford University]], \"almost certainly a courtesy degree\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} Thereafter the title pages of some of his published works bore the phrase ''Utruisq. Academiae in Artibus Magister''', \"Master of Arts in both Universities\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\nGreene died 3 September 1592,{{sfn|Dyce|1874|p=57}}<ref>Dyce appears to be the first to give the specific date of Greene's death, but cites no source.</ref> (aged 34 if he was the Robert Greene baptised in 1558). His death and burial were announced by Gabriel Harvey in a letter to Christopher Bird of [[Saffron Walden]] dated 5 September, first published as a \"butterfly pamphlet\" about 8 September, and later expanded as ''Four Letters and Certain Sonnets'', entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 4 December 1592.{{sfn|McKerrow I|1958|pp=151\u2013153}}{{sfn|McKerrow II|1958|pp=81\u201382, 87}} Harvey attributed Greene's demise to \"a surfeit of pickle herring and Rhenish wine\",{{sfn|McKerrow II|1958|p=82}} and claimed he had been buried in \"the [[New_Churchyard|new churchyard]] near [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]]\" on 4 September.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}{{sfn|Hartle|2017|pp= 40\u201341}} No record of Greene's burial has been found.\n\nAccording to ''The Repentance of Robert Greene'', Greene is alleged to have written ''Groatsworth'' during the month prior to his death, including in it a letter to his wife asking her to forgive him and stating that he was sending their son to her. No record of Greene's son by his wife has been found; however, in ''Four Letters'', [[Gabriel Harvey]] claimed that Greene kept a mistress, Em, the sister of a criminal known as \"[[Cutting Ball]]\" hanged at [[Tyburn]]. Harvey described her as \"a sorry ragged quean of whom [Greene] had his base son Infortunatus Greene\". According to Newcomb, a Fortunatus Greene was buried at [[Shoreditch]] on 12 August 1593, \"whose folk-tale name might lie behind Harvey's jest\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\n==Writing==\n[[File:Greene Bacon and Bungay 1594.jpg|thumb|left|Title page of Greene's ''[[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]]'' (1594 edition)]]\nAccording to Newcomb, '[Greene's] works evince an inexhaustible linguistic facility, grounded in wide (if not painstaking) reading in the classics, and extra-curricular reading in the modern continental languages'.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} He wrote prolifically: From 1583 to 1592, he published more than twenty-five works in prose, becoming one of the first authors in England to support himself with his pen in an age when professional authorship was virtually unknown.\n\nGreene's literary career began with the publication of a long romance, ''Mamillia'', entered in the [[Stationers' Register]] on 3 October 1580.{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} Greene's romances were written in a highly wrought style which reached its highest level in ''[[Pandosto]]'' (1588) and ''Menaphon'' (1589). Short poems and songs incorporated in some of the romances attest to his ability as a lyric poet. One song from ''Menaphon'', ''Weep not my wanton, smile upon my knee'', (a mother's lullaby to her baby son),  enjoyed immense success, and is now probably his best-known work.<ref>''The Oxford Companion to English Literature''  7th Edition Dinah Birch ed.  (2009) p.634</ref>\n\nIn his later \"[[coney-catching]]\" pamphlets, Greene fashioned himself into a well-known public figure, telling colourful inside stories of [[Rake (character)|rake]]s and rascals duping young gentlemen and solid citizens out of their hard-earned money. These stories, told from the perspective of a repentant former rascal, have been considered autobiographical, and have been thought to incorporate many facts of Greene's own life thinly veiled as fiction: his early riotous living, his marriage and desertion of his wife and child for the sister of a notorious character of the London underworld, his dealings with players, and his success in the production of plays for them. However, according to Newcomb, in his later prose works \"Greene himself built his persona around a myth of prodigal decline that cannot be taken at face value\".{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} His plays earned himself the title as one of the \"[[University Wits]]\", including [[George Peele]], [[Thomas Nashe]], and [[Christopher Marlowe]].\n\nRichardson makes a similar argument, concluding that Greene's later works 'prejudice the examination of all the work before them', and that the prose works prior to the cony-catching and repentance pamphlets establish that 'initially at least Greene was respectable'. Richardson considers that Greene:{{sfn|Richardson|1980|pp=178\u20139}}\n\n<blockquote>claimed from the outset a moral or civilizing purpose in his writing. His tales repeatedly illustrate the disastrous disruptions caused in life by passion and laud the life of restraint. His views are basically conservative&nbsp;... He equivocates and hesitates over the defence of the values of a conservative culture, virginity, true devotion, strict moral probity.</blockquote>\n\nIn addition to his prose works, Greene also wrote several plays, none of them published in his lifetime,{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}} including ''[[The Scottish History of James IV]]'', ''[[Alphonsus (play)|Alphonsus]]'', and his greatest popular success, ''[[Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay]]'', as well as ''[[Orlando Furioso (play)|Orlando Furioso]]'', based on [[Ludovico Ariosto]]'s ''[[Orlando Furioso]]''.\n\nIn addition to the plays published under his name after his death, Greene has been proposed as the author of several other dramas, including a second part to ''Friar Bacon'' which may survive as ''[[John of Bordeaux]]'', ''[[The Troublesome Reign of King John]]'', ''[[George a Greene]]'', ''[[Fair Em]]'', ''[[A Knack to Know a Knave]]'', ''[[Locrine]]'', ''[[Selimus (play)|Selimus]]'', and ''[[Edward III (play)|Edward III]]'', and even [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' and Henry VI plays.<ref>Logan and Smith, pp. 81\u201385.</ref>{{sfn|Newcomb|2004}}\n\n==Greene and Shakespeare==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2008}}\n{{original research|section|date=October 2008}}\n{{main article|Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit}}\n[[File:Greenes-Groats-worth.png|thumb|''Greene's Groats-worth'']]\nGreene is most familiar to Shakespeare scholars for his pamphlet ''Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit'', which alludes to a line, \"O tiger's heart wrapped in a woman's hide\", found in Shakespeare's ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' ({{circa}} 1591\u201392):\n\n{{quote|... for there is an upstart Crow, beautified with our feathers, that with his Tygers hart wrapt in a Players hyde, supposes he is as well able to bombast out a blanke verse as the best of you: and being an absolute [[Jack of all trades, master of none|Johannes fac totum]], is in his owne conceit the onely Shake-scene in a countrey.}}\n\nGreene evidently complains of an actor who believes he can write as well as university-educated playwrights, alludes to the actor with a quotation that appears in both the ''True Tragedy'' quarto and Shakespeare's Folio version of ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', and uses the term \"Shake-scene\", a unique term never used before or after Greene's screed, to refer to the actor. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' notes that it is \"Of uncertain or vague meaning: used by Greene in his attack on Shakespeare.\"\n\nSome scholars have hypothesized that all or part of ''Groatsworth'' was written shortly after Greene's death by [[Henry Chettle]] or another one of his fellow writers, hoping to capitalise on a lurid tale of death-bed repentance.{{sfn|Schoone-Jongen|2008|pp=21\u201328}}{{sfn|Carroll|1994|pp=1\u201331}} Hanspeter Born argues that Greene wrote the whole of ''Groatsworth'', and that his deathbed attack on the \"upstart Crow\" was provoked by Shakespeare's interference with a play attributed to Greene, ''A Knack to Know a Knave''.<ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Why+Greene+was+angry+at+Shakespeare.-a0304726829 Born, Hanspeter, \"Why Greene was Angry at Shakespeare\", ''Medieval and Renaissance Drama in England'' 25 (2012), 133\u2013173].</ref>\n\nGreene's colourful and irresponsible character has led some, including [[Stephen Greenblatt]], to speculate that Greene may have served as the model for Shakespeare's [[Falstaff]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} His quotation has also been used as the title for the 2016 sitcom ''[[Upstart Crow]]'' on Shakespeare's life, written by [[Ben Elton]], its story commencing in 1592 (the year the quotation was written) and featuring Greene as a character (played by [[Mark Heap]]).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2015-12-08/david-mitchell-to-play-shakespeare-in-new-bbc2-sitcom|title=David Mitchell to play Shakespeare in new BBC2 sitcom|newspaper=RadioTimes|access-date=2017-01-13}}</ref>\n\n==Some Prose works==\n*''Mamillia: A Mirror or Looking-glass for the Ladies of England'' (1583), dedicated to Lord Darcy of the North\n*''Mamillia: The Second Part of the Triumph of Pallas'' (1593), dedicated to Robert Lee and Roger Portington\n*''The Anatomy of Lovers' Flatteries'' (1584), dedicated to Mary Rogers, wife to Master Hugh Rogers of Everton{{sfn|Laoutaris|2008|p=88}}\n*''The Myrrour of Modestie'' (1584), dedicated to [[Margaret Stanley, Countess of Derby|Margaret, Countess of Derby]]\n*''Arbasto;

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \"Jack the Ripper\" after [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] fears that a [[revolution]] is in the air in London's East End.\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant [[George Godley]]. These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] - Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], an aging [[alcoholic]] whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking\n* [[Lewis Collins]] - Sergeant [[George Godley]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] - [[Richard Mansfield]], American Stage actor in the theatrical play ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]''\n* [[Ray McAnally]] - [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Physician-in-Ordinary to [[Queen Victoria]] \n* [[Ken Bones]] - [[Robert James Lees]], Queen Victoria's psychic medium\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] - [[Catherine Eddowes]], fourth victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] - Emma Prentiss \n* [[Harry Andrews]] - [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]] \n* [[Lysette Anthony]] - [[Mary Jane Kelly]], fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Gerald Sim]] - Dr. [[George Bagster Phillips]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] - [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]] [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] - Chief Superintendent of Police [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]]\n* [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]] - [[Coach (carriage)|Coach]] driver [[John Netley]]\n* [[Michael Gothard]] - [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], and a violent [[Marxism|Marxist]] and power-hungry politician\n* [[T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect. The blu-ray release contains the same extras contained in the previous DVD releases.\n\n==Historical accuracy==\n\nJack the Ripper (1988 TV series) contains numerous historical inaccuracies:\n\nPrince Albert Victor is referred to in the film as The Duke of Clarence, when in fact he did not assume this title until May 1890, two years after the murders.\n\nJane Seymour's character, Emma Prentiss, claims that the illustration she has drawn is for The Strand Magazine, when in fact that publication did exist until 1891.\n\nA photographer is seen photographing the corpse of Annie Chapman at the murder scene. In reality, photographing a murder scene was not common practice at the time and the body was not photographed until being transferred to the mortuary.\n\nAccording to their uniforms, the constables in the film were assigned to 'J' division, whereas Whitechapel was actually 'H' division.\n\nThe film claims that the murderer has cut off the years of Catharine Eddowes. In reality, her ears were left intact, with only the lobe of one ear becoming detached during the transporting of the corpse to the mortuary.\n\nBloodhounds are visible at the scene of Mary Jane Kelly's murder in Miller's Court. While the use of bloodhounds was indeed considered and trialed, they were not actually employed during the investigation.\n\nWhen the body of Mary Jane Kelly is discovered, the view of the corspe through the window is incorrect. It is seen as being face-on, whereas the body was actually side-on, with the head to the right.\n\nSusan George, playing common prostitute Catharine Eddowes is far too well-dressed for a woman of Eddowes' class, clad in a fashionable and expensive 'Bustle' dress.\n\nFrederick Abberline is portrayed as both single and an alcoholic, who is transferred to Whitechapel as a form of demotion. In fact, Abberline was happily married at the time of murders and there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that he was an alcoholic. Furthermore, Abberline was re-assigned to field work from Scotland Yard due to his intimate knowledge of the area, having worked there for fourteen years.\n\nFar from being a violet anarchist and socialist as depicted in the film, George Lusk was in fact a respected and mild-mannered local builder and recent widower with seven children.\n\n==Reception==\n===Awards===\n''Jack the Ripper'' was nominated for the following awards:\n\n*[[Emmy Award|Emmy]] -1989- Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Special: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n*[[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Michael Caine]] Won (Award Tied)\n*Golden Globe -1989- Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for TV: [[Armand Assante]] Nominated\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Murder by Decree]]''\n*''[[From Hell (film)]]''\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{IMDb title|id=0095388|title=Jack the Ripper}}\n*{{amg title|25712|Jack the Ripper}}\n*[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm Review on Eofftv.com]\n\n{{Jack the Ripper media}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Jack the Ripper (1988 Tv Series)}}\n[[Category:1988 British television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1988 British television series endings]]\n[[Category:1980s British drama television series]]\n[[Category:1980s British television miniseries]]\n[[Category:ITV television dramas]]\n[[Category:Films set in 1888]]\n[[Category:Television series about Jack the Ripper]]\n[[Category:Television series by Warner Bros.

Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]] of [[Scotland Yard]] is assigned by his superiors to investigate the murder and brutal mutilation of a prostitute in the [[East End of London]]. As the mutilated corpses of other \"[[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] whores\" turn up in the same area, London's tabloid journalists - particularly Benjamin Bates of ''[[The Star (London)|The Star]]'' - whip up a public frenzy. The killer is nicknamed \"Jack the Ripper\" after [[Dear Boss letter|a letter]] bearing that name and supposedly from the killer, is forwarded to Scotland Yard. As the Ripper terrorizes London, public outrage erupts throughout the country, and Police Commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] fears that a [[revolution]] is in the air in London's East End.\n\nThere is no shortage of suspects for Abberline and his partner, Sergeant [[George Godley]]. These suspects include the American actor [[Richard Mansfield]] (appearing in the play ''[[Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' in London); police surgeon Dr Henry Llewellyn; [[socialist]] agitator [[George Lusk]]; [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[clairvoyant]] [[Robert James Lees|Robert Lees]]; the Queen's grandson [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]]; and Dr [[Theodore Dyke Acland]], the son-in-law of [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Royal Surgeon to Queen Victoria and expert on diseases of the brain. The police and the authorities want the murders solved at any cost, but Abberline and Godley face huge obstacles as they search for the truth - and hindrance from their superiors when the killer is finally unmasked.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Caine]] - Chief Inspector [[Frederick Abberline]], an aging [[alcoholic]] whose quest to solve the murders gives him the strength to give up drinking\n* [[Lewis Collins]] - Sergeant [[George Godley]]\n* [[Armand Assante]] - [[Richard Mansfield]], American Stage actor in the theatrical play ''[[Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde|Jekyll and Hyde]]''\n* [[Ray McAnally]] - [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], Physician-in-Ordinary to [[Queen Victoria]] \n* [[Ken Bones]] - [[Robert James Lees]], Queen Victoria's psychic medium\n* [[Susan George (actress)|Susan George]] - [[Catherine Eddowes]], fourth victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] - Emma Prentiss \n* [[Harry Andrews]] - [[Coroner]] [[Wynne Edwin Baxter|Wynne Baxter]] \n* [[Lysette Anthony]] - [[Mary Jane Kelly]], fifth and last victim of Jack the Ripper\n* [[Gerald Sim]] - Dr. [[George Bagster Phillips]]\n* [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] - [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner of Police]] [[Charles Warren|Sir Charles Warren]]\n* [[Edward Judd]] - Chief Superintendent of Police [[Thomas Arnold (policeman)|Thomas Arnold]]\n* [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]] - [[Coach (carriage)|Coach]] driver [[John Netley]]\n* [[Michael Gothard]] - [[George Lusk]], Chairman of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]], and a violent [[Marxism|Marxist]] and power-hungry politician\n* [[T.

(In real-life, at the time of the Ripper murders, Abberline was married to Emma Beament, the daughter of a merchant. In ''Jack the Ripper'', Emma Prentiss is not married to Abberline.) Furthermore, the series' portrayal of Abberline unmasking the Ripper as William Gull contradicts the fact that the real-life Abberline believed that the Ripper was actually [[George Chapman (murderer)|George Chapman]]. [[George Lusk]] of the [[Whitechapel Vigilance Committee]] was depicted in the film as a violent, argumentative troublemaker when in fact he was very quiet, a good local business man who was known for his peaceful nature, a [[churchwarden]] and a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. [[Hugh Fraser (actor)|Hugh Fraser]] wore clothing that his character, [[Sir Charles Warren]], had actually worn. This was both [[Harry Andrews]] and [[Edward Judd]]'s last production. [[Armand Assante]]'s stand-in died during filming. Of her experience filming ''Jack the Ripper'', [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] said, \"That was fun. I played it as a redhead, it was a great role, and of course I got to work with the great Michael Caine. I had been warned that Michael is tough on actors and actresses unless they know their lines and are very professional, which mostly I was, but they didn\u2019t tell me that he literally liked to do one take and then go and have lunch with his wife. Which is basically what happened! So you\u2019d show up, and unless the [microphone] landed on you or the camera bumped onto you or he messed up, which he never did, that was it. It was one take, and then you\u2019re on to the next. So that was interesting.\"<ref name=\"Harris\"/> [[Michael Caine]] worked with ''Jack the Ripper'' director David Wickes on another television film: the four-hour, two-part ''Jekyll & Hyde'' (1990), based on [[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|the book]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]. The story of Jekyll and Hyde is a plot-point in Wickes' ''Jack the Ripper'' series.\n\nUsing historical characters involved in the genuine 1888 hunt for the killer, ''Jack the Ripper'' was written by [[Derek Marlowe]] and David Wickes and [[film director|directed]] by Wickes. The series drew heavily on the same discredited [[Freemasonry|Masonic]]/[[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] [[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution#Claims of Thomas Stowell|conspiracy theory]] as the 1978 film ''[[Murder By Decree]]''; it is also the account presented in the 2001 film ''[[From Hell (film)|From Hell]]''. This theory was first put forward in the 1960s by [[Thomas E. A. Stowell]] who published his claims in a November 1970 issue of ''The Criminologist''.<ref>Stowell, T. E. A. (November 1970) \"Jack the Ripper&nbsp;\u2013 A Solution?\". ''The Criminologist'' vol.5 pp.40\u201351</ref> The theory was later turned into the bestselling ''[[Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution]]'' (1976) by [[Stephen Knight (author)|Stephen Knight]]. The 1988 series dispenses with the fictional [[Sherlock Holmes]] who uncovered the conspiracy in ''Murder By Decree'' and instead concentrates on the real-life [[Whitechapel]] detective [[Frederick Abberline]], as assisted by Sergeant [[George Godley]].<ref name=eoff>[http://www.eofftv.com/review/j/jack_the_ripper_1988_review.htm ''Jack the Ripper'' reviewed on Eofftv.com]</ref>\n\nThe series is constructed as a [[Whodunit]] in which viewers are led to suspect, at various points, that [[Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale|Prince Albert Victor]], [[Richard Mansfield]], [[George Lusk]], Henry Llewellyn or [[Theodore Dyke Acland]] could be Jack the Ripper. Before ''Jack the Ripper'' was broadcast, director/co-writer David Wickes claimed that he had been allowed unprecedented access to the [[Scotland Yard]] files on the [[Jack the Ripper|Ripper]] case and stated that his production would be revealing the 'true' identity of Jack the Ripper for the first time. After pressure from [[Ripperologist]] [[Melvin Harris]] and others, Wickes was forced to withdraw this claim.<ref name=eoff/> Nevertheless, the series begins with a disclaimer on behalf of the production staff, stating, ''\"Our story is based on extensive research, including a review of the official files by special permission of the [[Home Office]] and interviews with leading criminologists and Scotland Yard officials.\"'' The series' \"revelation\" that [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]] was Jack the Ripper was not new: Stephen Knight's 1976 book alleged that Gull was the Ripper, and prior to that, the theory had been cited in the 1973 [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Jack the Ripper (1973 TV series)|Jack the Ripper]]'' (two episodes of which were directed by David Wickes). Furthermore, the Ripper character in the film ''Murder by Decree'', assigned the fictitious name \"Sir Thomas Spivey,\" was based on Sir William Gull.\n\nMarlowe and Wickes retained ''The Final Solution''{{'}}s contention that William Gull was Jack the Ripper, but dispensed with most of the rest of the theory: the involvement of Prince Albert Victor is dismissed as a [[Red herring]]; there is no mention of [[Walter Sickert]], Annie Crook, an illegitimate Royal baby, blackmail, or [[Freemasons]]; and the explanation given for the murders is [[dementia]], acquired by Gull from a [[stroke]]. The original script adhered more closely to ''The Final Solution'' but was changed during the course of production: interviewed in 2017, [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]] stated \"when we first got the script, they kind of implicated the Masons as being involved, and by the time we finished the movie, there was pretty much no mention of the Masons.\"<ref name=\"Harris\">{{cite web |first=Will |last=Harris |url=http://www.avclub.com/article/jane-seymour-how-dr-quinn-was-not-supposed-last-an-253538 |title=Jane Seymour on how Dr. Quinn was not supposed to last and her \"whole new career\" in comedy|date=17 April 2017 |work=[[The A.V. Club]]}}</ref>\n\nThe series ends with Gull's son-in-law, Dr. Theodore Dyke Acland, theorising that Gull was using himself as a case-study of [[multiple personality disorder]] (giving free rein to his murderous impulses in an effort to understand his own multi-faceted mind). The series presents Gull acting of his own accord (with only coachman [[John Netley]] complicit in his crimes), and conspiracy only coming into play ''after'' Gull's arrest: according to the series, Gull's murders were covered up at the behest of police commissioner [[Sir Charles Warren]] to avoid a scandal, as Gull was [[Queen Victoria]]'s physician. The series' denouement thus differs to Stephen Knight's claim that Warren was aware of the Ripper's identity as the crimes were being committed.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' ends with the following disclaimer:\n\n{{cquote|''In the strange case of Jack the Ripper, there was no trial and no signed confession.''\n\n''In 1888, neither fingerprinting nor bloodtyping was in use and no conclusive forensic, documentary or eye-witness testimony was available. Thus, positive proof of the Ripper\u2019s identity is not available.''\n\n''We have come to our conclusions after careful study and painstaking deduction. Other researchers, criminologists and writers may take a different view.''\n\n''We believe our conclusions to be true.''}}\n\nThe series was originally mounted on a relatively low-budget, with interior photography shot on video-tape and location footage shot on 16-mm film (as was common practice for British television productions of the time). Filming commenced in October 1987, with [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] of ''[[Van der Valk (TV series)|Van der Valk]]'' cast in the role of Abberline. Production was halted in December 1987 after the American television network [[CBS]] became interested in the project, and most of the original cast and crew were paid off.\n[[File:Michael Caine - Viennale 2012 g (cropped).jpg|thumb|160px|right|[[Michael Caine]] played [[Frederick Abberline]]]]\n''Jack the Ripper'' was consequently re-tooled as an [[UK|Anglo]]-[[US|American]] co-production with an $11 million budget (provided jointly by [[Thames Television]] and CBS), shot entirely on film. It was decided that a more famous actor would be required to headline the series if it was to sell in the [[United States]], so the role of Abberline was recast with the actor [[Michael Caine]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo-michael-caine-in-the-film-jack-the-ripper-playing-the-part-of-inspector-20264135.html |title=Michael Caine in the film Jack the ripper playing the part of Inspector fred abberline |access-date=5 September 2018 |work=[[Alamy]] |date=1 September 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/tv/1988/10/16/michael-caine/02b17497-e700-4ea4-9a6d-529ac5204ec1/ |title=Michael Caine |first=Michael E. |last=Hill |date=16 October 1988 |access-date=5 September 2018 |newspaper=[[Washington Post]]}}</ref> - ironically, Foster had earlier replaced Caine in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[Frenzy]]'', when Caine refused to play a serial killer who mutilates women.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kevin |last=Mcgue |url=http://www.alifeatthemovies.com/jack-the-ripper/ |title=Jack the Ripper film review|date=24 April 2010 |work=A Life at the Movies}}</ref> The casting of Michael Caine was considered to be a major coup, as the actor was not known for doing television work. ''Jack the Ripper'' reportedly earned Caine a fee of $1 million.\n\nIn the original version of the series, Abberline's partner George Godley was to have been played by [[Brian Capron]].<ref name=eofftv/><ref>[http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm Series background on Eofftv.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511035436/http://www.eofftv.com/j/jac/jack_the_ripper_1988_main.htm |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref> He was replaced by [[Lewis Collins]] who was best known as Bodie in the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] action series ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]''. American actor [[Armand Assante]] and British actress [[Jane Seymour (actress)|Jane Seymour]], both well known to American audiences, were added to the cast at the suggestion of CBS. [[Ken Bones]], [[George Sweeney (actor)|George Sweeney]], [[Edward Judd]] and Kelly Cryer all played the parts they were cast for in the unfinished version of the series.\n\n''Jack the Ripper'' began filming in February 1988, with principal photography at [[Pinewood Studios]]. David Wickes was determined that as few people as possible should know who would be unmasked as the killer, and shot four dummy endings (revealing George Lusk, Inspector Spratling, Chief Superintendent Arnold and Sir Charles Warren as the Ripper) to put the cast and crew off the scent. He also mocked up a scene with Godley pulling William Gull from a coach in a case of mistaken identity, and then edited them all together to produce the end result. Reportedly, only eight members of Wickes' staff knew the truth before production wrapped.<ref name=eofftv>[http://www.startrader.co.uk/Action%20TV/articles/jtr.htm Action TV Online]</ref>\n\nThe series premiered in the UK on 11 October 1988, and in the USA on 21 October 1988. (The original broadcast thus occurred within the timeframe of the centenary of the Ripper's \"Canonical Five\" murders, 31 August-9 November 1888.) The series enjoyed extremely high ratings on both sides of the Atlantic.<ref name=\"eofftv\"/>\n\nSeveral DVD editions of ''Jack the Ripper'' include, as extra features, [[audio commentary]] by director/co-writer David Wickes and production assistant Sue Davies, and twenty minutes of footage from the original shoot starring [[Barry Foster (actor)|Barry Foster]] and [[Brian Capron]]. The series was released on Blu-ray on 27 March 2017. This edition features two versions of the series over two discs, the first presenting the series in two parts as originally broadcast and in its original 4:3 aspect. The second disc contains the series as one film and in a 16:9 widescreen aspect.

It is considered a defining work of the postwar [[Beat Generation|Beat]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture]] generations, with its protagonists living life against a backdrop of jazz, poetry, and drug use. The novel is a [[roman \u00e0 clef]], with many key figures of the Beat movement, such as [[William S. Burroughs]] (Old Bull Lee), [[Allen Ginsberg]] (Carlo Marx), and [[Neal Cassady]] (Dean Moriarty) represented by characters in the book, including Kerouac himself as the narrator Sal Paradise.\n\nThe idea for ''On the Road'', Kerouac's second novel, was formed during the late 1940s in a series of notebooks, and then typed out on a continuous reel of paper during three weeks in April 1951. It was published by [[Viking Press]] in 1957.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' hailed the book's appearance as \"the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat,' and whose principal avatar he is.\"<ref name=\"millstein\"/> In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''On the Road'' 55th on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].  The novel was chosen by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/2005/100books/the_complete_list.html |work=TIME Magazine |title= ALL-TIME 100 Novels: The Complete List|date=2005}}</ref>\n\n==Production and publication==\n\nAfter Kerouac dropped out of [[Columbia University]], he served on several different sailing vessels before returning to New York to write.  He met and mixed with [[Beat Generation]] figures [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]], and [[Neal Cassady]]. Between 1947 and 1950, while writing what would become ''[[The Town and the City]]'' (1950), Kerouac engaged in the road adventures that would form ''On the Road''.<ref name=\"Charters\">{{cite book|author=Ann Charters|title=Introduction to On the Road|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York}}</ref> Kerouac carried small notebooks, in which much of the text was written as the eventful span of road trips unfurled. He started working on the first of several versions of the novel as early as 1948, based on experiences during his first long road trip in 1947. However, he remained dissatisfied with the novel.<ref>{{cite news|author=Brinkley, Douglas |title=In the Kerouac Archive|work= Atlantic Monthly|date=November 1998|pages= 49\u201376}}</ref> Inspired by a 10,000-word rambling letter from his friend [[Neal Cassady]], Kerouac in 1950 outlined the \"Essentials of Spontaneous Prose\" and decided to tell the story of his years on the road with Cassady as if writing a letter to a friend in a form that reflected the improvisational fluidity of jazz.<ref>{{cite book|author=Charters, Ann |date=1973|title= Kerouac: A Biography|location= San Francisco|publisher= Straight Arrow Books}}</ref> In a letter to a student in 1961, Kerouac wrote: \"Dean and I were embarked on a journey through post-Whitman America to FIND that America and to FIND the inherent goodness in American man.

The novel contains five parts, three of them describing road trips with Moriarty. The narrative takes place in the years 1947 to 1950, is full of [[Americana]], and marks a specific era in [[Jazz#1940s and 1950s|jazz history]], \"somewhere between its [[Charlie Parker]] ''[[Ornithology (composition)|Ornithology]]'' period and another period that began with [[Miles Davis]].\"  The novel is largely autobiographical, Sal being the alter ego of the author and Dean standing for [[Neal Cassady]].\n\n===Part One===\nThe first section describes Sal's first trip to [[San Francisco]].  Disheartened after a divorce, his life changes when he meets Dean Moriarty, who is \"tremendously excited with life,\" and begins to long for the freedom of the road: \"Somewhere along the line I knew there would be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.\"  He sets off in July 1947 with fifty dollars in his pocket. After taking several buses and hitchhiking, he arrives in Denver, where he hooks up with Carlo Marx, Dean, and their friends. There are parties\u2014among them an excursion to the ghost town of Central City. Eventually Sal leaves by bus and gets to San Francisco, where he meets Remi Boncoeur and his girlfriend Lee Ann. Remi arranges for Sal to take a job as a [[security guard|night watchman]] at a boarding camp for [[Merchant Marines|merchant sailors]] waiting for their ship. Not holding this job for long, Sal hits the road again. \"Oh, where is the girl I love?\" he wonders. Soon he meets Terry, the \"cutest little Mexican girl,\" on the bus to Los Angeles. They stay together, traveling back to [[Bakersfield]], then to Sabinal, \"her hometown,\" where her family works in the fields. He meets Terry's brother Ricky, who teaches him the true meaning of \"ma\u00f1ana\" (\"tomorrow\"). Working in the cotton fields, Sal realizes that he is not made for this type of work. Leaving Terry behind, he takes the bus back to [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]], bums a quarter off a preacher who looks the other way, and arrives at his aunt's house in Paterson, just missing Dean, who had come to see him, by two days.\n\n===Part Two===\nIn December 1948 Sal is celebrating Christmas with his relatives in Testament, Virginia, when Dean shows up with Marylou (having left his second wife, Camille, and their newborn baby, Amy, in San Francisco) and Ed Dunkel. Sal's Christmas plans are shattered as \"now the bug was on me again, and the bug's name was Dean Moriarty.\" First they drive to New York, where they meet Carlo and party. Dean wants Sal to make love to Marylou, but Sal declines. In Dean's Hudson they take off from New York in January 1949 and make it to New Orleans. In Algiers they stay with the morphine-addicted Old Bull Lee and his wife Jane. Galatea Dunkel joins her husband in New Orleans while Sal, Dean, and Marylou continue their trip. Once in San Francisco, Dean again leaves Marylou to be with Camille. \"Dean will leave you out in the cold anytime it is in the interest of him,\" Marylou tells Sal. Both of them stay briefly in a hotel, but soon she moves out, following a nightclub owner. Sal is alone and on Market Street has visions of past lives, birth, and rebirth. Dean finds him and invites him to stay with his family. Together, they visit nightclubs and listen to [[Slim Gaillard]] and other jazz musicians. The stay ends on a sour note: \"what I accomplished by coming to Frisco I don't know,\" and Sal departs, taking the bus back to New York.\n\n===Part Three===\nIn the spring of 1949, Sal takes a bus from New York to [[Denver]]. He is depressed and lonesome; none of his friends are around. After receiving some money, he leaves Denver for San Francisco to see Dean. Camille is pregnant and unhappy, and Dean has injured his thumb trying to hit Marylou for sleeping with other men. Camille throws them out, and Sal invites Dean to come to New York, planning to travel further to Italy. They meet Galatea, who tells Dean off: \"You have absolutely no regard for anybody but yourself and your kicks.\" Sal realizes she is right\u2014Dean is the \"HOLY GOOF\"\u2014but also defends him, as \"he's got the secret that we're all busting to find out.\"  After a night of jazz and drinking in Little Harlem on [[Folsom Street]], they depart. On the way to Sacramento they meet a \"fag\", who propositions them. Dean tries to hustle some money out of this but is turned down. During this part of the trip Sal and Dean have ecstatic discussions having found \"IT\" and \"TIME\". In Denver a brief argument shows the growing rift between the two, when Dean reminds Sal of his age, Sal being the older of the two. They get a 1947 [[Cadillac]] that needs to be taken to [[Chicago]] from a [[travel bureau]]. Dean drives most of the way, crazy, careless, often speeding at over {{convert|100|mph|km/h|spell=in}}, delivering the car in a disheveled state. By bus they move on to [[Detroit]] and spend a night on [[Skid Row]], Dean hoping to find his homeless father. From Detroit they share a ride to New York and arrive at Sal's aunt's new flat in [[Long Island]]. They go on partying in New York, where Dean meets Inez and gets her pregnant while his wife is expecting their second child.\n\n===Part Four===\nIn the spring of 1950, Sal gets the itch to travel again while Dean is working as a parking lot attendant in Manhattan, living with his girlfriend Inez. Sal notices that he has been reduced to simple pleasures\u2014listening to basketball games and looking at erotic playing cards. By bus Sal takes to the road again, passing [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Ashland, Ohio|Ashland]], [[Cincinnati]], and [[St. Louis]], and eventually reaching Denver. There he meets Stan Shephard, and the two plan to go to [[Mexico City]] when they learn that Dean has bought a car and is on the way to join them. In a rickety '37 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] sedan the three set off across [[Texas]] to [[Laredo, TX|Laredo]], where they cross the border. They are ecstatic, having left \"everything behind us and entering a new and unknown phase of things.\"  Their money buys more (10 cents for a beer), police are laid back, [[cannabis]] is readily available, and people are curious and friendly. The landscape is magnificent. In Gregoria, they meet Victor, a local kid, who leads them to a bordello where they have their last grand party, dancing to mambo, drinking, and having fun with prostitutes. In Mexico City Sal becomes ill from [[dysentery]] and is \"delirious and unconscious.\" Dean leaves him, and Sal later reflects that \"when I got better I realized what a rat he was, but then I had to understand the impossible complexity of his life, how he had to leave me there, sick, to get on with his wives and woes.\"\n\n===Part Five===\nDean, having obtained divorce papers in Mexico, had first returned to New York to marry Inez, only to leave her and go back to Camille. After his recovery from dysentery in Mexico, Sal returns to New York in the fall. He finds a girl, Laura, and plans to move with her to San Francisco. Sal writes to Dean about his plan to move to San Francisco. Dean writes back saying that he's willing to come and accompany Laura and Sal. Dean arrives over five weeks early, but Sal is out taking a late-night walk alone. Sal returns home, sees a copy of [[Proust]], and knows it is Dean's. Sal realizes his friend has arrived, but at a time when Sal doesn't have the money to relocate to San Francisco. On hearing this Dean makes the decision to head back to Camille. Sal's friend Remi Boncoeur denies Sal's request to give Dean a short lift to 40th Street on their way to a [[Duke Ellington]] concert at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]]. Sal's girlfriend Laura realizes this is a painful moment for Sal and prompts him for a response as the party drives off without Dean. Sal replies: \"He'll be alright\". Sal later reflects as he sits on a river pier under a New Jersey night sky about the roads and lands of America that he has travelled and states: \"... I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of Old Dean Moriarty the father we never found, I think of Dean Moriarty.\"\n\n===Characters===\n\nKerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.<ref name=\"Sandison\">Sandison, David.

Some of the earlier reviews spoke highly of the book, but the backlash to these was swift and strong.  Although this was discouraging to Kerouac, he still received great recognition and notoriety from the work.  Since its publication, critical attention has focused on issues of both the context and the style, addressing the actions of the characters as well as the nature of Kerouac's prose.\n\n===Initial reaction===\nIn his review for ''[[The New York Times]],'' Gilbert Millstein wrote, \"its publication is a historic occasion insofar as the exposure of an authentic work of art is of any great moment in an age in which the attention is fragmented and the sensibilities are blunted by the superlatives of fashion\" and praised it as \"a major novel.\"<ref name=\"millstein\">{{cite news | author =Gilbert Millstein | title =  Books of the Times | work = [[The New York Times]] | date =5 September 1957| url = http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/kerouac-millstein.pdf }}</ref> Millstein was already sympathetic toward the Beat Generation and his promotion of the book in the Times did wonders for its recognition and acclaim.  Not only did he like the themes, but also the style, which would come to be just as hotly contested in the reviews that followed.  \"There are sections of ''On the Road'' in which the writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking ... there is some writing on jazz that has never been equaled in American fiction, either for insight, style, or technical virtuosity.\"<ref name=\"millstein\"/> Kerouac and [[Joyce Johnson]], a younger writer he was living with, read the review shortly after midnight at a [[newsstand]] at [[69th Street (Manhattan)|69th Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], near Joyce's apartment in the [[Upper West Side]]. They took their copy of the newspaper to a neighborhood bar and read the review over and over. \"Jack kept shaking his head,\" Joyce remembered later in her memoir ''[[Minor Characters]]'', \"as if he couldn't figure out why he wasn't happier than he was.\" Finally, they returned to her apartment to go to sleep. As Joyce recalled: \"Jack lay down obscure for the last time in his life. The ringing phone woke him the next morning, and he was famous.\"<ref>[[Ann Charters]]' introduction to the 1991 edition of ''On the Road''</ref>\n\nThe backlash began just a few days later in the same publication. [[David Dempsey (writer)|David Dempsey]] published a review that contradicted most of what Millstein had promoted in the book.  \"As a portrait of a disjointed segment of society acting out of its own neurotic necessity, ''On the Road'', is a stunning achievement.  But it is a road, as far as the characters are concerned, that leads to nowhere.\"  While he did not discount the stylistic nature of the text (saying that it was written \"with great relish\"), he dismissed the content as a \"passionate lark\" rather than a novel.\"<ref name=\"dempsey\">{{cite news |author =David Dempsey |title =In Pursuit of 'Kicks'| work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 8 September 1957 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/07/home/kerouac-roadbr.html}}</ref>\n\nOther reviewers were also less than impressed. Phoebe Lou Adams in ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' wrote that it \"disappoints because it constantly promises a revelation or a conclusion of real importance and general applicability, and cannot deliver any such conclusion because Dean is more convincing as an eccentric than as a representative of any segment of humanity.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic\">Atlantic Monthly, October 1957.</ref>  While she liked the writing and found a good theme, her concern was repetition.  \"Everything Mr. Kerouac has to say about Dean has been told in the first third of the book, and what comes later is a series of variations on the same theme.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic\"/>\n\nThe review from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' exhibited a similar sentiment.  \"The post-World War II generation\u2014beat or beatific\u2014has not found symbolic spokesmen with anywhere near the talents of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], or [[Nathanael West]].  In this novel, talented Author Kerouac, 35, does not join that literary league, either, but at least suggests that his generation is not silent.  With his barbaric yawp of a book, Kerouac commands attention as a kind of literary [[James Dean]].\"<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite news|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=September 16, 1957|title=Books: The Ganser Syndrome|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809932,00.html}}</ref> It considers the book partly a travel book and partly a collection of journal jottings.  While Kerouac sees his characters as \"mad to live ... desirous of everything at the same time,\" the reviewer likens them to cases of \"psychosis that is a variety of [[Ganser Syndrome]]\" who \"aren't really mad\u2014they only seem to be.\"<ref name=\"Time\"/>\n\n===Critical study===\n[[Thomas Pynchon]] describes ''On The Road'' as \"one of the great American novels\".<ref name=\"Pynchon2012\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Pynchon|title=Slow Learner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTlDf5j2en0C|date=13 June 2012|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-59461-2|page=3}}</ref>\n\n''On the Road'' has been the object of critical study since its publication.  [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compiled several opinions and summarized them in an Op-Ed from October 2, 2007. Whereas Millstein saw it as a story in which the heroes took pleasure in everything, George Mouratidis, an editor of a new edition, claimed \"above all else, the story is about loss.\"  \"It's a book about death and the search for something meaningful to hold on to\u2014the famous search for 'IT,' a truth larger than the self, which, of course, is never found,\" wrote Meghan O'Rourke in Slate.  \"Kerouac was this deep, lonely, melancholy man,\" Hilary Holladay of the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] told ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. \"And if you read the book closely, you see that sense of loss and sorrow swelling on every page.\"  \"In truth, 'On the Road' is a book of broken dreams and failed plans,\" wrote Ted Gioia in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''.<ref name=\"Brooks\">{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=David|title=Sal Paradise at 50|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/opinion/02brooks.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 April 2012|date=October 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]], author of ''Why Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of On the Road (They're Not What You Think),'' says \"We're no longer shocked by the sex and drugs. The slang is pass\u00e9 and at times corny. Some of the racial sentimentality is appalling\" but adds \"the tale of passionate friendship and the search for revelation are timeless. These are as elusive and precious in our time as in Sal's, and will be when our grandchildren celebrate the book's hundredth anniversary.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0670063258|title=Amazon.com: Why Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of On the Road (They're Not What You Think) - Questions for John Leland |work=amazon.com}}</ref>\n\nTo Brooks, this characterization seems limited.  \"Reading through the anniversary commemorations, you feel the gravitational pull of the great Boomer Narcissus.  All cultural artifacts have to be interpreted through whatever experiences the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boomer generation]] is going through at that moment.  So a book formerly known for its youthful exuberance now becomes a gloomy middle-aged disillusion.\"<ref name=\"Brooks\"/>  He laments how the book's spirit seems to have been tamed by the professionalism of America today and how it has only survived in parts.  The more reckless and youthful parts of the text that gave it its energy are the parts that have \"run afoul of the new gentility, the rules laid down by the health experts, childcare experts, guidance counselors, safety advisers, admissions officers, virtuecrats and employers to regulate the lives of the young.\"<ref name=\"Brooks\"/>  He claims that the \"ethos\" of the book has been lost.\n\nMary Pannicia Carden feels that traveling was a way for the characters to assert their independence: they \"attempt to replace the model of manhood dominant in capitalist America with a model rooted in foundational American ideals of conquest and self-discovery.\"<ref name=\"Carden\">{{cite journal|last=Carden|first=Mary Pannicia|title='Adventures in Auto-Eroticism': Economies of Traveling Masculinity in On the Road and The First Third|journal=What's Your Road, Man?|year=2009|pages=169\u2013185|editor1-last=Hilary Holladay and Robert Holton|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale, IL}}</ref> \"Reassigning disempowering elements of patriarchy to female keeping, they attempt to substitute male brotherhood for the nuclear family and to replace the ladder of success with the freedom of the road as primary measures of male identity.\"<ref name=\"Carden\"/>\n\nKerouac's writing style has attracted the attention of critics. ''On the Road'' has been considered by Tim Hunt to be a transitional phase between the traditional narrative structure of ''The Town and the City'' (1951) and the \"wild form\" of his later books like ''Visions of Cody'' (1972).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tim Hunt|title=Typetalking: Voice and Performance in On the Road|journal=What's Your Road, Man?|year=2009|pages=169\u2013185|editor1-last=Hilary Holladay and Robert Holton|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale, IL}}</ref> Kerouac's own explanation of his style in \"Essentials of Spontaneous Prose\" (1953) is that his writing is like the Impressionist painters who sought to create art through direct observation. Matt Theado feels he endeavored to present a raw version of truth which did not lend itself to the traditional process of revision and rewriting but rather the emotionally charged practice of the spontaneity he pursued.<ref name=\"Theado\">{{cite book|author=Matt Theado|title=Understanding Jack Kerouac|year=2000|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC}}</ref> Theado argues that the personal nature of the text helps foster a direct link between Kerouac and the reader; that his casual diction and very relaxed syntax was an intentional attempt to depict events as they happened and to convey all of the energy and emotion of the experiences.<ref name=\"Theado\"/>\n\n==Music in ''On the Road''==\nMusic is an important part of the scene that Kerouac sets in ''On the Road''.  Early in the book (Pt. 1, Ch. 3), he establishes the time period with references to the musical world:  \"At this time, 1947, bop was going like mad all over America. The fellows at the Loop blew, but with a tired air, because bop was somewhere between its [[Charlie Parker]] Ornithology period and another period that began with [[Miles Davis]]. And as I sat there listening to that sound of the night which bop has come to represent for all of us, I thought of all my friends from one end of the country to the other and how they were really all in the same vast backyard doing something so frantic and rushing-about.\"\n\nMain characters Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty are clearly enthusiastic fans of the jazz/bebop and early rhythm-and-blues musicians and records that were in the musical mix during the years when story took place, 1947-50.  Sal, Dean, and their friends are repeatedly depicted listening to specific records and going to clubs to hear their musical favorites.\n\nFor example, in one of two separate passages where they go to clubs to hear British jazz pianist [[George Shearing]], the effect of the music is described as almost overwhelming for Dean (Pt. 2, Ch. 4): \"Shearing began to play his chords; they rolled out of the piano in great rich showers, you'd think the man wouldn't have time to line them up. They rolled and rolled like the sea. Folks yelled for him to 'Go!' Dean was sweating; the sweat poured down his collar. 'There he is! That's him! Old God! Old God Shearing! Yes! Yes! Yes!' And Shearing was conscious of the madman behind him, he could hear every one of Dean's gasps and imprecations, he could sense it though he couldn't see. 'That's right!' Dean said. 'Yes!' Shearing smiled; he rocked. Shearing rose from the piano, dripping with sweat; these were his great 1949 days before he became cool and commercial. When he was gone Dean pointed to the empty piano seat. 'God's empty chair,' he said.\"\n\nKerouac mentions many other musical artists and their records throughout ''On the Road'':   [[Charlie Parker]] \u2013 \"Ornithology\" (Pt. 1, Ch. 3; also Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Lionel Hampton]] \u2013 \"Central Avenue Breakdown\" (Pt. 1, Ch. 13; also Pt. 4, Ch. 4); [[Billie Holiday]] \u2013 \"Lover Man\" (Pt.1, Ch. 13; also Pt. 3, Ch. 4); [[Dexter Gordon]] and [[Wardell Gray]] \u2013 \"The Hunt\" (Pt. 2, Ch. 1; Pt. 2, Ch. 4); [[Dizzy Gillespie]] \u2013 \"Congo Blues\" (Pt. 3, Ch. 7 \u2013 recorded under [[Red Norvo]]'s name and also featuring Charlie Parker; also Pt. 3, Ch. 10; Pt. 4, Ch. 3); [[Willis Jackson (saxophonist)|Willis Jackson]] \u2013 \"Gator Tail\" (Pt. 4, Ch. 1 \u2013 recorded with the [[Cootie Williams]] Orchestra); [[Wynonie Harris]] \u2013 \"I Like My Baby's Pudding\" (Pt. 4, Ch. 4); and [[Perez Prado]] -- \"More Mambo Jambo,\" \"Chattanooga de Mambo,\" \"Mambo Numero Ocho\" (\"Mambo No. 8\") (Pt. 4, Ch. 5).\n\nKerouac also notes several other musical artists without mentioning specific records:  [[Miles Davis]] (Pt. 1, Ch. 3; Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[George Shearing]] and his drummer [[Denzil Best]] (Pt. 2, Ch. 4; Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Slim Gaillard]] (Pt. 2, Ch. 11);  [[Lester Young]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10; Pt. 4, Ch. 1); [[Louis Armstrong]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Roy Eldridge]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Count Basie]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Bennie Moten]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Hot Lips Page]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Thelonious Monk]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Anita O'Day]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10);  [[Stan Getz]] (Pt. 4, Ch. 1); [[Lucky Millinder]] (Pt. 4, Ch. 4); and [[Duke Ellington]] (Pt. 5).\n\nJazz and other types of music are also featured more generally as a backdrop, with the characters often listening to music in clubs or on the radio.  For example, while driving across the upper Midwest toward New York City, Sal mentions that he and Dean are listening to the radio show of well-known jazz deejay [[Symphony Sid]] Torin (Pt. 3, Ch. 11).\n\nKerouac even delves into the classical music genre briefly, having Sal attend a performance of [[Beethoven]]'s sole opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805), in [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]], Colorado, as performed by \"stars of the Metropolitan\" who are visiting the area for the summer (Pt. 1, Ch. 9).\n\n==Influence==\n\n''On the Road'' has been an influence on various poets, writers, actors and musicians, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Hunter S. Thompson]].\n\nFrom journalist [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]], in a 2007 article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'':\n\n{{quote|'It changed my life like it changed everyone else's,' Dylan would say many years later. [[Tom Waits]], too, acknowledged its influence, hymning Jack and Neal in a song and calling the Beats \"father figures.\" At least two great American photographers were influenced by Kerouac: [[Robert Frank]], who became his close friend\u2014Kerouac wrote the introduction to Frank's book, [[The Americans (photography)|''The Americans'']]\u2014and [[Stephen Shore]], who set out on an American road trip in the 1970s with Kerouac's book as a guide. It would be hard to imagine Hunter S. Thompson's road novel ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' had ''On the Road'' not laid down the template; likewise, films such as ''[[Easy Rider]],'' [[Paris, Texas (film)|''Paris, Texas,'']] and even ''[[Thelma and Louise]]''.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/05/fiction.jackkerouac| first = Sean| last= O'Hagan|title = America's first king of the road| publisher = The Guardian | location=London | date=August 5, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nIn his book ''Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors,'' [[Ray Manzarek]] (keyboard player of [[The Doors]]) wrote \"I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written ''On the Road'', The Doors would never have existed.\"\n\n''On the Road'' influenced an entire generation of musicians, poets, and writers including Allen Ginsberg. Because of Ginsberg's friendship with Kerouac, Ginsberg was written into the novel through the character Carlo Marx. Ginsberg recalled that he was attracted to the beat generation, and Kerouac, because the beats valued \"detachment from the existing society,\" while at the same time calling for an immediate release from a culture in which the most \"freely\" accessible items\u2014bodies and ideas\u2014seemed restricted (1). Ginsberg incorporated a sense of freedom of prose and style into his poetry as a result of the influence of Kerouac (1).<ref>Johnston, Allan. \"Consumption, Addiction, Vision, Energy: Political Economies and Utopian Visions in the Writings of the Beat Generation.\" ''College Literature'' 32.2 (Spring 2005): 103-126.

In the November 16, 1952 ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Sunday Magazine]]'', he wrote a piece exposing the faces of the Beat Generation. \"[O]ne day [Kerouac] said, 'You know, this is a really beat generation' ... More than mere weariness, it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw.  It involves a sort of nakedness of mind, and ultimately, of soul:  a feeling of being reduced to the bedrock of consciousness.  In short, it means being undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself.\"<ref name=\"Holmes\">{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=John Clellon|title=This is the Beat Generation|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Magazine|date=November 19, 1952}}</ref>  He distinguishes Beats from the [[Lost Generation]] of the 1920s pointing out how the Beats are not lost but how they are searching for answers to all of life's questions. Kerouac's preoccupation with writers like [[Ernest Hemingway]] shaped his view of the beat generation. He uses a prose style which he adapted from Hemingway and throughout ''On the Road'' he alludes to novels like ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''. \"How to live seems much more crucial than why.\"<ref name=\"Holmes\"/>  In many ways, it is a spiritual journey, a quest to find belief, belonging, and meaning in life.  Not content with the uniformity promoted by government and consumer culture, the Beats yearned for a deeper, more sensational experience. Holmes expands his attempt to define the generation in a 1958 article in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. This article was able to take more of a look back at the formation of the movement as it was published after ''On the Road''.  \"It describes the state of mind from which all unessentials have been stripped, leaving it receptive to everything around it, but impatient with trivial obstructions.

It is considered a defining work of the postwar [[Beat Generation|Beat]] and [[Counterculture of the 1960s|Counterculture]] generations, with its protagonists living life against a backdrop of jazz, poetry, and drug use. The novel is a [[roman \u00e0 clef]], with many key figures of the Beat movement, such as [[William S. Burroughs]] (Old Bull Lee), [[Allen Ginsberg]] (Carlo Marx), and [[Neal Cassady]] (Dean Moriarty) represented by characters in the book, including Kerouac himself as the narrator Sal Paradise.\n\nThe idea for ''On the Road'', Kerouac's second novel, was formed during the late 1940s in a series of notebooks, and then typed out on a continuous reel of paper during three weeks in April 1951. It was published by [[Viking Press]] in 1957.\n\n''[[The New York Times]]'' hailed the book's appearance as \"the most beautifully executed, the clearest and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac himself named years ago as 'beat,' and whose principal avatar he is.\"<ref name=\"millstein\"/> In 1998, the [[Modern Library]] ranked ''On the Road'' 55th on its list of the [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|100 best English-language novels of the 20th century]].

He met and mixed with [[Beat Generation]] figures [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]], and [[Neal Cassady]]. Between 1947 and 1950, while writing what would become ''[[The Town and the City]]'' (1950), Kerouac engaged in the road adventures that would form ''On the Road''.<ref name=\"Charters\">{{cite book|author=Ann Charters|title=Introduction to On the Road|year=2003|publisher=Penguin Classics|location=New York}}</ref> Kerouac carried small notebooks, in which much of the text was written as the eventful span of road trips unfurled.

The novel contains five parts, three of them describing road trips with Moriarty. The narrative takes place in the years 1947 to 1950, is full of [[Americana]], and marks a specific era in [[Jazz#1940s and 1950s|jazz history]], \"somewhere between its [[Charlie Parker]] ''[[Ornithology (composition)|Ornithology]]'' period and another period that began with [[Miles Davis]].\"  The novel is largely autobiographical, Sal being the alter ego of the author and Dean standing for [[Neal Cassady]].\n\n===Part One===\nThe first section describes Sal's first trip to [[San Francisco]].  Disheartened after a divorce, his life changes when he meets Dean Moriarty, who is \"tremendously excited with life,\" and begins to long for the freedom of the road: \"Somewhere along the line I knew there would be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me.\"  He sets off in July 1947 with fifty dollars in his pocket. After taking several buses and hitchhiking, he arrives in Denver, where he hooks up with Carlo Marx, Dean, and their friends. There are parties\u2014among them an excursion to the ghost town of Central City. Eventually Sal leaves by bus and gets to San Francisco, where he meets Remi Boncoeur and his girlfriend Lee Ann. Remi arranges for Sal to take a job as a [[security guard|night watchman]] at a boarding camp for [[Merchant Marines|merchant sailors]] waiting for their ship. Not holding this job for long, Sal hits the road again. \"Oh, where is the girl I love?\" he wonders. Soon he meets Terry, the \"cutest little Mexican girl,\" on the bus to Los Angeles. They stay together, traveling back to [[Bakersfield]], then to Sabinal, \"her hometown,\" where her family works in the fields. He meets Terry's brother Ricky, who teaches him the true meaning of \"ma\u00f1ana\" (\"tomorrow\"). Working in the cotton fields, Sal realizes that he is not made for this type of work. Leaving Terry behind, he takes the bus back to [[Times Square]] in [[New York City]], bums a quarter off a preacher who looks the other way, and arrives at his aunt's house in Paterson, just missing Dean, who had come to see him, by two days.\n\n===Part Two===\nIn December 1948 Sal is celebrating Christmas with his relatives in Testament, Virginia, when Dean shows up with Marylou (having left his second wife, Camille, and their newborn baby, Amy, in San Francisco) and Ed Dunkel. Sal's Christmas plans are shattered as \"now the bug was on me again, and the bug's name was Dean Moriarty.\" First they drive to New York, where they meet Carlo and party. Dean wants Sal to make love to Marylou, but Sal declines. In Dean's Hudson they take off from New York in January 1949 and make it to New Orleans. In Algiers they stay with the morphine-addicted Old Bull Lee and his wife Jane. Galatea Dunkel joins her husband in New Orleans while Sal, Dean, and Marylou continue their trip. Once in San Francisco, Dean again leaves Marylou to be with Camille. \"Dean will leave you out in the cold anytime it is in the interest of him,\" Marylou tells Sal. Both of them stay briefly in a hotel, but soon she moves out, following a nightclub owner. Sal is alone and on Market Street has visions of past lives, birth, and rebirth. Dean finds him and invites him to stay with his family. Together, they visit nightclubs and listen to [[Slim Gaillard]] and other jazz musicians. The stay ends on a sour note: \"what I accomplished by coming to Frisco I don't know,\" and Sal departs, taking the bus back to New York.\n\n===Part Three===\nIn the spring of 1949, Sal takes a bus from New York to [[Denver]]. He is depressed and lonesome; none of his friends are around. After receiving some money, he leaves Denver for San Francisco to see Dean. Camille is pregnant and unhappy, and Dean has injured his thumb trying to hit Marylou for sleeping with other men. Camille throws them out, and Sal invites Dean to come to New York, planning to travel further to Italy. They meet Galatea, who tells Dean off: \"You have absolutely no regard for anybody but yourself and your kicks.\" Sal realizes she is right\u2014Dean is the \"HOLY GOOF\"\u2014but also defends him, as \"he's got the secret that we're all busting to find out.\"  After a night of jazz and drinking in Little Harlem on [[Folsom Street]], they depart. On the way to Sacramento they meet a \"fag\", who propositions them. Dean tries to hustle some money out of this but is turned down. During this part of the trip Sal and Dean have ecstatic discussions having found \"IT\" and \"TIME\". In Denver a brief argument shows the growing rift between the two, when Dean reminds Sal of his age, Sal being the older of the two. They get a 1947 [[Cadillac]] that needs to be taken to [[Chicago]] from a [[travel bureau]]. Dean drives most of the way, crazy, careless, often speeding at over {{convert|100|mph|km/h|spell=in}}, delivering the car in a disheveled state. By bus they move on to [[Detroit]] and spend a night on [[Skid Row]], Dean hoping to find his homeless father. From Detroit they share a ride to New York and arrive at Sal's aunt's new flat in [[Long Island]]. They go on partying in New York, where Dean meets Inez and gets her pregnant while his wife is expecting their second child.\n\n===Part Four===\nIn the spring of 1950, Sal gets the itch to travel again while Dean is working as a parking lot attendant in Manhattan, living with his girlfriend Inez. Sal notices that he has been reduced to simple pleasures\u2014listening to basketball games and looking at erotic playing cards. By bus Sal takes to the road again, passing [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Ashland, Ohio|Ashland]], [[Cincinnati]], and [[St. Louis]], and eventually reaching Denver. There he meets Stan Shephard, and the two plan to go to [[Mexico City]] when they learn that Dean has bought a car and is on the way to join them. In a rickety '37 [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] sedan the three set off across [[Texas]] to [[Laredo, TX|Laredo]], where they cross the border. They are ecstatic, having left \"everything behind us and entering a new and unknown phase of things.\"  Their money buys more (10 cents for a beer), police are laid back, [[cannabis]] is readily available, and people are curious and friendly. The landscape is magnificent. In Gregoria, they meet Victor, a local kid, who leads them to a bordello where they have their last grand party, dancing to mambo, drinking, and having fun with prostitutes. In Mexico City Sal becomes ill from [[dysentery]] and is \"delirious and unconscious.\" Dean leaves him, and Sal later reflects that \"when I got better I realized what a rat he was, but then I had to understand the impossible complexity of his life, how he had to leave me there, sick, to get on with his wives and woes.\"\n\n===Part Five===\nDean, having obtained divorce papers in Mexico, had first returned to New York to marry Inez, only to leave her and go back to Camille. After his recovery from dysentery in Mexico, Sal returns to New York in the fall. He finds a girl, Laura, and plans to move with her to San Francisco. Sal writes to Dean about his plan to move to San Francisco. Dean writes back saying that he's willing to come and accompany Laura and Sal. Dean arrives over five weeks early, but Sal is out taking a late-night walk alone. Sal returns home, sees a copy of [[Proust]], and knows it is Dean's. Sal realizes his friend has arrived, but at a time when Sal doesn't have the money to relocate to San Francisco. On hearing this Dean makes the decision to head back to Camille. Sal's friend Remi Boncoeur denies Sal's request to give Dean a short lift to 40th Street on their way to a [[Duke Ellington]] concert at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (39th Street)|Metropolitan Opera House]]. Sal's girlfriend Laura realizes this is a painful moment for Sal and prompts him for a response as the party drives off without Dean. Sal replies: \"He'll be alright\". Sal later reflects as he sits on a river pier under a New Jersey night sky about the roads and lands of America that he has travelled and states: \"... I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of Old Dean Moriarty the father we never found, I think of Dean Moriarty.\"\n\n===Characters===\n\nKerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.<ref name=\"Sandison\">Sandison, David.

Some of the earlier reviews spoke highly of the book, but the backlash to these was swift and strong.  Although this was discouraging to Kerouac, he still received great recognition and notoriety from the work.  Since its publication, critical attention has focused on issues of both the context and the style, addressing the actions of the characters as well as the nature of Kerouac's prose.\n\n===Initial reaction===\nIn his review for ''[[The New York Times]],'' Gilbert Millstein wrote, \"its publication is a historic occasion in so far as the exposure of an authentic work of art is of any great moment in an age in which the attention is fragmented and the sensibilities are blunted by the superlatives of fashion\" and praised it as \"a major novel.\"<ref name=\"millstein\">{{cite news | author =Gilbert Millstein | title =  Books of the Times | work = [[The New York Times]] | date =5 September 1957| url = http://graphics.nytimes.com/packages/html/books/kerouac-millstein.pdf }}</ref> Millstein was already sympathetic toward the Beat Generation and his promotion of the book in the Times did wonders for its recognition and acclaim.  Not only did he like the themes, but also the style, which would come to be just as hotly contested in the reviews that followed.  \"There are sections of ''On the Road'' in which the writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking ... there is some writing on jazz that has never been equaled in American fiction, either for insight, style, or technical virtuosity.\"<ref name=\"millstein\"/> Kerouac and [[Joyce Johnson]], a younger writer he was living with, read the review shortly after midnight at a [[newsstand]] at [[69th Street (Manhattan)|69th Street]] and [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], near Joyce's apartment in the [[Upper West Side]]. They took their copy of the newspaper to a neighborhood bar and read the review over and over. \"Jack kept shaking his head,\" Joyce remembered later in her memoir ''[[Minor Characters]]'', \"as if he couldn't figure out why he wasn't happier than he was.\" Finally, they returned to her apartment to go to sleep. As Joyce recalled: \"Jack lay down obscure for the last time in his life. The ringing phone woke him the next morning, and he was famous.\"<ref>[[Ann Charters]]' introduction to the 1991 edition of ''On the Road''</ref>\n\nThe backlash began just a few days later in the same publication. [[David Dempsey (writer)|David Dempsey]] published a review that contradicted most of what Millstein had promoted in the book.  \"As a portrait of a disjointed segment of society acting out of its own neurotic necessity, ''On the Road'', is a stunning achievement.  But it is a road, as far as the characters are concerned, that leads to nowhere.\"  While he did not discount the stylistic nature of the text (saying that it was written \"with great relish\"), he dismissed the content as a \"passionate lark\" rather than a novel.\"<ref name=\"dempsey\">{{cite news |author =David Dempsey |title =In Pursuit of 'Kicks'| work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 8 September 1957 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/09/07/home/kerouac-roadbr.html}}</ref>\n\nOther reviewers were also less than impressed. Phoebe Lou Adams in ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' wrote that it \"disappoints because it constantly promises a revelation or a conclusion of real importance and general applicability, and cannot deliver any such conclusion because Dean is more convincing as an eccentric than as a representative of any segment of humanity.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic\">Atlantic Monthly, October 1957.</ref>  While she liked the writing and found a good theme, her concern was repetition.  \"Everything Mr. Kerouac has to say about Dean has been told in the first third of the book, and what comes later is a series of variations on the same theme.\"<ref name=\"Atlantic\"/>\n\nThe review from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' exhibited a similar sentiment.  \"The post-World War II generation\u2014beat or beatific\u2014has not found symbolic spokesmen with anywhere near the talents of [[F. Scott Fitzgerald|Fitzgerald]], [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], or [[Nathanael West]].  In this novel, talented Author Kerouac, 35, does not join that literary league, either, but at least suggests that his generation is not silent.  With his barbaric yawp of a book, Kerouac commands attention as a kind of literary [[James Dean]].\"<ref name=\"Time\">{{cite news|newspaper=Time Magazine|date=September 16, 1957|title=Books: The Ganser Syndrome|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,809932,00.html}}</ref> It considers the book partly a travel book and partly a collection of journal jottings.  While Kerouac sees his characters as \"mad to live ... desirous of everything at the same time,\" the reviewer likens them to cases of \"psychosis that is a variety of [[Ganser Syndrome]]\" who \"aren't really mad\u2014they only seem to be.\"<ref name=\"Time\"/>\n\n===Critical study===\n[[Thomas Pynchon]] describes ''On The Road'' as \"one of the great American novels\".<ref name=\"Pynchon2012\">{{cite book|author=Thomas Pynchon|title=Slow Learner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTlDf5j2en0C|date=13 June 2012|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-101-59461-2|page=3}}</ref>\n\n''On the Road'' has been the object of critical study since its publication.  [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' compiled several opinions and summarized them in an Op-Ed from October 2, 2007. Whereas Millstein saw it as a story in which the heroes took pleasure in everything, George Mouratidis, an editor of a new edition, claimed \"above all else, the story is about loss.\"  \"It's a book about death and the search for something meaningful to hold on to\u2014the famous search for 'IT,' a truth larger than the self, which, of course, is never found,\" wrote Meghan O'Rourke in Slate.  \"Kerouac was this deep, lonely, melancholy man,\" Hilary Holladay of the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] told ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''. \"And if you read the book closely, you see that sense of loss and sorrow swelling on every page.\"  \"In truth, 'On the Road' is a book of broken dreams and failed plans,\" wrote Ted Gioia in ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''.<ref name=\"Brooks\">{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=David|title=Sal Paradise at 50|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/opinion/02brooks.html|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=16 April 2012|date=October 2, 2007}}</ref>\n\n[[John Leland (journalist)|John Leland]], author of ''Why Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of On the Road (They're Not What You Think),'' says \"We're no longer shocked by the sex and drugs. The slang is pass\u00e9 and at times corny. Some of the racial sentimentality is appalling\" but adds \"the tale of passionate friendship and the search for revelation are timeless. These are as elusive and precious in our time as in Sal's, and will be when our grandchildren celebrate the book's hundredth anniversary.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0670063258|title=Amazon.com: Why Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of On the Road (They're Not What You Think) - Questions for John Leland |work=amazon.com}}</ref>\n\nTo Brooks, this characterization seems limited.  \"Reading through the anniversary commemorations, you feel the gravitational pull of the great Boomer Narcissus.  All cultural artifacts have to be interpreted through whatever experiences the [[Baby boomer|Baby Boomer generation]] is going through at that moment.  So a book formerly known for its youthful exuberance now becomes a gloomy middle-aged disillusion.\"<ref name=\"Brooks\"/>  He laments how the book's spirit seems to have been tamed by the professionalism of America today and how it has only survived in parts.  The more reckless and youthful parts of the text that gave it its energy are the parts that have \"run afoul of the new gentility, the rules laid down by the health experts, childcare experts, guidance counselors, safety advisers, admissions officers, virtuecrats and employers to regulate the lives of the young.\"<ref name=\"Brooks\"/>  He claims that the \"ethos\" of the book has been lost.\n\nMary Pannicia Carden feels that traveling was a way for the characters to assert their independence: they \"attempt to replace the model of manhood dominant in capitalist America with a model rooted in foundational American ideals of conquest and self-discovery.\"<ref name=\"Carden\">{{cite journal|last=Carden|first=Mary Pannicia|title='Adventures in Auto-Eroticism': Economies of Traveling Masculinity in On the Road and The First Third|journal=What's Your Road, Man?|year=2009|pages=169\u2013185|editor1-last=Hilary Holladay and Robert Holton|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale, IL}}</ref> \"Reassigning disempowering elements of patriarchy to female keeping, they attempt to substitute male brotherhood for the nuclear family and to replace the ladder of success with the freedom of the road as primary measures of male identity.\"<ref name=\"Carden\"/>\n\nKerouac's writing style has attracted the attention of critics. ''On the Road'' has been considered by Tim Hunt to be a transitional phase between the traditional narrative structure of ''The Town and the City'' (1951) and the \"wild form\" of his later books like ''Visions of Cody'' (1972).<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tim Hunt|title=Typetalking: Voice and Performance in On the Road|journal=What's Your Road, Man?|year=2009|pages=169\u2013185|editor1-last=Hilary Holladay and Robert Holton|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale, IL}}</ref> Kerouac's own explanation of his style in \"Essentials of Spontaneous Prose\" (1953) is that his writing is like the Impressionist painters who sought to create art through direct observation. Matt Theado feels he endeavored to present a raw version of truth which did not lend itself to the traditional process of revision and rewriting but rather the emotionally charged practice of the spontaneity he pursued.<ref name=\"Theado\">{{cite book|author=Matt Theado|title=Understanding Jack Kerouac|year=2000|publisher=University of South Carolina Press|location=Columbia, SC}}</ref> Theado argues that the personal nature of the text helps foster a direct link between Kerouac and the reader; that his casual diction and very relaxed syntax was an intentional attempt to depict events as they happened and to convey all of the energy and emotion of the experiences.<ref name=\"Theado\"/>\n\n==Music in ''On the Road''==\nMusic is an important part of the scene that Kerouac sets in ''On the Road''.  Early in the book (Pt. 1, Ch. 3), he establishes the time period with references to the musical world:  \"At this time, 1947, bop was going like mad all over America. The fellows at the Loop blew, but with a tired air, because bop was somewhere between its [[Charlie Parker]] Ornithology period and another period that began with [[Miles Davis]]. And as I sat there listening to that sound of the night which bop has come to represent for all of us, I thought of all my friends from one end of the country to the other and how they were really all in the same vast backyard doing something so frantic and rushing-about.\"\n\nMain characters Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty are clearly enthusiastic fans of the jazz/bebop and early rhythm-and-blues musicians and records that were in the musical mix during the years when story took place, 1947-50.  Sal, Dean, and their friends are repeatedly depicted listening to specific records and going to clubs to hear their musical favorites.\n\nFor example, in one of two separate passages where they go to clubs to hear British jazz pianist [[George Shearing]], the effect of the music is described as almost overwhelming for Dean (Pt. 2, Ch. 4): \"Shearing began to play his chords; they rolled out of the piano in great rich showers, you'd think the man wouldn't have time to line them up. They rolled and rolled like the sea. Folks yelled for him to 'Go!' Dean was sweating; the sweat poured down his collar. 'There he is! That's him! Old God! Old God Shearing! Yes! Yes! Yes!' And Shearing was conscious of the madman behind him, he could hear every one of Dean's gasps and imprecations, he could sense it though he couldn't see. 'That's right!' Dean said. 'Yes!' Shearing smiled; he rocked. Shearing rose from the piano, dripping with sweat; these were his great 1949 days before he became cool and commercial. When he was gone Dean pointed to the empty piano seat. 'God's empty chair,' he said.\"\n\nKerouac mentions many other musical artists and their records throughout ''On the Road'':   [[Charlie Parker]] \u2013 \"Ornithology\" (Pt. 1, Ch. 3; also Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Lionel Hampton]] \u2013 \"Central Avenue Breakdown\" (Pt. 1, Ch. 13; also Pt. 4, Ch. 4); [[Billie Holiday]] \u2013 \"Lover Man\" (Pt.1, Ch. 13; also Pt. 3, Ch. 4); [[Dexter Gordon]] and [[Wardell Gray]] \u2013 \"The Hunt\" (Pt. 2, Ch. 1; Pt. 2, Ch. 4); [[Dizzy Gillespie]] \u2013 \"Congo Blues\" (Pt. 3, Ch. 7 \u2013 recorded under [[Red Norvo]]'s name and also featuring Charlie Parker; also Pt. 3, Ch. 10; Pt. 4, Ch. 3); [[Willis Jackson (saxophonist)|Willis Jackson]] \u2013 \"Gator Tail\" (Pt. 4, Ch. 1 \u2013 recorded with the [[Cootie Williams]] Orchestra); [[Wynonie Harris]] \u2013 \"I Like My Baby's Pudding\" (Pt. 4, Ch. 4); and [[Perez Prado]] -- \"More Mambo Jambo,\" \"Chattanooga de Mambo,\" \"Mambo Numero Ocho\" (\"Mambo No. 8\") (Pt. 4, Ch. 5).\n\nKerouac also notes several other musical artists without mentioning specific records:  [[Miles Davis]] (Pt. 1, Ch. 3; Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[George Shearing]] and his drummer [[Denzil Best]] (Pt. 2, Ch. 4; Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Slim Gaillard]] (Pt. 2, Ch. 11);  [[Lester Young]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10; Pt. 4, Ch. 1); [[Louis Armstrong]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Roy Eldridge]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Count Basie]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Bennie Moten]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Hot Lips Page]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Thelonious Monk]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); [[Anita O'Day]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 10);  [[Stan Getz]] (Pt. 4, Ch. 1); [[Lucky Millinder]] (Pt. 4, Ch. 4); and [[Duke Ellington]] (Pt. 5).\n\nJazz and other types of music are also featured more generally as a backdrop, with the characters often listening to music in clubs or on the radio.  For example, while driving across the upper Midwest toward New York City, Sal mentions that he and Dean are listening to the radio show of well-known jazz deejay [[Symphony Sid]] Torin (Pt. 3, Ch. 11).\n\nKerouac even delves into the classical music genre briefly, having Sal attend a performance of [[Beethoven]]'s sole opera, ''[[Fidelio]]'' (1805), in [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]], Colorado, as performed by \"stars of the Metropolitan\" who are visiting the area for the summer (Pt. 1, Ch. 9).\n\n==Influence==\n\n''On the Road'' has been an influence on various poets, writers, actors and musicians, including [[Bob Dylan]], [[Van Morrison]], [[Noel Gallagher]], [[Jim Morrison]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[David Bowie]] and [[Hunter S. Thompson]].\n\nFrom journalist [[Sean O'Hagan (journalist)|Sean O'Hagan]], in a 2007 article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'':\n\n{{quote|'It changed my life like it changed everyone else's,' Dylan would say many years later. [[Tom Waits]], too, acknowledged its influence, hymning Jack and Neal in a song and calling the Beats \"father figures.\" At least two great American photographers were influenced by Kerouac: [[Robert Frank]], who became his close friend\u2014Kerouac wrote the introduction to Frank's book, [[The Americans (photography)|''The Americans'']]\u2014and [[Stephen Shore]], who set out on an American road trip in the 1970s with Kerouac's book as a guide. It would be hard to imagine Hunter S. Thompson's road novel ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' had ''On the Road'' not laid down the template; likewise, films such as ''[[Easy Rider]],'' [[Paris, Texas (film)|''Paris, Texas,'']] and even ''[[Thelma and Louise]]''.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/aug/05/fiction.jackkerouac| first = Sean| last= O'Hagan|title = America's first king of the road| publisher = The Guardian | location=London | date=August 5, 2007 | accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>}}\n\nIn his book ''Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors,'' [[Ray Manzarek]] (keyboard player of [[The Doors]]) wrote \"I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written ''On the Road'', The Doors would never have existed.\"\n\n''On the Road'' influenced an entire generation of musicians, poets, and writers including Allen Ginsberg. Because of Ginsberg's friendship with Kerouac, Ginsberg was written into the novel through the character Carlo Marx. Ginsberg recalled that he was attracted to the beat generation, and Kerouac, because the beats valued \"detachment from the existing society,\" while at the same time calling for an immediate release from a culture in which the most \"freely\" accessible items\u2014bodies and ideas\u2014seemed restricted (1). Ginsberg incorporated a sense of freedom of prose and style into his poetry as a result of the influence of Kerouac (1).<ref>Johnston, Allan. \"Consumption, Addiction, Vision, Energy: Political Economies and Utopian Visions in the Writings of the Beat Generation.\" ''College Literature'' 32.2 (Spring 2005): 103-126.

In the November 16, 1952 ''[[The New York Times Magazine|New York Times Sunday Magazine]]'', he wrote a piece exposing the faces of the Beat Generation. \"[O]ne day [Kerouac] said, 'You know, this is a really beat generation' ... More than mere weariness, it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw.  It involves a sort of nakedness of mind, and ultimately, of soul:  a feeling of being reduced to the bedrock of consciousness.  In short, it means being undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself.\"<ref name=\"Holmes\">{{cite news|last=Holmes|first=John Clellon|title=This is the Beat Generation|newspaper=The New York Times Sunday Magazine|date=November 19, 1952}}</ref>  He distinguishes Beats from the [[Lost Generation]] of the 1920s pointing out how the Beats are not lost but how they are searching for answers to all of life's questions. Kerouac's preoccupation with writers like [[Ernest Hemingway]] shaped his view of the beat generation. He uses a prose style which he adapted from Hemingway and throughout ''On the Road'' he alludes to novels like ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''. \"How to live seems much more crucial than why.\"<ref name=\"Holmes\"/>  In many ways, it is a spiritual journey, a quest to find belief, belonging, and meaning in life.  Not content with the uniformity promoted by government and consumer culture, the Beats yearned for a deeper, more sensational experience. Holmes expands his attempt to define the generation in a 1958 article in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine. This article was able to take more of a look back at the formation of the movement as it was published after ''On the Road''.  \"It describes the state of mind from which all unessentials have been stripped, leaving it receptive to everything around it, but impatient with trivial obstructions.  To be beat is to be at the bottom of your personality, looking up.\"<ref name=\"Esquire\">{{cite journal|last=Holmes|first=John Clellon|title=The Philosophy of the Beat Generation|journal=Esquire|date=February 1958|pages=35\u201338}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Off the Road]]'' (1990 book by Carolyn Cassady)\n*''[[Love Always, Carolyn]]''\n*''[[Jack Kerouac Reads On the Road]]''\n*[[List of most expensive books and manuscripts]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Citation |first=Barry |last=Gifford |authorlink=Barry Gifford| first2=Lawrence |last2=Lee |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Jack's Book: An Oral Biography of Jack Kerouac |publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=1-56025-739-3 }}\n*Holladay, Hilary, and Robert Holton, eds.

Chuck left to attend [[seminary]] for a year but returned to the group by 1964. Tom Nardin had been brought in to replace Chuck on guitar, and Chuck decided to play bass guitar when he returned to the band. John Panozzo was the drummer, while DeYoung had switched from accordion to keyboards. In 1965, the Tradewinds name was changed to TW4 (There Were 4) <ref name=clark /> after another band, [[the Trade Winds]], achieved fame nationally. By 1966, the Panozzo brothers had joined DeYoung at [[Chicago State College]] and kept the group together by performing at high schools and fraternity parties while studying to be teachers. In 1969, they added a college friend guitarist, [[John Curulewski]], after Nardin departed.

These albums contained straight-ahead rockers mixed with prog rock flourish with a lot of guitars, drums, keyboards, percussion, and vocals solos. They established a fan base in the [[Chicago]] area, but were unable to break into the mainstream, though the song \"Best Thing\" from ''Styx'' charted on September 16, 1972, and stayed on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart for 6 weeks, peaking at No. 82.<ref name=clark /> Then, the [[power ballad]] \"[[Lady (Styx song)|Lady]]\" (from ''Styx II''), began to earn some radio time, first on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] in Chicago in 1974<ref>{{cite book |last=Childers |first=Scott |date=2008 |title=Chicago's WLS Radio (Images of America: Illinois) |location=Charleston, SC |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |page=87 |isbn=9780738561943}}</ref> and then nationwide. In the spring of 1975, nearly two years after the album had been released, \"Lady\" hit No.&nbsp;6 in the US, and ''Styx II'' went gold soon after. After the success of \"Lady\", \"Best Thing\" was re-released.\n\n==Commercial success (1975-1983)==\n===Breakthrough recognition (1975 to 1978)===\nOn the heels of its belated hit single, Styx signed with [[A&M Records]] and released ''[[Equinox (Styx album)|Equinox]]'' (1975), which sold well and yielded a minor hit in \"[[Lorelei (Styx song)|Lorelei]]\", which reached No. 27 in the U.S. More importantly, it contained the rock anthem \"[[Suite Madame Blue]]\", which gained the band considerable recognition and airplay on [[FM radio]] in the relatively new [[Album-oriented rock|Album Oriented Rock]] (AOR) format. Following the move to A&M, guitarist [[John Curulewski]] suddenly left the band as they were to embark on a nationwide tour in December 1975, due to his desire to spend time with his family. After a frantic last-minute search, the band brought in guitarist [[Tommy Shaw]] as Curulewski's replacement.<ref name=clark />\n\n''[[Crystal Ball (Styx album)|Crystal Ball]]'' (1976), the first album to feature Shaw, was moderately successful, but was overall a disappointment, failing to achieve the sales of its predecessor. The album showcased the band's newest member, as Shaw's \"[[Mademoiselle (song)|Mademoiselle]]\" was another minor hit, reaching No. 36, and the album's title track, also written and sung by Shaw  became another minor AOR hit.\n\nStyx's seventh album, ''[[The Grand Illusion (album)|The Grand Illusion]]'', was released on July 7, 1977, and became their breakthrough album, reaching [[gold album|Triple Platinum]] [[RIAA certification|certification]]. It spawned a top-ten hit and [[Album Oriented Rock|AOR]] radio staple in the [[Dennis DeYoung|DeYoung]]-written \"[[Come Sail Away]]\", which reached No. 8 in 1978. Shaw's \"[[Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)]]\" was a second radio hit and reached No. 29 the same year. The title track also received significant airplay.\n\nThrough the late 1970s and early 1980s, the band enjoyed its greatest success. Their 1978 album ''[[Pieces of Eight (album)|Pieces of Eight]]'' found the group moving in a more straight-ahead hard-rock direction and spawned three Shaw sung hit singles \"[[Renegade (Styx song)|Renegade]]\" (No. 16 in the US) and \"[[Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)]]\" (No. 21 in the US), plus a minor hit \"[[Sing for the Day]]\" that stopped just short of the Top Forty at No. 41.\n\n===Mainstream success (1979 to 1983)===\nTheir 1979 album ''[[Cornerstone (Styx album)|Cornerstone]]'' yielded their first No. 1 hit, the DeYoung ballad \"[[Babe (Styx song)|Babe]]\".

However, after DeYoung was fired for the first time, things were quickly smoothed over.<ref>VHI Behind the Music Remastered</ref> While \u201cFirst Time\u201d did not chart in the U.S., it became a huge hit single in the Philippines in 1981.\n\nIn January 1981, Styx released ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theatre]]'', a [[concept album]] that became their biggest hit, reaching No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' pop albums chart and yielding five singles, including the top ten hits \"[[The Best of Times (song)|The Best of Times]]\" by DeYoung (No. 3) and \"[[Too Much Time on My Hands]]\" by Shaw (No. 9), his only top 10 single as a member of the band. ''Paradise Theatre'' became the band's fourth consecutive [[multi-platinum]] album.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, the band would use the ''Paradise Theatre'' (1981) album's opening track, \"[[Rockin' the Paradise]]\" (charted at No.&nbsp;8 on Top Rock Tracks Chart) to open their shows.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kilroy2.jpg|thumb|right|Dennis DeYoung as \"Kilroy\" revealing his identity in the pre-concert film ''Kilroy Was Here''{{ffdc|1=Kilroy2.jpg|log=2009 August 24}}]] -->\n\nThe band was accused by a [[California]] religious group and later the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] of [[backmasking]] [[Satanism|Satanic]] messages in their anti-[[cocaine]] anthem, \"[[Snowblind (Styx song)|Snowblind]]\".<ref name=clark>{{cite news|last=Clark|first=Dick|title=Styx and stones...|newspaper=[[Times-News (Hendersonville, North Carolina)|Times-News]]|date=March 29, 1983}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theatre.wazzontv.com/2011/03/09/styx_snowblind_81_live/|title=wazzontv.com|date=January 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110022905/http://theatre.wazzontv.com/2011/03/09/styx_snowblind_81_live/|archive-date=January 10, 2016}}</ref> [[James Young (American musician)|James \"JY\" Young]] has denied this charge during his introduction for \"Snowblind\" when played live. [[Dennis DeYoung]] has denied the accusation as well, joking on the ''[[In the Studio with Redbeard]]'' program \"we had enough trouble to make the music sound right forward.\" Also, Young quotes, \"If we were going to put some message in our songs, we would have put it so it was in the song forward. Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it.\"\n\n===Breakup (1983-84)===\nThe band followed DeYoung's lead with their next project, [[Kilroy Was Here (album)|''Kilroy Was Here'']] (1983), another more fully realized concept album, embracing the [[rock opera]] form. It is set in a future where performing and playing rock music has been outlawed due to the efforts of a charismatic evangelist, Dr. Everett Righteous played by James \"JY\" Young. ''Kilroy Was Here'' featured DeYoung in the part of Kilroy, an unjustly imprisoned rock star. Tommy Shaw played the part of Jonathan Chance, a younger rocker who fights for Kilroy's freedom and the lifting of the ban on rock music. This future society is served by robots. Called Robotos, these automatons perform many jobs, and several serve as Kilroy's prison guards.\n\nPart of the impetus for the Kilroy story was the band's reaction to the backward masking accusation.<ref name=clark /> The album included Young's song \"[[Heavy Metal Poisoning]]\", which includes lyrics sarcastically mocking the allegations against the group. Its introduction intentionally included a backward message, the Latin phrases, \"annuit coeptis\" and \"novus ordo seclorum\", from the reverse side of the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Referring to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in 1776, these are translated, \"''[[Annuit c\u0153ptis]]'' - He (God) favors our undertakings, and ''[[Novus ordo seclorum]]'' - A new order of the ages.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/2233|title=The Great Seal of the United States on Paper Currency\n|publisher=US Bureau of Engraving and Printing |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829233635/http://www.moneyfactory.gov/document.cfm/18/2233 |archivedate=August 29, 2008 |accessdate=November 19, 2008}}</ref> Both choices also served the Kilroy story, because the villain is an evangelist that seeks to expand his Vision of Morality movement via mass demonstrations.\n\nThe album ''Kilroy Was Here'' went [[Platinum certification|Platinum]] in 1983, boasting two Top Ten hits written and sung by DeYoung, the [[synthesizer]]-based \"[[Mr. Roboto]]\" (No. 3 US) and power ballad \"[[Don't Let It End]]\" (No. 6 US). The album earned a nomination as Best Engineered Recording for engineer and long-time friend [[Gary Loizzo]] and fellow engineers on the album Will Rascati and Rob Kingsland, for the 26th Grammy Awards (1983).<ref>{{cite news|url= http://theenvelope.latimes.com/search/env-past-winners-search,0,1243372,results.formprofile?Query=Styx&selectsearch=pastwinners&target=article&Lib=turbine_cdb_lib%3Aresult_doc_id+result_doc_rank+document_id+cdb_num+cdb_01_txt+cdb_02_txt+cdb_03_txt+cdb_04_txt+cdb_01_num&SortBy=COMPOSITE_RANK+desc&PageSize=10&Page=1&MinCoarseRank=500&QueryType=CONCEPT&x=10&y=11.\n |title=Every show, every winner, every nominee - The Envelope - LA Times\n |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]\n |accessdate=March 28, 2010\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1983, the band mounted an ambitious stage show in support of ''Kilroy Was Here''<ref name=clark /> featuring theatrical presentations of three songs utilizing instrumental backing tracks, including \"Mr. Roboto\", which featured DeYoung singing live while disguised as a Roboto, \"Heavy Metal Poisoning\" with Young as the evangelist Dr. Righteous singing while the Panozzo brothers acted as his henchmen on stage, and \"Haven't We Been Here Before\" with Shaw as Jonathan Chance and DeYoung (as Kilroy in Roboto costume) duetting. The elaborate show was expensive to produce and was not as profitable as previous tours.\n\n''Kilroy Was Here'' brought the creative and competitive tensions within the band beyond the breaking point. Shaw departed the band for a solo career at the conclusion of the tour. In 1984, the band released its first live album, ''[[Caught in the Act (Styx album)|Caught in the Act]]''. The project featured one studio track, \"[[Music Time (song)|Music Time]]\", which became a Top 40 hit. The concert was also filmed and released on VHS under the same title (and on DVD in 2007). By the time of the album's release, the band had already parted ways.\n\n==Solo careers (1984 to 1989)==\nDennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw released a string of solo albums, beginning with DeYoung's ''[[Desert Moon]]'' and Shaw's ''[[Girls with Guns (album)|Girls with Guns]]'' in 1984. Both DeYoung and Shaw generated a moderate amount of interest with their first solo albums, with DeYoung achieving more success. DeYoung scored a Top 10 hit with the title track, \"[[Desert Moon (song)|Desert Moon]]\", which was also heavily featured on [[MTV]].<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dennis-deyoung|title=Dennis DeYoung|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> Shaw also cracked the Top Forty with \"Girls with Guns\" and he made a cameo appearance on the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Miami Vice]]''. DeYoung's follow up single \"Don't Wait for Heroes\" also featured a video that was heavily featured on MTV, but it failed to generate significant radio airplay, only peaking at No.&nbsp;83.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> During the filming of the video, DeYoung injured his back, causing him to back out of opening a North American concert tour for [[Huey Lewis and the News]]. Shaw, however, did tour in the fall of 1984 as an opening act for [[the Kinks]].\n\nShaw's 1985 album ''[[What If (Tommy Shaw album)|What If]]'' and DeYoung's 1986 album ''[[Back to the World (Dennis DeYoung album)|Back to the World]]'' also charted, along with singles from film soundtracks. Shaw's \"What If (Remo's Theme)\" from ''[[Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins]]'' entered the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Hot 100, while DeYoung's \"This Is the Time\" from ''[[The Karate Kid, Part II]]'' soundtrack was featured for a short while on MTV. The first single from DeYoung's ''Back to the World'' album, \"Call Me\", peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the Adult Contemporary chart and was a modest pop hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;54 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/>\n\nHowever, by the late 1980s, both Styx members' solo careers gradually simmered down to a modest but loyal fan base. Neither Shaw's ''[[Ambition (Tommy Shaw album)|Ambition]]'' (1987) nor DeYoung's ''[[Boomchild (album)|Boomchild]]'' (1989) achieved nearly the same levels of earlier albums, although Shaw's cover of [[Jim Peterik]]'s \"Ever Since the World Began\" charted briefly. Shaw also recorded sessions with Peterik's group, [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], on 1986's ''[[When Seconds Count]]'', and Shaw's solo band opened the majority of the US shows for [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s 1987-88 Hold Your Fire Tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/Tours.htm |title=Rush Tour Dates and Setlists from Power Windows |website=2112.net |date= |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101120127/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/Tours.htm |archive-date=November 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, James \"JY\" Young recorded his own solo albums: ''City Slicker'' (1985 with [[Jan Hammer]])<ref name=mayne/> and ''Out on a Day Pass'' (1988), both attracting only minimal attention. In 1995 Young partnered with other Chicago musicians and released an album under the name James Young Group titled ''Raised by Wolves''.\n\nIn 1989, Shaw formed [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]] with [[Ted Nugent]], [[Jack Blades]], and [[Michael Cartellone]]. However, the remaining members of Styx made plans for a comeback in the new decade.\n\n==Reunion and beyond (1990s-present)==\n[[File:Styx.JPG|thumb|[[James Young (American musician)|James \"JY\" Young]], [[Tommy Shaw]], [[Lawrence Gowan]]]]\n\n===''Edge of the Century'' and renewed success (1990-91)===\n\nStyx reformed in 1990, bringing in [[Glen Burtnik]] as a new guitarist, as Shaw was by then committed to [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Styx Newcomer Burtnik Feels He Fits Right in|newspaper=Worcester Telegram Gazette|date=May 26, 1991}}</ref>\n\nThe new line-up released one album, ''[[Edge of the Century]]'', featuring the Dennis DeYoung ballad \"[[Show Me the Way (Styx song)|Show Me the Way]]\", which received an additional boost just prior to the first [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. Some radio stations edited the Top Three hit to include the voices of children, whose parents were deployed in Saudi Arabia between 1990 and 1991. The song went all the way to No. 3 on both the [[Hot 100]] and at [[Adult Contemporary]] radio and notably remained in the top 40 for 23 weeks and AC for 31 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1991-03-16/hot-100|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> With the huge success of the song \"Show Me the Way\", Styx joined a handful of musical acts to have top 10 singles in three different decades and under four different presidential administrations.\n\nA follow single, \u201c[[Love At First Sight (Styx song)|Love At First Sight]]\u201d, peaked at No. 25 on the [[Hot 100]] and No. 13 on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart.\n\nStyx toured across the US in the spring and summer of 1991, but their success was short lived, as they were dropped after A&M Records was purchased by [[PolyGram Records]], ending an over-fifteen-year relationship. The popularity of [[Grunge]] was a major factor in PolyGram letting the band go.\n\nA set of demos titled ''Son of Edge'' were completed and shown to other record labels. But with [[grunge]] now dominating the rock press, video channels, and airwaves, and with singles from pop/rock bands being phased out, there was little interest from major record companies, and by fall 1991, Styx disbanded once again.\n\n===1995 reunion with Shaw===\nThe band reunited once again in 1995, with guitarist Tommy Shaw returning to the fold, to re-record \"Lady\" for ''[[Styx Greatest Hits]]''. Drummer [[Todd Sucherman]] filled in for John Panozzo, who was unable to participate due to liver problems caused by years of excessive [[alcohol (drug)|drinking]], which eventually claimed his life the following year on July 16.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|title=John Panozzo - Styx Drummer|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=July 16, 1996}}</ref>\n\nThe 1996 \"Return to Paradise\" tour, with Sucherman as a full member, was successful. The reunion tour was documented with a two-disc live set, 1997's ''[[Return to Paradise (Styx album)|Return to Paradise]]'', which featured three new studio tracks: \"On My Way\", \"Paradise\" (a soft rock ballad that also appears in another version on Dennis DeYoung's 1998 ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Dennis DeYoung album)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' album), and \"Dear John\", a tribute to the late Panozzo that has become a cult favorite among Styx fans. And later on it documented on DVD format. The ''Return to Paradise'' album was a surprise success in 1997, achieving gold status and the single \u201cParadise\u201d briefly charting on the Adult Contemporary chart at No. 27. Following the release of the album, Styx embarked on another tour, this one to mark the 20th anniversary of [[The Grand Illusion (album)|''The Grand Illusion'']].\n\n===''Brave New World'' (1999) and split with DeYoung===\nTwo years later, in 1999, the band released its first new studio album in almost a decade: [[Brave New World (Styx album)|''Brave New World'']]. The album received a lukewarm reception and sold very slowly, and the single, \"Everything Is Cool\", failed to chart.\n\nOnce again, during work on the album, personality conflicts drove the band members apart. While Tommy Shaw's material attempted to bring the band into the next century and JY's songs attempted to convey a hard rock vein, Dennis DeYoung's more pop and Broadway-style leanings led to divergent sounds on ''Brave New World''. According to DeYoung, another crucial difference was that he was not the overall producer on this album, as he had been on the others.\n\nArguments over which songs to release as singles, the album's artwork, the track sequencing, the slow album sales, and the omission of DeYoung's vocals and keyboards from many of the Shaw-Young tracks fueled the fire.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The band was further hindered by a viral illness contracted by DeYoung, which temporarily made his eyes sensitive to light. DeYoung asked his bandmates to delay touring, but they refused and decided to go forward without him. DeYoung was replaced by [[Lawrence Gowan]], a classically trained pianist, who had achieved platinum success as a solo act on [[Sony Canada]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Ray|title=Touring like never before|journal=Billboard|date=August 4, 2001|volume=113|issue=31|page=S8}}</ref> Gowan's song \"[[A Criminal Mind]]\" was incorporated into their tour [[set list]], and is still performed into the 2010s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/07/10/styx-singer-lawrence-gowan-is-still-a-strange-animal/ |title=Styx singer Lawrence Gowan is still a strange animal |last=Go |first=Justin |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=10 July 2012 |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141005003432/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/07/10/styx-singer-lawrence-gowan-is-still-a-strange-animal/ |archive-date=October 5, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBassist Chuck Panozzo was sidelined in 1999 due to health problems related to his battle with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].

Each band also released their set as a separate album, with additional tracks; Styx's version was ''[[At the River's Edge: Live in St. Louis]]''.\n\nWith Chuck Panozzo concentrating on his health problems, Glen Burtnik returned to Styx in 1999 to fill in for him on bass, with Panozzo participating on a part-time basis, sitting in as his health permitted.\n\nIn 2001, DeYoung sued his former bandmates, seeking the rights to use the group's name in support of his solo career, with the group being allowed to keep the name \"Styx\" and DeYoung able to use the name in descriptive phrases such as \"the music of Styx\" or \"formerly of Styx\" (but not \"the voice of Styx\"). Financial terms that Young and Shaw had to pay DeYoung for ownership of the name were not disclosed.\n\nStyx's new lineup released several live albums and released the studio album [[Cyclorama (album)|Cyclorama]] in February 2003, which reached No.&nbsp;127 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts. A single \"Waiting for Our Time\" hit No.&nbsp;37 on the ''Billboard'' mainstream rock chart for 1 week. Styx toured extensively during this period and released additional live albums. Styx also was part of the Super Bowl pre game entertainment in San Diego prior to the Oakland Raiders vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They played a short set in the parking lot, as well as on the field right before the game, playing [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[We Are the Champions]]\".\n\nBurtnik left Styx in September 2003, to spend time with his family and to pursue a solo career and release the album ''Welcome to Hollywood''. He was replaced by [[Ricky Phillips]], formerly of [[the Babys]] and [[Bad English]]. Panozzo continues to play bass for some shows with Phillips on rhythm guitar, while Phillips continues as a stand in bassist for Panozzo during shows without him. Burtnik would go on to join up with DeYoung for numerous tour dates over the next several years.\n\nOn June 5, 2004, Styx participated in Eric Clapton's [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] covering songs by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[B.B.

Their version of [[the Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" received some radio play, and a video was made for the song, which was subsequently featured in their live shows. Still, the album had a short life on the charts and failed to make much of a dent.\n\nMeanwhile, DeYoung continued his solo career by re-arranging and performing his Styx hits with a symphony orchestra. In 2005, DeYoung released a CD of re-recorded Styx hits from a solo concert with a symphony orchestra (titled ''[[The Music of Styx - Live with Symphony Orchestra]]''). The album also contained three new DeYoung songs. DeYoung's CD became a major hit in Canada, selling 50,000 copies there. Burtnik now often appears with DeYoung in his solo shows. In June 2007, DeYoung released ''[[One Hundred Years from Now (album)|One Hundred Years from Now]]'' (not released in the US till 2009), his first full collection of new songs in some time.\n\nAs of April 21, 2006, according to the [[RIAA]], which awards artists and groups gold/platinum status, Styx ranks number 127 with 17.5&nbsp;million records sold within the United States.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt \n |title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum - March&nbsp;28, 2010 \n |website=Riaa.com \n |access-date=March 28, 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701163039/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt \n |archive-date=July 1, 2007 \n |df=mdy \n}}</ref> The blurb on Amazon.com about Panozzo's book ''The Grand Illusion: Love, Lies, and My Life with Styx'' states that Styx has sold over 54&nbsp;million records.\n\nOn April 16, 2007, [[Def Leppard]] announced a 50-date 2007 tour, which included Styx and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] as supporting acts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defleppard.com/news/news_item.asp?item=184 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519122819/http://www.defleppard.com/news/news_item.asp?item=184 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-05-19 |title=News |publisher=Def Leppard |date= |access-date=2011-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 2007, Styx received the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" from [[IEBA]] (International Entertainment Buyers Association) in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nIn 2008, Styx performed on a double bill with [[Boston (band)|Boston]] in a North American summer tour, playing 53 dates in 12 weeks.\n\nIn 2009, Styx went on tour with [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[38 Special (band)|.38 Special]].

In 1965, the Tradewinds name was changed to TW4 (There Were 4) <ref name=clark /> after another band, [[the Trade Winds]], achieved fame nationally. By 1966, the Panozzo brothers had joined DeYoung at [[Chicago State College]] and kept the group together by performing at high schools and fraternity parties while studying to be teachers.

These albums contained straight-ahead rockers mixed with prog rock flourish with a lot of guitars, drums, keyboards, percussion, and vocals solos.

In the spring of 1975, nearly two years after the album had been released, \"Lady\" hit No.&nbsp;6 in the US, and ''Styx II'' went gold soon after. After the success of \"Lady\", \"Best Thing\" was re-released.\n\n==Commercial success (1975-1983)==\n===Breakthrough recognition (1975 to 1978)===\nOn the heels of its belated hit single, Styx signed with [[A&M Records]] and released ''[[Equinox (Styx album)|Equinox]]'' (1975), which sold well and yielded a minor hit in \"[[Lorelei (Styx song)|Lorelei]]\", which reached No. 27 in the U.S. More importantly, it contained the rock anthem \"[[Suite Madame Blue]]\", which gained the band considerable recognition and airplay on [[FM radio]] in the relatively new [[Album-oriented rock|Album Oriented Rock]] (AOR) format. Following the move to A&M, guitarist [[John Curulewski]] suddenly left the band as they were to embark on a nationwide tour in December 1975, due to his desire to spend time with his family. After a frantic last-minute search, the band brought in guitarist [[Tommy Shaw]] as Curulewski's replacement.<ref name=clark />\n\n''[[Crystal Ball (Styx album)|Crystal Ball]]'' (1976), the first album to feature Shaw, was moderately successful, but was overall a disappointment, failing to achieve the sales of its predecessor. The album showcased the band's newest member, as Shaw's \"[[Mademoiselle (song)|Mademoiselle]]\" was another minor hit, reaching No. 36, and the album's title track, also written and sung by Shaw  became another minor AOR hit.\n\nStyx's seventh album, ''[[The Grand Illusion (album)|The Grand Illusion]]'', was released on July 7, 1977, and became their breakthrough album, reaching [[gold album|Triple Platinum]] [[RIAA certification|certification]]. It spawned a top-ten hit and [[Album Oriented Rock|AOR]] radio staple in the [[Dennis DeYoung|DeYoung]]-written \"[[Come Sail Away]]\", which reached No. 8 in 1978. Shaw's \"[[Fooling Yourself (The Angry Young Man)]]\" was a second radio hit and reached No. 29 the same year. The title track also received significant airplay.\n\nThrough the late 1970s and early 1980s, the band enjoyed its greatest success. Their 1978 album ''[[Pieces of Eight (album)|Pieces of Eight]]'' found the group moving in a more straight-ahead hard-rock direction and spawned three Shaw sung hit singles \"[[Renegade (Styx song)|Renegade]]\" (No. 16 in the US) and \"[[Blue Collar Man (Long Nights)]]\" (No. 21 in the US), plus a minor hit \"[[Sing for the Day]]\" that stopped just short of the Top Forty at No. 41.\n\n===Mainstream success (1979 to 1983)===\nTheir 1979 album ''[[Cornerstone (Styx album)|Cornerstone]]'' yielded their first No. 1 hit, the DeYoung ballad \"[[Babe (Styx song)|Babe]]\".

Not so you would have to buy some $400 tape recorder to hear it.\"\n\n===Breakup (1983-84)===\nThe band followed DeYoung's lead with their next project, [[Kilroy Was Here (album)|''Kilroy Was Here'']] (1983), another more fully realized concept album, embracing the [[rock opera]] form. It is set in a future where performing and playing rock music has been outlawed due to the efforts of a charismatic evangelist, Dr. Everett Righteous played by James \"JY\" Young. ''Kilroy Was Here'' featured DeYoung in the part of Kilroy, an unjustly imprisoned rock star. Tommy Shaw played the part of Jonathan Chance, a younger rocker who fights for Kilroy's freedom and the lifting of the ban on rock music. This future society is served by robots. Called Robotos, these automatons perform many jobs, and several serve as Kilroy's prison guards.\n\nPart of the impetus for the Kilroy story was the band's reaction to the backward masking accusation.<ref name=clark /> The album included Young's song \"[[Heavy Metal Poisoning]]\", which includes lyrics sarcastically mocking the allegations against the group. Its introduction intentionally included a backward message, the Latin phrases, \"annuit coeptis\" and \"novus ordo seclorum\", from the reverse side of the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

The elaborate show was expensive to produce and was not as profitable as previous tours.\n\n''Kilroy Was Here'' brought the creative and competitive tensions within the band beyond the breaking point. Shaw departed the band for a solo career at the conclusion of the tour. In 1984, the band released its first live album, ''[[Caught in the Act (Styx album)|Caught in the Act]]''. The project featured one studio track, \"[[Music Time (song)|Music Time]]\", which became a Top 40 hit. The concert was also filmed and released on VHS under the same title (and on DVD in 2007). By the time of the album's release, the band had already parted ways.\n\n==Solo careers (1984 to 1989)==\nDennis DeYoung and Tommy Shaw released a string of solo albums, beginning with DeYoung's ''[[Desert Moon]]'' and Shaw's ''[[Girls with Guns (album)|Girls with Guns]]'' in 1984. Both DeYoung and Shaw generated a moderate amount of interest with their first solo albums, with DeYoung achieving more success. DeYoung scored a Top 10 hit with the title track, \"[[Desert Moon (song)|Desert Moon]]\", which was also heavily featured on [[MTV]].<ref name=\"billboard.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dennis-deyoung|title=Dennis DeYoung|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> Shaw also cracked the Top Forty with \"Girls with Guns\" and he made a cameo appearance on the [[NBC]] television series ''[[Miami Vice]]''. DeYoung's follow up single \"Don't Wait for Heroes\" also featured a video that was heavily featured on MTV, but it failed to generate significant radio airplay, only peaking at No.&nbsp;83.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/> During the filming of the video, DeYoung injured his back, causing him to back out of opening a North American concert tour for [[Huey Lewis and the News]]. Shaw, however, did tour in the fall of 1984 as an opening act for [[the Kinks]].\n\nShaw's 1985 album ''[[What If (Tommy Shaw album)|What If]]'' and DeYoung's 1986 album ''[[Back to the World (Dennis DeYoung album)|Back to the World]]'' also charted, along with singles from film soundtracks. Shaw's \"What If (Remo's Theme)\" from ''[[Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins]]'' entered the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Hot 100, while DeYoung's \"This Is the Time\" from ''[[The Karate Kid, Part II]]'' soundtrack was featured for a short while on MTV. The first single from DeYoung's ''Back to the World'' album, \"Call Me\", peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the Adult Contemporary chart and was a modest pop hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;54 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name=\"billboard.com\"/>\n\nHowever, by the late 1980s, both Styx members' solo careers gradually simmered down to a modest but loyal fan base. Neither Shaw's ''[[Ambition (Tommy Shaw album)|Ambition]]'' (1987) nor DeYoung's ''[[Boomchild (album)|Boomchild]]'' (1989) achieved nearly the same levels of earlier albums, although Shaw's cover of [[Jim Peterik]]'s \"Ever Since the World Began\" charted briefly. Shaw also recorded sessions with Peterik's group, [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]], on 1986's ''[[When Seconds Count]]'', and Shaw's solo band opened the majority of the US shows for [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s 1987-88 Hold Your Fire Tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/Tours.htm |title=Rush Tour Dates and Setlists from Power Windows |website=2112.net |date= |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101120127/http://www.2112.net/powerwindows/tours/Tours.htm |archive-date=November 1, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, James \"JY\" Young recorded his own solo albums: ''City Slicker'' (1985 with [[Jan Hammer]])<ref name=mayne/> and ''Out on a Day Pass'' (1988), both attracting only minimal attention. In 1995 Young partnered with other Chicago musicians and released an album under the name James Young Group titled ''Raised by Wolves''.\n\nIn 1989, Shaw formed [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]] with [[Ted Nugent]], [[Jack Blades]], and [[Michael Cartellone]]. However, the remaining members of Styx made plans for a comeback in the new decade.\n\n==Reunion and beyond (1990s-present)==\n[[File:Styx.JPG|thumb|[[James Young (American musician)|James \"JY\" Young]], [[Tommy Shaw]], [[Lawrence Gowan]]]]\n\n===''Edge of the Century'' and renewed success (1990-91)===\n\nStyx reformed in 1990, bringing in [[Glen Burtnik]] as a new guitarist, as Shaw was by then committed to [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Styx Newcomer Burtnik Feels He Fits Right in|newspaper=Worcester Telegram Gazette|date=May 26, 1991}}</ref>\n\nThe new line-up released one album, ''[[Edge of the Century]]'', featuring the Dennis DeYoung ballad \"[[Show Me the Way (Styx song)|Show Me the Way]]\", which received an additional boost just prior to the first [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]]. Some radio stations edited the Top Three hit to include the voices of children, whose parents were deployed in Saudi Arabia between 1990 and 1991. The song went all the way to No. 3 on both the [[Hot 100]] and at [[Adult Contemporary]] radio and notably remained in the top 40 for 23 weeks and AC for 31 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1991-03-16/hot-100|title=Music: Top 100 Songs - Billboard Hot 100 Chart|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> With the huge success of the song \"Show Me the Way\", Styx joined a handful of musical acts to have top 10 singles in three different decades and under four different presidential administrations.\n\nA follow single, \u201c[[Love At First Sight (Styx song)|Love At First Sight]]\u201d, peaked at No. 25 on the [[Hot 100]] and No. 13 on the [[Adult Contemporary]] chart.\n\nStyx toured across the US in the spring and summer of 1991, but their success was short lived, as they were dropped after A&M Records was purchased by [[PolyGram Records]], ending an over-fifteen-year relationship. The popularity of [[Grunge]] was a major factor in PolyGram letting the band go.\n\nA set of demos titled ''Son of Edge'' were completed and shown to other record labels. But with [[grunge]] now dominating the rock press, video channels, and airwaves, and with singles from pop/rock bands being phased out, there was little interest from major record companies, and by fall 1991, Styx disbanded once again.\n\n===1995 reunion with Shaw===\nThe band reunited once again in 1995, with guitarist Tommy Shaw returning to the fold, to re-record \"Lady\" for ''[[Styx Greatest Hits]]''. Drummer [[Todd Sucherman]] filled in for John Panozzo, who was unable to participate due to liver problems caused by years of excessive [[alcohol (drug)|drinking]], which eventually claimed his life the following year on July 16.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|title=John Panozzo - Styx Drummer|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=July 16, 1996}}</ref>\n\nThe 1996 \"Return to Paradise\" tour, with Sucherman as a full member, was successful. The reunion tour was documented with a two-disc live set, 1997's ''[[Return to Paradise (Styx album)|Return to Paradise]]'', which featured three new studio tracks: \"On My Way\", \"Paradise\" (a soft rock ballad that also appears in another version on Dennis DeYoung's 1998 ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Dennis DeYoung album)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' album), and \"Dear John\", a tribute to the late Panozzo that has become a cult favorite among Styx fans. And later on it documented on DVD format. The ''Return to Paradise'' album was a surprise success in 1997, achieving gold status and the single \u201cParadise\u201d briefly charting on the Adult Contemporary chart at No. 27. Following the release of the album, Styx embarked on another tour, this one to mark the 20th anniversary of [[The Grand Illusion (album)|''The Grand Illusion'']].\n\n===''Brave New World'' (1999) and split with DeYoung===\nTwo years later, in 1999, the band released its first new studio album in almost a decade: [[Brave New World (Styx album)|''Brave New World'']]. The album received a lukewarm reception and sold very slowly, and the single, \"Everything Is Cool\", failed to chart.\n\nOnce again, during work on the album, personality conflicts drove the band members apart. While Tommy Shaw's material attempted to bring the band into the next century and JY's songs attempted to convey a hard rock vein, Dennis DeYoung's more pop and Broadway-style leanings led to divergent sounds on ''Brave New World''. According to DeYoung, another crucial difference was that he was not the overall producer on this album, as he had been on the others.\n\nArguments over which songs to release as singles, the album's artwork, the track sequencing, the slow album sales, and the omission of DeYoung's vocals and keyboards from many of the Shaw-Young tracks fueled the fire.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The band was further hindered by a viral illness contracted by DeYoung, which temporarily made his eyes sensitive to light. DeYoung asked his bandmates to delay touring, but they refused and decided to go forward without him. DeYoung was replaced by [[Lawrence Gowan]], a classically trained pianist, who had achieved platinum success as a solo act on [[Sony Canada]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Waddell|first=Ray|title=Touring like never before|journal=Billboard|date=August 4, 2001|volume=113|issue=31|page=S8}}</ref> Gowan's song \"[[A Criminal Mind]]\" was incorporated into their tour [[set list]], and is still performed into the 2010s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/07/10/styx-singer-lawrence-gowan-is-still-a-strange-animal/ |title=Styx singer Lawrence Gowan is still a strange animal |last=Go |first=Justin |newspaper=[[National Post]] |date=10 July 2012 |access-date=4 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141005003432/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/07/10/styx-singer-lawrence-gowan-is-still-a-strange-animal/ |archive-date=October 5, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nBassist Chuck Panozzo was sidelined in 1999 due to health problems related to his battle with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]].

AMACOM,2007, p. 185.</ref>\n\nOn June 6, 1999, the group reunited briefly to perform for the [[Children's Miracle Network Hospitals|Children's Miracle Network]] Telethon as DeYoung's final performance with the band. Glen Burtnik filled in for Chuck Panozzo on bass.\n\n===Post-DeYoung years (2000-present)===\n[[File:Styx 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Styx performing in 2009]]\nOn June 9, 2000, Styx made an appearance with [[REO Speedwagon]] at the [[Hollywood Casino Amphitheatre (Maryland Heights, Missouri)|Riverport Amphitheatre]]. A 2-CD recording of the concert was released as ''[[Arch Allies: Live at Riverport]]'', with one disc of each band's set, and both discs concluding with performances of the two bands collaborating on jam versions of Styx's \"Blue Collar Man\" and REO's \"[[Roll with the Changes]]\".  Each band also released their set as a separate album, with additional tracks; Styx's version was ''[[At the River's Edge: Live in St. Louis]]''.\n\nWith Chuck Panozzo concentrating on his health problems, Glen Burtnik returned to Styx in 1999 to fill in for him on bass, with Panozzo participating on a part-time basis, sitting in as his health permitted.\n\nIn 2001, DeYoung sued his former bandmates, seeking the rights to use the group's name in support of his solo career, with the group being allowed to keep the name \"Styx\" and DeYoung able to use the name in descriptive phrases such as \"the music of Styx\" or \"formerly of Styx\" (but not \"the voice of Styx\"). Financial terms that Young and Shaw had to pay DeYoung for ownership of the name were not disclosed.\n\nStyx's new lineup released several live albums and released the studio album [[Cyclorama (album)|Cyclorama]] in February 2003, which reached No.&nbsp;127 on the ''Billboard'' 200 album charts. A single \"Waiting for Our Time\" hit No.&nbsp;37 on the ''Billboard'' mainstream rock chart for 1 week. Styx toured extensively during this period and released additional live albums. Styx also was part of the Super Bowl pre game entertainment in San Diego prior to the Oakland Raiders vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers. They played a short set in the parking lot, as well as on the field right before the game, playing [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s \"[[We Are the Champions]]\".\n\nBurtnik left Styx in September 2003, to spend time with his family and to pursue a solo career and release the album ''Welcome to Hollywood''. He was replaced by [[Ricky Phillips]], formerly of [[the Babys]] and [[Bad English]]. Panozzo continues to play bass for some shows with Phillips on rhythm guitar, while Phillips continues as a stand in bassist for Panozzo during shows without him. Burtnik would go on to join up with DeYoung for numerous tour dates over the next several years.\n\nOn June 5, 2004, Styx participated in Eric Clapton's [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] covering songs by [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[B.B. King]], and [[Slim Harpo]] with [[Jeff Baxter]] as a special guest.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.zrock.com/zforum/post-1448.html\n |title       = Crossroads Guitar Festival : June&nbsp;4\u20136, 2004 : Dallas, TX\n |work        = zrock.com\n |access-date  = March 28, 2010\n |url-status     = dead\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20101104230827/http://www.zrock.com/zforum/post-1448.html\n |archive-date = November 4, 2010\n |df          = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, Styx released an album of cover tunes, ''[[Big Bang Theory (Styx album)|Big Bang Theory]]'', which reached the ''Billboard'' Top 50 on the album charts, their highest charting album since 1990. Their version of [[the Beatles]] song \"[[I Am the Walrus]]\" received some radio play, and a video was made for the song, which was subsequently featured in their live shows. Still, the album had a short life on the charts and failed to make much of a dent.\n\nMeanwhile, DeYoung continued his solo career by re-arranging and performing his Styx hits with a symphony orchestra. In 2005, DeYoung released a CD of re-recorded Styx hits from a solo concert with a symphony orchestra (titled ''[[The Music of Styx - Live with Symphony Orchestra]]''). The album also contained three new DeYoung songs. DeYoung's CD became a major hit in Canada, selling 50,000 copies there. Burtnik now often appears with DeYoung in his solo shows. In June 2007, DeYoung released ''[[One Hundred Years from Now (album)|One Hundred Years from Now]]'' (not released in the US till 2009), his first full collection of new songs in some time.\n\nAs of April 21, 2006, according to the [[RIAA]], which awards artists and groups gold/platinum status, Styx ranks number 127 with 17.5&nbsp;million records sold within the United States.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt \n |title=RIAA - Gold & Platinum - March&nbsp;28, 2010 \n |website=Riaa.com \n |access-date=March 28, 2010 \n |url-status=dead \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701163039/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt \n |archive-date=July 1, 2007 \n |df=mdy \n}}</ref> The blurb on Amazon.com about Panozzo's book ''The Grand Illusion: Love, Lies, and My Life with Styx'' states that Styx has sold over 54&nbsp;million records.\n\nOn April 16, 2007, [[Def Leppard]] announced a 50-date 2007 tour, which included Styx and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] as supporting acts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defleppard.com/news/news_item.asp?item=184 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519122819/http://www.defleppard.com/news/news_item.asp?item=184 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-05-19 |title=News |publisher=Def Leppard |date= |access-date=2011-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nOn October 16, 2007, Styx received the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" from [[IEBA]] (International Entertainment Buyers Association) in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].\n\nIn 2008, Styx performed on a double bill with [[Boston (band)|Boston]] in a North American summer tour, playing 53 dates in 12 weeks.\n\nIn 2009, Styx went on tour with [[REO Speedwagon]] and [[38 Special (band)|.38 Special]].
