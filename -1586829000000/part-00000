It was based in [[Central Java]], and later in [[East Java]]. Established by King [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the kingdom was ruled by the [[Sailendra]] dynasty.\n\nDuring most of its history the kingdom seems have relied heavily on agriculture, especially extensive [[rice farming]], and later also benefited from maritime trade. According to foreign sources and archaeological findings, the kingdom seems to have been well populated and quite prosperous. The kingdom developed a complex society,<ref name=\"Peradaban35\">{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=35 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref> had a well developed culture, and achieved a degree of sophistication and refined civilization.\n\nIn the period between the late 8th century and the mid-9th century, the kingdom saw the blossoming of classical Javanese art and architecture reflected in the rapid growth of [[Candi of Indonesia|temple construction]].  Temples dotted the landscape of its heartland in [[Yogyakarta|Mataram]] ([[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]). The most notable of the temples constructed in Medang Mataram are [[Kalasan]], [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]], all quite close to present-day city of [[Yogyakarta]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2012/02/18/04155621/Kisah.Mataram.di.Poros.Kedu-Prambanan|title=Kisah Mataram di Poros Kedu-Prambanan - Kompas.com|last=Media|first=Kompas Cyber|date=2012-02-18|work=KOMPAS.com|access-date=2018-09-08|language=id}}</ref> At its peak, the kingdom had become a dominant empire\u2014not only in Java, but also in [[Srivijaya|Sumatra]], [[Bali]], [[Ligor|southern Thailand]], Indianized kingdoms of the [[Philippines]], and the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] in [[Cambodia]].<ref name=\"Laguna Copperplate Inscription\">[[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]]</ref><ref name=\"Ligor inscription\">[[Ligor inscription]]</ref><ref name=\"Coed\u00e8s, George 1968\">Coed\u00e8s, George (1968).

Civil war followed.  The outcome was that the Medang empire was divided into two powerful kingdoms; the [[Sanjaya dynasty|Shivaist dynasty]] of Medang kingdom in [[Java]] led by [[Rakai Pikatan]] and the [[Shailendra dynasty|Buddhist dynasty]] of [[Srivijaya]] kingdom in [[Sumatra]] led by [[Balaputradewa]]. Hostility between them did not end until 1006 when the Sailendra clan based in Srivijaya incited a rebellion by Wurawari, a vassal of the Medang kingdom, and sacked the capital of Watugaluh in East Java. Srivijaya rose to become the undisputed hegemonic empire in the region. The Shivaist dynasty survived, reclaimed east Java in 1019, and then established the [[Kahuripan|Kahuripan kingdom]] led by [[Airlangga]], son of [[Udayana Warmadewa|Udayana]] of Bali.<ref>{{harvp|Brown|2003|p=23}}</ref>\n\n==Historiography==\n[[File:BUDDINGH(1) p281 - RUINEN VAN PRAMBANAN, TJANDI SEWOE.jpg|thumb|right|A lithograph of ''[[Sewu|Tjandi Sewoe]]'' ruins near Prambanan, circa 1859|alt=|220x220px]]\nIn the early 19th century, the discovery of numerous ruins of [[Candi of Indonesia|great monuments]]\u2014such as [[Borobudur]], [[Sewu]] and [[Prambanan]]\u2014 which dominated the landscape of the [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain|Kewu]] plains in [[Yogyakarta Special Region|Yogyakarta]] and [[Central Java]], caught the attention of some historians and scholars in the colonial [[Dutch East Indies]].<ref name=\"Raffles1814\">{{cite book|title=The History of Java|author=Thomas Stamford Raffles|authorlink=Sir Thomas Raffles|year=1817|edition=1978|isbn=0-19-580347-7|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> This spurred [[archaeology|archaeological]] studies to uncover the history of this ancient civilisation.\n\nThe history of the Mataram area as the capital of the Central Javanese Medang kingdom is also part of the historical ''Yawadvipa'' or ''Bhumijava'' (the land of [[Java]]), and the classical Javanese civilisation. The [[India]]ns collectively called them as ''Yawadvipa'', the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] refer to them as ''Chvea'', the [[China|Chinese]] called them as ''Shepo'', ''Chopo'' or ''Chao-wa'', the Arabs called them as ''Jawi'' or ''Jawah'', and Srivijayan refer to them as ''Bhumijava''. The native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] most often refer to their lands and country simply as ''Jawi'' (Java), while the name of their ''nagara'' (country) is often based on their capital. The only foreign source mentioning ''Mda\u03b7'' was found from the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|Philippines inscription]], dated 822 saka (900).<ref>{{cite web | title=The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary | first=Postma | last=Antoon | url=http://ojs.philippinestudies.net/index.php/ps/article/download/1033/1018 | publisher=Philippine Studies, Ateneo de Manila University | location=Loyola Heights, Quezon City, the Philippines | page=186 | accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Panoramic views of Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borobudur]], the largest single Buddhist structure in the world, one of the monuments constructed by the [[Shailendra dynasty|Sailendran]] of the Medang Kingdom.|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nThere are no comprehensive written records that have survived in Java except numbers of ''prasasti'' (inscriptions) written on stones or copper plates. These inscriptions most often recorded the political and religious deeds of the rulers. The most common theme mentioned in inscriptions is the establishment of ''Sima'' (taxed rice cultivation land recognised through royal edict), and sometimes some portion or the whole of tax collected from this ''Sima'' land is appointed to fund the construction and maintenance of [[Candi of Indonesia|religious building]]. Nevertheless, some local legends and historical records, written on ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|lontar]]''\u2014most often dated from later period\u2014might also provides data and source to reconstruct the historical event.\n[[File:Shivagrha Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 778 Saka (856 CE), one of the historical source dated from the Medang Mataram Kingdom.]]\n\nNative [[Javanese mythology]] and beliefs composed in the [[Mataram Sultanate]] era (circa 17th century), but probably originating from an earlier period, mentioned a semi-mythological kingdom named [[Medang Kamulan]], which in Javanese translates to \"Medang the origin\" kingdom. The kingdom is mentioned in the myth of [[Dewi Sri]] and also [[Aji Saka]]. This is probably the remnant of vague native Javanese collective memory of the existence of an ancient kingdom called \"Medang\".\n\nCurrent knowledge of historical Javanese civilisation is thus primarily derived from:\n* ''Archaeological excavations'', reconstruction and investigation of ancient structures, especially ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temples), and also the discovery of ancient relics, such as the [[Wonoboyo hoard]].\n* ''Stone inscriptions'', most common are those which mention the foundation and funding of temples which report on the political and religious deeds of the kings, or stating their lineage; the most notable are the [[Canggal inscription|Canggal]], [[Kalasan inscription|Kalasan]], [[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]] and [[Mantyasih inscription|Balitung charter]].\n* ''[[Bas relief]]s'' in a series of temple walls with depictions of life in the palace, village, temple, ship, marketplace and also the everyday lives of the population. The most notable are the bas reliefs found on Borobudur and Prambanan temple.\n* ''Native [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscripts]]'' mentioning stories of kings, their deeds and exploits, that somehow link across to accounts mentioned in stone inscriptions. The notable example is the [[Carita Parahyangan]].\n* ''Reports and chronicles'' of foreign diplomats, traders and travellers, mainly from Chinese, Indian, and Arab sources.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Prambanan]] temple compound originally consisted of hundreds of temples, built and expanded in the period between the reign of Pikatan and Balitung|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nInitially, the kingdom was identified only through its location '''Yawadvipa''' ([[Java]] island) as mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732). The inscription mentioned ''Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya'' (King Sanjaya, the Rakai (lord) of Mataram). The earlier historians such as [[Soekmono]], identify this kingdom as '''Mataram''', a historic geographical name to identify the plain south of [[Mount Merapi]] in central Java, roughly corresponds to modern [[Muntilan]] (where the Canggal temple on [[Gunung Wukir]] hill is located), [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]] and [[Bantul Regency]]. This is based on the locations where large numbers of [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] were discovered in and around [[Prambanan Plain]]. The etymology of the name \"Mataram\" derived from a Sanskrit term for \"mother\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Mataram | work = Sanskrit dictionary | url = http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&tinput=mataram&trans=Translate}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Medang''' appear later in East Javanese inscriptions such as [[Anjukladang inscription]] (937) and [[Minto Stone]] (982), Paradah inscription and some inscriptions discovered in Surabaya. As the result, historians tends to identify the Eastern Java period (929\u20141006) of this kingdom as ''Medang'' to differ it with its earlier Central Java period of ''Mataram'' (732\u2014929). However, by examining the phrase in Anjukladang inscription mentioning: ''\"Kita prasiddha mangrakpa kadatwan rahyang ta i Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' suggests that the name ''Mda\u014b'' (read: Mdang or Medang) was already used earlier in Central Java period. The phrase ''\"Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' literally means \"Medang in the land of Mataram\", which means the kingdom name is Medang with its capital in Mataram.<ref>{{cite book|title=Menuju Puncak Kemegahan|author=Slamet Muljana\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XPLpH5LOZLsC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=Medang+Anjukladang#v=onepage&q=Medang%20Anjukladang&f=false|page=84|language=Indonesian|publisher=LKiS|accessdate=3 March 2014|isbn=9789798451355\n|year=2005\n}}</ref> The etymology of the name \"Medang\" might be derived from a local name of the hardwood \"medang\" tree which refer to trees of the genus ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work = KBBI | title = Medang | url = http://kbbi.web.id/medang}}</ref> However, another etymological approach suggests that it might derived from old Javanese term \"medang\" which means \"gracefully appear\". It might be related to a Javanese term \"medal\" which means \"going out\", and Sundanese term \"midang\" which refer to dress up and appear gracefully in public.<ref>{{cite web | title = Midang | work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=a&bhs2=m&q=1%20ngageulis%202%20midang.}}</ref>\n\nThe court moved several times after Mataram (reign of Sanjaya) to Mamrati or Amrati (reign of Rakai Pikatan), Poh Pitu (reign of Balitung), again to Bhumi Mataram (reign of Dyah Wawa), Tamwlang (reign of Sindok), Watugaluh (reign of Sindok), and last to Wwatan (reign of Dharmawangsa Teguh).\n\nThe name \"Mataram\" reappeared again later in the 14th century as one of [[Majapahit]]'s province. Later in the 16th century appeared the Islamic [[Mataram Sultanate]] located in the same area in Yogyakarta vicinity. As the result, earlier historian also named this kingdom as '''Hindu Mataram''' or '''Ancient Mataram''' to differ it with later Islamic Mataram Sultanate.\n\nThis historic Javanese Kingdom of Mataram should not be confused with the [[Mataram (city)|Mataram city]] located on [[Lombok]] island, currently the capital of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] province. The latter was actually the royal capital of the Cakranegara, a branch of [[Bali]]nese [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]] nobles that colonize Lombok in early 19th century. Indeed, Lombok's Mataram city was named after the historic region of Mataram in Java, as it is a common practice for [[Balinese people|Balinese]] to name their settlements after their Javanese Majapahit heritage.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and growth===\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Canggal inscription (732), created by King Sanjaya.]]\nThe earliest account of the Medang Mataram Kingdom is in the [[Canggal inscription]], dated 732, discovered within the compound of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple in Canggal village, southwest of the town of [[Magelang]]. This inscription, written in [[Sanskrit]] using the [[Pallava]] script, tells of the erection of a ''[[Lingam|lingga]]'' (a symbol of [[Shiva]]) on the hill in the Kunjarakunja area, located on a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which was blessed with abundance of rice and gold. The establishment of lingga was under the order of [[Sri Sanjaya|Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya]] (King Sanjaya Rakai (lord) of Mataram). This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was ruled by [[King Sanna]], whose long reign was marked by wisdom and virtue. After Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity. [[Sri Sanjaya|Sanjaya]], the son of [[Sannaha]] (Sanna's sister) ascended to the throne. He conquered the areas around his kingdom, and his wise reign blessed his land with peace and prosperity for all of his subjects.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Drs. R.

And yet it seems to be the continuation of earlier polity ruled by King Sanna, Sanjaya's uncle. This earlier polity is linked to the earlier [[Dieng temples|temple structures]] in [[Dieng Plateau]], in the northern part of Central Java, which is the oldest surviving structure found in Central Java. The earlier kingdom linked as the predecessor of Medang Mataram kingdom is [[Kalingga]], located somewhere in Central Java northern coast.\n\nThe story of Sanna and Sanjaya are also described in the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', a book from a later period composed around late 16th-century, which mainly describes the history of Pasundan (the [[Sunda Kingdom]]). This book mentions that Sanna was defeated by [[Purbasora]], King of [[Galuh]], and retreated to [[Mount Merapi]]. Later, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled [[West Java]], Central Java, East Java, and [[Bali]]. He also battled the [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Keling]] (against their king, Sang Srivijaya). Although the manuscript seems to be romanticised, vague and not providing certain details on the period, nevertheless the almost exact name and theme of the story with historical Canggal inscription seems to confirm that the manuscript was based or inspired from the historical event.\n\n===Golden age===\n[[File:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 9th century Central Javanese gold and silver image of the Mahayana Buddhist goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]]]\nThe period between the reign of King [[Panangkaran]] to King [[Balitung]] (span between 760\u2014910) that roughly lasted for 150 years, marked the apogee of Javanese classic civilisation. This period witnessed the blossoming of Javanese art and architecture, as numbers of majestic temples and monuments were erected and dominated the skyline of [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]. Most notable of these temples are [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temple. The [[Sailendra]]s are known as the ardent temple builder.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89\u201390}}\n\nKing Sanjaya was a Shivaist, and yet his successor Panangkaran was a Mahayana Buddhist.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89}} This shift of faith, from Shivaist Sanjaya to Buddhist Panangkaran has raised problematic questions among scholars; whether there were two competing royal families that dominated the political landscapes in Central Java, that each are patrons of either Shivaist Hindu or Mahayana Buddhism. Or more recently suggested theory, that there were only one dynasty\u2014the [[Sailendra]]s\u2014and there was only the shift or split of royal patronage in favour to Hinduism or Buddhism.\n\n====The great builder====\n[[File:Kalasan Temple from the south-south-east, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|The construction of [[Kalasan]] temple was mentioned in [[Kalasan inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]].]]\n\n[[Panangkaran]] (r. 760\u2014780) was an enthusiastic developer, he was credited for at least five major temple projects conducted and started during his reign. According to the [[Kalasan inscription]], dated 778 and written in the Pranagari script in Sanskrit, the [[Candi Kalasan|Kalasan]] temple was erected by the will of ''Guru Sang Raja Sailendravam\u00e7atilaka'' (the teacher of the ornament of Sailendra family), who persuaded [[Panangkaran]] (Sanjaya's successor) to construct a holy building for the goddess (''boddhisattvadevi'') [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and build a [[vihara]] ([[monastery]]) for Buddhist monks from the Sailendra realm. Panangkaran also awarded Kala\u00e7a village to a ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' (Buddhist monastic community).<ref>{{cite book | author=Soetarno, Drs.

This hilltop compound was actually not a religious structure; consist of series of gates, ramparts, fortified walls, dry moats, walled enclosure, terraces and building bases.

Initially probably it was intended as a secluded hilltop Buddhist monastery, as mentioned in the Abhayagiri Vihara inscription. However, later it seems to be converted to become a fortified palace or a citadel, which evidence in the remnant of defensive structures.<ref>{{cite book | author=Soetarno, Drs.

The king however, never saw the completion of this grand temple complex, as it finished in 792, long after his death probably around 780.

He was mentioned in [[Kelurak inscription]] (dated 782) in his formal reign name Sri Sanggrama Dhananjaya. In this inscription he was hailed as ''Wairiwarawiramardana'' or \"the slayer of courageous enemies\". The similar title also found in [[Ligor inscription|Ligor B inscription]] discovered in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula; ''Sarwwarimadawimathana'', which suggest it referred to the same person.

He continued the construction of Manjusrigrha temple ([[Sewu]] complex), and  according to the [[Karangtengah inscription]] (dated 824) responsible for the construction of Venuvana temple, connected to [[Mendut]] or probably [[Ngawen]] temple. He was also probably responsible for the conception and initiation of the construction of [[Borobudur]] and [[Pawon]] temple.\n\nDharanindra ascends as the Maharaja of [[Srivijaya]]. The nature of Sailendras' close relations with the neighbouring Srivijayan empire based on Sumatra is quite uncertain and complicated. It seems that in earlier times, Sailendra family belonged within Srivijayan [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala sphere of influence]]. And for later period of time Sailendras' monarch rose to become the head of Srivijayan mandala. The shift that rendered Sailendras in return to become the ruler of Srivijaya was unclear. Was it led by military campaign by Dharanindra against Srivijaya in Sumatra, or more likely formed by close alliance and kinship between the house of Sailendra and the Maharaja of Srivijaya.\n[[File:LCI.jpg|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (circa 900 CE) from the Laguna de Bay area in Luzon, the Philippines.

This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from [[Tonle Sap]] to [[Mahendraparvata]], severed the link and proclaimed [[Khmer Empire|Cambodian]] independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married T\u0101r\u0101, daughter of [[Dharmasetu]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in [[Mantyasih inscription]].\n\nEarlier historians, such as [[N.

Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.\n\n[[Samaratungga]] (r. 819\u2013838) was credited for the completion of massive stone [[mandala]], the grand monument of [[Borobudur]] (completed in 825). Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strive to become a pacifist and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess [[Pramodhawardhani]] that betrothed to Shivaite [[Rakai Pikatan]], son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.\n\nThe rule of Shivaist [[Rakai Pikatan]] (r. 838\u2013850) and his Buddhist queen consort Pramodhawardhani marked the return of the Medang Mataram court favour to Shivaist Hindu,<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} instead of Mahayana Buddhism favoured by previous king Samaratungga. This is evident in the construction of grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound in the Mataram capital, located only few hundred meters south from [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple compound. Nevertheless, the inter-religious relations during Pikatan's reign seems to promote tolerance in the spirit of reconciliation. Their reign is credited to the construction and expansion of at least two of perwara temple and [[stupa]] in [[Plaosan]] complex, located east from Sewu (Manjusrigrha) temple. Plaosan temple with twin main temples is probably built and dated from an earlier period, probably started by Panangkaran, Samaragrawira or Samaratungga, but completed during Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani's reign.\n\n====The divide====\n[[File:Ratuboko Gate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ratu Boko]], a fortified hill, probably referred in [[Shivagrha inscription]] as the location of a battle.]]\n[[Balaputra]] however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.<ref name=\"Srivijaya21\">{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | page=21 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]] (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in [[Srivijaya]]n capital of [[Palembang]]. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother\u2014Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in [[Nalanda inscription]] dated 860.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}}\n\nThe [[Shivagrha inscription]] (dated 856) mentioned about a war challenging Pikatan's reign, the inscription however did not mention who was the enemy that challenged Pikatan's authority. The earlier historians suggests that it was Balaputradewa that rose against Pikatan, however later historians suggest it was another enemy, argued by that time Balaputra already ruled in Srivijaya. The Shivagrha inscription only mentioned that the battle happened in a fortress on a hill protected by bulk of stone walls, this fortress hill is identified with [[Ratu Boko]] archaeological site. The eldest children of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani was Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu. Eventually the revolt was successfully defeated by Pikatan's youngest son\u2014the valiant Dyah Lokapala also known as Rakai Kayuwangi. As the reward for his heroic deed and bravery, the people and many of Pikatan's state advisors urged that Lokapala should be named as crown prince instead of Gurunwangi. Gurunwangi's loss of favour in succession\u2014despite being the eldest sibling, has raised a question among scholars. It was previously thought that the name Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu refer to a female character (princess), although it is more likely that Gurunwangi was a prince.\n\nThis revolt seems to have succeeded in taking over the capital in Mataram for a certain period. After defeating the usurper, Pikatan found that this bloodshed has made the capital in Mataram inauspicious, thus he moved the karaton (court) to Mamrati or Amrati located somewhere in Kedu Plain (Progo river valley), northwest from Mataram.\n\nLater Pikatan decided to abdicate his throne in favour of his youngest son Dyah Lokapala (r. 850\u2014890). Rakai Pikatan retired, renounce worldly affairs and become a hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat. The event also marked with the consecrated ceremony of Shiva image in [[Prambanan]] main temple. Boechari suggests that the enemy that challenged Pikatan was Rakai Walaing pu Kumbhayoni, a powerful Shivaist landlord and also the branch of the ruling dynasty as he claimed as the descendant of a king that ruled Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\">{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | isbn=978-9794074084 | language=Indonesian |oclc=318053182 }}</ref>{{rp|159}}\n\n====The short peace====\nThe Medang Mataram kings after [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]]; from Lokapala, Watuhumalang (r. 890\u2014898) and [[Balitung]] are the patrons of Shivaist Hindu, \"after the decline of the power of the Buddhist Sailendras in central Java.\"<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|125\u2013127}} Their reign seems to enjoyed a relative peace. The grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound are continuously expanded and completed with hundreds of perwara (complementary) temples surrounding the main three prasada (tower) of [[Trimurti]] Hindu Gods. It is probably during their reign that some Hindu temples are constructed in the area, such as [[Sambisari]], [[Barong temple|Barong]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], [[Kedulan]], [[Kimpulan]], [[Kadisoka]], [[Gebang]] and [[Merak temple]]. Barong and Ijo temples in particular are interesting, for they are built on the hill and has different layout compared to earlier temples. Sewu and Prambanan temples are arranged in concentric mandala layout. Barong and Ijo temples however, are arranged in completely different way; the main temple is located in further back of the compound on the most higher ground, while the perwara complementary temples are built in front of the main temple on the lower ground, the layout corresponds to the uneven topography of the site. This style of temple layout is most likely the predecessor and will be continued in the later East Javanese temple architecture.\n\nKing Pikatan, Lokapala (Rakai Kayuwangi), and Watuhumalang ruled from their court in Mamrati or Amrati, they are known as \"Amrati Kings\". The exact location of Mamrati is unknown, suggested somewhere in [[Kedu Plain]] (modern day [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung regencies]]), located north from Mataram along [[Progo River]] valley. It was suggested that Amrati might be located near the location of Wanua Tengah III inscription, in Kedunglo hamlet, Kaloran village, within [[Temanggung Regency]].\n\nAfter absent for several generations, the name \"Mataram\" reappears in Javanese inscription during the reign of Balitung, which probably signify the transfer of capital. King Balitung moved his capital from Amrati to Poh Pitu, and renamed Poh Pitu as Yawapura. Again the exact location of this capital is unknown, probably also located within Kedu Plain. However, it is highly possible that Poh Pitu was located around the Poh inscription (905), in Dumpoh hamlet, Potrobangsan [[Villages of Indonesia|village]], North Magelang district within [[Magelang]] city. Balitung productively issued several inscriptions, among others are Telahap inscription (dated 11 September 899), Watukura inscription (27 July 902), Telang (11 January 904), Poh (17 July 905), Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905),  Mantyasih (11 April 907), and Rukam (907).\n\nOur current knowledge of the names of kings that reign the Medang Mataram kingdom is much owed to [[Mantyasih inscription]] (dated 907), issued by King [[Balitung]] (r. 898\u2014910)\u2014that contains genealogy and the reign order of Medang Mataram kings, and he seek ancestor as far as King Sanjaya. This inscription is also known as \"Balitung charter\". The motivation of Balitung's edict has sparked various assumptions from historians\u2014as if Balitung eagerly seeks legitimacy of his rule, by stating his ancestral lineage. It is highly possible that he related to the royal family and shared common ancestry. Thus, suggested that he married to the daughter of previous king, which made him the royal son in-law as well as heir.\n\nThe Watukura inscription (902) is the oldest inscription in Javanese statecraft that mentioned the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister), while the position of Rakryan Mapatih\u2014which in Balitung's era is equivalent to [[crown prince]], was held by Mpu Daksa. The relation between Balitung and his successor Daksha is quite problematic, as historians suggested Daksha was the son of previous king (Watuhumalang), while the court was held by Balitung who is probably Dakhsa's brother in-law. The Telang inscription, dated 11 January 904, revealed the development of the port complex of Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the bank of [[Solo River|Bengawan Solo river]]. By building port and ferry crossing in navigable Bengawan Solo, might signify the growing interest in maritime trade, thus the court interest has shifted eastward.\n\nThe Kubu-Kubu inscription (17 October 905) revealed the village Kubu-kubu was awarded to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in recognition of their valor on conquering Bantan. The toponym of Bantan is unclear, it might be corresponds to the 10th century site of [[Banten Girang]] in present-day [[Banten]] province of western Java, or might be other place. While other historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. In old Javanese, the term Bantan means \"sacrifice\" which often used interchangeably with Bali that means \"offering\".\n\nThe Mantyasih inscription (11 April 907) revealed the gifts awarded to five junior ''patihs'' (officials) for their service on maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also in 907, in Rukam inscription, Balitung offers that the Sima taxes being collected from the village of Rukam to be allocated for the construction and maintenance of a temple dedicated to his grandmother, Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana. The temple mentioned here is [[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, located not far south from Prambanan, probably was built during the end of Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala) reign and completed in Balitung's reign. The temple is dedicated to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana, linked to Sri Kahulunnan, another name of queen [[Pramodhawardhani]]. This temple probably was a mortuary temple dedicated as ''pedharmaan'' (dedication) for the deceased queen mother.\n\nThe rivalry between Balitung and Daksha was probably a result of the previous contest of succession between Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala)\u2014both are descendants of Rakai Pikatan. During the rule of his brother-in-law\u2014Balitung, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino, according to Taji Gunung inscription (dated 21 December 910), that mentioned about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. It seems that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with his nephew Daksha. Historian Boechari is certain that the reign of Balitung was ended as the result of Mpu Daksha's rebellion. According to Taji Gunung inscription (910) Daksha was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913) he already ascended to the throne as the king. Although the kingdom also enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, after King Balitung, it seems that the construction of grand temples are decreased in both quality and quantity.\n\nDaksha ruled over the centre and the east portions of Java.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|127}} King Daksha (r. 910\u2014919) and his successor King [[Tulodong]] (r. 919\u2014924) also ruled from Poh Pitu. The next monarch, King [[Wawa of Mataram|Wawa]] (r. 924\u2014929) returned the capital back from Poh Pitu to Mataram. The [[Minto Stone|Sanggurah inscription]] (dated 2 August 928)\u2014found in [[Malang]] area in East Java is particularly interesting, since it mentioned about the deed of Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa) that granted the Sima status to the land in and around the source of Brantas river in present-day Batu and Malang area. This means that during the reign of Wawa, the kingdom has expanded eastward by establishing settlements (Sima lands) along the river Bengawan Solo and [[Brantas River|Brantas]].\n\n===Moving eastward===\n[[File:Sambisari 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sambisari]] temple buried five metres under volcanic debris of [[Mount Merapi]].]]\nAround the year 929, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Central Java to East Java by [[Mpu Sindok]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|128}} who established the [[Isyana Dynasty]]. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain. Historians have proposed various possible causes; from natural disaster, epidemic outbreak, politics and power struggle, to religious or economic motives.\n\nAccording to van Bemmelen's theory, which was supported by Prof. Boechari a severe eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] volcano probably has caused the move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\">{{cite news |title = Merapi and the demise of the Mataram kingdom |date = 13 June 2006 |author = Handewi Soegiharto |newspaper = The Jakarta Post |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/13/merapi-and-demise-mataram-kingdom.html |accessdate = 31 August 2015}}</ref> Historians suggest that, some time during the reign of King [[Wawa of Mataram]] (924\u2014929), Merapi volcano erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram. The historic massive volcano eruption is popularly known as ''Pralaya Mataram'' (the debacle of Mataram). The evidence for this eruption can be seen in several temples that were virtually buried under Merapi's [[lahar]] and volcanic debris, such as the [[Sambisari]], Morangan, Kedulan, [[Kadisoka]] and [[Kimpulan]] temples.\n\nArcheologist Agus Aris Munandar proposed a hypothesis, that the move was caused by a religious motives. He mentions that the incessant eruptions of Mount Merapi has caused the kingdom to move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> Pointing out that in ancient Javanese beliefs, Merapi was considered as the [[Mount Meru|Mahameru]] for the people in the ancient Mataram. According to Hindu teachings, the Mahameru peak symbolises the centre of the universe, the sacred realm where the gods live. Since their Mahameru in Central Java continued to erupt, they decided to move, but they still looked for another Mahameru. As East Java was still part of Mataram territory, it is possible that some of the people informed the Central Java kingdom that there was another Mahameru in the east. He suggests that the new sacred mountain was [[Mount Penanggungan]] in East Java, which resembles Mahameru.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis proposed by N.J. Krom says that the demise was caused by an epidemic break-out, forcing people to seek a new place to live.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> On the other hand, B. Schrieke says the move was caused by economic reasons; the vigorous temple construction boom during the era of Sailendran kings has put a tremendous economic burden upon the peasant. People were suffering as they were forced to build grand temples by the kings, instead of working their farms. Slowly they moved to the east to avoid the kings' orders.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nA power struggle is also proposed as the cause of the move. Coedes suggested that the move to East Java was probably in response to the Buddhist [[Sailendra]]s.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|79,90}} This theory is inline with the one proposed by J.G. de Casparis which suggests, that the shift of capital city eastward was to avoid a Srivijaya invasion from Sumatra.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nHowever, it was most likely motivated by economic reasons. De Casparis then expands his theory, saying that the location of the kingdom in Central Java was less accessible than East Java. The [[Brantas]] river valley was considered to be a strategic location, as the river provides easy access to reach ports on East Java's north coast and [[Java Sea]], strategic for the control of maritime trade routes to the eastern parts of archipelago, being especially vital for control of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] spice trade. This is in contrast with Mataram's Kedu and Kewu Plain that relatively isolated from the north coast of Central Java. Despite its fertility, ideal for rice agricultural kingdom, the Mataram Plain is quite isolated, its northern borders are protected by natural barrier of Merapi, Merbabu, Sumbing, Sundoro, Dieng and Ungaran volcanoes. Ideal for inward-looking agricultural polity, but insufficient to develop a maritime trading kingdom.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nThe recent studies suggest, that the move eastward was not an abrupt event. During the Mataram period in Central Java, the kingdom most likely already expanded eastward and established settlements along Brantas river in East Java. It was more likely that the move was done in gradual manner over long period. The cause of the move was also motivated from multiple factors; either natural, economy or politics. The Sanggurah inscription or popularly known as the \"[[Minto Stone]]\", dated to 982 \u2014 found in [[Malang]], East Java in early 19th century \u2014 mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa Wijayaloka<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Verhandelingen van Het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen|volume=60|year=1913| title=Oud-Javaansche Oorkonden.

This suggests that even during the reign of King Wawa, the Malang region in East Java already belongs within the realm of Medang Kingdom. The inscription contains elements about the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.<ref>{{cite book|page=55|title=Handbook of Oriental Studies. Part 3|author=de Longh, R.C.|year=1977| publisher=Brill}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the true reasons behind the move of political centre from Central to East Java, this event marked the end of an era profoundly. Indeed, the temple-building activity has decreased since the era of King Balitung in scale, quality and quantity, and yet the Eastern Java period of Medang kingdom leave no tangible traces of any temple structure comparable to those of the previous Central Javanese Sailendra era. It seems that the kingdom no longer has the intention and the resource to embark on a grand scale construction project.\n\n====Establishing the eastern country====\n[[File:Anjuk Ladang Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Anjukladang inscription]] (937), issued by King Sindok during his power consolidation in East Java.]]\nAccording to [[Turyan inscription]] (dated 929), [[Mpu Sindok|Sindok]] moved the capital to Tamwlang and later moved it again to Watugaluh. Historian identify those names with the Tambelang and Megaluh area near modern [[Jombang Regency|Jombang]], East Java. Although Sindok establishes a new dynasty, the [[Isyana dynasty]] named after his daughter, Sindok seems to be closely related to the royal house of Medang Mataram, thus he can be viewed as the continuation of a long line of Javanese Kings lineage stretched from [[Sri Sanjaya|King Sanjaya]]. During his reign Sindok created quite a number of inscriptions, most are related to the establishment of ''Sima'' lands; these inscriptions are among others; Linggasutan (929), Gulung-Gulung (929), Cunggrang (929), Jru-Jru (930), Waharu (931), Sumbut (931), Wulig (935), and [[Anjuk Ladang inscription|Anjukladang]] (937). Most of these inscription mentioned about the establishment of ''Sima'' or ''Swatantra'' lands. This signify that Sindok seems to consolidated his authority over East Java as collections of villages are declared as ''Sima'' lands, which means the settlements have developed wet rice cultivation and can be taxed and swore allegiance as part of Sindok's kingdom.\n\nThe [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 in particular is interesting, because it stated the ''Sima'' status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a temple is erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in [[Nganjuk Regency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://museumanjukladang.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/prasasti-anjukladang/|title=Prasasti Anjukladang|date=2016-02-13|work=Museum Anjuk Ladang|access-date=2018-05-21|language=id-ID}}</ref> The mentioning of invading ''Malayu'' forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably means [[Srivijaya]] instead. This means the relations between East Javanese Medang kingdom with Srivijaya has badly deteriorated to the state of hostility.\n\n====Expansion to Bali====\n[[File:Buddha Manjucri from Goa Raja cave Bali.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]] from [[Goa Gajah]] cave, Bali, demonstrated the influence of Javanese Medang Mataram Sailendran art.]]\nSindok was succeeded by his daughter [[Isyana Tunggawijaya]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} According to [[Gedangan inscription]] (dated 950), Queen Isyana married to Sri Lokapala, a nobleman from [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]].

According to [[Pucangan inscription]] (dated 1041), King Makutawangsa Wardhana has a daughter named [[Mahendradatta]], Makutawangsa Wardhana was replaced by his son [[Dharmawangsa|Dharmawangsa Tguh]] c. 990s.\n\nA later king, [[Dharmawangsa]], moved the capital again to Wwatan, identified as the Wotan area near modern [[Madiun]]. Dharmawangsa's sister, [[Mahendradatta]] later would be betrothed to a Balinese king [[Udayana Warmadewa]]. This report indicated that somehow [[Bali]] had been absorbed into the Medang Kingdom's mandala sphere of influence, probably as vassal. In literature development, King Dharmawangsa also ordered the translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] in 996.\n\n===Collapse===\nIn the late 10th century, the rivalry between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Mataram became more hostile.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|130}} The animosity was probably caused by the Srivijayan effort to reclaim Sailendra lands in Java, as [[Balaputra]] and his offspring&nbsp;\u2014 a new dynasty of Srivijaya [[maharaja]]s&nbsp;\u2014 belonged to the Sailendra dynasty, or by Medang aspirations to challenge Srivijaya dominance as the regional power.

The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese accounts from Song period. In 988, an envoy from ''San-fo-qi'' (Srivijaya) was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by ''She-po'' (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from ''She-po'' (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders.<ref name=\"Kulke\">{{cite book |title=Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia, Volume 1 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series |editor=Hermann Kulke |editor2=K Kesavapany |editor3=Vijay Sakhuja |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2009 |isbn= 9789812309372 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2swhCXJVRzwC&dq=Dharmawangsa+Srivijaya+envoy+China}}</ref>{{rp|229}}\n\nDharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]] to seek protection from China.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|141}} Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills.

Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple ''Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou'' ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.<ref name=\"Kulke\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nAfter 16 years of war, in 1006, Srivijaya managed to repelled the Medang invaders and liberated Palembang. This attack opened the eyes of the Srivijayan Maharaja to how dangerous the Medang kingdom could be, and he planned to destroy his new Javanese nemesis.\n\n====Mahapralaya====\n[[File:Java, predating Nganjuk style, 10th century - Bodhisattva Padmapani - 1967.149 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddhist bronze figure depicting Boddhisattva Padmapani, 10th-century dated from late period of Medang Kingdom.]]\nIn retaliation, in 1016-1017, Srivijaya forces assisted Haji (king) Wurawari to revolt.

With the absence of Medang paramount ruler, warlords in regional provinces and settlements in central and east Java rebelled and break loose from the central Medang government and forming their own polities serving local dynasties. Raids and robbery were rampant ravaging the country. There was further unrest and violence several years after the kingdom's demise.\n\n[[Airlangga]], a son of King [[Udayana Warmadewa]] of [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] and Queen [[Mahendradatta]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} also a nephew of slain King Dharmawangsa, managed to escape the destruction and went into exile in [[Wonogiri|Vanagiri]] forest in interior Central Java. He later rallied popular support, reunited the remnants of the Medang Kingdom and re-established the kingdom (including Bali) under the name of [[Kingdom of Kahuripan]] in 1019. The Kingdom of Kahuripan can be considered as the successor state of Medang, and from this point on, the kingdom was known as [[Kahuripan]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144\u2013147}} with its capital located near Brantas river estuarine, somewhere around modern Surabaya, Sidoarjo or Pasuruan in East Java.\n\n==The Dynasty==\n\n=== The dual dynasties theory ===\n{{Main|Sanjaya Dynasty}}\nBosch  in his book ''\"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\"'' (1952) suggested that king Sanjaya was the progenitor of the [[Sanjaya Dynasty]], and there was two dynasties that ruled Central Java; the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and the Shivaist Sanjaya dynasty.<ref>Dr. Bosch, \"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\", 1952.</ref> The inscription also states that Sanjaya was an ardent follower of [[Shaivism]]. From its founding in the early 8th century until 928, the kingdom was ruled by the Sanjaya dynasty. The first king was Sanjaya, who ruled in the Mataram region in the vicinity of modern Yogyakarta and Prambanan, and left the written records on the Canggal inscription. However, around the mid 8th century, the [[Sailendra]] dynasty emerged in Central Java and challenged Sanjaya domination in the region.\n\nThe prevailing historical interpretation holds that the Sailendra dynasty co-existed next to the Sanjaya dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterised by peaceful co-operation. The Sailendra, with their strong connections to [[Srivijaya]], managed to gain control of Central Java and become overlords of the ''Rakai'' (local Javanese lords), including the Sanjayas, thus making the Sanjaya kings of Mataram their [[vassal]]s. Little is known about the kingdom due to the dominance of the Sailendra, who during this period constructed [[Borobudur]], a Buddhist monument. [[Samaratungga]], the monarch of the Sailendra, tried to secure the Sailendra position in Java, cementing an alliance with the Sanjayas by arranging the marriage of his daughter [[Pramodhawardhani]] with [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]].\n\nAround the middle of the 9th century, relations between the Sanjaya and the Sailendra deteriorated. In 852, the Sanjaya ruler, Pikatan, defeated [[Balaputra]], the offspring of the Sailendra monarch Samaratunga and the princess Tara. This ended the Sailendra presence in Java; Balaputra retreated to the Srivijayan capital in [[Sumatra]], where he became the paramount ruler.<ref>cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111</ref> The victory of Pikatan was recorded in [[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 856, created by Rakai Kayuwangi, Pikatan's successor.\n\n=== The single dynasty theory ===\n[[File:Borobudur relief 1.jpg|thumb|right|The scene of the Javanese court depicted in Borobudur bas relief]]\n{{Main|Sailendra Dynasty}}\nHowever, this dual Sailendra\u2014Sanjaya dynasties theory proposed by Bosch and De Casparis was opposed by some Indonesian historians in later period. An alternate theory, proposed by [[Poerbatjaraka]], suggests there was only one kingdom and one dynasty, the kingdom called Medang, with the capital in the Mataram area (thus the name of the kingdom: ''\"Medang i Bhumi Mataram\"''), and the ruling dynasty being the [[Sailendra]].\n\nThis theory is supported with Boechari interpretation on [[Sojomerto inscription]] and Poerbatjaraka study on [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript, Poerbatjaraka holds that Sanjaya and all of his offspring belongs to the Sailendra family, which initially was [[Shivaist]] Hindu. However, according to [[Raja Sankhara inscription]] (now missing); Sanjaya's son, Panangkaran, converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. And because of that conversion, the later series of Sailendra kings who ruled Medang become Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists also and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga's reign.<ref>Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254\u2013264</ref> The Shivaist Hindus regained royal patronage with the reign of Pikatan, which lasted until the end of the Medang Kingdom. During the reign of Kings Pikatan and [[Balitung]], the royal Hindu [[Trimurti]] temple of [[Prambanan]] was built and expanded in the vicinity of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].\n\n== Government and economy ==\nThe complex stratified ancient Javan society, with its refined aesthetic taste in art and culture, is evidenced through the various scenes in narrative [[bas-relief]]s carved on various temples dated from the Medang era.\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Hindu Temple in Java, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prambanan]] pr\u0101s\u0101da (towers) viewed from [[Ratu Boko]] hill, the area in [[Prambanan Plain]] was the location of the Mataram capital]] \nDuring this period the common concept of [[city]], as it known in Europe, Middle East or China, as the urban concentration centre of politics, administration, religious and economic activities, was not quite established yet in ancient Java. The proper urban development as a city took place later in 13th century [[Majapahit]]'s [[Trowulan]].\n\nThe capital itself is more likely refer to the [[palace]], a walled compound called ''pura'' in Sanskrit, or in local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''karaton'' or ''kadatwan'', this is where the king and his family reside and rule his court. The palace itself is more of a collection of ''[[pendopo]]'' style pavilions surrounded by walls. These pavilions and halls are made from organic wooden and thatched materials, so they had decayed over centuries leaving only stone walls, gates, terraces and bases. The example of this type of secular buildings can be found in [[Ratu Boko]] compound. The Javanese urban centre in this period did not recognise walled-city as it found in Chinese or Indian counterparts, the only walled, well-guarded and protected compound was the king's palace and temple compound. The ''nagara'' or capital itself was more of a collection of densely populated villages surrounding the ''pura'' (king's palace).\n\nThe religious activity centres, which refer to the location of where the temples stood, did not necessarily signify the administrative or economic centre as well. As according to inscriptions, numbers of lands has been awarded a ''Sima'' status with portion or the whole of its rice tax revenue was allocated to funding the construction and maintaining the temple. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the [[Prambanan Plain]] with high concentration of temples located just few hundred meters away from each other \u2014 [[Sambisari]], [[Kalasan]], [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Lumbung]], [[Prambanan]], [[Plaosan]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Banyunibo]], [[Ratuboko]], Barong and Ijo temples \u2014 was might be the location of the capital of Mataram. Other expert argued that the Prambanan area was indeed the religious centre of the kingdom, but was not the administrative centre, while suggesting other location in [[Muntilan]] as the possible political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\">{{cite book|last=Degroot|first=V\u00e9ronique|title=Candi, Space and Landscape: A Study on the Distribution, Orientation and Spatial Organization of Central Javanese Temple Remains |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HzduME8OcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=85 |location=Leiden|publisher=Sidestone Press, Issue 38 of Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde |isbn=978-9088900396}}</ref>\n\nMost of the time, the court of the Medang Kingdom was located in Mataram, possibly located somewhere in Muntilan or the [[Prambanan Plain]] near modern [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. However, during the reign of Rakai Pikatan, the court was moved to Mamrati. Later, in the reign of Balitung, the court moved again, this time to Poh Pitu. Unlike Mataram, historians have been unable to pinpoint the possible locations of Mamrati and Poh Pitu, although most historians agree that both were located in the [[Kedu Plain]], somewhere around the modern [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] or [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung]] regencies. Later expert suggests that the area in Secang, on the upper Progo river valley in northern Magelang Regency \u2014 with relatively high temple density \u2014 was possibly the secondary political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\"/> In later Eastern Java period, other centres were mentioned; such as Tamwlang and Watugaluh (near Jombang), also Wwatan (near [[Madiun]]).\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The bas relief of 8th century [[Borobudur]] depict the scene in royal court.]]\nDuring this period the administration level of Javanese polity was only consists of two levels; the central government level centred in king's court, and the ''wanua'' or village level took form of settlements scattered around within kingdom's realm. The palace where the King resided was mentioned as ''kadatwan'' or ''karaton'', the court was the centre of kingdom's administration. The ''wanua'' or village is more likely took shape of an \"island\" filled with housings and orchards in the middle of vast [[rice paddies]], this village layout still can be found in modern Javanese ''desa''.\n\nThe King was regarded as the paramount ruler or ''[[chakravartin]]'', where the highest power and authority lies. He ruled the ''nagara'' or ''kadatwan'' which means the kingdom, from his ''puri'' (palace or walled compound). Under the king, there are state officials that serve to forward the king's laws and orders. They are using the title of ''Rakai'' or ''Samget''. The ''Rakais'' ruled an administrative unit called '' watak'' that formed from the collection of several villages or ''wanua''. ''Rakai'' can be considered as regional [[landlord]] or the [[landed gentry]], that rule a large collection of villages. The ''rakais'' transmit the king's order to the ''Rama'' or village leaders that rules their own domain called ''karaman'' or ''watak''. As the kingdom grew larger and complex, entering the 10th century during the reign of [[Balitung]], series of state officials are added to add hierarchy levels.<ref>{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=111 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref>\n\nMost of the inscriptions dated from Medang Mataram period are related to the establishment of ''sima'' lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a ''ladang'' (dry rice cultivation) to ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). A ''sima'' is an arable [[wet rice]] agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these ''sima'' lands are ruled by regional ''rakai'' or ''samget'' (landed gentry) in their realm. By acquiring prestigious ''sima'' status from the king, a ''watak'' regional unit held a higher prestige compared to non-''sima'' settlements, yet this also means acknowledging the kingdom's overlordship over their land and swore their allegiance to the king. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court (central government in the capital). In some instance, some of these ''sima'' inscription stated that this ''sima'' land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a religious building. This means the ''rakai'' that traditionally ruled this lands no longer has the right to collect the tax, or at least reducing their tax earnings.\n\nOther than their administrative and military-defense function, the king and the royal family is also known as the patron of arts and also religious piousness. The king, the royal family and the kingdom's officials had the authority to launch public projects, such as irrigation works or temple construction. The royal art and religious patronage can be seen in sponsoring temples constructions. The kingdom left behind several temples and monuments. The most notable ones are Borobudur, Prambanan, [[Sewu]], and the [[Plaosan]] temple compound.\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebf op de Borobudur TMnr 10027564.jpg|thumb|left|The bas-relief in 8th century [[Borobudur]] depicting rice agriculture in ancient Java]]\nThe common people of Medang mostly made a living in agriculture, especially as [[rice]] farmers, however, some may have pursued other careers, such as hunter, trader, artisan, weaponsmith, sailor, soldier, dancer, musician, food or drink vendor, etc. Rich portrayals of daily life in 9th century Java can be seen in many temple bas-reliefs. Rice cultivation had become the base for the kingdom's economy where the villages throughout the realm relied on their annual rice yield to pay taxes to the court. Exploiting the fertile volcanic soil of Central Java and the intensive wet rice cultivation (''sawah'') enabled the population to grow significantly, which contributed to the availability of labour and workforce for the state's public projects. Certain villages and lands were given the status as ''sima'' lands awarded through royal edict written in inscriptions. The rice yields from ''sima'' lands usually were allocated for the maintenance of certain religious buildings.\n\n[[File:Javanese gold mas or tahil ingot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Earliest evidence of a [[currency]] system in Java. Javanese [[gold]] ''mas'' or ''tahil'' ingots, circa the 9th century.]]\n\nThe economic activity was also not solely centred in a single marketplace in the capital city. It is most likely that the marketplace was rotated in daily basis within a week among participating villages, in a Javanese system called ''pasaran''. This system still can be found in rural Javanese villages, before most are turned into a permanent marketplace as it is commonly found today. The economic trading practice in these marketplace are most likely done in [[barter]] as well as using money, as during this period, Javanese economy has been partly monetised.\n\nThe bas-reliefs from temples of this period, especially from [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] describe occupations and careers other than agricultural pursuit; such as soldiers, government officials, court servants, massage therapists, travelling musicians and dancing troupe, food and drink sellers, logistics courier, sailors, merchants, even thugs and robbers are depicted in everyday life of 9th century Java. These occupations requires economic system that employs [[currency]]. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]], golden artefacts discovered in 1990, revealed gold coins in shape similar to corn seeds, which suggests that 9th century Javan economy is partly monetised. On the surface of the gold coins engraved with a script ''\"ta\"'', a short form of ''\"tail\"'' or ''\"tahil\"'' a unit of currency in ancient Java.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Society ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf Borobudur TMnr 60042617.jpg|thumb|upright|A nobleman accompanied by his entourage and servants, a bas-relief of Borobudur.]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Detail van reli\u00ebf O 105 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015664.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Buddhist]] hermit meditating in secluded forest, Borobudur bas-relief.]]\nA complex and stratified society of ancient Javanese people and their social order can be seen through studies on the rich portrayal in bas-reliefs from this period, as well as inscription studies. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom.<ref name=\"Peradaban35\"/> The ancient Javanese did recognise the Hindu ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|catur varna]]'' or [[caste]] social classes; [[Brahmana]] (priests), [[Kshatriya]] (kings, warlords and nobles), [[Vaishya]] (traders and artisans), and [[Shudra]] (servants and slaves). Nevertheless, the social stratification system in ancient Java slightly differ from those of India, as it less rigid.<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=49\u201350 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n\nPigeaud divides ancient Javanese society into four classes: the ruling class, religious authority, commoners, and slaves.<ref>Pigeaud, 1958: 195</ref> While de Casparis suggest; although the ancient Javanese society recognise caste differences, their rules and implementations was less rigid compared to those caste system in India. De Casparis divides them into three groups:\n# The commoners that formed the majority of kingdom's population.\n# The king with his royal family, including those nobles, landlords and the member of elite ruling class that depends on the king's court and his dynasty. Can be commonly called \"the palace/court people\".\n# The religious figures and religious authorities. The priests class; brahmins and monks, includes the lower rank servants employed in temple compounds and monasteries.<ref>de Casparis, 1954: 56</ref>\n\nBased on the study of the styles and types of clothing and jewelries worn by people depicted in bas-reliefs from the temple \u2014 especially Borobudur reliefs \u2014 the ancient Javanese society roughly can be divided into:<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=55\u201356 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n# '''The nobles''', the king and the royal families, landlords, nobles and those that related to ruling elites. They wore luxurious clothing of ''kain'' long clothes wrapped around their hips to the ankle, waistband, and [[sash]] either wore around their hips as ''sampur'', or wore around their body hanging from left shoulder to the hip. Adorned with intricate golden jewelries such as ''jamang'' (forehead ornaments), ''makuta'' (crown), earrings, ''kelat bahu'' ([[armlet]]), necklace, ''upavita'' (body ornament of golden chains wore across the chest), bracelets, rings, ankle bracelet. The gods and divinities also portrayed in similar fashion as nobles, although they are described as having ''prabhamandala'' (divine [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) around their head.\n# '''The royal servants''' or '''lower-ranked nobles''', they are king's servants, entourages or royal attendants. They occupied positions as ''dayang-dayang'' (female royal attendants), guard or state officials. They wore long cloth around their hips to the ankle, and wore jewelries and ornaments too, such as earrings, necklace and bracelets, although not as complete and luxurious as those worn by the king and the nobles.\n# '''The priests''', the [[brahmin]]s, Buddhist monks, or those religious figures employed in temples or monasteries. They usually wore robes or cloaks called ''sinhel''. Buddhist monks were usually portrayed as bald men wore robe with open right shoulder, while brahmins were usually depicted as bearded men wearing [[turbans]]. \n# '''The commoners''', the majority of the people, mostly described as villagers. They wore simple clothing of around their hips, the lower end sometimes being tied upward to create a short [[loincloth]]. Usually they wore no jewelry or ornaments, but some wore a few simple ornaments, including necklaces or bracelets, or a rope worn as a waistband.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple]]\n\n[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are the two religions adhered by the rulers and people of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the commoners' religious practices were probably still mixed with native [[shamanism]] and indigenous pre-Dharmic beliefs. Since the beginning of its formation, the Medang Mataram kings seemed to favour [[Shivaist]] Hinduism, such as the construction of [[linga]] in Gunung Wukir Hindu temple as mentioned in Canggal inscription by king Sanjaya. However, during the reign of [[Panangkaran]], [[Mahayana]] Buddhism began to blossomed and gain court favour. The [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and the magnificent [[Borobudur]] temples testify the Buddhist renaissance in Central Java. The court patronage on Buddhism spanned from the reign of Panangkaran to [[Samaratungga]]. During the reign of Pikatan, Shivaist Hinduism began to regain court's favour, signified by the construction of grand Shivagrha (Prambanan).\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Mahadewa in de Lara Djonggrang hindoe-tempel te Prambanan TMnr 60033679.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shiva]] statue in main chamber of [[Prambanan]].]]\nThe kingdom recognised the religious authority of priest class, the [[brahmin]]s. Buddhism was also well represented through the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] Buddhist monastic community, consists of [[Buddhist monks]] living in [[vihara]]s such as Sari and Plaosan and gaining court patronage. These Hindu and Buddhist religious authorities conducted state's and regional religious rituals and ceremonies in the temples. The ruling class of [[kshatriya]] royal family also indulged in spiritualism. Some monarch seems to immerse themselves in spiritualism and religion. For example, King Panangkaran seems to be deeply influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and even strive to become a hermit during his later days. Numbers of other kings such as Samaragrawira and Samaratungga was also deeply influenced by Buddhism and strive to become a benevolent leaders. Rakai Pikatan also abdicated and renounced worldly affairs during his old days and become a [[rishi]] hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to the reign of King Balitung (late 8th century to the early 10th century) saw a fervent temple construction in the kingdom. This was probably motivated either by religious zeal, kingdom's immense wealth and resources or social-political reasons. Some historians such as Munoz suggest, that this ardent temple construction projects was actually a religious-political tool to control the regional ''Rakai'' landlords, to prevent them from rebelling against the king.<ref>{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages= |isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}</ref> During this time, each of regional ''watak'' are ruled by ''Rakai'' landlords that nurturing their own dynasty. By appointing the Rakais' ''sima'' land to fund the construction and maintenance of a ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' religious building, the Maharaja depriving the Rakais' ability to collect large sum of tax, that can be potentially misused to fund some army that might rose to challenge the Maharaja's authority. The Rakais might be willingly or reluctantly compliant to the king's will, for refusing to construct religious building might harm their reputation, and cast them not only as the enemy of the king, but also as the enemy of gods or Buddha.\n\n=== Art and Architecture ===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Wonoboyo Hoard.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] displays the immense wealth and artistic achievement of the Medang kingdom.]]\nOther than examining bas-reliefs carved on the temple's walls, the study of ancient Javanese society is also conducted through archaeological relics. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] golden artefacts attest to the wealth, art, and culture as well as the aesthetic achievement of the Medang Kingdom. The artefacts show the intricate artwork and technical mastery of the ancient Javanese [[goldsmith]]. The hoard was estimated to date from the reign of King Balitung.<ref name=\"tempo\">{{cite web|url=http://majalah.tempointeraktif.com/id/arsip/1990/11/03/ILT/mbm.19901103.ILT19845.id.html |title=Warisan Saragi Diah Bunga|publisher=Majalah Tempo|date=3 November 1990 |accessdate=21 July 2010}}</ref> The treasure has been identified as belonging to a noble or a member of the royal family.<ref name=\"graf\">[http://www.grafico-qld.com/exhibition/i_gold.htm \"Indonesian Gold\" Treasures from the National Museum Jakarta], grafico-qld.com, accessed July 2010</ref>\n\nThe earliest temple in the Southern Central Java Mataram region was the Hindu Shivaist [[Gunung Wukir]] temple, linked to [[Canggal inscription]] (732 CE) built by [[Sanjaya of Mataram|King Sanjaya]]. Almost 50 years later the oldest Buddhist temple was built in Prambanan region, the Buddhist [[Kalasan]] temple, linked to [[Kalasan inscription]] (778 CE) and King [[Panangkaran]]. From this time, the kingdom saw exuberant temple construction projects, such as [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Lumbung]], [[Ngawen]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and peaked in the construction of [[Borobudur]], the massive stone [[mandala]], that took shape of a mountain temple pinnacled with [[stupa]]s that completed c. 825 CE.\n\n[[File:Prambanan Shiva Temple.jpg|thumb|left|The magnificent 9th century Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]], [[Yogyakarta]], was a major Hindu monument in the kingdom of Medang.]]\n\nThe monumental Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] in the vicinity of Yogyakarta&nbsp;\u2014 initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838\u2014850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850\u2014890) to [[Balitung]] (899\u2013911)&nbsp;\u2014 is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near the temple (Opak river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in [[Shivagrha inscription]]. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the ''[[Trimurti]]'', the three highest gods in the Hindu [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in [[Indonesia]], evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.\n\nOther Hindu temples dated from Medang Mataram Kingdom era are: [[Sambisari]], [[Gebang Temple|Gebang]], Barong, Ijo, and Morangan. Although the Shivaist regain the favour, Buddhist remain under royal patronage. The Sewu temple dedicated for [[Manjusri]] according to [[Kelurak inscription]] was probably initially built by Panangkaran, but later expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, whom married to a Buddhist princess [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of Samaratungga. Most of their subjects retained their old religion; Shivaists and Buddhists seemed to co-exist in harmony. The Buddhist temple of [[Plaosan]], [[Banyunibo]] and [[Sajiwan]] were built during the reign of King Pikatan and Queen Pramodhawardhani, probably in the spirit of religious reconciliation after the succession disputes between Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani against [[Balaputra]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016190.jpg|thumb|Bas relief in [[Prambanan]] depicting a scene taken from [[Ramayana]]. The translation of Indian epic into Javanese [[Kakawin Ramayana]] took place during Medang Mataram kingdom.]]\n\nFrom the 9th to mid 10th centuries, the Medang Kingdom witnessed the blossoming of art, culture and literature, mainly through the translation of Hindu-Buddhist sacred texts and the transmission and adaptation of Hindu-Buddhist ideas into Old Javanese text and visual bas-reliefs rendering. The bas-relief carved on each sides of [[Mendut]] temple stairs and also on the base of [[Sojiwan]] temple for example, narrating the popular [[Jataka]] Buddhist tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The [[Borobudur]] bas-relief particularly, contains the most complete rendering of Buddhist sacred texts. Ranged from [[Karma]]vibhanga (the law of [[karma]]), [[Lalitavistara]] (the story of the Buddha), the tale of [[Manohara]], [[Jataka]] and Jatakamala, [[Avadana]] (collection of virtuous deeds) and [[Gandavyuha]] ([[Sudhana]]'s quest for the ultimate truth).\n\nThe bas-relief narration of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and also was carved on the wall of Prambanan temple's Shiva and Brahma temples, while the stories of [[Krishna]] taken from [[Bhagavata Purana]] was carved on Vishnu temple. During this period, the [[Kakawin Ramayana|Kakawin ''Ramayana'']], an old [[Javanese language|Javanese]] rendering was written. This Kakawin Ramayana, also called the ''Yogesvara Ramayana'', is attributed to the scribe Yogesvara c. the 9th century CE, who was employed in the court of the Medang in Central Java. It has 2774 [[stanza]]s in the ''manipravala'' style, a mixture of Sanskrit and [[Kawi language|archaic Javanese prose]]. The most influential version of the ''Ramayana'' is the ''Ravanavadham'' of [[Bhatti]], popularly known as ''Bhattikavya''. The Javanese ''Ramayana'' differs markedly from the original Hindu.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\nMedang kingdom had an exceptionally intense relations with the regional hegemon [[Srivijaya]] of Sumatra. In earlier period, the relations was close and intimate, as Sailendran kings of Java has formed an alliance with Maharaja of Srivijaya and the two royal houses seems to be merged. In later period however, the relations was deteriorated to warfare, as Dharmawangsa launched failed attempt to capture Palembang, and Srivijaya well-crafted retaliation ensued. In its eastern boundary, the Medang kingdom seems to subjugate the neighboring [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]], and pulled the island into its sphere of influence.\n{{multiple image|align=right|perrow=2|total_width=500|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|width1=131|image2=Bakong 01.jpg|width2=131|footer=Comparison between left: [[Borobudur]] of Java (825) and right: [[Bakong]] of Cambodia (881), both temples had similar basic design of [[stepped pyramid]] and similar corbelling method, which suggest there was a connection of influence between ancient Java and Cambodia.}}\n\nThe Khmer art and architecture during the formative early [[Angkor]] era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art and architecture; the striking similarity of the [[Bakong]] temple in [[Cambodia]] to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design.

By incorporating Hindu-Buddhist frame of reference and elements into their culture, art and architecture, and by [[Sanskritization]] their language, Javanese has formulating their own Hindu-Buddhist Javanese style and developing an ingenious civilisation. This Javanese style of Sailendran art, either in sculpture and architecture, in return influenced regional arts, particularly the Srivijayan art in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.\n\n[[File:RamanyanaBallet.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wayang Wong|Javanese]] [[Ramayana Ballet]] performance in [[Prambanan]] open air stage.

The [[India]]ns collectively called them as ''Yawadvipa'', the [[Khmer Empire|Khmer]] refer to them as ''Chvea'', the [[China|Chinese]] called them as ''Shepo'', ''Chopo'' or ''Chao-wa'', the Arabs called them as ''Jawi'' or ''Jawah'', and Srivijayan refer to them as ''Bhumijava''. The native [[Javanese people|Javanese]] most often refer to their lands and country simply as ''Jawi'' (Java), while the name of their ''nagara'' (country) is often based on their capital. The only foreign source mentioning ''Mda\u03b7'' was found from the [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription|Philippines inscription]], dated 822 saka (900).<ref>{{cite web | title=The Laguna Copper-Plate Inscription: Text and Commentary | first=Postma | last=Antoon | url=http://ojs.philippinestudies.net/index.php/ps/article/download/1033/1018 | publisher=Philippine Studies, Ateneo de Manila University | location=Loyola Heights, Quezon City, the Philippines | page=186 | accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref>\n[[File:Panoramic views of Borobudur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Borobudur]], the largest single Buddhist structure in the world, one of the monuments constructed by the [[Shailendra dynasty|Sailendran]] of the Medang Kingdom.|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nThere are no comprehensive written records that have survived in Java except numbers of ''prasasti'' (inscriptions) written on stones or copper plates. These inscriptions most often recorded the political and religious deeds of the rulers. The most common theme mentioned in inscriptions is the establishment of ''Sima'' (taxed rice cultivation land recognised through royal edict), and sometimes some portion or the whole of tax collected from this ''Sima'' land is appointed to fund the construction and maintenance of [[Candi of Indonesia|religious building]]. Nevertheless, some local legends and historical records, written on ''[[Palm-leaf manuscript|lontar]]''\u2014most often dated from later period\u2014might also provides data and source to reconstruct the historical event.\n[[File:Shivagrha Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 778 Saka (856 CE), one of the historical source dated from the Medang Mataram Kingdom.]]\n\nNative [[Javanese mythology]] and beliefs composed in the [[Mataram Sultanate]] era (circa 17th century), but probably originating from an earlier period, mentioned a semi-mythological kingdom named [[Medang Kamulan]], which in Javanese translates to \"Medang the origin\" kingdom. The kingdom is mentioned in the myth of [[Dewi Sri]] and also [[Aji Saka]]. This is probably the remnant of vague native Javanese collective memory of the existence of an ancient kingdom called \"Medang\".\n\nCurrent knowledge of historical Javanese civilisation is thus primarily derived from:\n* ''Archaeological excavations'', reconstruction and investigation of ancient structures, especially ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' (temples), and also the discovery of ancient relics, such as the [[Wonoboyo hoard]].\n* ''Stone inscriptions'', most common are those which mention the foundation and funding of temples which report on the political and religious deeds of the kings, or stating their lineage; the most notable are the [[Canggal inscription|Canggal]], [[Kalasan inscription|Kalasan]], [[Shivagrha inscription|Shivagrha]] and [[Mantyasih inscription|Balitung charter]].\n* ''[[Bas relief]]s'' in a series of temple walls with depictions of life in the palace, village, temple, ship, marketplace and also the everyday lives of the population. The most notable are the bas reliefs found on Borobudur and Prambanan temple.\n* ''Native [[Palm-leaf manuscript|manuscripts]]'' mentioning stories of kings, their deeds and exploits, that somehow link across to accounts mentioned in stone inscriptions. The notable example is the [[Carita Parahyangan]].\n* ''Reports and chronicles'' of foreign diplomats, traders and travellers, mainly from Chinese, Indian, and Arab sources.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Prambanan Complex 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Prambanan]] temple compound originally consisted of hundreds of temples, built and expanded in the period between the reign of Pikatan and Balitung|alt=|right|220x220px]]\nInitially, the kingdom was identified only through its location '''Yawadvipa''' ([[Java]] island) as mentioned in [[Canggal inscription]] (732). The inscription mentioned ''Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya'' (King Sanjaya, the Rakai (lord) of Mataram). The earlier historians such as [[Soekmono]], identify this kingdom as '''Mataram''', a historic geographical name to identify the plain south of [[Mount Merapi]] in central Java, roughly corresponds to modern [[Muntilan]] (where the Canggal temple on [[Gunung Wukir]] hill is located), [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]], [[Sleman Regency|Sleman]] and [[Bantul Regency]]. This is based on the locations where large numbers of [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] were discovered in and around [[Prambanan Plain]]. The etymology of the name \"Mataram\" derived from a Sanskrit term for \"mother\".<ref>{{cite web | title = Mataram | work = Sanskrit dictionary | url = http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?beginning=0+&tinput=mataram&trans=Translate}}</ref>\n\nThe name '''Medang''' appear later in East Javanese inscriptions such as [[Anjukladang inscription]] (937) and [[Minto Stone]] (982), Paradah inscription and some inscriptions discovered in Surabaya. As the result, historians tends to identify the Eastern Java period (929\u20141006) of this kingdom as ''Medang'' to differ it with its earlier Central Java period of ''Mataram'' (732\u2014929). However, by examining the phrase in Anjukladang inscription mentioning: ''\"Kita prasiddha mangrakpa kadatwan rahyang ta i Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' suggests that the name ''Mda\u014b'' (read: Mdang or Medang) was already used earlier in Central Java period. The phrase ''\"Mda\u014b i Bh\u00fbmi Matar\u00e2m\"'' literally means \"Medang in the land of Mataram\", which means the kingdom name is Medang with its capital in Mataram.<ref>{{cite book|title=Menuju Puncak Kemegahan|author=Slamet Muljana\n|url=https://books.google.com/?id=XPLpH5LOZLsC&pg=PA84&lpg=PA84&dq=Medang+Anjukladang#v=onepage&q=Medang%20Anjukladang&f=false|page=84|language=Indonesian|publisher=LKiS|accessdate=3 March 2014|isbn=9789798451355\n|year=2005\n}}</ref> The etymology of the name \"Medang\" might be derived from a local name of the hardwood \"medang\" tree which refer to trees of the genus ''[[Phoebe (plant)|Phoebe]]''.<ref>{{cite web | work = KBBI | title = Medang | url = http://kbbi.web.id/medang}}</ref> However, another etymological approach suggests that it might derived from old Javanese term \"medang\" which means \"gracefully appear\". It might be related to a Javanese term \"medal\" which means \"going out\", and Sundanese term \"midang\" which refer to dress up and appear gracefully in public.<ref>{{cite web | title = Midang | work = Kamus Daerah | url = http://www.kamusdaerah.com/?bhs=a&bhs2=m&q=1%20ngageulis%202%20midang.}}</ref>\n\nThe court moved several times after Mataram (reign of Sanjaya) to Mamrati or Amrati (reign of Rakai Pikatan), Poh Pitu (reign of Balitung), again to Bhumi Mataram (reign of Dyah Wawa), Tamwlang (reign of Sindok), Watugaluh (reign of Sindok), and last to Wwatan (reign of Dharmawangsa Teguh).\n\nThe name \"Mataram\" reappeared again later in the 14th century as one of [[Majapahit]]'s province. Later in the 16th century appeared the Islamic [[Mataram Sultanate]] located in the same area in Yogyakarta vicinity. As the result, earlier historian also named this kingdom as '''Hindu Mataram''' or '''Ancient Mataram''' to differ it with later Islamic Mataram Sultanate.\n\nThis historic Javanese Kingdom of Mataram should not be confused with the [[Mataram (city)|Mataram city]] located on [[Lombok]] island, currently the capital of [[West Nusa Tenggara]] province. The latter was actually the royal capital of the Cakranegara, a branch of [[Bali]]nese [[Kingdom of Karangasem|Karangasem]] nobles that colonize Lombok in early 19th century. Indeed, Lombok's Mataram city was named after the historic region of Mataram in Java, as it is a common practice for [[Balinese people|Balinese]] to name their settlements after their Javanese Majapahit heritage.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and growth===\n[[File:Canggal inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Canggal inscription (732), created by King Sanjaya.]]\nThe earliest account of the Medang Mataram Kingdom is in the [[Canggal inscription]], dated 732, discovered within the compound of [[Gunung Wukir]] temple in Canggal village, southwest of the town of [[Magelang]]. This inscription, written in [[Sanskrit]] using the [[Pallava]] script, tells of the erection of a ''[[Lingam|lingga]]'' (a symbol of [[Shiva]]) on the hill in the Kunjarakunja area, located on a noble island called Yawadwipa (Java) which was blessed with abundance of rice and gold. The establishment of lingga was under the order of [[Sri Sanjaya|Rakai Mataram Sang Ratu Sanjaya]] (King Sanjaya Rakai (lord) of Mataram). This inscription tells that Yawadwipa was ruled by [[King Sanna]], whose long reign was marked by wisdom and virtue. After Sanna died, the kingdom fell into disunity.

And yet it seems to be the continuation of earlier polity ruled by King Sanna, Sanjaya's uncle. This earlier polity is linked to the earlier [[Dieng temples|temple structures]] in [[Dieng Plateau]], in the northern part of Central Java, which is the oldest surviving structure found in Central Java. The earlier kingdom linked as the predecessor of Medang Mataram kingdom is [[Kalingga]], located somewhere in Central Java northern coast.\n\nThe story of Sanna and Sanjaya are also described in the ''[[Carita Parahyangan]]'', a book from a later period composed around late 16th-century, which mainly describes the history of Pasundan (the [[Sunda Kingdom]]). This book mentions that Sanna was defeated by [[Purbasora]], King of [[Galuh]], and retreated to [[Mount Merapi]]. Later, Sanjaya reclaimed Sanna's kingdom and ruled [[West Java]], Central Java, East Java, and [[Bali]]. He also battled the [[Melayu Kingdom|Malayu]] and [[Keling]] (against their king, Sang Srivijaya). Although the manuscript seems to be romanticised, vague and not providing certain details on the period, nevertheless the almost exact name and theme of the story with historical Canggal inscription seems to confirm that the manuscript was based or inspired from the historical event.\n\n===Golden age===\n[[File:Javanese - The Buddhist Goddess Tara - Walters 572282.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The 9th century Central Javanese gold and silver image of the Mahayana Buddhist goddess [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]]]]\nThe period between the reign of King [[Panangkaran]] to King [[Balitung]] (span between 760\u2014910) that roughly lasted for 150 years, marked the apogee of Javanese classic civilisation. This period witnessed the blossoming of Javanese art and architecture, as numbers of majestic temples and monuments were erected and dominated the skyline of [[Kedu Plain|Kedu]] and [[Kewu Plain]]. Most notable of these temples are [[Sewu]], [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] temple. The [[Sailendra]]s are known as the ardent temple builder.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89\u201390}}\n\nKing Sanjaya was a Shivaist, and yet his successor Panangkaran was a Mahayana Buddhist.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|89}} This shift of faith, from Shivaist Sanjaya to Buddhist Panangkaran has raised problematic questions among scholars; whether there were two competing royal families that dominated the political landscapes in Central Java, that each are patrons of either Shivaist Hindu or Mahayana Buddhism. Or more recently suggested theory, that there were only one dynasty\u2014the [[Sailendra]]s\u2014and there was only the shift or split of royal patronage in favour to Hinduism or Buddhism.\n\n====The great builder====\n[[File:Kalasan Temple from the south-south-east, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|The construction of [[Kalasan]] temple was mentioned in [[Kalasan inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]].]]\n\n[[Panangkaran]] (r. 760\u2014780) was an enthusiastic developer, he was credited for at least five major temple projects conducted and started during his reign. According to the [[Kalasan inscription]], dated 778 and written in the Pranagari script in Sanskrit, the [[Candi Kalasan|Kalasan]] temple was erected by the will of ''Guru Sang Raja Sailendravam\u00e7atilaka'' (the teacher of the ornament of Sailendra family), who persuaded [[Panangkaran]] (Sanjaya's successor) to construct a holy building for the goddess (''boddhisattvadevi'') [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] and build a [[vihara]] ([[monastery]]) for Buddhist monks from the Sailendra realm. Panangkaran also awarded Kala\u00e7a village to a ''[[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]]'' (Buddhist monastic community).<ref>{{cite book | author=Soetarno, Drs.

The king however, never saw the completion of this grand temple complex, as it finished in 792, long after his death probably around 780. This massive temple complex with total of 249 structures was the grandest of its time, and probably served as the official state's temple that conducted important stately religious ceremonies.<ref>{{Citation|work=Harian Kompas via Youtube|title=Candi Sewu Mandala Suci Manjusrigrha|author1=Gunawan Kartapranata|author2=Septa Inigopatria|author3=Emille Junior|date=2015-04-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riCSpUwgoJQ|access-date=2018-09-08}}</ref>\n\n====The great conqueror====\n[[File:Candi Sewu viewed from the south, 23 November 2013.jpg|thumb|left|The construction of [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple was mentioned in [[Manjusrigrha inscription]], under the auspices of King [[Panangkaran]] and completed during [[Dharanindra]] reign.]]\nThere are some reports that naval Javanese raiders invaded [[T\u0129nh H\u1ea3i qu\u00e2n|Tran-nam]] in 767, [[Champa]] in 774, and Champa again in 787.<ref name=Maspero>{{cite book|author=Maspero, G.|year=2002|title=The Champa Kingdom|location=Bangkok| publisher=White Lotus Co., Ltd.|isbn=9747534991|page=48,166,50}}</ref> The successor of Panangkaran was [[Dharanindra]] (r. 780\u2014800) or commonly known as King Indra. He was mentioned in [[Kelurak inscription]] (dated 782) in his formal reign name Sri Sanggrama Dhananjaya. In this inscription he was hailed as ''Wairiwarawiramardana'' or \"the slayer of courageous enemies\". The similar title also found in [[Ligor inscription|Ligor B inscription]] discovered in Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula; ''Sarwwarimadawimathana'', which suggest it referred to the same person. Dharanindra seems to be a valiant and warlike character, as he embarked on military naval expedition overseas and has brought Sailendras' control on [[Ligor]] in Malay Peninsula.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|91\u201392}}\n\nKing Indra seems to continue the builder tradition of his predecessor. He continued the construction of Manjusrigrha temple ([[Sewu]] complex), and  according to the [[Karangtengah inscription]] (dated 824) responsible for the construction of Venuvana temple, connected to [[Mendut]] or probably [[Ngawen]] temple. He was also probably responsible for the conception and initiation of the construction of [[Borobudur]] and [[Pawon]] temple.\n\nDharanindra ascends as the Maharaja of [[Srivijaya]]. The nature of Sailendras' close relations with the neighbouring Srivijayan empire based on Sumatra is quite uncertain and complicated. It seems that in earlier times, Sailendra family belonged within Srivijayan [[Mandala (Southeast Asian political model)|mandala sphere of influence]]. And for later period of time Sailendras' monarch rose to become the head of Srivijayan mandala. The shift that rendered Sailendras in return to become the ruler of Srivijaya was unclear. Was it led by military campaign by Dharanindra against Srivijaya in Sumatra, or more likely formed by close alliance and kinship between the house of Sailendra and the Maharaja of Srivijaya.\n[[File:LCI.jpg|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (circa 900 CE) from the Laguna de Bay area in Luzon, the Philippines.

He appointed the [[Khmer people|Khmer]] prince [[Jayavarman II|Jayavarman]] as the governor of [[Indrapura (Khmer)|Indrapura]] in the Mekong delta under Sailendran rule. This decision was proven as a mistake, as Jayavarman later revolted, moved his capital further inland north from [[Tonle Sap]] to [[Mahendraparvata]], severed the link and proclaimed [[Khmer Empire|Cambodian]] independence from Java in 802. Samaragrawira was mentioned as the king of Java that married T\u0101r\u0101, daughter of [[Dharmasetu]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} He was mentioned as his other name Rakai Warak in [[Mantyasih inscription]].\n\nEarlier historians, such as [[N. J. Krom]], and Coedes, tend to equate Samaragrawira and [[Samaratungga]] as the same person.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|92}} However, later historians such as [[Slamet Muljana]] equate Samaratungga with Rakai Garung, mentioned in Mantyasih inscription as the fifth monarch of Mataram kingdom. Which means Samaratungga was the successor of Samaragrawira.\n\n[[Samaratungga]] (r. 819\u2013838) was credited for the completion of massive stone [[mandala]], the grand monument of [[Borobudur]] (completed in 825). Samaratungga just like Samaragrawira, seems to be deeply influenced by peaceful Mahayana Buddhist beliefs and strive to become a pacifist and a benevolent ruler. His successor was Princess [[Pramodhawardhani]] that betrothed to Shivaite [[Rakai Pikatan]], son of the influential Rakai Patapan, a landlord in Central Java. The political move that seems as an effort to secure peace and Sailendran rule on Java by reconciling the Mahayana Buddhist with Shivaist Hindus.\n\nThe rule of Shivaist [[Rakai Pikatan]] (r. 838\u2013850) and his Buddhist queen consort Pramodhawardhani marked the return of the Medang Mataram court favour to Shivaist Hindu,<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}} instead of Mahayana Buddhism favoured by previous king Samaratungga. This is evident in the construction of grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound in the Mataram capital, located only few hundred meters south from [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]] temple compound. Nevertheless, the inter-religious relations during Pikatan's reign seems to promote tolerance in the spirit of reconciliation. Their reign is credited to the construction and expansion of at least two of perwara temple and [[stupa]] in [[Plaosan]] complex, located east from Sewu (Manjusrigrha) temple. Plaosan temple with twin main temples is probably built and dated from an earlier period, probably started by Panangkaran, Samaragrawira or Samaratungga, but completed during Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani's reign.\n\n====The divide====\n[[File:Ratuboko Gate.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ratu Boko]], a fortified hill, probably referred in [[Shivagrha inscription]] as the location of a battle.]]\n[[Balaputra]] however, opposed the rule of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani. The relations between Balaputra and Pramodhawardhani is interpreted differently by some historians. Older theory according to Bosch and De Casparis holds that Balaputra was the son of Samaratungga, which means he was the younger brother of Pramodhawardhani. Later historians such as Muljana on the other hand, argued that Balaputra was the son of Samaragrawira and the younger brother of Samaratungga, which means he was the uncle of Pramodhawardhani.<ref name=\"Srivijaya21\">{{cite book | author=Muljana, Slamet | title=Sriwijaya | publisher=Yogyakarta: LKiS |year=2006 | page=21 | language=Indonesian | isbn=979-8451-62-7}}</ref>\n\nIt is not known whether Balaputra was expelled from Central Java because of succession dispute with Pikatan, or was he already ruled in [[Suvarnabhumi|Suvarnadvipa]] (Sumatra). Either ways, it seems that Balaputra eventually ruled the Sumatran branch of Sailendra dynasty and enthroned in [[Srivijaya]]n capital of [[Palembang]]. Historians argued that this was because Balaputra's mother\u2014Tara, the queen consort of King Samaragrawira was the princess of Srivijaya, this rendered Balaputra as the heir of Srivijayan throne. Balaputra the Maharaja of Srivijaya later stated his claim as the rightful heir of Sailendra dynasty from Java, as proclaimed in [[Nalanda inscription]] dated 860.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|108}}\n\nThe [[Shivagrha inscription]] (dated 856) mentioned about a war challenging Pikatan's reign, the inscription however did not mention who was the enemy that challenged Pikatan's authority. The earlier historians suggests that it was Balaputradewa that rose against Pikatan, however later historians suggest it was another enemy, argued by that time Balaputra already ruled in Srivijaya. The Shivagrha inscription only mentioned that the battle happened in a fortress on a hill protected by bulk of stone walls, this fortress hill is identified with [[Ratu Boko]] archaeological site. The eldest children of Pikatan and Pramodhawardhani was Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu. Eventually the revolt was successfully defeated by Pikatan's youngest son\u2014the valiant Dyah Lokapala also known as Rakai Kayuwangi. As the reward for his heroic deed and bravery, the people and many of Pikatan's state advisors urged that Lokapala should be named as crown prince instead of Gurunwangi. Gurunwangi's loss of favour in succession\u2014despite being the eldest sibling, has raised a question among scholars. It was previously thought that the name Rakai Gurunwangi Dyah Saladu refer to a female character (princess), although it is more likely that Gurunwangi was a prince.\n\nThis revolt seems to have succeeded in taking over the capital in Mataram for a certain period. After defeating the usurper, Pikatan found that this bloodshed has made the capital in Mataram inauspicious, thus he moved the karaton (court) to Mamrati or Amrati located somewhere in Kedu Plain (Progo river valley), northwest from Mataram.\n\nLater Pikatan decided to abdicate his throne in favour of his youngest son Dyah Lokapala (r. 850\u2014890). Rakai Pikatan retired, renounce worldly affairs and become a hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat. The event also marked with the consecrated ceremony of Shiva image in [[Prambanan]] main temple. Boechari suggests that the enemy that challenged Pikatan was Rakai Walaing pu Kumbhayoni, a powerful Shivaist landlord and also the branch of the ruling dynasty as he claimed as the descendant of a king that ruled Java.<ref name=\"SNI-II:Zaman Kuno\">{{cite book |author1=Marwati Djoened Poesponegoro |author2=Nugroho Notosusanto | title=Sejarah Nasional Indonesia: Zaman Kuno | date=2008 | publisher=Balai Pustaka | isbn=978-9794074084 | language=Indonesian |oclc=318053182 }}</ref>{{rp|159}}\n\n====The short peace====\nThe Medang Mataram kings after [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]]; from Lokapala, Watuhumalang (r. 890\u2014898) and [[Balitung]] are the patrons of Shivaist Hindu, \"after the decline of the power of the Buddhist Sailendras in central Java.\"<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|125\u2013127}} Their reign seems to enjoyed a relative peace. The grand [[Prambanan|Shivagrha]] temple compound are continuously expanded and completed with hundreds of perwara (complementary) temples surrounding the main three prasada (tower) of [[Trimurti]] Hindu Gods. It is probably during their reign that some Hindu temples are constructed in the area, such as [[Sambisari]], [[Barong temple|Barong]], [[Ijo temple|Ijo]], [[Kedulan]], [[Kimpulan]], [[Kadisoka]], [[Gebang]] and [[Merak temple]]. Barong and Ijo temples in particular are interesting, for they are built on the hill and has different layout compared to earlier temples. Sewu and Prambanan temples are arranged in concentric mandala layout. Barong and Ijo temples however, are arranged in completely different way; the main temple is located in further back of the compound on the most higher ground, while the perwara complementary temples are built in front of the main temple on the lower ground, the layout corresponds to the uneven topography of the site. This style of temple layout is most likely the predecessor and will be continued in the later East Javanese temple architecture.\n\nKing Pikatan, Lokapala (Rakai Kayuwangi), and Watuhumalang ruled from their court in Mamrati or Amrati, they are known as \"Amrati Kings\". The exact location of Mamrati is unknown, suggested somewhere in [[Kedu Plain]] (modern day [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] and [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung regencies]]), located north from Mataram along [[Progo River]] valley. It was suggested that Amrati might be located near the location of Wanua Tengah III inscription, in Kedunglo hamlet, Kaloran village, within [[Temanggung Regency]].\n\nAfter absent for several generations, the name \"Mataram\" reappears in Javanese inscription during the reign of Balitung, which probably signify the transfer of capital. King Balitung moved his capital from Amrati to Poh Pitu, and renamed Poh Pitu as Yawapura. Again the exact location of this capital is unknown, probably also located within Kedu Plain. However, it is highly possible that Poh Pitu was located around the Poh inscription (905), in Dumpoh hamlet, Potrobangsan [[Villages of Indonesia|village]], North Magelang district within [[Magelang]] city. Balitung productively issued several inscriptions, among others are Telahap inscription (dated 11 September 899), Watukura inscription (27 July 902), Telang (11 January 904), Poh (17 July 905), Kubu-Kubu (17 October 905),  Mantyasih (11 April 907), and Rukam (907).\n\nOur current knowledge of the names of kings that reign the Medang Mataram kingdom is much owed to [[Mantyasih inscription]] (dated 907), issued by King [[Balitung]] (r. 898\u2014910)\u2014that contains genealogy and the reign order of Medang Mataram kings, and he seek ancestor as far as King Sanjaya. This inscription is also known as \"Balitung charter\". The motivation of Balitung's edict has sparked various assumptions from historians\u2014as if Balitung eagerly seeks legitimacy of his rule, by stating his ancestral lineage. It is highly possible that he related to the royal family and shared common ancestry. Thus, suggested that he married to the daughter of previous king, which made him the royal son in-law as well as heir.\n\nThe Watukura inscription (902) is the oldest inscription in Javanese statecraft that mentioned the position of Rakryan Kanuruhan (Prime Minister), while the position of Rakryan Mapatih\u2014which in Balitung's era is equivalent to [[crown prince]], was held by Mpu Daksa. The relation between Balitung and his successor Daksha is quite problematic, as historians suggested Daksha was the son of previous king (Watuhumalang), while the court was held by Balitung who is probably Dakhsa's brother in-law. The Telang inscription, dated 11 January 904, revealed the development of the port complex of Paparahuan which was led by Rakai Welar Mpu Sudarsana, located on the bank of [[Solo River|Bengawan Solo river]]. By building port and ferry crossing in navigable Bengawan Solo, might signify the growing interest in maritime trade, thus the court interest has shifted eastward.\n\nThe Kubu-Kubu inscription (17 October 905) revealed the village Kubu-kubu was awarded to Rakryan Hujung Dyah Mangarak and Rakryan Matuha Dyah Majawuntan in recognition of their valor on conquering Bantan. The toponym of Bantan is unclear, it might be corresponds to the 10th century site of [[Banten Girang]] in present-day [[Banten]] province of western Java, or might be other place. While other historians speculated that Bantan might be an alternative name to [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. In old Javanese, the term Bantan means \"sacrifice\" which often used interchangeably with Bali that means \"offering\".\n\nThe Mantyasih inscription (11 April 907) revealed the gifts awarded to five junior ''patihs'' (officials) for their service on maintained peace during Balitung's wedding. Also in 907, in Rukam inscription, Balitung offers that the Sima taxes being collected from the village of Rukam to be allocated for the construction and maintenance of a temple dedicated to his grandmother, Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana. The temple mentioned here is [[Sajiwan]] Buddhist temple, located not far south from Prambanan, probably was built during the end of Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala) reign and completed in Balitung's reign. The temple is dedicated to Nini Haji Rakryan Sanjiwana, linked to Sri Kahulunnan, another name of queen [[Pramodhawardhani]]. This temple probably was a mortuary temple dedicated as ''pedharmaan'' (dedication) for the deceased queen mother.\n\nThe rivalry between Balitung and Daksha was probably a result of the previous contest of succession between Rakai Gurunwangi and Rakai Kayuwangi (King Lokapala)\u2014both are descendants of Rakai Pikatan. During the rule of his brother-in-law\u2014Balitung, Mpu Daksa held the position as Rakai Hino, according to Taji Gunung inscription (dated 21 December 910), that mentioned about the partition of Taji Gunung area between him and Rakai Gurunwangi. It seems that Rakai Gurunwangi allied himself with his nephew Daksha. Historian Boechari is certain that the reign of Balitung was ended as the result of Mpu Daksha's rebellion. According to Taji Gunung inscription (910) Daksha was still as Rakai Hino, while in the stele of Timbangan Wungkal (913) he already ascended to the throne as the king. Although the kingdom also enjoyed relative peace and prosperity, after King Balitung, it seems that the construction of grand temples are decreased in both quality and quantity.\n\nDaksha ruled over the centre and the east portions of Java.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|127}} King Daksha (r. 910\u2014919) and his successor King [[Tulodong]] (r. 919\u2014924) also ruled from Poh Pitu. The next monarch, King [[Wawa of Mataram|Wawa]] (r. 924\u2014929) returned the capital back from Poh Pitu to Mataram. The [[Minto Stone|Sanggurah inscription]] (dated 2 August 928)\u2014found in [[Malang]] area in East Java is particularly interesting, since it mentioned about the deed of Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa) that granted the Sima status to the land in and around the source of Brantas river in present-day Batu and Malang area. This means that during the reign of Wawa, the kingdom has expanded eastward by establishing settlements (Sima lands) along the river Bengawan Solo and [[Brantas River|Brantas]].\n\n===Moving eastward===\n[[File:Sambisari 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sambisari]] temple buried five metres under volcanic debris of [[Mount Merapi]].]]\nAround the year 929, the centre of the kingdom was shifted from Central Java to East Java by [[Mpu Sindok]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|128}} who established the [[Isyana Dynasty]]. The exact cause of the move is still uncertain. Historians have proposed various possible causes; from natural disaster, epidemic outbreak, politics and power struggle, to religious or economic motives.\n\nAccording to van Bemmelen's theory, which was supported by Prof. Boechari a severe eruption of [[Mount Merapi]] volcano probably has caused the move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\">{{cite news |title = Merapi and the demise of the Mataram kingdom |date = 13 June 2006 |author = Handewi Soegiharto |newspaper = The Jakarta Post |url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2006/06/13/merapi-and-demise-mataram-kingdom.html |accessdate = 31 August 2015}}</ref> Historians suggest that, some time during the reign of King [[Wawa of Mataram]] (924\u2014929), Merapi volcano erupted and devastated the kingdom's capital in Mataram. The historic massive volcano eruption is popularly known as ''Pralaya Mataram'' (the debacle of Mataram). The evidence for this eruption can be seen in several temples that were virtually buried under Merapi's [[lahar]] and volcanic debris, such as the [[Sambisari]], Morangan, Kedulan, [[Kadisoka]] and [[Kimpulan]] temples.\n\nArcheologist Agus Aris Munandar proposed a hypothesis, that the move was caused by a religious motives. He mentions that the incessant eruptions of Mount Merapi has caused the kingdom to move.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> Pointing out that in ancient Javanese beliefs, Merapi was considered as the [[Mount Meru|Mahameru]] for the people in the ancient Mataram. According to Hindu teachings, the Mahameru peak symbolises the centre of the universe, the sacred realm where the gods live. Since their Mahameru in Central Java continued to erupt, they decided to move, but they still looked for another Mahameru. As East Java was still part of Mataram territory, it is possible that some of the people informed the Central Java kingdom that there was another Mahameru in the east. He suggests that the new sacred mountain was [[Mount Penanggungan]] in East Java, which resembles Mahameru.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nAnother hypothesis proposed by N.J. Krom says that the demise was caused by an epidemic break-out, forcing people to seek a new place to live.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/> On the other hand, B. Schrieke says the move was caused by economic reasons; the vigorous temple construction boom during the era of Sailendran kings has put a tremendous economic burden upon the peasant. People were suffering as they were forced to build grand temples by the kings, instead of working their farms. Slowly they moved to the east to avoid the kings' orders.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nA power struggle is also proposed as the cause of the move. Coedes suggested that the move to East Java was probably in response to the Buddhist [[Sailendra]]s.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|79,90}} This theory is inline with the one proposed by J.G. de Casparis which suggests, that the shift of capital city eastward was to avoid a Srivijaya invasion from Sumatra.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nHowever, it was most likely motivated by economic reasons. De Casparis then expands his theory, saying that the location of the kingdom in Central Java was less accessible than East Java. The [[Brantas]] river valley was considered to be a strategic location, as the river provides easy access to reach ports on East Java's north coast and [[Java Sea]], strategic for the control of maritime trade routes to the eastern parts of archipelago, being especially vital for control of the [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] spice trade. This is in contrast with Mataram's Kedu and Kewu Plain that relatively isolated from the north coast of Central Java. Despite its fertility, ideal for rice agricultural kingdom, the Mataram Plain is quite isolated, its northern borders are protected by natural barrier of Merapi, Merbabu, Sumbing, Sundoro, Dieng and Ungaran volcanoes. Ideal for inward-looking agricultural polity, but insufficient to develop a maritime trading kingdom.<ref name=\"JPMataram\"/>\n\nThe recent studies suggest, that the move eastward was not an abrupt event. During the Mataram period in Central Java, the kingdom most likely already expanded eastward and established settlements along Brantas river in East Java. It was more likely that the move was done in gradual manner over long period. The cause of the move was also motivated from multiple factors; either natural, economy or politics. The Sanggurah inscription or popularly known as the \"[[Minto Stone]]\", dated to 982 \u2014 found in [[Malang]], East Java in early 19th century \u2014 mentions the name of a Javanese king, Sri Maharaja Rakai Pangkaja Dyah Wawa Sri Wijayalokanamottungga (King Wawa Wijayaloka<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Verhandelingen van Het Bataviaasch Genootschap van Kunsten en Wetenschappen|volume=60|year=1913| title=Oud-Javaansche Oorkonden.

This suggests that even during the reign of King Wawa, the Malang region in East Java already belongs within the realm of Medang Kingdom. The inscription contains elements about the shift of power that consequently took place to East Java.<ref>{{cite book|page=55|title=Handbook of Oriental Studies. Part 3|author=de Longh, R.C.|year=1977| publisher=Brill}}</ref>\n\nWhatever the true reasons behind the move of political centre from Central to East Java, this event marked the end of an era profoundly. Indeed, the temple-building activity has decreased since the era of King Balitung in scale, quality and quantity, and yet the Eastern Java period of Medang kingdom leave no tangible traces of any temple structure comparable to those of the previous Central Javanese Sailendra era. It seems that the kingdom no longer has the intention and the resource to embark on a grand scale construction project.\n\n====Establishing the eastern country====\n[[File:Anjuk Ladang Inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Anjukladang inscription]] (937), issued by King Sindok during his power consolidation in East Java.]]\nAccording to [[Turyan inscription]] (dated 929), [[Mpu Sindok|Sindok]] moved the capital to Tamwlang and later moved it again to Watugaluh. Historian identify those names with the Tambelang and Megaluh area near modern [[Jombang Regency|Jombang]], East Java. Although Sindok establishes a new dynasty, the [[Isyana dynasty]] named after his daughter, Sindok seems to be closely related to the royal house of Medang Mataram, thus he can be viewed as the continuation of a long line of Javanese Kings lineage stretched from [[Sri Sanjaya|King Sanjaya]]. During his reign Sindok created quite a number of inscriptions, most are related to the establishment of ''Sima'' lands; these inscriptions are among others; Linggasutan (929), Gulung-Gulung (929), Cunggrang (929), Jru-Jru (930), Waharu (931), Sumbut (931), Wulig (935), and [[Anjuk Ladang inscription|Anjukladang]] (937). Most of these inscription mentioned about the establishment of ''Sima'' or ''Swatantra'' lands. This signify that Sindok seems to consolidated his authority over East Java as collections of villages are declared as ''Sima'' lands, which means the settlements have developed wet rice cultivation and can be taxed and swore allegiance as part of Sindok's kingdom.\n\nThe [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 in particular is interesting, because it stated the ''Sima'' status is awarded to Anjukladang village and a temple is erected in recognition of their service on repelling the invading forces from Malayu. The temple mentioned here is probably the Candi Lor made of bricks which is now in ruins, located in Candirejo village in [[Nganjuk Regency]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://museumanjukladang.wordpress.com/2016/02/14/prasasti-anjukladang/|title=Prasasti Anjukladang|date=2016-02-13|work=Museum Anjuk Ladang|access-date=2018-05-21|language=id-ID}}</ref> The mentioning of invading ''Malayu'' forces refer to the old name of Sumatran Malayu Kingdom, which probably means [[Srivijaya]] instead. This means the relations between East Javanese Medang kingdom with Srivijaya has badly deteriorated to the state of hostility.\n\n====Expansion to Bali====\n[[File:Buddha Manjucri from Goa Raja cave Bali.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bodhisattva]] [[Manjushri]] from [[Goa Gajah]] cave, Bali, demonstrated the influence of Javanese Medang Mataram Sailendran art.]]\nSindok was succeeded by his daughter [[Isyana Tunggawijaya]].<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} According to [[Gedangan inscription]] (dated 950), Queen Isyana married to Sri Lokapala, a nobleman from [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]]. She later succeeded by her son [[Makutawangsa Wardhana]] c. 985. According to [[Pucangan inscription]] (dated 1041), King Makutawangsa Wardhana has a daughter named [[Mahendradatta]], Makutawangsa Wardhana was replaced by his son [[Dharmawangsa|Dharmawangsa Tguh]] c. 990s.\n\nA later king, [[Dharmawangsa]], moved the capital again to Wwatan, identified as the Wotan area near modern [[Madiun]]. Dharmawangsa's sister, [[Mahendradatta]] later would be betrothed to a Balinese king [[Udayana Warmadewa]]. This report indicated that somehow [[Bali]] had been absorbed into the Medang Kingdom's mandala sphere of influence, probably as vassal. In literature development, King Dharmawangsa also ordered the translation of the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' into [[Old Javanese language|Old Javanese]] in 996.\n\n===Collapse===\nIn the late 10th century, the rivalry between the Sumatran Srivijaya and Javanese Mataram became more hostile.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|130}} The animosity was probably caused by the Srivijayan effort to reclaim Sailendra lands in Java, as [[Balaputra]] and his offspring&nbsp;\u2014 a new dynasty of Srivijaya [[maharaja]]s&nbsp;\u2014 belonged to the Sailendra dynasty, or by Medang aspirations to challenge Srivijaya dominance as the regional power. Previously the [[Anjukladang inscription]] dated from 937 mentioned about infiltration attack from Malayu which refer to a Srivijayan attack.\n\n====War against Srivijaya====\n[[File:032 Avadana Level 1, Ship and Crew.jpg|thumb|Ancient [[Borobudur ship|Javanese vessel]] depicted in Borobudur.

The news of Javanese invasion of Srivijaya was recorded in Chinese accounts from Song period. In 988, an envoy from ''San-fo-qi'' (Srivijaya) was sent to Chinese court in Guangzhou. After sojourned for about two years in China, the envoy learned that his country has been attacked by ''She-po'' (Java) thus made him unable to return home. In 992 the envoy from ''She-po'' (Java) arrived in Chinese court and explaining that their country has involved in continuous war with Srivijaya. In 999 the Srivijayan envoy sailed from China to Champa in an attempt to return home, however he received no news about the condition of his country. The Srivijayan envoy then sailed back to China and appealed Chinese Emperor for the protection of China against Javanese invaders.<ref name=\"Kulke\">{{cite book |title=Nagapattinam to Suvarnadwipa: Reflections on the Chola Naval Expeditions to Southeast Asia, Volume 1 of Nalanda-Sriwijaya series |editor=Hermann Kulke |editor2=K Kesavapany |editor3=Vijay Sakhuja |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |year=2009 |isbn= 9789812309372 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2swhCXJVRzwC&dq=Dharmawangsa+Srivijaya+envoy+China}}</ref>{{rp|229}}\n\nDharmawangsa's invasion led the Maharaja of Srivijaya, Sri [[Cudamani Warmadewa]] to seek protection from China.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|141}} Srivijayan Maharaja, Sri Cudamani Warmadewa was an able and astute ruler, with shrewd diplomatic skills. In the midst of crisis brought by Javanese invasion, he secured Chinese political support by appeasing the Chinese Emperor. In 1003, a Song historical record reported that the envoy of ''San-fo-qi'' dispatched by the king Sri Cudamani Warmadewa, informed that a Buddhist temple had been erected in their country to pray for the long life of Chinese Emperor, thus asked the emperor to give the name and the bell for this temple which was built in his honor. Rejoiced, the Chinese Emperor named the temple ''Ch'eng-t'en-wan-shou'' ('ten thousand years of receiving blessing from heaven, which is China) and a bell was immediately cast and sent to Srivijaya to be installed in the temple.<ref name=\"Kulke\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nAfter 16 years of war, in 1006, Srivijaya managed to repelled the Medang invaders and liberated Palembang. This attack opened the eyes of the Srivijayan Maharaja to how dangerous the Medang kingdom could be, and he planned to destroy his new Javanese nemesis.\n\n====Mahapralaya====\n[[File:Java, predating Nganjuk style, 10th century - Bodhisattva Padmapani - 1967.149 - Cleveland Museum of Art.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Buddhist bronze figure depicting Boddhisattva Padmapani, 10th-century dated from late period of Medang Kingdom.]]\nIn retaliation, in 1016-1017, Srivijaya forces assisted Haji (king) Wurawari to revolt.

This sudden and unexpected attack took place during the wedding ceremony of Dharmawangsa's daughter, which rendered the court unprepared and shocked.\n\nThis calamity was recorded in Javanese account as the ''pralaya'' (the debacle) the death of the Mataram kingdom.<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144}} With the death of Dharmawangsa and the fall of the capital, under military pressure from Srivijaya, the kingdom finally collapsed and fell to chaos. With the absence of Medang paramount ruler, warlords in regional provinces and settlements in central and east Java rebelled and break loose from the central Medang government and forming their own polities serving local dynasties. Raids and robbery were rampant ravaging the country. There was further unrest and violence several years after the kingdom's demise.\n\n[[Airlangga]], a son of King [[Udayana Warmadewa]] of [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]] and Queen [[Mahendradatta]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|129}} also a nephew of slain King Dharmawangsa, managed to escape the destruction and went into exile in [[Wonogiri|Vanagiri]] forest in interior Central Java. He later rallied popular support, reunited the remnants of the Medang Kingdom and re-established the kingdom (including Bali) under the name of [[Kingdom of Kahuripan]] in 1019. The Kingdom of Kahuripan can be considered as the successor state of Medang, and from this point on, the kingdom was known as [[Kahuripan]],<ref name=\"indianised\" />{{rp|144\u2013147}} with its capital located near Brantas river estuarine, somewhere around modern Surabaya, Sidoarjo or Pasuruan in East Java.\n\n==The Dynasty==\n\n=== The dual dynasties theory ===\n{{Main|Sanjaya Dynasty}}\nBosch  in his book ''\"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\"'' (1952) suggested that king Sanjaya was the progenitor of the [[Sanjaya Dynasty]], and there was two dynasties that ruled Central Java; the Buddhist [[Sailendra]] and the Shivaist Sanjaya dynasty.<ref>Dr. Bosch, \"Srivijaya, de Sailendravamsa en de Sanjayavamsa\", 1952.</ref> The inscription also states that Sanjaya was an ardent follower of [[Shaivism]]. From its founding in the early 8th century until 928, the kingdom was ruled by the Sanjaya dynasty. The first king was Sanjaya, who ruled in the Mataram region in the vicinity of modern Yogyakarta and Prambanan, and left the written records on the Canggal inscription. However, around the mid 8th century, the [[Sailendra]] dynasty emerged in Central Java and challenged Sanjaya domination in the region.\n\nThe prevailing historical interpretation holds that the Sailendra dynasty co-existed next to the Sanjaya dynasty in Central Java, and much of the period was characterised by peaceful co-operation. The Sailendra, with their strong connections to [[Srivijaya]], managed to gain control of Central Java and become overlords of the ''Rakai'' (local Javanese lords), including the Sanjayas, thus making the Sanjaya kings of Mataram their [[vassal]]s. Little is known about the kingdom due to the dominance of the Sailendra, who during this period constructed [[Borobudur]], a Buddhist monument. [[Samaratungga]], the monarch of the Sailendra, tried to secure the Sailendra position in Java, cementing an alliance with the Sanjayas by arranging the marriage of his daughter [[Pramodhawardhani]] with [[Rakai Pikatan|Pikatan]].\n\nAround the middle of the 9th century, relations between the Sanjaya and the Sailendra deteriorated. In 852, the Sanjaya ruler, Pikatan, defeated [[Balaputra]], the offspring of the Sailendra monarch Samaratunga and the princess Tara. This ended the Sailendra presence in Java; Balaputra retreated to the Srivijayan capital in [[Sumatra]], where he became the paramount ruler.<ref>cf. De Casparis, 1956; Hall, 1985:111</ref> The victory of Pikatan was recorded in [[Shivagrha inscription]] dated 856, created by Rakai Kayuwangi, Pikatan's successor.\n\n=== The single dynasty theory ===\n[[File:Borobudur relief 1.jpg|thumb|right|The scene of the Javanese court depicted in Borobudur bas relief]]\n{{Main|Sailendra Dynasty}}\nHowever, this dual Sailendra\u2014Sanjaya dynasties theory proposed by Bosch and De Casparis was opposed by some Indonesian historians in later period. An alternate theory, proposed by [[Poerbatjaraka]], suggests there was only one kingdom and one dynasty, the kingdom called Medang, with the capital in the Mataram area (thus the name of the kingdom: ''\"Medang i Bhumi Mataram\"''), and the ruling dynasty being the [[Sailendra]].\n\nThis theory is supported with Boechari interpretation on [[Sojomerto inscription]] and Poerbatjaraka study on [[Carita Parahyangan]] manuscript, Poerbatjaraka holds that Sanjaya and all of his offspring belongs to the Sailendra family, which initially was [[Shivaist]] Hindu. However, according to [[Raja Sankhara inscription]] (now missing); Sanjaya's son, Panangkaran, converted to Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism. And because of that conversion, the later series of Sailendra kings who ruled Medang become Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists also and gave Buddhism royal patronage in Java until the end of Samaratungga's reign.<ref>Poerbatjaraka, 1958: 254\u2013264</ref> The Shivaist Hindus regained royal patronage with the reign of Pikatan, which lasted until the end of the Medang Kingdom. During the reign of Kings Pikatan and [[Balitung]], the royal Hindu [[Trimurti]] temple of [[Prambanan]] was built and expanded in the vicinity of [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]].\n\n== Government and economy ==\nThe complex stratified ancient Javan society, with its refined aesthetic taste in art and culture, is evidenced through the various scenes in narrative [[bas-relief]]s carved on various temples dated from the Medang era.\n\n===Capital===\n[[File:Hindu Temple in Java, Indonesia.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Prambanan]] pr\u0101s\u0101da (towers) viewed from [[Ratu Boko]] hill, the area in [[Prambanan Plain]] was the location of the Mataram capital]] \nDuring this period the common concept of [[city]], as it known in Europe, Middle East or China, as the urban concentration centre of politics, administration, religious and economic activities, was not quite established yet in ancient Java. The proper urban development as a city took place later in 13th century [[Majapahit]]'s [[Trowulan]].\n\nThe capital itself is more likely refer to the [[palace]], a walled compound called ''pura'' in Sanskrit, or in local [[Javanese language|Javanese]] as ''karaton'' or ''kadatwan'', this is where the king and his family reside and rule his court. The palace itself is more of a collection of ''[[pendopo]]'' style pavilions surrounded by walls. These pavilions and halls are made from organic wooden and thatched materials, so they had decayed over centuries leaving only stone walls, gates, terraces and bases. The example of this type of secular buildings can be found in [[Ratu Boko]] compound. The Javanese urban centre in this period did not recognise walled-city as it found in Chinese or Indian counterparts, the only walled, well-guarded and protected compound was the king's palace and temple compound. The ''nagara'' or capital itself was more of a collection of densely populated villages surrounding the ''pura'' (king's palace).\n\nThe religious activity centres, which refer to the location of where the temples stood, did not necessarily signify the administrative or economic centre as well. As according to inscriptions, numbers of lands has been awarded a ''Sima'' status with portion or the whole of its rice tax revenue was allocated to funding the construction and maintaining the temple. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that the [[Prambanan Plain]] with high concentration of temples located just few hundred meters away from each other \u2014 [[Sambisari]], [[Kalasan]], [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Lumbung]], [[Prambanan]], [[Plaosan]], [[Sajiwan]], [[Banyunibo]], [[Ratuboko]], Barong and Ijo temples \u2014 was might be the location of the capital of Mataram. Other expert argued that the Prambanan area was indeed the religious centre of the kingdom, but was not the administrative centre, while suggesting other location in [[Muntilan]] as the possible political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\">{{cite book|last=Degroot|first=V\u00e9ronique|title=Candi, Space and Landscape: A Study on the Distribution, Orientation and Spatial Organization of Central Javanese Temple Remains |year=2009 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2HzduME8OcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |page=85 |location=Leiden|publisher=Sidestone Press, Issue 38 of Mededelingen van het Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde |isbn=978-9088900396}}</ref>\n\nMost of the time, the court of the Medang Kingdom was located in Mataram, possibly located somewhere in Muntilan or the [[Prambanan Plain]] near modern [[Yogyakarta (city)|Yogyakarta]]. However, during the reign of Rakai Pikatan, the court was moved to Mamrati. Later, in the reign of Balitung, the court moved again, this time to Poh Pitu. Unlike Mataram, historians have been unable to pinpoint the possible locations of Mamrati and Poh Pitu, although most historians agree that both were located in the [[Kedu Plain]], somewhere around the modern [[Magelang Regency|Magelang]] or [[Temanggung Regency|Temanggung]] regencies. Later expert suggests that the area in Secang, on the upper Progo river valley in northern Magelang Regency \u2014 with relatively high temple density \u2014 was possibly the secondary political centre of the kingdom.<ref name=\"Degroot85\"/> In later Eastern Java period, other centres were mentioned; such as Tamwlang and Watugaluh (near Jombang), also Wwatan (near [[Madiun]]).\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Sailendra King and Queen, Borobudur.jpg|thumb|right|The bas relief of 8th century [[Borobudur]] depict the scene in royal court.]]\nDuring this period the administration level of Javanese polity was only consists of two levels; the central government level centred in king's court, and the ''wanua'' or village level took form of settlements scattered around within kingdom's realm. The palace where the King resided was mentioned as ''kadatwan'' or ''karaton'', the court was the centre of kingdom's administration. The ''wanua'' or village is more likely took shape of an \"island\" filled with housings and orchards in the middle of vast [[rice paddies]], this village layout still can be found in modern Javanese ''desa''.\n\nThe King was regarded as the paramount ruler or ''[[chakravartin]]'', where the highest power and authority lies. He ruled the ''nagara'' or ''kadatwan'' which means the kingdom, from his ''puri'' (palace or walled compound). Under the king, there are state officials that serve to forward the king's laws and orders. They are using the title of ''Rakai'' or ''Samget''. The ''Rakais'' ruled an administrative unit called '' watak'' that formed from the collection of several villages or ''wanua''. ''Rakai'' can be considered as regional [[landlord]] or the [[landed gentry]], that rule a large collection of villages. The ''rakais'' transmit the king's order to the ''Rama'' or village leaders that rules their own domain called ''karaman'' or ''watak''. As the kingdom grew larger and complex, entering the 10th century during the reign of [[Balitung]], series of state officials are added to add hierarchy levels.<ref>{{cite book| author=Rahardjo, Supratikno |title= Peradaban Jawa, Dinamika Pranata Politik, Agama, dan Ekonomi Jawa Kuno | date=2002 | publisher=Komuntas Bambu, Jakarta | language=Indonesian |page=111 | isbn=979-96201-1-2}}</ref>\n\nMost of the inscriptions dated from Medang Mataram period are related to the establishment of ''sima'' lands. This signify the formation and expansion of Javanese agricultural villages in the region during this period. Either by opening a forest or converting a ''ladang'' (dry rice cultivation) to ''sawah'' (wet rice cultivation). A ''sima'' is an arable [[wet rice]] agricultural land with rice surpluses available for taxation, and officially recognised through royal edict. Most of these ''sima'' lands are ruled by regional ''rakai'' or ''samget'' (landed gentry) in their realm. By acquiring prestigious ''sima'' status from the king, a ''watak'' regional unit held a higher prestige compared to non-''sima'' settlements, yet this also means acknowledging the kingdom's overlordship over their land and swore their allegiance to the king. The Rakais that rule the land are granted a royal permission to collect tax, yet some parts of these tax should be regularly paid to the king's court (central government in the capital). In some instance, some of these ''sima'' inscription stated that this ''sima'' land has become a tax-free land, in exchange that the rice harvest surpluses collected from this land are used to construct or maintain a religious building. This means the ''rakai'' that traditionally ruled this lands no longer has the right to collect the tax, or at least reducing their tax earnings.\n\nOther than their administrative and military-defense function, the king and the royal family is also known as the patron of arts and also religious piousness. The king, the royal family and the kingdom's officials had the authority to launch public projects, such as irrigation works or temple construction. The royal art and religious patronage can be seen in sponsoring temples constructions. The kingdom left behind several temples and monuments. The most notable ones are Borobudur, Prambanan, [[Sewu]], and the [[Plaosan]] temple compound.\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Bas-reli\u00ebf op de Borobudur TMnr 10027564.jpg|thumb|left|The bas-relief in 8th century [[Borobudur]] depicting rice agriculture in ancient Java]]\nThe common people of Medang mostly made a living in agriculture, especially as [[rice]] farmers, however, some may have pursued other careers, such as hunter, trader, artisan, weaponsmith, sailor, soldier, dancer, musician, food or drink vendor, etc. Rich portrayals of daily life in 9th century Java can be seen in many temple bas-reliefs. Rice cultivation had become the base for the kingdom's economy where the villages throughout the realm relied on their annual rice yield to pay taxes to the court. Exploiting the fertile volcanic soil of Central Java and the intensive wet rice cultivation (''sawah'') enabled the population to grow significantly, which contributed to the availability of labour and workforce for the state's public projects. Certain villages and lands were given the status as ''sima'' lands awarded through royal edict written in inscriptions. The rice yields from ''sima'' lands usually were allocated for the maintenance of certain religious buildings.\n\n[[File:Javanese gold mas or tahil ingot.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Earliest evidence of a [[currency]] system in Java. Javanese [[gold]] ''mas'' or ''tahil'' ingots, circa the 9th century.]]\n\nThe economic activity was also not solely centred in a single marketplace in the capital city. It is most likely that the marketplace was rotated in daily basis within a week among participating villages, in a Javanese system called ''pasaran''. This system still can be found in rural Javanese villages, before most are turned into a permanent marketplace as it is commonly found today. The economic trading practice in these marketplace are most likely done in [[barter]] as well as using money, as during this period, Javanese economy has been partly monetised.\n\nThe bas-reliefs from temples of this period, especially from [[Borobudur]] and [[Prambanan]] describe occupations and careers other than agricultural pursuit; such as soldiers, government officials, court servants, massage therapists, travelling musicians and dancing troupe, food and drink sellers, logistics courier, sailors, merchants, even thugs and robbers are depicted in everyday life of 9th century Java. These occupations requires economic system that employs [[currency]]. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]], golden artefacts discovered in 1990, revealed gold coins in shape similar to corn seeds, which suggests that 9th century Javan economy is partly monetised. On the surface of the gold coins engraved with a script ''\"ta\"'', a short form of ''\"tail\"'' or ''\"tahil\"'' a unit of currency in ancient Java.\n\n== Culture and society ==\n\n=== Society ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf Borobudur TMnr 60042617.jpg|thumb|upright|A nobleman accompanied by his entourage and servants, a bas-relief of Borobudur.]]\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Detail van reli\u00ebf O 105 op de verborgen voet van de Borobudur TMnr 10015664.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A [[Buddhist]] hermit meditating in secluded forest, Borobudur bas-relief.]]\nA complex and stratified society of ancient Javanese people and their social order can be seen through studies on the rich portrayal in bas-reliefs from this period, as well as inscription studies. The kingdom had developed a complex society; which characterised by heterogeneity of their society, inequality of social stratification, and the formation of national administrative institution in their kingdom.<ref name=\"Peradaban35\"/> The ancient Javanese did recognise the Hindu ''[[Varna (Hinduism)|catur varna]]'' or [[caste]] social classes; [[Brahmana]] (priests), [[Kshatriya]] (kings, warlords and nobles), [[Vaishya]] (traders and artisans), and [[Shudra]] (servants and slaves). Nevertheless, the social stratification system in ancient Java slightly differ from those of India, as it less rigid.<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=49\u201350 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n\nPigeaud divides ancient Javanese society into four classes: the ruling class, religious authority, commoners, and slaves.<ref>Pigeaud, 1958: 195</ref> While de Casparis suggest; although the ancient Javanese society recognise caste differences, their rules and implementations was less rigid compared to those caste system in India. De Casparis divides them into three groups:\n# The commoners that formed the majority of kingdom's population.\n# The king with his royal family, including those nobles, landlords and the member of elite ruling class that depends on the king's court and his dynasty. Can be commonly called \"the palace/court people\".\n# The religious figures and religious authorities. The priests class; brahmins and monks, includes the lower rank servants employed in temple compounds and monasteries.<ref>de Casparis, 1954: 56</ref>\n\nBased on the study of the styles and types of clothing and jewelries worn by people depicted in bas-reliefs from the temple \u2014 especially Borobudur reliefs \u2014 the ancient Javanese society roughly can be divided into:<ref>{{cite book | author=Inda Citraninda Noerhadi | title=Busana Jawa Kuna | pages=55\u201356 | publisher=Komunitas Bambu | location=Jakarta | date=July 2012 | language=Indonesian | isbn=978-602-9402-16-2}}</ref>\n# '''The nobles''', the king and the royal families, landlords, nobles and those that related to ruling elites. They wore luxurious clothing of ''kain'' long clothes wrapped around their hips to the ankle, waistband, and [[sash]] either wore around their hips as ''sampur'', or wore around their body hanging from left shoulder to the hip. Adorned with intricate golden jewelries such as ''jamang'' (forehead ornaments), ''makuta'' (crown), earrings, ''kelat bahu'' ([[armlet]]), necklace, ''upavita'' (body ornament of golden chains wore across the chest), bracelets, rings, ankle bracelet. The gods and divinities also portrayed in similar fashion as nobles, although they are described as having ''prabhamandala'' (divine [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]) around their head.\n# '''The royal servants''' or '''lower-ranked nobles''', they are king's servants, entourages or royal attendants. They occupied positions as ''dayang-dayang'' (female royal attendants), guard or state officials. They wore long cloth around their hips to the ankle, and wore jewelries and ornaments too, such as earrings, necklace and bracelets, although not as complete and luxurious as those worn by the king and the nobles.\n# '''The priests''', the [[brahmin]]s, Buddhist monks, or those religious figures employed in temples or monasteries. They usually wore robes or cloaks called ''sinhel''. Buddhist monks were usually portrayed as bald men wore robe with open right shoulder, while brahmins were usually depicted as bearded men wearing [[turbans]]. \n# '''The commoners''', the majority of the people, mostly described as villagers. They wore simple clothing of around their hips, the lower end sometimes being tied upward to create a short [[loincloth]]. Usually they wore no jewelry or ornaments, but some wore a few simple ornaments, including necklaces or bracelets, or a rope worn as a waistband.\n\n=== Religion ===\n[[File:Buddha Mendut.jpg|thumb|left|The statue of Dhyani Buddha [[Vairocana]], [[Avalokitesvara]], and [[Vajrapani]] inside the [[Mendut]] temple]]\n\n[[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] are the two religions adhered by the rulers and people of the kingdom. Nevertheless, the commoners' religious practices were probably still mixed with native [[shamanism]] and indigenous pre-Dharmic beliefs. Since the beginning of its formation, the Medang Mataram kings seemed to favour [[Shivaist]] Hinduism, such as the construction of [[linga]] in Gunung Wukir Hindu temple as mentioned in Canggal inscription by king Sanjaya. However, during the reign of [[Panangkaran]], [[Mahayana]] Buddhism began to blossomed and gain court favour. The [[Kalasan]], [[Candi Sari|Sari]], [[Sewu]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and the magnificent [[Borobudur]] temples testify the Buddhist renaissance in Central Java. The court patronage on Buddhism spanned from the reign of Panangkaran to [[Samaratungga]]. During the reign of Pikatan, Shivaist Hinduism began to regain court's favour, signified by the construction of grand Shivagrha (Prambanan).\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Mahadewa in de Lara Djonggrang hindoe-tempel te Prambanan TMnr 60033679.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shiva]] statue in main chamber of [[Prambanan]].]]\nThe kingdom recognised the religious authority of priest class, the [[brahmin]]s. Buddhism was also well represented through the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|sangha]] Buddhist monastic community, consists of [[Buddhist monks]] living in [[vihara]]s such as Sari and Plaosan and gaining court patronage. These Hindu and Buddhist religious authorities conducted state's and regional religious rituals and ceremonies in the temples. The ruling class of [[kshatriya]] royal family also indulged in spiritualism. Some monarch seems to immerse themselves in spiritualism and religion. For example, King Panangkaran seems to be deeply influenced by Mahayana Buddhism, and even strive to become a hermit during his later days. Numbers of other kings such as Samaragrawira and Samaratungga was also deeply influenced by Buddhism and strive to become a benevolent leaders. Rakai Pikatan also abdicated and renounced worldly affairs during his old days and become a [[rishi]] hermit named Sang Prabhu Jatiningrat.\n\nThe period between the reign of King Panangkaran to the reign of King Balitung (late 8th century to the early 10th century) saw a fervent temple construction in the kingdom. This was probably motivated either by religious zeal, kingdom's immense wealth and resources or social-political reasons. Some historians such as Munoz suggest, that this ardent temple construction projects was actually a religious-political tool to control the regional ''Rakai'' landlords, to prevent them from rebelling against the king.<ref>{{cite book |last=Munoz|first=Paul Michel|title=Early Kingdoms of the Indonesian Archipelago and the Malay Peninsula|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|year=2006|location=Singapore|url= |doi= |pages= |isbn= 981-4155-67-5}}</ref> During this time, each of regional ''watak'' are ruled by ''Rakai'' landlords that nurturing their own dynasty. By appointing the Rakais' ''sima'' land to fund the construction and maintenance of a ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candi]]'' religious building, the Maharaja depriving the Rakais' ability to collect large sum of tax, that can be potentially misused to fund some army that might rose to challenge the Maharaja's authority. The Rakais might be willingly or reluctantly compliant to the king's will, for refusing to construct religious building might harm their reputation, and cast them not only as the enemy of the king, but also as the enemy of gods or Buddha.\n\n=== Art and Architecture ===\n{{further|Candi of Indonesia}}\n[[File:Wonoboyo Hoard.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] displays the immense wealth and artistic achievement of the Medang kingdom.]]\nOther than examining bas-reliefs carved on the temple's walls, the study of ancient Javanese society is also conducted through archaeological relics. The [[Wonoboyo hoard]] golden artefacts attest to the wealth, art, and culture as well as the aesthetic achievement of the Medang Kingdom.

Almost 50 years later the oldest Buddhist temple was built in Prambanan region, the Buddhist [[Kalasan]] temple, linked to [[Kalasan inscription]] (778 CE) and King [[Panangkaran]]. From this time, the kingdom saw exuberant temple construction projects, such as [[Sari temple|Sari]], [[Sewu|Manjusrigrha]], [[Lumbung]], [[Ngawen]], [[Mendut]], [[Pawon]] and peaked in the construction of [[Borobudur]], the massive stone [[mandala]], that took shape of a mountain temple pinnacled with [[stupa]]s that completed c. 825 CE.\n\n[[File:Prambanan Shiva Temple.jpg|thumb|left|The magnificent 9th century Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]], [[Yogyakarta]], was a major Hindu monument in the kingdom of Medang.]]\n\nThe monumental Hindu temple of [[Prambanan]] in the vicinity of Yogyakarta&nbsp;\u2014 initially built during the reign of King Pikatan (838\u2014850), and expanded continuously through the reign of Lokapala (850\u2014890) to [[Balitung]] (899\u2013911)&nbsp;\u2014 is a fine example of ancient Medang Mataram art and architecture. The description of a grand temple compound dedicated for lord Shiva, and the public project to shift the course of the river near the temple (Opak river) to run straight along western wall of temple compound was also mentioned in [[Shivagrha inscription]]. The grand temple complex was dedicated to the ''[[Trimurti]]'', the three highest gods in the Hindu [[Pantheon (gods)|pantheon]] (Shiva, Brahma, Vishnu). It was the largest Hindu temple ever built in [[Indonesia]], evidence of the immense wealth and cultural achievement of the kingdom.\n\nOther Hindu temples dated from Medang Mataram Kingdom era are: [[Sambisari]], [[Gebang Temple|Gebang]], Barong, Ijo, and Morangan. Although the Shivaist regain the favour, Buddhist remain under royal patronage. The Sewu temple dedicated for [[Manjusri]] according to [[Kelurak inscription]] was probably initially built by Panangkaran, but later expanded and completed during Rakai Pikatan's rule, whom married to a Buddhist princess [[Pramodhawardhani]], daughter of Samaratungga. Most of their subjects retained their old religion; Shivaists and Buddhists seemed to co-exist in harmony. The Buddhist temple of [[Plaosan]], [[Banyunibo]] and [[Sajiwan]] were built during the reign of King Pikatan and Queen Pramodhawardhani, probably in the spirit of religious reconciliation after the succession disputes between Pikatan-Pramodhawardhani against [[Balaputra]].\n\n=== Literature ===\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Reli\u00ebf op de aan Shiva gewijde tempel op de Candi Lara Jonggrang oftewel het Prambanan tempelcomplex TMnr 10016190.jpg|thumb|Bas relief in [[Prambanan]] depicting a scene taken from [[Ramayana]]. The translation of Indian epic into Javanese [[Kakawin Ramayana]] took place during Medang Mataram kingdom.]]\n\nFrom the 9th to mid 10th centuries, the Medang Kingdom witnessed the blossoming of art, culture and literature, mainly through the translation of Hindu-Buddhist sacred texts and the transmission and adaptation of Hindu-Buddhist ideas into Old Javanese text and visual bas-reliefs rendering. The bas-relief carved on each sides of [[Mendut]] temple stairs and also on the base of [[Sojiwan]] temple for example, narrating the popular [[Jataka]] Buddhist tales, the stories that tell about the previous lives of the Buddha, in both human and animal form. The [[Borobudur]] bas-relief particularly, contains the most complete rendering of Buddhist sacred texts. Ranged from [[Karma]]vibhanga (the law of [[karma]]), [[Lalitavistara]] (the story of the Buddha), the tale of [[Manohara]], [[Jataka]] and Jatakamala, [[Avadana]] (collection of virtuous deeds) and [[Gandavyuha]] ([[Sudhana]]'s quest for the ultimate truth).\n\nThe bas-relief narration of the Hindu epic ''[[Ramayana]]'' and also was carved on the wall of Prambanan temple's Shiva and Brahma temples, while the stories of [[Krishna]] taken from [[Bhagavata Purana]] was carved on Vishnu temple. During this period, the [[Kakawin Ramayana|Kakawin ''Ramayana'']], an old [[Javanese language|Javanese]] rendering was written. This Kakawin Ramayana, also called the ''Yogesvara Ramayana'', is attributed to the scribe Yogesvara c. the 9th century CE, who was employed in the court of the Medang in Central Java. It has 2774 [[stanza]]s in the ''manipravala'' style, a mixture of Sanskrit and [[Kawi language|archaic Javanese prose]]. The most influential version of the ''Ramayana'' is the ''Ravanavadham'' of [[Bhatti]], popularly known as ''Bhattikavya''. The Javanese ''Ramayana'' differs markedly from the original Hindu.\n\n==Relations with regional powers==\n{{multiple image|align=right|perrow=2|total_width=500|direction=horizontal|caption_align=center|image1=Borobudur-Nothwest-view.jpg|width1=131|image2=Bakong 01.jpg|width2=131|footer=Comparison between left: [[Borobudur]] of Java (825) and right: [[Bakong]] of Cambodia (881), both temples had similar basic design of [[stepped pyramid]] and similar corbelling method, which suggest there was a connection of influence between ancient Java and Cambodia.}}\n\nMedang kingdom had an exceptionally intense relations with the regional hegemon [[Srivijaya]] of Sumatra. In earlier period, the relations was close and intimate, as Sailendran kings of Java has formed an alliance with Maharaja of Srivijaya and the two royal houses seems to be merged. In later period however, the relations was deteriorated to warfare, as Dharmawangsa launched failed attempt to capture Palembang, and Srivijaya well-crafted retaliation ensued. In its eastern boundary, the Medang kingdom seems to subjugate the neighboring [[Bali Kingdom|Bali]], and pulled the island into its sphere of influence.\n\nThe Khmer art and architecture during the formative early [[Angkor]] era also believed to being influenced by Javanese art and architecture; the striking similarity of the [[Bakong]] temple in [[Cambodia]] to Borobudur, strongly suggests that Bakong was inspired by Borobudur's design.

By incorporating Hindu-Buddhist frame of reference and elements into their culture, art and architecture, and by [[Sanskritization]] their language, Javanese has formulating their own Hindu-Buddhist Javanese style and developing an ingenious civilisation. This Javanese style of Sailendran art, either in sculpture and architecture, in return influenced regional arts, particularly the Srivijayan art in Sumatra and Southern Thailand Malay Peninsula.\n\n[[File:RamanyanaBallet.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wayang Wong|Javanese]] [[Ramayana Ballet]] performance in [[Prambanan]] open air stage.

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] held its [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2016|South Carolina primary]] on the same day, while their own [[Nevada Republican caucuses, 2016|Nevada caucuses]] took place on February 23.\n\nWith all other candidates having dropped out of the race ahead of the Nevada caucuses, the two remaining candidates were [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nvdems.com/caucus/candidates/|title=2016 Candidates|publisher=NVDems|date=2014-06-20|accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Washoe County Democratic Convention 2016 (25925609250).jpg|thumb|Tension arises at the Washoe County Democratic Convention 2016, between Sanders supporters in front and Clinton supporters behind.]]\nOf the total number of 43 delegates the Nevada Democratic Party may send to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], 35 are pledged and 8 are unpledged.\n\nThe delegate selection process is a system with three levels:\n# The first step in the delegate selection process were the precinct caucuses on February 20, which elected about 12,000 delegates to the county conventions.\n# At the county conventions on April 2, the county delegates selected about 4,000 delegates to the state convention.\n# At the state convention on May 14\u201315, the final 35 pledged delegates to the National Convention will be selected. 23 of them are allocated proportionally based on congressional district results, whereas the remaining 12 are allocated based on the state convention as a whole.\n\n==State convention==\nThe state convention was held in May as the final stage of the delegate selection process. Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which had been largely the same for the previous 8 years, gave an unfair amount of power to the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates. During the vote the convention chair, Roberta Lange accepted the \"yeas\" even though the \"nays\" were louder than the \"yeas\" in the room. However both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room. Once Lange accepted the \"yeas\", upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, yelling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party\u2019s executive board. The event was quickly shut down after that. Casino spokeswoman Jennifer Forkis said the event ran over its allotted time by about four hours, meaning security hired for the event would soon leave their shifts. \"Without adequate security personnel, and in consultation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and event organizers, a decision was made that it was in the best interest of everyone in attendance to end the event,\" Forkis said in a statement.<ref>https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/may/18/jeff-weaver/allegations-fraud-and-misconduct-nevada-democratic/</ref>\n\n==Debates and forums==\n===October 2015 debate in Las Vegas===\n{{main|First Democratic Party presidential debate, October 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada}}\n\nOn October 13, 2015, the Democratic Party's very first debate was held at the [[Wynn Las Vegas|Wynn Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] held its [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2016|South Carolina primary]] on the same day, while their own [[Nevada Republican caucuses, 2016|Nevada caucuses]] took place on February 23.\n\nWith all other candidates having dropped out of the race ahead of the Nevada caucuses, the two remaining candidates were [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nvdems.com/caucus/candidates/|title=2016 Candidates|publisher=NVDems|date=2014-06-20|accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Washoe County Democratic Convention 2016 (25925609250).jpg|thumb|Tension arises at the Washoe County Democratic Convention 2016, between Sanders supporters in front and Clinton supporters behind.]]\nOf the total number of 43 delegates the Nevada Democratic Party may send to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], 35 are pledged and 8 are unpledged.\n\nThe delegate selection process is a system with three levels:\n# The first step in the delegate selection process were the precinct caucuses on February 20, which elected about 12,000 delegates to the county conventions.\n# At the county conventions on April 2, the county delegates selected about 4,000 delegates to the state convention.\n# At the state convention on May 14\u201315, the final 35 pledged delegates to the National Convention will be selected. 23 of them are allocated proportionally based on congressional district results, whereas the remaining 12 are allocated based on the state convention as a whole.\n\n==State convention==\nThe state convention was held in May as the final stage of the delegate selection process. Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which had been largely the same for the previous 8 years, gave an unfair amount of power to the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates. During the vote the convention chair, Roberta Lange accepted the \"yeas\" even though the \"nays\" were louder than the \"yeas\" in the room. However both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room. Once Lange accepted the \"yeas\", upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, yelling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party\u2019s executive board. The event was quickly shut down after that. Casino spokeswoman Jennifer Forkis said the event ran over its allotted time by about four hours, meaning security hired for the event would soon leave their shifts. \"Without adequate security personnel, and in consultation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and event organizers, a decision was made that it was in the best interest of everyone in attendance to end the event,\" Forkis said in a statement.<ref>https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/may/18/jeff-weaver/allegations-fraud-and-misconduct-nevada-democratic/</ref>\n\n==Debates and forums==\n===October 2015 debate in Las Vegas===\n{{main|First Democratic Party presidential debate, October 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada}}\n\nOn October 13, 2015, the Democratic Party's very first debate was held at the [[Wynn Las Vegas|Wynn Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].

The DUP and its coalition partner the UPP made significant gains in the north-west of the country, winning a combined total of 26 new seats in [[Seoul]], four in [[Incheon]] and 14 in suburban [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi-do]]. Altogether the DUP-UPP coalition won 70 of 112 seats in this region, a gain of 44. They also maintained their dominant position in [[Jeolla]] and [[Jeju-do|Jeju]], winning 31 of 33 seats, a gain of three. Had the liberal parties made comparable gains in the eastern half of the country, they would have won the election.{{vague|date=April 2012}} They won only 13 seats of 100 in these provinces, a net gain of one. In [[Chungcheong]], [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon]] and [[Gyeongsang]], the Saenuri Party made gains from the DUP and the Liberty Forward Party. The liberal parties failed to make significant gains in the southeast, a traditionally conservative region.<ref>Armstrong, C. K. (2007) ''Korean Society: Civil Society, Democracy and the State.''

The DUP and its coalition partner the UPP made significant gains in the north-west of the country, winning a combined total of 26 new seats in [[Seoul]], four in [[Incheon]] and 14 in suburban [[Gyeonggi Province|Gyeonggi-do]]. Altogether the DUP-UPP coalition won 70 of 112 seats in this region, a gain of 44. They also maintained their dominant position in [[Jeolla]] and [[Jeju-do|Jeju]], winning 31 of 33 seats, a gain of three. Had the liberal parties made comparable gains in the eastern half of the country, they would have won the election.{{vague|date=April 2012}} They won only 13 seats of 100 in these provinces, a net gain of one. In [[Chungcheong]], [[Gangwon Province (South Korea)|Gangwon]] and [[Gyeongsang]], the Saenuri Party made gains from the DUP and the Liberty Forward Party. The liberal parties failed to make significant gains in the southeast, a traditionally conservative region.<ref>Armstrong, C. K. (2007) ''Korean Society: Civil Society, Democracy and the State.''
