Their next-door neighbour, Fred, is seen with two young men, Peter and Paul. They find Fred reacting somewhat awkwardly. Fred and Paul come over to help put the boat into the lake. After they leave, George and Georgie stay outside by the lake, tending to their boat. Georgie asks his father why Fred was behaving so strangely.\n\nWhile Ann is in the kitchen cooking, Peter visits and asks to borrow some eggs. Ann gives him the eggs but Peter clumsily drops them. Feeling a little annoyed after Peter accidentally knocks her phone into the sink filled with water, Ann gives him another four eggs and he leaves. Soon afterwards she hears Lucky barking and finds Peter and Paul inside together. Lucky had jumped on Peter, causing him to break the second batch of eggs. Paul asks her to try out one of the golf clubs outside, and she begrudgingly agrees. In the boat, George and Georgie hear Lucky barking hysterically when suddenly the barking stops. Peter and Paul request more eggs, and Ann becomes frustrated, but George arrives and tries to force the men to leave, slapping Paul. In retaliation, Peter breaks one of George's legs with the golf club. The two young men then take the family hostage.\n\nPaul guides Ann on a hunt to find the family's dog, which he had killed with George's golf club. When their neighbors, the Thompsons, visit, Ann passes the two men off as friends. After returning to the house, the Farbers are forced to participate in a number of [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadistic]] games in order to stay alive. Paul asks if George or Ann wants to bet that they will be alive by 9:00 in the morning, and says that he and Peter are betting they will not be. Paul frequently ridicules Peter's weight and lack of intelligence, and describes a number of contradicting stories of Peter's past, although no definitive explanation is ever presented as to the men's origins or motives.\n\nDuring the \"games\", Peter and Paul put Georgie's head in a bag and ask Ann to strip naked. Georgie is nearly suffocated until George asks Ann to follow the men's instructions. When released from the bag, Georgie escapes the house with the help of his parents. He goes to the neighbors', where he discovers their bloody corpses. Meanwhile, Paul pushes Ann, whose hands have been tied with tape behind her back, onto a sofa that is some space away from George, and ties her ankles with tape before going out to search for Georgie, leaving Peter to watch over the Farbers. Ann asks why they do not directly kill them, and Peter answers that they should not forget the fun of the games. When Peter goes to kitchen to get eggs, Ann jumps to George but George fails to untie her before Peter comes back, and Peter beats her and breaks the eggs again. Ann begs Peter to let them go, but he refuses. Georgie finds a shotgun in the neighbors' house and Paul tells him to go ahead and shoot him with it, but the gun fails to go off. Paul returns him to the living room, and gives the shotgun to Peter.\n\nThe men play a new game, saying whoever gets counted out will be shot. While Paul is in the kitchen getting something to eat, Georgie panics and runs, which results in Peter shooting and killing him. Paul berates Peter for being trigger-happy, and the two men decide to briefly leave. George and Ann are grief-stricken over their loss, but they eventually resolve to survive. Ann is able to free herself and flee the house while George desperately tries to make a call on the malfunctioning phone. Ann fails to find help, only to be re-captured by Peter and Paul, who bring her back to the house.\n\nAfter stabbing George, they tell Ann to say a prayer before making a choice for her husband; a painful and prolonged death with the \"little\" knife, or a quick and brutal death with the \"big\" shotgun. While Paul is talking, Ann seizes the shotgun on the table in front of her and kills Peter. An enraged Paul grabs the shotgun and starts looking for the television remote. Upon finding it, he rewinds the last occurrences back to a moment before Ann grabs the shotgun, breaking the [[fourth wall]]. On the \"do over\", Paul snatches the shotgun away before she can grab it and admonishes her, saying she is not allowed to break the rules.\n\nPeter and Paul kill George and take Ann, bound and gagged, out onto the family's boat. Ann tries to free herself, but is caught by Paul and Peter. Around eight o'clock in the morning, they nonchalantly throw her into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock on the door of the Thompsons' house and request some eggs. The film ends with Paul glancing at the camera with a smirk.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as Ann Farber\n*[[Tim Roth]] as George Farber\n*[[Michael Pitt]] as Paul\n*[[Brady Corbet]] as Peter\n*[[Devon Gearhart]] as Georgie Farber\n*[[Boyd Gaines]] as Fred, the Farbers' neighbor\n*[[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] as Betsy Thompson\n*[[Robert LuPone]] as Robert Thompson\n*Susanne Haneke as Betsy's sister-in-law\n*Linda Moran as Eve\n\nFor 2007's American remake, the character of Gerda was renamed \"Betsy\", the second family to fall victim to Paul and Peter were given the surname \"Farber\" and the third family were given the surname \"Thompson\".\n\n==Development==\n[[Michael Haneke]] wanted to make a film set in the United States, but for practical reasons he had to set the [[Funny Games (1997 film)|original 1997 film]] in Austria.<ref name=CineasteFG>Koehler, Robert. \"[http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Funny Games].\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131002065215/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Archive]) ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''.

Meanwhile, Paul pushes Ann, whose hands have been tied with tape behind her back, onto a sofa that is some space away from George, and ties her ankles with tape before going out to search for Georgie, leaving Peter to watch over the Fabers. Ann asks why they do not directly kill them, and Peter answers that they should not forget the fun of the games. When Peter goes to kitchen to get eggs, Ann jumps to George but George fails to untie her before Peter comes back, and Peter beats her and breaks the eggs again. Ann begs Peter to let them go, but he refuses. Georgie finds a shotgun in the neighbors' house and Paul tells him to go ahead and shoot him with it, but the gun fails to go off. Paul returns him to the living room, and gives the shotgun to Peter.\n\nThe men play a new game, saying whoever gets counted out will be shot. While Paul is in the kitchen getting something to eat, Georgie panics and runs, which results in Peter shooting and killing him. Paul berates Peter for being trigger-happy, and the two men decide to briefly leave. George and Ann are grief-stricken over their loss, but they eventually resolve to survive. Ann is able to free herself and flee the house while George desperately tries to make a call on the malfunctioning phone. Ann fails to find help, only to be re-captured by Peter and Paul, who bring her back to the house.\n\nAfter stabbing George, they tell Ann to say a prayer before making a choice for her husband; a painful and prolonged death with the \"little\" knife, or a quick and brutal death with the \"big\" shotgun. While Paul is talking, Ann seizes the shotgun on the table in front of her and kills Peter. An enraged Paul grabs the shotgun and starts looking for the television remote. Upon finding it, he rewinds the last occurrences back to a moment before Ann grabs the shotgun, breaking the [[fourth wall]]. On the \"do over\", Paul snatches the shotgun away before she can grab it and admonishes her, saying she is not allowed to break the rules.\n\nPeter and Paul kill George and take Ann, bound and gagged, out onto the family's boat. Ann tries to free herself, but is caught by Paul and Peter. Around eight o'clock in the morning, they nonchalantly throw her into the water to drown, thus winning their bet. They knock on the door of the Thompsons' house and request some eggs. The film ends with Paul glancing at the camera with a smirk.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Naomi Watts]] as Ann Farber\n*[[Tim Roth]] as George Farber\n*[[Michael Pitt]] as Paul\n*[[Brady Corbet]] as Peter\n*[[Devon Gearhart]] as Georgie Farber\n*[[Boyd Gaines]] as Fred, the Farbers' neighbor\n*[[Siobhan Fallon Hogan]] as Betsy Thompson\n*[[Robert LuPone]] as Robert Thompson\n*Susanne Haneke as Betsy's sister-in-law\n*Linda Moran as Eve\n\nFor 2007's American remake, the character of Gerda was renamed \"Betsy\", the second family to fall victim to Paul and Peter were given the surname \"Farber\" and the third family were given the surname \"Thompson\".\n\n==Development==\n[[Michael Haneke]] wanted to make a film set in the United States, but for practical reasons he had to set the [[Funny Games (1997 film)|original 1997 film]] in Austria.<ref name=CineasteFG>Koehler, Robert. \"[http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Funny Games].\" ([https://web.archive.org/web/20131002065215/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/funny-games.htm Archive]) ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]''.

In 2006, many of the former [[Scottish Radio Holdings]] stations were added to the network and branded as ''Big City Network Scotland and Northern Ireland'', although all stations kept their original logos, with the exception of CFM, which took a version of the 'cog' logo used by other BCN stations in England. [[West Sound AM|West Sound]] was the only AM station in the network although it did not carry any of the networked programming carried by the FM stations.\n\nIn April 2011 Bauer Radio announced it would be restructuring its radio portfolio into two divisions: locally focused and heritage stations, including many of the Big City stations, South Coast station [[Wave 105]] and London station [[Magic 105.4 FM]] would also become part of the \"Bauer Place\" division, with branded music-category stations such as [[Kiss Network|Kiss]] and [[Kerrang Radio]] forming a second sub-brand, \"Bauer Passion\" \u2013 the Big City Network identity was dropped as part of the restructuring.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.6927.2 \"Bauer drops Big City image\", Radio Today, 14 Apr 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504000121/http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.6927.2 |date=4 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Bauer announced it would merge its two North East England stations, [[Metro Radio]] and [[TFM (radio)|TFM]]. Both stations broadcast shared programming from Newcastle and Manchester while carrying separate branding, news bulletins and advertising.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2013/04/tfm-leaves-teesside-to-share-with-metro/ TFM leaves Teesside to share with Metro], RadioToday, 5 April 2013</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, Bauer announced it would be restructuring its radio portfolio as from January 2015. Magic AM in England was dropped in favour of the stations reverting to their heritage station names.<ref>[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/radio-ops/formats/Greatest_Hits_Network_Change_request_form.pdf Greatest Hits Network Change request form] Ofcom</ref><ref>[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/radio-ops/formats/Magic_Changes_Ofcom_Request_Form.pdf Magic Changes Ofcom Request Form] Ofcom</ref> The stations now form part of the new 'City 2' network serving both Scotland and Northern England. A 'City 3' network on DAB replacing The Hits Radio (in most areas) launched on Monday 19 January 2015. As part of this restructuring, the Place and Passion network banners introduced in 2011 were replaced by the current Bauer City and Bauer National divisions. (The 'City 3' network was withdrawn in favour of reverting to the networked The Hits service from September 2017.)\n\nAt the beginning of March, 2016, Bauer moved two of its stations, Planet Rock and Absolute 80s, from [[Digital One]] onto the [[Sound Digital]] multiplex, reducing the availability of these stations (areas including East Anglia, the South West, parts of Kent, Cumbria, and large areas of Wales and Scotland had no Sound Digital network transmitters at all.)

On 1 March 2016, ''Planet Rock'' ceased being a fully national station due to the station transferring to the Sound Digital multiplex, which is not available across all of the UK. [[Devon]], [[Cornwall]], parts of [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[East Anglia]] and other areas of the UK will no longer be able to receive ''Planet Rock'' on DAB.\n\n* [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]]\n\n===Former Lincs FM Group stations===\n\nIn February 2019, Bauer purchased these stations from [[Lincs FM Group]]\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Lincs FM]] (Lincolnshire & Newark)\n* [[Compass FM]] (North East Lincolnshire)\n* [[Trax FM]] (Doncaster & Bassetlaw)\n* [[Dearne FM]] (Barnsley, Penistone and the Dearne Valley)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Rutland Radio]] (Stamford & Rutland)\n* [[Ridings FM]] (the Wakefield district)\n* [[Rother FM]] (Rotherham)\n* Suffolk First (Suffolk)\n{{col-end}}\n\n===The Breeze network===\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[The Breeze (South West)]]\n* [[The Breeze (Basingstoke & North Hampshire)]] \n* [[The Breeze (Bridgwater & West Somerset)]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[The Breeze (Yeovil & South Somerset)]] \n* [[The Breeze (North Dorset)]]\n* [[The Breeze 105.5 (South Devon)|The Breeze (South Devon)]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n===SAM FM stations===\n\n* [[Sam FM (Bristol)]]\n* [[Sam FM (Swindon)]]\n\n===Anglian stations and Fire Radio===\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Dream 100 FM]]    ([[Colchester]])\n* [[Town 102]]          ([[Ipswich]])\n* [[The Beach (radio station)|The Beach]]  ([[Great Yarmouth]]/[[Lowestoft]])\n{{col-2}}\n* [[North Norfolk Radio]]         ([[Cromer]]/[[Sheringham]])\n* [[Radio Norwich 99.9]]          ([[Norwich]])\n* [[Fire Radio]] ([[Bournemouth]]/[[Poole]])\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Former Wireless Group stations===\n\nOn 8 February 2019, it was announced that Bauer are to purchase the local stations from [[Wireless Group]]\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Radio Wave 96.5]]\n*[[Pulse 1]]\n*[[Pulse 2]]\n*[[Wish FM]]\n*[[Tower FM]]\n*[[Wire FM]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Peak FM (North Derbyshire)|Peak FM]]\n*[[Signal 1]]\n*[[Signal 2]]\n*[[Signal 107]]\n*[[96.4 The Wave]]\n*[[Swansea Sound]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Former UKRD Stations===\n\nOn 5 March 2019, it was announced that Bauer are to purchase the [[UKRD Group]].\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Eagle Radio]] \u2013 Surrey, northeast Hampshire\n*[[KL.FM 96.7]] \u2013 King's Lynn, Norfolk\n*[[Minster FM]] \u2013 York and North Yorkshire\n*[[Mix 96 (Aylesbury)|Mix 96]] \u2013 Aylesbury\n*[[Pirate FM 102]] \u2013 Cornwall\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Spire FM]] \u2013 Salisbury\n*[[Spirit FM (UK radio station)|Spirit FM]] \u2013 West Sussex\n*[[Stray FM]] \u2013 Harrogate, Ripon, Yorkshire Dales\n*[[Wessex FM]] \u2013 Dorset\n*[[Yorkshire Coast Radio]] \u2013 North and East Yorkshire\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Other stations===\n*'''[[Radio City Talk]]''' \u2013 a speech, sports and rock music radio station on AM & DAB in [[Liverpool]]\n*'''[[Wave 105]]''' \u2013 Hot AC regional radio station in [[Solent]], entire output and playlist is locally produced and takes no network programming, although is part of [[Hits Radio]] for advertising purposes.\n*'''[[Cool FM]]''' \u2013 [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] local radio station on FM in [[Belfast]] and DAB across [[Northern Ireland]], part of [[Hits Radio]] for advertising purposes.\n*'''[[Downtown Radio]]''' \u2013 [[Hot AC]] local radio station on AM/DAB in Belfast and FM/DAB in the rest of Northern Ireland, part of [[Hits Radio]] for advertising purposes.\n*'''[[Downtown Radio|Downtown Country]]''' \u2013 Dedicated digital country music station on DAB in Northern Ireland\n*'''[[Scala Radio]]''' \u2013 National [[classical music]] station broadcast digitally ([[Sound Digital]] and online) from 4 March 2019\n*'''Country Hits Radio''' - contemporary [[Country radio|country music radio]] service, available on DAB and online.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47531363 \"First nationwide country music radio station to launch in UK\", BBC, 2019-03-12]</ref>\n\n===Former stations===\n*'''[[3C (radio)|3C]]''' \u2013 country music station, based in Glasgow, acquired as part of SRH takeover, broadcast on DAB in various areas and Freeview nationally; closed 2007; replaced on Freeview by a relay of [[Clyde 1]] for a time.\n*'''[[Mojo (magazine)#Mojo Radio|Mojo Radio]]''' \u2013 classic rock, early pop, blues and soul; broadcast on digital TV and online; ceased broadcasting in 2008.\n*'''[[Q Radio]]''' \u2013 rock, alternative rock; broadcast nationally on Freeview and online; closed on 7 May 2013; replaced by [[Kisstory]].\n*'''[[Smash Hits Radio]]''' \u2013 contemporary pop hits; following its removal from DAB it continued over Freeview, until being withdrawn to release a slot for KissFresh\n\n==DAB multiplexes==\nBauer is a partner in one of the UK's national commercial multiplexes, operates twelve wholly owned local DAB multiplexes, and jointly owns a further three with [[Global Radio]]; the firm was also formerly a minority partner (of [[Wireless Group]]) for local services in three further areas.

The balloon release went ahead. Two leading diver journalists contacted Radio City 2's owner \u2013 [[Bauer Media Group]] \u2013 appealing for this practice to be stopped. Bauer Media confirmed that no company within the Group would conduct a balloon release in the future. An exception to this was made by Key 103 on 24 May 2017, 2 days after the Manchester Arena terror attack in memory of the 22 victims that died.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.xray-mag.com/content/bauer-media-stop-balloon-releases-within-group|title=Bauer Media To Stop 'Balloon Releases' Within The Group||date=9 January 2017|author=Rosemary E Lunn|periodical=X-Ray Mag}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bauerverlag.de/ Bauer Group]\n* [http://www.baueradvertising.co.uk/ Bauer Radio]\n\n{{Bauer}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[Category:Radio broadcasting companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Bauer Radio| ]]\n[[Category:Bauer Group (UK)]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=May 2013}}\n\n'''Bauer Radio''' is a UK-based radio division of the [[Bauer Media Group]]. \n{{Coord|53|24|13.9|N|2|59|33.9|W|display=title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = Bauer Radio Limited\n| logo             = Logo Bauer Media Group.svg\n| logo_size        = 170px\n| type             = [[Subsidiary]]\n| foundation       = 2008\n| location         = Media House, Peterborough Business Park, Peterborough, United Kingdon\n| industry         = [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n| revenue          = \n| operating_income = \n| net_income       = \n| parent           = [[Bauer Media Group]]\n| homepage         = {{url| https://www.bauermedia.co.uk/brands-radio}}\n| footnotes        = \n| area_served      = United Kingdom\n}}\n\nThe Bauer network is divisible into two main groups, the [[Hits Radio]] Network and Bauer National portfolios, with Hits Radio consisting of locally focused services primarily broadcast on FM and local digital-platforms to a given coverage area, and National consisting of national and quasi-national music-genre services delivered mainly through digital platforms, with some services also offered on FM/AM.\n\n==History==\n{{Further information|Timeline of Bauer Radio}}\n\nBauer's network of local FM stations was originally known as the ''Big City Network''. In 2006, many of the former [[Scottish Radio Holdings]] stations were added to the network and branded as ''Big City Network Scotland and Northern Ireland'', although all stations kept their original logos, with the exception of CFM, which took a version of the 'cog' logo used by other BCN stations in England. [[West Sound AM|West Sound]] was the only AM station in the network although it did not carry any of the networked programming carried by the FM stations.\n\nIn April 2011 Bauer Radio announced it would be restructuring its radio portfolio into two divisions: locally focused and heritage stations, including many of the Big City stations, South Coast station [[Wave 105]] and London station [[Magic 105.4 FM]] would also become part of the \"Bauer Place\" division, with branded music-category stations such as [[Kiss Network|Kiss]] and [[Kerrang Radio]] forming a second sub-brand, \"Bauer Passion\" \u2013 the Big City Network identity was dropped as part of the restructuring.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.6927.2 \"Bauer drops Big City image\", Radio Today, 14 Apr 2011] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504000121/http://radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.6927.2 |date=4 May 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2013, Bauer announced it would merge its two North East England stations, [[Metro Radio]] and [[TFM (radio)|TFM]]. Both stations broadcast shared programming from Newcastle and Manchester while carrying separate branding, news bulletins and advertising.<ref>[http://radiotoday.co.uk/2013/04/tfm-leaves-teesside-to-share-with-metro/ TFM leaves Teesside to share with Metro], RadioToday, 5 April 2013</ref>\n\nIn September 2014, Bauer announced it would be restructuring its radio portfolio as from January 2015. Magic AM in England was dropped in favour of the stations reverting to their heritage station names.<ref>[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/radio-ops/formats/Greatest_Hits_Network_Change_request_form.pdf Greatest Hits Network Change request form] Ofcom</ref><ref>[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/broadcast/radio-ops/formats/Magic_Changes_Ofcom_Request_Form.pdf Magic Changes Ofcom Request Form] Ofcom</ref> The stations now form part of the new 'City 2' network serving both Scotland and Northern England. A 'City 3' network on DAB replacing The Hits Radio (in most areas) launched on Monday 19 January 2015. As part of this restructuring, the Place and Passion network banners introduced in 2011 were replaced by the current Bauer City and Bauer National divisions. (The 'City 3' network was withdrawn in favour of reverting to the networked The Hits service from September 2017.)\n\nAt the beginning of March, 2016, Bauer moved two of its stations, Planet Rock and Absolute 80s, from [[Digital One]] onto the [[Sound Digital]] multiplex, reducing the availability of these stations (areas including East Anglia, the South West, parts of Kent, Cumbria, and large areas of Wales and Scotland had no Sound Digital network transmitters at all.) The issue was reported in local press in some areas<ref>http://www.edp24.co.uk/news/digital_radio_listeners_in_east_anglia_miss_out_on_18_dab_stations_1_4506913</ref> Planet Rock and Absolute 80s on D1 began broadcasting just a retune message loop from 18 April and the switch-off occurred on 30 April.\n\nOn 6 May 2016, Bauer announced it had bought Midlands radio group [[Orion Media]] for an undisclosed fee, reportedly between \u00a340 and \u00a350 million.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/06/bauer-buys-radio-group-orion-media \"Bauer buys radio group Orion Media\"], ''The Guardian'', 6 May 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2016/05/06/orion-media-sold-to-bauer-for-50m/ \"Orion Media sold to Bauer for \u00a350m\"], ''The Telegraph'', 6 May 2016</ref> It was subsequently confirmed that Orion's stations Free Radio (West Midlands) and Gem (East Midlands) would become part of the Bauer City portfolio, with Gem introducing a version of the City sonic logo device to its presentation from August 2016.\n\nOn 16 August 2018, Bauer announced that it had bought [[Jazz FM (UK)|Jazz FM]] for an undisclosed sum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.a516digital.com/2018/08/bauer-takes-over-at-jazz-fm-plans-to.html|title=Bauer takes over at Jazz FM; plans to enhance offering|date=2018-08-16|accessdate=2018-08-16|publisher=a516 Digital}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2019, Bauer purchased [[Lincs FM Group]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/02/bauer-media-acquires-lincs-fm-group/|title=Bauer Media acquires Lincs FM Group|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref>, [[Celador]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/02/bauer-media-continues-to-grow/|title=Bauer Media continues to grow with two acquisitions|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref> and the local stations owned by [[Wireless Group]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiotoday.co.uk/2019/02/bauer-buys-wireless-groups-local-radio-stations/|title=Bauer buys Wireless Group\u2019s local radio stations|publisher=|accessdate=8 February 2019}}</ref> and the following month Bauer purchased the ten FM stations owned by [[UKRD Group|UKRD]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bauermedia.co.uk/newsroom/press-releases/bauer-media-uk-to-acquire-ukrd-group|title=BAUER MEDIA UK TO ACQUIRE UKRD GROUP|website=Bauer Media|accessdate=10 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Stations==\n\n===Absolute===\nBauer purchased the '''Absolute Radio''' group of stations from TIML in 2013.

[[Devon]], [[Cornwall]], parts of [[Scotland]], [[Wales]], [[East Anglia]] and other areas of the UK will no longer be able to receive ''Planet Rock'' on DAB.\n\n* [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]]\n\n===Former Lincs FM Group stations===\n\nIn February 2019, Bauer purchased these stations from [[Lincs FM Group]]\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Lincs FM]] (Lincolnshire & Newark)\n* [[Compass FM]] (North East Lincolnshire)\n* [[Trax FM]] (Doncaster & Bassetlaw)\n* [[Dearne FM]] (Barnsley, Penistone and the Dearne Valley)\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Rutland Radio]] (Stamford & Rutland)\n* [[Ridings FM]] (the Wakefield district)\n* [[Rother FM]] (Rotherham)\n* Suffolk First (Suffolk)\n{{col-end}}\n\n===The Breeze network===\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[The Breeze (South West)]]\n* [[The Breeze (Basingstoke & North Hampshire)]] \n* [[The Breeze (Bridgwater & West Somerset)]]\n{{col-2}}\n* [[The Breeze (Yeovil & South Somerset)]] \n* [[The Breeze (North Dorset)]]\n* [[The Breeze 105.5 (South Devon)|The Breeze (South Devon)]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n===SAM FM stations===\n\n* [[Sam FM (Bristol)]]\n* [[Sam FM (Swindon)]]\n\n===Anglian stations and Fire Radio===\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Dream 100 FM]]    ([[Colchester]])\n* [[Town 102]]          ([[Ipswich]])\n* [[The Beach (radio station)|The Beach]]  ([[Great Yarmouth]]/[[Lowestoft]])\n{{col-2}}\n* [[North Norfolk Radio]]         ([[Cromer]]/[[Sheringham]])\n* [[Radio Norwich 99.9]]          ([[Norwich]])\n* [[Fire Radio]] ([[Bournemouth]]/[[Poole]])\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Former Wireless Group stations===\n\nOn 8 February 2019, it was announced that Bauer are to purchase the local stations from [[Wireless Group]]\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Radio Wave 96.5]]\n*[[Pulse 1]]\n*[[Pulse 2]]\n*[[Wish FM]]\n*[[Tower FM]]\n*[[Wire FM]]\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Peak FM (North Derbyshire)|Peak FM]]\n*[[Signal 1]]\n*[[Signal 2]]\n*[[Signal 107]]\n*[[96.4 The Wave]]\n*[[Swansea Sound]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Former UKRD Stations===\n\nOn 5 March 2019, it was announced that Bauer are to purchase the [[UKRD Group]].\n\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Eagle Radio]] \u2013 Surrey, northeast Hampshire\n*[[KL.FM 96.7]] \u2013 King's Lynn, Norfolk\n*[[Minster FM]] \u2013 York and North Yorkshire\n*[[Mix 96 (Aylesbury)|Mix 96]] \u2013 Aylesbury\n*[[Pirate FM 102]] \u2013 Cornwall\n{{col-2}}\n*[[Spire FM]] \u2013 Salisbury\n*[[Spirit FM (UK radio station)|Spirit FM]] \u2013 West Sussex\n*[[Stray FM]] \u2013 Harrogate, Ripon, Yorkshire Dales\n*[[Wessex FM]] \u2013 Dorset\n*[[Yorkshire Coast Radio]] \u2013 North and East Yorkshire\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Other stations===\n*'''[[Radio City Talk]]''' \u2013 a speech, sports and rock music radio station on AM & DAB in [[Liverpool]]\n*'''[[Wave 105]]''' \u2013 Hot AC regional radio station in [[Solent]], entire output and playlist is locally produced and takes no network programming, although is part of [[Hits Radio]] for advertising purposes.\n*'''[[Cool FM]]''' \u2013 [[Contemporary hit radio|CHR]] local radio station on FM in [[Belfast]] and DAB across [[Northern Ireland]], part of [[Hits Radio]] for advertising purposes.\n*'''[[Downtown Radio]]''' \u2013 [[Hot AC]] local radio station on AM/DAB in Belfast and FM/DAB in the rest of Northern Ireland, part of [[Hits Radio]] for advertising purposes.\n*'''[[Downtown Radio|Downtown Country]]''' \u2013 Dedicated digital country music station on DAB in Northern Ireland\n*'''[[Scala Radio]]''' \u2013 National [[classical music]] station broadcast digitally ([[Sound Digital]] and online) from 4 March 2019\n*'''Country Hits Radio''' - contemporary [[Country radio|country music radio]] service, available on DAB and online.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-47531363 \"First nationwide country music radio station to launch in UK\", BBC, 2019-03-12]</ref>\n\n===Former stations===\n*'''[[3C (radio)|3C]]''' \u2013 country music station, based in Glasgow, acquired as part of SRH takeover, broadcast on DAB in various areas and Freeview nationally; closed 2007; replaced on Freeview by a relay of [[Clyde 1]] for a time.\n*'''[[Mojo (magazine)#Mojo Radio|Mojo Radio]]''' \u2013 classic rock, early pop, blues and soul; broadcast on digital TV and online; ceased broadcasting in 2008.\n*'''[[Q Radio]]''' \u2013 rock, alternative rock; broadcast nationally on Freeview and online; closed on 7 May 2013; replaced by [[Kisstory]].\n*'''[[Smash Hits Radio]]''' \u2013 contemporary pop hits; following its removal from DAB it continued over Freeview, until being withdrawn to release a slot for KissFresh\n\n==DAB multiplexes==\nBauer is a partner in one of the UK's national commercial multiplexes, operates twelve wholly owned local DAB multiplexes, and jointly owns a further three with [[Global Radio]]; the firm was also formerly a minority partner (of [[Wireless Group]]) for local services in three further areas. Bauer operates the following [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]] multiplexes:\n\n===Sound Digital===\nBauer has a 30% holding in [[Sound Digital]], operator of the second national commercial DAB multiplex to launch in the UK; this began transmissions in spring 2016 and several Bauer stations broadcast on it, some transferred from other multiplexes. The other partners are [[Wireless Group]] (30%) and [[Arqiva]] (40%).\n\n===Bauer Digital Radio===\nBauer's wholly owned digital multiplexes are primarily located in areas where the firm operates local FM stations; the original group of Bauer (formerly Emap) DAB multiplexes are located in the following areas:\n\n*[[Central Lancashire]] \u2013 Bauer Central Lancashire\n*[[Humberside]] \u2013 Bauer Humberside\n*[[Leeds]] \u2013 Bauer Leeds\n*[[Liverpool]] \u2013 Bauer Liverpool\n*[[South Yorkshire]] \u2013 Bauer South Yorkshire\n*[[Teesside]] \u2013 Bauer Teesside\n*[[Tyne and Wear]] \u2013 Bauer Tyne & Wear\n\n===Score Digital===\nAs part of Emap's takeover of Scottish Radio Holdings, the firm gained control of Score Digital, the DAB multiplex operator owned by SRH. Competition guidelines required the merged firm to divest of one of the multiplexes obtained in this deal, and so the [[Ayr]] multiplex formerly run by Score was sold on to [[Arqiva]]. The remaining Score multiplexes have since been relabelled as Bauer multiplexes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wohnort.org/DAB/ukloc.html|title=DAB Ensembles WorldWide \u2013 UK Local & Minimuxes|work=wohnort.org}}</ref>\n\nThe ex-Score DAB multiplexes are located in:\n*[[Dundee]] \u2013 Score Dundee\n*[[Edinburgh]] \u2013 Score Edinburgh\n*[[Glasgow]] \u2013 Score Glasgow\n*[[Inverness]] \u2013 Score Inverness\n*[[Northern Ireland]] \u2013 Score Northern Ireland\n\n===Switchdigital===\nThe Wireless Group and Emap entered into a venture to run the following three DAB multiplexes. These multiplexes were initially branded as TWG-Emap multiplexes; following the sale of TWG to [[UTV Media|UTV]] (creating [[UTV Radio]]), the multiplexes were relabelled as UTV-Emap, and following the sale of Emap's radio assets to Bauer, the blocks were renamed again as UTV-Bauer. Bauer owned 30 per cent of the UTV-Bauer venture, but sold its stake in November 2013.<ref>[https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/555de2cc40f0b666a2000030/Bauer.pdf See 'End Notes' on page 28.]</ref> Now wholly owned by [[Wireless Group]], the business is known as Switchdigital.<ref>http://www.switchdigital.com/</ref>\n\n*[[Stoke-on-Trent]] \u2013 [[Stoke & Stafford (DAB Multiplex)]]\n*[[Swansea]] \u2013 [[Swansea SW Wales (DAB Multiplex)]]\n*[[West Yorkshire]] \u2013 [[Bradford & Huddersfield (DAB Multiplex)]]\n\n===CE Digital===\n[[Bauer Media Group|Bauer]] and [[Global Radio]] jointly own CE Digital Ltd, each holding 50% of the venture. The CE operation was established by Emap in partnership with the Capital Radio Group, which through mergers subsequently became part of [[GCap Media]] and later [[Global Radio]]. The 'CE' multiplexes take their name from the initials of '''C'''apital and '''E'''map, and have not been renamed despite the identity changes of both operators.\n\nCE Digital operate the following DAB multiplexes:\n\n* [[Birmingham]] \u2013 [[CE Birmingham]]\n* [[London]] \u2013 [[CE London]] (also known as Greater London I)\n* [[Manchester]] \u2013 [[CE Manchester]]\n\n==Controversy==\nIn 2008 Radio City 2 started annually releasing hundreds of balloons (with messages attached) from the roof of the Radio City 2 \"in memory of loved ones that we miss at Christmas time.\"\nThis practice continued on an annual basis until December 2016. On 22 December Radio City 2 and [[Pete Price]] \u2013 a radio presenter at Radio City 2 \u2013 were contacted by numerous scuba divers and environmentally savvy members of the public begging them to cancel the planned mass balloon release at midnight on 22 December. The balloon release went ahead. Two leading diver journalists contacted Radio City 2's owner \u2013 [[Bauer Media Group]] \u2013 appealing for this practice to be stopped. Bauer Media confirmed that no company within the Group would conduct a balloon release in the future. An exception to this was made by Key 103 on 24 May 2017, 2 days after the Manchester Arena terror attack in memory of the 22 victims that died.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.xray-mag.com/content/bauer-media-stop-balloon-releases-within-group|title=Bauer Media To Stop 'Balloon Releases' Within The Group||date=9 January 2017|author=Rosemary E Lunn|periodical=X-Ray Mag}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.bauerverlag.de/ Bauer Group]\n* [http://www.baueradvertising.co.uk/ Bauer Radio]\n\n{{Bauer}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom}}\n\n[[Category:Radio broadcasting companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Bauer Radio| ]]\n[[Category:Bauer Group (UK)]]\n", "name_user": "2a02:c7f:d216:9200:c8ef:a1f1:62d5:cf3c", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eBauer Digital Radio)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bauer_Radio"}

Streisand was invited to sing at weddings and summer camp, along with having an unsuccessful audition at MGM records when she was nine.

During one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping at the home of friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around. When desperate, she returned to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother was horrified by her daughter's \"gypsy-like lifestyle\", wrote biographer [[Karen Swenson]], and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business,<ref name=Nickens />{{rp|6}} but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: \"My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I ''could'' be a star.\"<ref name=Nickens />{{rp|6}}\n\nShe took a job as an usher at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater for ''The Sound of Music'' early in 1960.

Her early works in the 1960s (her debut ''[[The Barbra Streisand Album]]'', ''[[The Second Barbra Streisand Album]]'', ''[[The Third Album (Barbra Streisand album)|The Third Album]]'', ''[[My Name Is Barbra]]'', etc.) are considered classic renditions of theatre and cabaret standards, including her pensive version of the normally uptempo \"[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]\". She performed this in a duet with Judy Garland on ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''.  Garland referred to her on the air as one of the last great [[belting (music)|belters]].  They also sang \"[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]\" with [[Ethel Merman]] joining them.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7AViKc52P0 Barbra Streisand, Judy Garland, and Ethel Merman on \"The Judy Garland Show\"], 1963</ref>\n\n[[File:Barbra Streisand singing- 1969.jpg|thumb|left|On ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969]]\nBeginning with ''My Name Is Barbra'', her early albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, but like many talented singers of the day, she found herself out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented [[Richard Perry]]-produced album ''[[Stoney End (Barbra Streisand album)|Stoney End]]'' in 1971. The [[Stoney End (song)|title track]], written by [[Laura Nyro]], was a major hit for Streisand.\n\nDuring the 1970s, she was also highly prominent on the pop charts, with Top 10 recordings such as \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\" (US No. 1), \"[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)]]\" (US No. 1), \"[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]\" (1979, with [[Donna Summer]]), which {{as of|2010|lc=y}} is reportedly still the most commercially successful duet, (US No. 1), \"[[You Don't Bring Me Flowers]]\" (with [[Neil Diamond]]) (US No. 1) and \"The Main Event\" (US No. 3), some of which came from soundtrack recordings of her films. As the 1970s ended, Streisand was named the most successful female singer in the U.S. \u2013 only [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]] had sold more albums.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp|title=The American Recording Industry Announces its Artists of the Century|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514091340/http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp|date=November 10, 2009|archivedate=May 14, 2007|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1980, she released her best-selling effort to date, the [[Barry Gibb]]-produced ''[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand album)|Guilty]]''. The album contained the hits \"[[Woman in Love]]\" (which spent several weeks on top of the pop charts in the fall of 1980), \"[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb song)|Guilty]]\", and \"[[What Kind of Fool]]\".\n\nAfter years of largely ignoring Broadway and traditional pop music in favor of more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots with 1985's ''[[The Broadway Album]]'', which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks, and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]], who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. ''The Broadway Album'' was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album ''[[One Voice (Barbra Streisand album)|One Voice]]'' in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of [[Rupert Holmes]], including \"[[On My Own (Les Mis\u00e9rables)|On My Own]]\" (from ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''), a medley of \"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\" and \"Heather on the Hill\" (from ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Brigadoon]]'', respectively), \"[[All I Ask of You]]\" (from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''), \"Warm All Over\" (from ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'') and an unusual solo version of \"[[Make Our Garden Grow]]\" (from ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]''). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only \"Warm All Over\" and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of \"All I Ask of You\" were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, ''[[Till I Loved You (album)|Till I Loved You]]''. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, ''Just for the Record'', was released. A compilation spanning Streisand's entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities and previously unreleased material.\n\n[[File:Barbra Streisand Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Streisand taping her TV Special ''Barbra Streisand ... and other Musical Instruments'' in 1973]]\nThe following year, Streisand's concert fundraising events helped propel President [[Bill Clinton]] into the spotlight and into office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newfield|first=Jack|url=http://barbra-archives.com/bjs_library/90s/george_1996.html|title=Diva Democracy|work=George|date=November 1996|publisher=Barbra-archives.com|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> Streisand later introduced Clinton at his inauguration in 1993. Streisand's music career, however, was largely on hold. A 1992 appearance at an APLA benefit as well as the aforementioned inaugural performance hinted that Streisand was becoming more receptive to the idea of live performances. A tour was suggested, though Streisand would not immediately commit to it, citing her well-known stage fright as well as security concerns. During this time, Streisand finally returned to the recording studio and released ''[[Back to Broadway]]'' in June 1993. The album was not as universally lauded as its predecessor, but it did debut at No. 1 on the pop charts (a rare feat for an artist of Streisand's age, especially given that it relegated [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Janet (album)|Janet]]'' to the No. 2 spot). One of the album's highlights was a medley of \"[[I Have A Love/One Hand, One Heart|I Have A Love\" / \"One Hand, One Heart]]\", a duet with [[Johnny Mathis]], who Streisand said is one of her favorite singers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Allison J.|title=The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KkkPwXeGZkC&pg=PA14|accessdate=December 13, 2012|year=2001|publisher=[[Kensington Books|Citadel Press]]|isbn=0-8065-2218-6|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Nudd|first1=Tim|last2=Wihlborg|first2=Ulrica|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20590521,00.html|title=Barbra Streisand Celebrates 70th Birthday with John Travolta & Celeb Pals|date=April 26, 2012|work=People|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, ''The New York Times'' music critic [[Stephen Holden]] wrote that Streisand \"enjoys a cultural status that only one other American entertainer, Frank Sinatra, has achieved in the last half century\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/arts/recordings-view-barbra-streisand-mixes-star-power-and-high-concept.html|title=Barbra Streisand Mixes Star Power And High Concept|first=Stephen|last=Holden|work=The New York Times|date=June 27, 1993|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> In September 1993, Streisand announced her first public concert appearances in 27 years (if one does not count her Las Vegas nightclub performances between 1969 and 1972). What began as a two-night New Year's event at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] led to a multi-city tour in the summer of 1994. Tickets for the tour were sold out in under an hour. Streisand also appeared on the covers of major magazines in anticipation of what ''Time magazine'' named \"The Music Event of the Century\". The tour was one of the biggest all-media merchandise parlays in history. Ticket prices ranged from US$50 to US$1,500, making Streisand the highest-paid concert performer in history. ''[[The Concert (Barbra Streisand album)|Barbra Streisand: The Concert]]'' went on to be the top-grossing concert of the year and earned five [[Emmy Awards]] and the [[Peabody Award]], while the taped broadcast on [[HBO]] was the highest-rated concert special in HBO's 30-year history.  Following the tour's conclusion, Streisand once again kept a low profile musically, instead focusing her efforts on acting and directing duties as well as a burgeoning romance with actor [[James Brolin]].\n\nIn 1996, Streisand released \"[[I Finally Found Someone]]\" as a duet with Canadian singer and songwriter [[Bryan Adams]]. The song was nominated for an Oscar as it was part of the soundtrack of Streisand's self-directed movie ''[[The Mirror Has Two Faces]]''. It reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was her first significant hit in almost a decade and her first top 10 hit on the Hot 100 (and first gold single) since 1981.\n\nIn 1997, she finally returned to the recording studio, releasing ''[[Higher Ground (Barbra Streisand album)|Higher Ground]]'', a collection of songs of a loosely inspirational nature which also featured a duet with [[C\u00e9line Dion]]. The album received generally favorable reviews and once again debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts. Following her marriage to Brolin in 1998, Streisand recorded an album of love songs entitled ''[[A Love Like Ours]]'' the following year. Reviews were mixed, with many critics complaining about the somewhat syrupy sentiments and overly-lush arrangements; however, it did produce a modest hit for Streisand in the country-tinged \"If You Ever Leave Me\", a duet with [[Vince Gill]].\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1999, Streisand returned to the concert stage, selling out in the first few hours, eight months before her return.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbrastreisand.com/us/biography|title=Biography|publisher=barbrastreisand.com|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref> At the end of the millennium, she was the number one female singer in the U.S., with at least two No. 1 albums in each decade since she began performing. A two-disc live album of the concert entitled ''[[Timeless: Live in Concert]]'' was released in 2000. Streisand performed versions of the ''Timeless'' concert in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in early 2000. In advance of four concerts (two each in Los Angeles and New York) in September 2000, Streisand announced that she was retiring from playing public concerts. Her performance of the song \"[[People (1964 song)|People]]\" was broadcast on the Internet via America Online.\n\nStreisand's most recent albums have been ''[[Christmas Memories]]'' (2001), a somewhat somber collection of holiday songs, and ''[[The Movie Album (Barbra Streisand album)|The Movie Album]]'' (2003), featuring famous film themes and backed by a large symphony orchestra. ''[[Guilty Pleasures (Barbra Streisand album)|Guilty Pleasures]]'' (called ''Guilty Too'' in the UK), a collaboration with Barry Gibb and a sequel to their ''Guilty'', was released worldwide in 2005.\n\n[[File:Barbra-streisand07 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Streisand performing in July 2007 at [[The O2 Arena]] in London]]\n\nIn February 2006, Streisand recorded the song \"Smile\" alongside [[Tony Bennett]] at Streisand's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home. The song is included on Bennett's 80th birthday album, ''[[Duets (Barbra Streisand album)|Duets]]''. In September 2006, the pair filmed a live performance of the song for a special directed by [[Rob Marshall]] entitled ''Tony Bennett: An American Classic''. The special aired on NBC November 21, 2006, and was released on DVD the same day. Streisand's duet with Bennett opened the special. In 2006, Streisand announced her intent to tour again, in an effort to raise money and awareness for multiple issues. After four days of rehearsal at the [[Sovereign Bank Arena]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the tour began on October 4 at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wachovia Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], continued with a featured stop in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], (this was the concert Streisand chose to film for a TV special), and concluded at Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 20, 2006. Special guests [[Il Divo]] were interwoven throughout the show. The show was known as ''[[Streisand: The Tour]]''.\n\nStreisand's 20-concert tour set box-office records. At the age of 64, she grossed $92,457,062 and set house gross records in 14 of the 16 arenas played on the tour. She set the third-place record for her show of October 9, 2006 at Madison Square Garden, the first- and second-place records, of which are held by her two shows in September 2000. She set the second-place record at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] with her December 31, 1999, show being the house record and highest-grossing concert of all time. This led many people to openly criticize Streisand for [[price gouging]] as many tickets sold for upwards of $1,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/magazine/the-big-city-scalping-fair-and-square.html|title=The Big City; Scalping, Fair and Square|work=The New York Times|date=June 26, 1994|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA collection of performances culled from different stops on this tour, ''[[Live in Concert 2006]]'', debuted at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Streisand's 29th Top 10 album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052029/chart-beat-chat|title=Chart Beat Chat|work=Billboard|date=July 7, 2007|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> In the summer of 2007, Streisand gave concerts for the first time in continental Europe.

During one period, she lacked a permanent address, and found herself sleeping at the home of friends or anywhere else she could set up the army cot she carried around. When desperate, she returned to her mother's flat in Brooklyn for a home-cooked meal. However, her mother was horrified by her daughter's \"gypsy-like lifestyle\", wrote biographer [[Karen Swenson]], and again begged her to give up trying to get into show business,<ref name=Nickens />{{rp|6}} but Streisand took her mother's pleadings as even more reason to keep trying: \"My desires were strengthened by wanting to prove to my mother that I ''could'' be a star.\"<ref name=Nickens />{{rp|6}}\n\nShe took a job as an usher at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater for ''The Sound of Music'' early in 1960.

Her early works in the 1960s (her debut ''[[The Barbra Streisand Album]]'', ''[[The Second Barbra Streisand Album]]'', ''[[The Third Album (Barbra Streisand album)|The Third Album]]'', ''[[My Name Is Barbra]]'', etc.) are considered classic renditions of theatre and cabaret standards, including her pensive version of the normally uptempo \"[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]\". She performed this in a duet with Judy Garland on ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''.  Garland referred to her on the air as one of the last great [[belting (music)|belters]].  They also sang \"[[There's No Business Like Show Business]]\" with [[Ethel Merman]] joining them.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W7AViKc52P0 Barbra Streisand, Judy Garland, and Ethel Merman on \"The Judy Garland Show\"], 1963</ref>\n\n[[File:Barbra Streisand singing- 1969.jpg|thumb|left|On ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in 1969]]\nBeginning with ''My Name Is Barbra'', her early albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, but like many talented singers of the day, she found herself out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented [[Richard Perry]]-produced album ''[[Stoney End (Barbra Streisand album)|Stoney End]]'' in 1971. The [[Stoney End (song)|title track]], written by [[Laura Nyro]], was a major hit for Streisand.\n\nDuring the 1970s, she was also highly prominent on the pop charts, with Top 10 recordings such as \"[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]\" (US No. 1), \"[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)]]\" (US No. 1), \"[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]\" (1979, with [[Donna Summer]]), which {{as of|2010|lc=y}} is reportedly still the most commercially successful duet, (US No. 1), \"[[You Don't Bring Me Flowers]]\" (with [[Neil Diamond]]) (US No. 1) and \"The Main Event\" (US No. 3), some of which came from soundtrack recordings of her films. As the 1970s ended, Streisand was named the most successful female singer in the U.S. \u2013 only [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]] had sold more albums.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp|title=The American Recording Industry Announces its Artists of the Century|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070514091340/http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp|date=November 10, 2009|archivedate=May 14, 2007|publisher=Recording Industry Association of America|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1980, she released her best-selling effort to date, the [[Barry Gibb]]-produced ''[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand album)|Guilty]]''. The album contained the hits \"[[Woman in Love]]\" (which spent several weeks on top of the pop charts in the fall of 1980), \"[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb song)|Guilty]]\", and \"[[What Kind of Fool]]\".\n\nAfter years of largely ignoring Broadway and traditional pop music in favor of more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots with 1985's ''[[The Broadway Album]]'', which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks, and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]], who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. ''The Broadway Album'' was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year and handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album ''[[One Voice (Barbra Streisand album)|One Voice]]'' in 1986, Streisand was set to release another album of Broadway songs in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of [[Rupert Holmes]], including \"[[On My Own (Les Mis\u00e9rables)|On My Own]]\" (from ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables (musical)|Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''), a medley of \"How Are Things in Glocca Morra?\" and \"Heather on the Hill\" (from ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Brigadoon]]'', respectively), \"[[All I Ask of You]]\" (from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''), \"Warm All Over\" (from ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'') and an unusual solo version of \"[[Make Our Garden Grow]]\" (from ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]''). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was scrapped. Only \"Warm All Over\" and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of \"All I Ask of You\" were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, ''[[Till I Loved You (album)|Till I Loved You]]''. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, ''Just for the Record'', was released. A compilation spanning Streisand's entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities and previously unreleased material.\n\n[[File:Barbra Streisand Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Streisand taping her TV Special ''Barbra Streisand ... and other Musical Instruments'' in 1973]]\nThe following year, Streisand's concert fundraising events helped propel President [[Bill Clinton]] into the spotlight and into office.<ref>{{cite web|last=Newfield|first=Jack|url=http://barbra-archives.com/bjs_library/90s/george_1996.html|title=Diva Democracy|work=George|date=November 1996|publisher=Barbra-archives.com|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> Streisand later introduced Clinton at his inauguration in 1993. Streisand's music career, however, was largely on hold. A 1992 appearance at an APLA benefit as well as the aforementioned inaugural performance hinted that Streisand was becoming more receptive to the idea of live performances. A tour was suggested, though Streisand would not immediately commit to it, citing her well-known stage fright as well as security concerns. During this time, Streisand finally returned to the recording studio and released ''[[Back to Broadway]]'' in June 1993. The album was not as universally lauded as its predecessor, but it did debut at No. 1 on the pop charts (a rare feat for an artist of Streisand's age, especially given that it relegated [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Janet (album)|Janet]]'' to the No. 2 spot). One of the album's highlights was a medley of \"[[I Have A Love/One Hand, One Heart|I Have A Love\" / \"One Hand, One Heart]]\", a duet with [[Johnny Mathis]], who Streisand said is one of her favorite singers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Waldman|first=Allison J.|title=The Barbra Streisand Scrapbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-KkkPwXeGZkC&pg=PA14|accessdate=December 13, 2012|year=2001|publisher=[[Kensington Books|Citadel Press]]|isbn=0-8065-2218-6|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Nudd|first1=Tim|last2=Wihlborg|first2=Ulrica|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20590521,00.html|title=Barbra Streisand Celebrates 70th Birthday with John Travolta & Celeb Pals|date=April 26, 2012|work=People|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, ''The New York Times'' music critic [[Stephen Holden]] wrote that Streisand \"enjoys a cultural status that only one other American entertainer, Frank Sinatra, has achieved in the last half century\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/arts/recordings-view-barbra-streisand-mixes-star-power-and-high-concept.html|title=Barbra Streisand Mixes Star Power And High Concept|first=Stephen|last=Holden|work=The New York Times|date=June 27, 1993|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}</ref> In September 1993, Streisand announced her first public concert appearances in 27 years (if one does not count her Las Vegas nightclub performances between 1969 and 1972). What began as a two-night New Year's event at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] led to a multi-city tour in the summer of 1994. Tickets for the tour were sold out in under an hour. Streisand also appeared on the covers of major magazines in anticipation of what ''Time magazine'' named \"The Music Event of the Century\". The tour was one of the biggest all-media merchandise parlays in history. Ticket prices ranged from US$50 to US$1,500, making Streisand the highest-paid concert performer in history. ''[[The Concert (Barbra Streisand album)|Barbra Streisand: The Concert]]'' went on to be the top-grossing concert of the year and earned five [[Emmy Awards]] and the [[Peabody Award]], while the taped broadcast on [[HBO]] was the highest-rated concert special in HBO's 30-year history.  Following the tour's conclusion, Streisand once again kept a low profile musically, instead focusing her efforts on acting and directing duties as well as a burgeoning romance with actor [[James Brolin]].\n\nIn 1996, Streisand released \"[[I Finally Found Someone]]\" as a duet with Canadian singer and songwriter [[Bryan Adams]]. The song was nominated for an Oscar as it was part of the soundtrack of Streisand's self-directed movie ''[[The Mirror Has Two Faces]]''. It reached #8 on the Billboard Hot 100, and was her first significant hit in almost a decade and her first top 10 hit on the Hot 100 (and first gold single) since 1981.\n\nIn 1997, she finally returned to the recording studio, releasing ''[[Higher Ground (Barbra Streisand album)|Higher Ground]]'', a collection of songs of a loosely inspirational nature which also featured a duet with [[C\u00e9line Dion]]. The album received generally favorable reviews and once again debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts. Following her marriage to Brolin in 1998, Streisand recorded an album of love songs entitled ''[[A Love Like Ours]]'' the following year. Reviews were mixed, with many critics complaining about the somewhat syrupy sentiments and overly-lush arrangements; however, it did produce a modest hit for Streisand in the country-tinged \"If You Ever Leave Me\", a duet with [[Vince Gill]].\n\nOn New Year's Eve 1999, Streisand returned to the concert stage, selling out in the first few hours, eight months before her return.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barbrastreisand.com/us/biography|title=Biography|publisher=barbrastreisand.com|accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref> At the end of the millennium, she was the number one female singer in the U.S., with at least two No. 1 albums in each decade since she began performing. A two-disc live album of the concert entitled ''[[Timeless: Live in Concert]]'' was released in 2000. Streisand performed versions of the ''Timeless'' concert in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in early 2000. In advance of four concerts (two each in Los Angeles and New York) in September 2000, Streisand announced that she was retiring from playing public concerts. Her performance of the song \"[[People (1964 song)|People]]\" was broadcast on the Internet via America Online.\n\nStreisand's most recent albums have been ''[[Christmas Memories]]'' (2001), a somewhat somber collection of holiday songs, and ''[[The Movie Album (Barbra Streisand album)|The Movie Album]]'' (2003), featuring famous film themes and backed by a large symphony orchestra. ''[[Guilty Pleasures (Barbra Streisand album)|Guilty Pleasures]]'' (called ''Guilty Too'' in the UK), a collaboration with Barry Gibb and a sequel to their ''Guilty'', was released worldwide in 2005.\n\n[[File:Barbra-streisand07 (cropped).jpg|alt=|thumb|Streisand performing in July 2007 at [[The O2 Arena]] in London]]\n\nIn February 2006, Streisand recorded the song \"Smile\" alongside [[Tony Bennett]] at Streisand's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home. The song is included on Bennett's 80th birthday album, ''[[Duets (Barbra Streisand album)|Duets]]''. In September 2006, the pair filmed a live performance of the song for a special directed by [[Rob Marshall]] entitled ''Tony Bennett: An American Classic''. The special aired on NBC November 21, 2006, and was released on DVD the same day. Streisand's duet with Bennett opened the special. In 2006, Streisand announced her intent to tour again, in an effort to raise money and awareness for multiple issues. After four days of rehearsal at the [[Sovereign Bank Arena]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], the tour began on October 4 at the [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wachovia Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], continued with a featured stop in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], (this was the concert Streisand chose to film for a TV special), and concluded at Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 20, 2006. Special guests [[Il Divo]] were interwoven throughout the show. The show was known as ''[[Streisand: The Tour]]''.\n\nStreisand's 20-concert tour set box-office records. At the age of 64, she grossed $92,457,062 and set house gross records in 14 of the 16 arenas played on the tour. She set the third-place record for her show of October 9, 2006 at Madison Square Garden, the first- and second-place records, of which are held by her two shows in September 2000. She set the second-place record at [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]] with her December 31, 1999, show being the house record and highest-grossing concert of all time. This led many people to openly criticize Streisand for [[price gouging]] as many tickets sold for upwards of $1,000.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tierney|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/26/magazine/the-big-city-scalping-fair-and-square.html|title=The Big City; Scalping, Fair and Square|work=The New York Times|date=June 26, 1994|accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nA collection of performances culled from different stops on this tour, ''[[Live in Concert 2006]]'', debuted at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Streisand's 29th Top 10 album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052029/chart-beat-chat|title=Chart Beat Chat|work=Billboard|date=July 7, 2007|accessdate=July 26, 2012}}</ref> In the summer of 2007, Streisand gave concerts for the first time in continental Europe.

One of the runners is steerable. Originally, such craft were boats with a support structure, riding on the runners and steered with a rear blade, as with a conventional rudder. As iceboats evolved, the structure became a frame with a seat or cockpit for the iceboat sailor, resting on runners. Steering was shifted to the front. \n\nBecause of their low resistance to forward motion over ice, iceboats are capable of speeds exceeding {{Convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=}}. Because of their speed, iceboats are used both for recreation and for racing. Racing craft typically carry one person.\n\nA related activity, [[land sailing]], employs sailing craft similar to iceboats, but riding on wheels instead of runners.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ice boat (Quebec).jpg|thumb|Ice boat on [[Saint Lawrence River]], [[Quebec City]], ca 1858-1860]]\n[[File:Ice yachters on Hudson River near Barrytown, NY.jpg|thumb|right|Classic iceboats on the [[Hudson River]] at [[Barrytown, New York|Barrytown, NY]]|alt=Several boats with their sails at various stages of dismantling surrounding a large vehicle with a wooded promontory behind them.

Initially boats were used for commerce, but soon evolved into pleasure craft\u2014\"ice yachts\". Ice sailing came to North America, where the sailing craft evolved into recreational and racing versions.\n\n=== Venues ===\nIceboating began in the 17th century as a documented means of transport on the frozen Gulf of Riga and the canals of the Netherlands into the 18th century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/iceboating|title=Iceboating {{!}} sport|last=Editors|first=|date=February 17, 2020|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> Ice boats carried cargo on Dutch canals during the 17th century.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=Spectre|first=Peter H.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/173009383|title=A mariner's book of days, 2007|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|year=|isbn=1-57409-226-X|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|pages=|oclc=173009383}}</ref> \n\nThe first iceboats were introduced on New York State's Hudson River in the United States in 1790, where the practice flourished as a sport. The first recorded boat, built in 1790 by Oliver Booth of Poughkeepsie, was a square box atop three runners, the two forward runners being nailed to the box and the third acted as a rudder operated by a tiller.

Boats were as long as {{Convert|69|ft|m|abbr=}} and sailed as fast as {{Convert|107|mi/h|km/h|abbr=}}, a record exceeding any other conveyance in 1885, set by the ''[[Icicle (yacht)|Icicle]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> The first American Challenge Pennant occurred in 1881 on the Hudson river with five ice-yacht clubs competing. Races were sailed five times around a triangular course with one-mile legs, two of which were to windward.

In Canada, there were venues on [[Lake Ontario]] (Kingston) and the [[Saint Lawrence River]].<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nA European ice sailing club formed first in Sweden (1901), followed by the European Ice Yachting Union, which formed in 1928 with member states Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Sweden, Austria, and Germany.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:Vinckboons Landscape with skaters.jpg|thumb|Dutch Iceboats, 17th century]]\n17th-century Dutch ice yachts consisted of flat-bottomed sailboats atop a cross-wise plank, resting on outboard metal runners, which carried the bulk of the weight of the craft. At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.<ref name=\":03\" /> In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. The ''Robert Scott'', designed and built by H. Relyea, had a single backbone and wire guy-ropes. The mast on subsequent boats were stepped further forward than in the past with shortened jibs were shortened and the center of effort and resistance brought into balance, aligning both with the main runners.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/03/07/as-the-hudson-river-freezes-over-classic-ice-yachts-emerge/|title=As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge|last=Fisher|first=Daniel|date=March 7, 2014|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The shallow cockpit box became elliptical.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the early 1900s some smaller iceboats, called ''scooters'', were designed to traverse both ice and water with a shallow, oval {{Convert|15*5|ft|m|abbr=}} hull on fixed runners. These sailing craft were steered by manipulating the sails, there being no rudder.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe traditional stern-steerer boats were largely replaced by front steering boats in the 1930s, following the development of this style by Walter Beauvois of [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]] in a boat named the ''Beau Skeeter''.<ref name=\":4\" /> This boat led to the \"Skeeter\" class, and the ''Skeeter Ice Boat Club'' formed on [[Geneva Lake]], Wisconsin. The Skeeter class adopted the logo of a mosquito on their sail, and has evolved into an [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamically clean]] machine.

Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop [[Forces on sails|propulsive lift]].

At the stern was a steering runner, attached to a rudder-like structure. to which are affixed four steel runners, one each at bow, stern and each end of the planking. These boats used conventional gaff mainsails and jibs, attached to the mast by travellers. A tiller or wheel stern controls the steering runner.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 19th century iceboats evolved into a box, riding on cross-pieces, supported by runners. These \"stern-steerer\" iceboats were generally rigged as [[sloop]]s, with a [[jib]] sail forward of the mast, although the [[catboat]] style with a single sail was also used.<ref name=\":03\" /> In 1879 the archetypical Hudson River iceboat began to emerge. The ''Robert Scott'', designed and built by H. Relyea, had a single backbone and wire guy-ropes. The mast on subsequent boats were stepped further forward than in the past with shortened jibs were shortened and the center of effort and resistance brought into balance, aligning both with the main runners.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielfisher/2014/03/07/as-the-hudson-river-freezes-over-classic-ice-yachts-emerge/|title=As The Hudson River Freezes, Classic Ice Yachts Emerge|last=Fisher|first=Daniel|date=March 7, 2014|website=Forbes|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The shallow cockpit box became elliptical.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the early 1900s some smaller iceboats, called ''scooters'', were designed to traverse both ice and water with a shallow, oval {{Convert|15*5|ft|m|abbr=}} hull on fixed runners.

Runners are made of iron or steel and sharpened to a fine edge, most often cut to an angled edge of 90 degrees, which holds onto the ice, preventing slippage sideways from the lateral force of the wind developed by the sails, as they develop [[Forces on sails|propulsive lift]]. Given their low forward resistance, iceboats can sail up to ten times the speed of the true wind. Because the velocity of the iceboat (V<sub>B</sub>) is so much greater than the true wind velocity (V<sub>T</sub>), the apparent wind (V<sub>A</sub>) is only a few degrees from the direction of travel on most [[Point of sail|points of sail]] and the sail is close-hauled in each.

The character was portrayed by [[Cory Monteith]] and first appeared on television when ''Glee'' initially premiered its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]] on Fox on May 19, 2009. Finn was developed by ''Glee'' creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]], and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]]. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]]. Finn is initially the quarterback of his high school football team. A popular jock at the top of the school's social hierarchy, when he finds himself forced to join the school's [[glee club]], he discovers that he loves it, although he risks alienation from his friends by remaining a member. His storylines see him struggle with his decision to stay in the club, which is at the bottom of the social ladder, while he maintains his popular reputation and the respect of the other jocks. The character has dealt with his attraction to both head cheerleader [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) and glee club star singer [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]), the series' female lead. Following Monteith's death on July 13, 2013, it was announced that Finn's own death would occur in the third episode of the fifth season, titled \"[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]\".\n\nMonteith felt that Finn has had to grow up a lot during his time on the show. The actor said, \"Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he\u2019s just a little na\u00efve.\" Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed; Emily VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V.

The character was portrayed by [[Cory Monteith]] and first appeared on television when ''Glee'' initially premiered its [[Pilot (Glee)|pilot episode]] on Fox on May 19, 2009. Finn was developed by ''Glee'' creators [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]], [[Brad Falchuk]], and [[Ian Brennan (writer)|Ian Brennan]]. ''Glee'' follows the trials of the New Directions [[glee club]] at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of [[Lima, Ohio]]. Finn is initially the quarterback of his high school football team. A popular jock at the top of the school's social hierarchy, when he finds himself forced to join the school's [[glee club]], he discovers that he loves it, although he risks alienation from his friends by remaining a member. His storylines see him struggle with his decision to stay in the club, which is at the bottom of the social ladder, while he maintains his popular reputation and the respect of the other jocks. The character has dealt with his attraction to both head cheerleader [[Quinn Fabray]] ([[Dianna Agron]]) and glee club star singer [[Rachel Berry]] ([[Lea Michele]]), the series' female lead. Following Monteith's death on July 13, 2013, it was announced that Finn's own death would occur in the third episode of the fifth season, titled \"[[The Quarterback (Glee)|The Quarterback]]\".\n\nMonteith felt that Finn has had to grow up a lot during his time on the show. The actor said, \"Finn started off as the stereotypical dumb jock but as the show has gone on, Finn's not dumb anymore, really, he\u2019s just a little na\u00efve.\" Early reviews of Finn from television critics were mixed; Emily VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' said that he and Michele were \"both agreeable and a little desperate for an outlet\" in the pilot episode. Commenting on the fifth episode of the first season, Eric Goldman of ''[[IGN]]'' wrote, \"We got to see a bit of a darker side to Finn [...] it's good to see this, because up until now, Finn's been a bit too straight-laced to totally invest in.\" In the second season's eighth episode, \"[[Furt]]\", ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'s}} Tim Stack said, \"It's been a while since we\u2019ve gotten some Finn focus, and I think I just missed Cory Monteith. But I also forgot what a good, natural actor he can be.\" Monteith as Finn won the 2011 Teen Choice Award for Choice TV: Actor Comedy, and was nominated in the same category in 2010.\n\nAlthough he was not a singer before being cast as Finn, Monteith sang lead or joint lead on a large number of songs on the show, most of which have charted in the US and abroad. \"[[Jessie's Girl]]\", which Finn performed as a solo, was certified gold in Australia, one of only three singles to do so from the show's releases in that country; he was joint lead on \"[[Don't Stop Believin']]{{-\"}} in the pilot episode, the show's first single sung by the glee club, which was certified gold and platinum in Australia and the US.\n\n==Development==\n===Casting and creation===\n[[File:Cory Monteith 2010 GLAAD Media Awards.jpg|thumb|right|180px|[[Cory Monteith]] at the [[21st GLAAD Media Awards]] in 2010]]\n\nFinn Hudson is<!--please keep in present tense--> portrayed by [[Cory Monteith]].

Will takes a leave of absence from McKinley to be a member of a blue-ribbon panel in Washington, DC, so starting in \"[[Dynamic Duets]]\", Finn becomes the interim director of New Directions.
