Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from the elder Ong to free his son. A ransom of $20000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 25 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. Forensic pathologist Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the corpse's state of severe decomposition. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, he even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words towards Oh, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, on 3 May 1994, Oh was found guilty and convicted of Liang's murder and he was subsequently sentenced to death. Oh's appeal was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was executed by hanging on 19 May 1995.\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1990===\n* 15 May 1990: Tan Ah Hong and James Soh Fook Leong were stabbed by two men after chatting on the spiral steps of the Amber Beacon Tower at [[East Coast Park]].

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and tried, claimed that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission over a pen he sold to Tan, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. Justice Sinnathuray rejected their defences and stating that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and satisfied that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore he convicted both of them as charged. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 December 1995.\n\n===1994===\n* 6 June 1994 : Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, two Japanese tourists Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56, were robbed by two Malay men, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad. The two acquaintances, who came to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview, saw the Japanse tour group which Fujii and Takashita were with, and deciding to rob them. Takashita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint from the assault. Fujii, however, was severely assaulted by Abdul Nasir. As he was trying to escape, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face. This led to a facial fracture and caused Fujii to suffocate to death. Both men were not arrested until when two years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and suffocate a taxi driver. His fingerprints were then tested and found to match those found at the crime scene, and thus he was charged with the murder of Fujii. Abdul Rahman, who was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft, was also charged with murder, though he later pleaded guilty to robbery with hurt, and sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. Abdul Nasir was eventually found guilty of robbery with hurt and sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane. However, it was not the end of Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee during the period of his remand before the trial, where they briefly kidnapped two officers before being abducted. Abdul Nasir was later convicted of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment with 12 strokes of the cane in January 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray ordered Abdul Nasir's life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term he received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir had to serve a total of 38 years in prison (At that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir filed an appeal for his two jail terms to run concurrently, but it was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How decided that the definition of life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of 20 years' imprisonment, and this amendment will apply to future cases. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this and hence his life term remained as a jail term of 20 years, and he would still be spending 38 years in prison.\n\n===1995===\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

He seized Lim's family valuables before tying up Lim, his wife, his daughter and Lim's maid. He then proceeded to shoot and kill Lim, where five of the six bullets hit Lim. He managed to flee the country with the help of his accomplice, Ho Yueh Keong. He was nabbed by the [[Royal Malaysian Police]] 10 days later at a hotel in Kuala Lumpur before being extradited back to Singapore on 1 March 2006. Initially charged with murder, his charge was amended to discharging of firearm. During the trial, Tan choose to be unrepresented. In one of his defence, he claimed that Lim was about to hit him with a chair and thus shot Lim in self-defence. But his defence fell flat when the prosecution noted that Lim was tied up and could not have lifted the chair. On 22 May 2007, he was found guilty and sentenced to hang.

The DSA has its roots in the [[Socialist Party of America]] (SPA), whose most prominent leaders included [[Eugene V. Debs]], [[Norman Thomas]] and [[Michael Harrington]].<ref name=\"WNlTR\" /> In 1973, Harrington, the leader of a minority faction that had opposed the SPA's rightward shift and transformation into the [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) during the party's 1972 national convention, formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC). The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members. Upon the founding of the DSA, Harrington and the [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] author [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] were elected as co-chairs of the organization. The DSA does not run candidates on its own ballot line in elections, but instead \"fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.\" The organization has at times endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] electoral candidates\u2014notably [[Walter Mondale]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[John Kerry]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Bernie Sanders]]\u2014and the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]].\n\n[[File:DSA Atlas.png|thumb|263x263px|[http://www.dsatlas.org/ Map of DSA chapters] as of January 2019]]\nThe DSA is the largest socialist organization in the United States in over a century.<ref name=\"north-texas-size-twitter\" /><ref name=\"the-kids-are-all-red\" /> As of September 2018, membership stood at 50,000<ref name=\"50k-members-twitter\" /> and the number of local chapters was 181.<ref name=\"embracing-label-nytimes\" /> {{as of|2017|December|}}, the median age of its membership was 33, compared to 68 in 2013.<ref name=\"Median age as of 2017\" /> In the [[2017 United States elections|2017 election]], fifteen candidates who were members of the DSA were elected to office in thirteen states, most notably [[Lee J. Carter]] in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]], adding to the twenty members already holding elected office nationwide.<ref name=\"MDV9Z\" /> In November 2018, two DSA members, [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]] and [[Rashida Tlaib]], were elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

At its start, the DSOC had 840 members, of whom 2% had served on its national board\u2014approximately 200 of whom previously held membership in the SDUSA or its predecessors (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max Shachtman, civil rights movement and the War on Poverty|Socialist Party\u2013Social Democratic Federation]], formerly part of the SPA) in 1973, when the SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800 according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.<ref name=\"Rbdbs\" />\n\n[[File:Democratic Socialists of America hand logo.svg|thumb|left|upright|Earlier iteration of the DSA logo]]\nThe red [[Rose (symbolism)|rose]] is part of the official logo of the DSA,<ref name=\"fjAuR\" /> having traditionally been a symbol of [[socialism]]<ref name=\"rose-emoji-mashable\" /> since the 1886 [[Haymarket Affair]] and the resulting [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] marches from the 19th century to the current day.<ref name=\"rose-and-fist-blog\" /> It was drawn from the logo of the DSOC, its precursor organization, and previously of the Socialist International, which shows a stylized fist clenching a red rose, the fist being substituted with a bi-racial [[handshake]] pertaining to the DSA's staunch anti-racism.<ref name=\"r8YTz\" /><ref name=\"where-we-stand-dsa\" />{{failed verification|date=April 2020}} The fist and rose logo had been originally designed by [[Didier Motchane]] and others for the new [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] founded in 1971<ref name=\"C4RUY\" /> and was later shared by socialist and labor political organizations worldwide.\n\nIn electoral politics, the DSA was very strongly associated with [[Michael Harrington]]'s position that \"the left wing of realism is found today in the Democratic Party\". In its early years, the DSA opposed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates by giving critical support to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominees like [[Walter Mondale]] in 1984.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> In 1988, the DSA enthusiastically supported [[Jesse Jackson]]'s second presidential campaign.<ref name=\"JwDxg\" /> Since 1995, the DSA's position on [[Elections in the United States|American electoral politics]] has been that \"democratic socialists reject an either-or approach to electoral coalition building, focused solely on a new party or on realignment within the Democratic Party\".<ref name=\"sAAjr\" /> During the 1990s, the DSA gave the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] an overall rating of C-, \"less than satisfactory\".<ref name=\"b8INp\" />\n\nThe DSA's elected leadership has often seen working within the Democratic Party as necessary rather than forming or support [[Third party (United States)|third parties]]. That said, the DSA is very critical of the corporate-funded Democratic Party leadership.<ref name=\"7z4rZ\" /> The organization has stated:<ref name=\"4RKOt\" /> {{quote|Much of progressive, independent political action will continue to occur in Democratic Party primaries in support of candidates who represent a broad progressive coalition. In such instances, democratic socialists will support coalitional campaigns based on labor, women, people of color and other potentially anti-corporate elements.\n\nElectoral tactics are only a means for democratic socialists; the building of a powerful anti-corporate coalition is the end.}}\n\n=== Electoral positions ===\nIn 2000, the DSA took no official position on the [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential election]], with several prominent DSA members backing [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] while others supported [[Socialist Party USA]] candidate [[David McReynolds]] and others voting for Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]].<ref name=\"Elteren2011\" /> In 2004, the organization backed [[John Kerry]] after he won the Democratic nomination. In its official magazine, the DSA's [[Political Action Committee]] declared:<ref name=\"zx1N8\" /> <blockquote>While we have no illusions about how a Kerry administration would govern \u2014 absent mass pressure from below \u2014 and are not impressed with his delayed criticism of the war and his earlier commitments in favor of 'free trade,' we also realize that the Bush administration is as reactionary as Reagan's. A Kerry defeat would be taken not as a defeat of the US political center, which Kerry represents, but of the mainstream Left. As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s 1984 defeat of [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] did. On the other hand, a Kerry victory will let us press onward, with progressives aggressively pressuring an administration that owed its victory to democratic mobilization from below.</blockquote>\n\nThe only resolution on upcoming elections at the DSA's 2005 convention focused on [[Bernie Sanders]]'s independent campaign for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"caZng\" /> The organization's 2007 convention in Atlanta featured record-breaking attendance and more participation by the organization's youth wing. Sanders gave the keynote address.<ref name=\"UN5Dq\" />\n\nIn 2008, the DSA supported Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] in his race against Republican candidate [[John McCain]]. In an article written in the March 24 edition of ''[[The Nation]]'', senior DSA strategists [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and Bill Fletcher Jr., along with [[Tom Hayden]] and [[Danny Glover]], announced the formation of Progressives for Obama.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" /> In the article, the four issued a joint statement arguing that Obama was the most progressive viable Democratic presidential candidate since [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1968.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" />\n\nFollowing Obama's election, many on the [[Right-wing politics|political right]]<ref name=\"yK8li\" /> began to allege that his administration's policies were \"socialistic\", a claim rejected by the DSA and the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] alike. The widespread use of the word \"socialism\" as a political [[epithet]] against the Obama administration by its opponents caused National Director [[Frank Llewellyn]] to declare that \"over the past 12 months, the Democratic Socialists of America has received more media attention than it has over the past 12 years\".<ref name=\"ui32s\" />\n\nFor the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], the DSA endorsed Sanders as the favored presidential candidate. While making it clear that Sanders' [[New Deal]]-inspired program did not fulfill the socialist aim of establishing social ownership of the economy, the DSA considered his campaign as a positive development in the context of contemporary American politics.<ref name=\"S1NCy\" /> The DSA noted the importance of his candidacy as a self-identified democratic socialist candidate as well as \"a lifelong champion of the public programs and democratic rights that empower working class people\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org\" /> The DSA managed the #WeNeedBernie campaign, an internally focused initiative directed towards mobilizing DSA supporters for Sanders.<ref name=\"dsausa.org\" /> After Sanders' defeat in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic primaries]], the DSA called for the defeat of Donald Trump, but it did not officially endorse Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name=\"1uCFu\" />\n\n=== 2017 off-year election gains ===\nIn the [[2017 United States elections|United States elections of 2017]], the DSA endorsed fifteen candidates for office, with the highest position gained being that of [[Lee Carter (politician)|Lee Carter]] in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]].<ref name=\"zRzXV\" /> DSA members won 15 electoral offices in thirteen states, bringing the total to thirty-five (the DSA, having changed its electoral strategy at its national convention, had anticipated picking up approximately five seats): [[city council]] seats in [[Pleasant Hill, Iowa]] ([[Ross Grooters]]), [[Billings, Montana]] ([[Denise Joy]]), [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] ([[Seema Singh Perez]]), [[Duluth, Minnesota]] ([[Joel Sipress]]) and [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] ([[JT Scott]] and [[Ben Ewen-Campen]]); and the seat in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] contested by Carter, among other offices.<ref name=\"The Democratic Socialists Scored Some Big Wins.

Ultimately, about a dozen members (or non-members who were endorsed) won office in their state legislatures.<ref name=\"How One Socialist Lawmaker Is Trying to Change His State's Pro-Business Policies\" /> In the aggregate, the DSA had backed 40 winning candidates at the state, county and municipal levels.<ref name=\"winning-elections-governing\" /><ref name=\"NPC Statement on 2018 Elections\" />\n\nOcasio-Cortez's victory and the subsequent publicity for the DSA led to more than 1,000 new members joining the organization the next day, approximately 35 times the daily average<ref name=\"JwTTh\" /> and their largest ever one-day increase in membership.<ref name=\"Largest Ever One-Day Increase in Membership\" /> These signups helped boost the organization to 42,000 members nationally in June 2018.<ref name=\"hCYMK\" /> That number increased to 50,000 by September 1, 2018.<ref name=\"fortynine\" />\n\n=== 2019 off-year election gains ===\n{{see also|Chicago City Council Socialist Caucus}}\nThe [[2019 Chicago aldermanic elections]] saw six DSA members elected to the 50-seat [[Chicago City Council]]: incumbent [[Carlos Ramirez-Rosa]] as well as newcomers [[Daniel La Spata]], [[Jeanette Taylor]], [[Byron Sigcho-Lopez]], [[Rossana Rodriguez-Sanchez]], and [[Andre Vasquez]].<ref name=\"x15mI\" /> In the [[2019 United States elections|2019 off-year elections]], DSA members made further gains by capturing over a half dozen city council seats across the country, such as [[Dean Preston]] becoming the first democratic socialist elected to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] in forty years,<ref name=\"4D0B8\" /> while [[Lee J.

A first such report covering the whole of 2017 and the first half of 2018 was published in August 2018.<ref name=\"2017Report\" /> As of June 2018, the organization claims over 40,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gstalter |first1=Morgan |title=Democratic Socialists of America see membership spike after Ocasio-Cortez win |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/394679-democratic-socialists-of-america-see-membership-spike-after |website=The Hill |accessdate=April 19, 2020 |date=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nThe DSA is organized at the local level and works with [[Trade union|labor unions]], community organizations and campus activists on issues of common interest. Nationwide campaigns are coordinated by the organization's national office in [[New York City]]. {{As of|2017}}, the DSA website listed 85 local chapters, two statewide chapters, 29 Young Democratic Socialist chapters and 63 organizing committees.<ref name=\"TD7nV\" /> {{as of|2018|April|}}, 181 chapters were extant.<ref name=\"embracing-label-nytimes\" />\n\nGovernance of the DSA is by the group's National Political Committee (NPC), which since 2001 has been a 16-person body.<ref name=\"iv7gF\" /> The DSA's constitution states that at least eight of the NPC's members shall be women and at least four members of \"racial or national\" minority groups.<ref name=\"INLAg\" /> A 17th vote is cast by the representative of the DSA's youth affiliate who elects one male and one female delegate who split the vote. The NPC meets four times a year.<ref name=\"E0HnO\" />\n\nThe NPC elects an inner committee of six, including five of its own members and one representative of the youth section, called the Steering Committee. At least two of these are constitutionally required to be women and at least one a \"person of color\", with the National Director and the Youth Section Organizer also participating as ''ex officio'' members. This Steering Committee meets bi-monthly, either in person or by conference call.<ref name=\"ridvF\" />\n\n=== Party media ===\nThe DSA publishes ''Democratic Left'', a quarterly magazine of news and analysis. This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by the DSOC (the DSA forerunner) since its establishment in 1973. In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref name=\"TjltD\" />\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref name=\"mvO1A\" />\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA. The YDSA chapters and members are encouraged to pursue and promote a democratic socialist political education and participate in social justice activism, often taking part in anti-war, labor and student-issue marches and rallies. The YDSA publishes a newsletter called ''The Red Letter''<ref name=\"cwInh\" /> and until recently also a blog titled The Activist.<ref name=\"ajr3F\" /> The organization's national activities revolve around supporting the DSA campaigns and initiatives and organizing various student conferences, usually held in New York City. The YDSA is a full member of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] (IUSY).<ref name=\"BcHa0\" />\n\n=== National conventions ===\nThe highest decision-making authority of the organization is the organization's national conventions which are held biennially. DSA holds conventions every two years, with the last occurring in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]\n\n::\n\nA student and young adult outreach conference hosted by the YDSA took place on February 13\u201315, 2015 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=\"tEwuX\" />\n\n== Political ideas of Michael Harrington ==\n{{American socialism|Active parties}}\nHarrington embraced a democratic interpretation of the writings of [[Karl Marx]] while rejecting the \"[[Actually existing socialism|actually existing]]\" systems of the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]]. In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"michael-harrington-obit-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref name=\"eWu4O\" />\n\nBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, the DSA voiced opposition to that nation's bureaucratically managed economy and control over its [[satellite state]]s.<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> The DSA welcomed [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms in the Soviet Union. Sociologist [[Bogdan Denitch]] wrote in the DSA's ''Democratic Left'' (quoted in 1989):<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>The aim of democrats and socialists should be [...] to help the chances of successful reform in the Soviet bloc. [...] While supporting liberalization and economic reforms from above, socialists should be particularly active in contacting and encouraging the tender shoots of democracy from below.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington voiced admiration for [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic]] Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', which sought to reduce antagonism between Western Europe and Soviet states.<ref name=\"the-other-american\" /> As co-chairman of the DSA, Michael Harrington wrote: <blockquote>[Willy Brandt] launched his famous ostpolitik (Eastern policy), and moved toward [[detente]] with the Soviets and Eastern Europeans\u2014a strategy that was to win him the Nobel Peace Prize. Disaster came in 1974. There was a spy scandal\u2014a member of Brandt's inner circle turned out to be an East German agent\u2014and the chancellor resigned his office.<ref name=\"willy-brandt-latimes\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Social democracy and welfare ===\nOne older leaflet detailing the group's official ideas, \"What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America\", states that \"no country has fully instituted democratic socialism\". Nonetheless, according to the DSA there are lessons to be learned from \"the [[Nordic model|comprehensive welfare state]] maintained by the Swedes, from Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|national healthcare system]], France's [[Child care#France|nationwide childcare program]], and Nicaragua's [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]]\".<ref name=\"whatis\" /> The \"tremendous prosperity and relative economic equality\" established by the social democratic parties of the countries of [[Scandinavia]] and parts of [[Western Europe]] are lauded.<ref name=\"whatis\" />\n\n== Policy and ideology ==\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref name=\"climate-caucus-dsa\" /> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\" /> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref name=\"libsoc-caucus-dsa\" /> and [[communism]].<ref name=\"communist-caucus-dsa\" />\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref name=\"about-dsa\" /><ref name=\"socialist-vs-demsoc-insider\" /><ref name=\"9-questions-vox\" /><ref name=\"rise-of-dsa-the-week\" /> \n\nA member of the [[Socialist International]] (SI) from its founding in 1982, the DSA voted to leave the SI in August 2017 over its acceptance of what the DSA perceived as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.leftvoice.org/DSA-Votes-for-BDS-Reparations-and-Out-of-the-Socialist-International |title=DSA Votes for BDS, Reparations, and Out of the Socialist International |accessdate=August 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nThe DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref name=\"government-own-everything-socialism\" /> Because the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref name=\"corporations-socialism\" /> \n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values. [...] Our affiliation with the Socialist International hinders our ability to develop stronger relationships with parties and social movements that share our values and which, in many cases, are bitterly opposed to their country's SI affiliate(s)\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /><ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" /> It also passed a resolution which solidified the DSA's solidarity with the cause of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]] and with the movement of [[Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions]]: \"Democratic Socialists of America condemns all efforts to deny the right of Palestinians in the United States and their allies to free speech, assembly, and academic freedom\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /> The resolution further condemned [[Israel]]i actions, comparing those actions to [[apartheid]].<ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" />\n\nThe DSA has shown its solidarity with [[Ahed Tamimi]]. The organization called for immediate release from detention. The statement also reiterated the DSA's support for the liberation of the [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] people.<ref name=\"ahed-tamimi\" />\n\nIn 2016, the DSA issued a statement of solidarity with [[Venezuela]]. The statement called the [[United States embargoes|sanctions placed on Venezuela]] by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] unjust and illegal. It called for the United States to cease its interference in Venezuelan affairs, saying: \"We call on the President and Congress to reverse these actions and stop seeking to undermine the Venezuelan people and their legitimate, democratically elected government\".<ref name=\"ven\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[International military intervention against ISIL|United States intervention]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law. In the same statement, the DSA called for protests of Trump's actions and for the lobbying of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to halt any further intervention.<ref name=\"syria-bombing\" />\n\nAt the 2019 DSA Convention, the group announced its support for [[open borders]].<ref name=\"deZI5\" />\n\n=== Anti-fascism ===\nThe DSA maintains itself as an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organization.<ref name=\"giZwO\" /> Members have been present at various anti-fascist marches and protests, including counterprotests against the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], the [[Boston Free Speech Rally]] and many other right-wing rallies surrounding the [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]]. The DSA positions itself with other left-wing groups who fight fascism in the United States, including the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and groups involved in the [[Antifa (United States)|antifa movement]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization also criticizes the [[police in the United States]] for their handling of anti-fascist activities and activities of such groups as [[Black Lives Matter]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" />\n\nThe DSA connects this fight against fascist groups to its broader struggle against capitalism, saying on its website: \"We believe that the terror unleashed on our comrades can be defeated. We also believe that the wider system of racist oppression can be defeated, but only with the ending of the capitalist system which birthed it\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization believes in defending communities from [[neofascist]] violence and building a multi-racial working-class movement.<ref name=\"charlottesville-organizing\" /> This involves [[deplatforming]] [[reactionary]] and racist groups and events, believing that a [[united front]] of left-wing organizations needs to confront these forces wherever they appear.<ref name=\"Z9Prs\" />\n\n=== Labor movement and workers' rights ===\nThe DSA has long been a supporter and defender of the [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement in the United States]] and has also argued for the increase of international worker solidarity.<ref name=\"dsausa.org22\" /> The DSA believes in a livable [[minimum wage]] for all workers, but it notes that this fight only goes so far and is only the first step in building a more humane economic system: \"Ultimately the minimum wage only works for those lucky enough to find a job \u2013 even a low paying one \u2013 and it doesn't really \"work\" for them, because it doesn't come with health benefits, adequate schools, or enough money to set aside for retirement\".<ref name=\"0Utxz\" /> The DSA members have been supporters and active participants in fights to increase the minimum wage across the country, including the [[Fight for $15]] protests.<ref name=\"fast-food-wages\" /><ref name=\"Bup8i\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[right to work laws]], which are seen as an attack on the rights of workers and the historic advances or the labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> It is argued that the enactment of these laws reduces the efficacy of collective bargaining agreements, putting workers at a disadvantage.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> In a statement released in 2014, the organization said: \"Such \"right to work\" laws consciously aim to weaken union strength; they are the main reason why the \"right to work\" is, as Martin Luther King, Jr. put it, \"the right to work for less\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" />\n\nThe DSA argues that financial elites have consciously fought to destroy union power in an effort to solidify the hegemony of markets and corporate power.<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The organization believes that for an equitable and sustainable economic system that the production of wealth should be under the democratic control of those [[Proletariat|who produce it]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The DSA also emphasizes the role played by immigrants, women, disabled workers, LGBTQIA+ and workers of color in the broader [[labor movement]], believing that all barriers between working people must be broken in order to help create and maintain a broad and unified labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org3\" />\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nThe DSA is committed to the rights of the [[LGBT]] community, connecting anti-gay prejudice to capitalist exploitation. This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender. The DSA supports the protection of [[same-sex marriages]], but it \"views marriage as only a first step in recognizing the diversity of human relationships\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org5\" />\n\n=== Socialist feminism ===\nThe DSA aligns itself with the [[Socialist feminism|socialist-feminist]] movement. The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements. The DSA further says that socialist feminism must include the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community.<ref name=\"dsausa.org6\" />\n\n=== Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict ===\n{{see also|Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict}}\nThe DSA is opposed to [[Zionism]] and the current form of the [[State of Israel]]. Members view them as [[imperialist]] and a form of [[ethnostate]].<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> The DSA formerly supported Israel throughout much of its history, including socialist and progressive individuals and movements inside the state. In 2018 Jo-Ann Mort, former vice-chair of DSA, described the group as formerly having been \"the place to go on the left if you were a socialist and you were pro-Israel\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> ''[[Alternet]]'' noted that this has been a dividing issue, with older members \"tried to reconcile socialism with Zionism\" while younger members recognize the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement as a \"time-tested means of nonviolent protest\" and \"the most powerful force to combat Israeli apartheid in the 21st century\".<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" />\n\nOn August 5, 2017, members of the organization voted almost unanimously, by 90%, to pass a motion to formally endorse the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> Jewish Solidarity Caucus, a subgroup formed by Jewish DSA members prior to the motion, stated in their founding declaration that \"Zionism cannot vanquish antisemitism\" and \"as socialists we detest all exclusivist nationalisms\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> At a convention in Chicago, it was reported by ''The Times of Israel'' that a number of DSA members were recorded, in a video posted to social media, chanting \u201c[[Palestinian nationalism|from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free]],\" a Palestinian-nationalistic slogan interpreted as variously calling for the elimination of Israel within 1967 lines or for the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/democratic-socialists-of-america-launch-into-anti-israel-chant-at-convention/|title=Democratic Socialists of America launch into anti-Israel chant at convention|last=staff|first=T.

Debs]], [[Norman Thomas]] and [[Michael Harrington]].<ref name=\"WNlTR\" /> In 1973, Harrington, the leader of a minority faction that had opposed the SPA's rightward shift and transformation into the [[Social Democrats, USA]] (SDUSA) during the party's 1972 national convention, formed the [[Democratic Socialist Organizing Committee]] (DSOC). The other faction that split following that convention was the [[Socialist Party USA]] (SPUSA), which remains an independent democratic socialist political party. The DSOC, in Harrington's words \"the remnant of a remnant\", soon became the largest democratic socialist group in the United States. In 1982, it merged with the [[New American Movement]] (NAM), a coalition of intellectuals with roots in the [[New Left]] movements of the 1960s and former members of socialist and communist parties of the [[Old Left]].<ref name=\"NYTimes\" />\n\nInitially, the organization consisted of approximately 5,000 ex-DSOC members and 1,000 ex-NAM members. Upon the founding of the DSA, Harrington and the [[Socialist feminism|socialist feminist]] author [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] were elected as co-chairs of the organization. The DSA does not run candidates on its own ballot line in elections, but instead \"fights for reforms today that will weaken the power of corporations and increase the power of working people.\" The organization has at times endorsed [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] electoral candidates\u2014notably [[Walter Mondale]], [[Jesse Jackson]], [[John Kerry]], [[Barack Obama]] and [[Bernie Sanders]]\u2014and the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] candidate [[Ralph Nader]].\n\n[[File:DSA Atlas.png|thumb|263x263px|[http://www.dsatlas.org/ Map of DSA chapters] as of January 2019]]\nThe DSA is the largest socialist organization in the United States in over a century.<ref name=\"north-texas-size-twitter\" /><ref name=\"the-kids-are-all-red\" /> As of September 2018, membership stood at 50,000<ref name=\"50k-members-twitter\" /> and the number of local chapters was 181.<ref name=\"embracing-label-nytimes\" /> {{as of|2017|December|}}, the median age of its membership was 33, compared to 68 in 2013.<ref name=\"Median age as of 2017\" /> In the [[2017 United States elections|2017 election]], fifteen candidates who were members of the DSA were elected to office in thirteen states, most notably [[Lee J.

At its start, the DSOC had 840 members, of whom 2% had served on its national board\u2014approximately 200 of whom previously held membership in the SDUSA or its predecessors (the [[Socialist Party of America#Max Shachtman, civil rights movement and the War on Poverty|Socialist Party\u2013Social Democratic Federation]], formerly part of the SPA) in 1973, when the SDUSA stated its membership at 1,800 according to a 1973 profile of Harrington.<ref name=\"Rbdbs\" />\n\n[[File:Democratic Socialists of America hand logo.svg|thumb|left|upright|Earlier iteration of the DSA logo]]\nThe red [[Rose (symbolism)|rose]] is part of the official logo of the DSA,<ref name=\"fjAuR\" /> having traditionally been a symbol of [[socialism]]<ref name=\"rose-emoji-mashable\" /> since the 1886 [[Haymarket Affair]] and the resulting [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] marches from the 19th century to the current day.<ref name=\"rose-and-fist-blog\" /> It was drawn from the logo of the DSOC, its precursor organization, and previously of the Socialist International, which shows a stylized fist clenching a red rose, the fist being substituted with a bi-racial [[handshake]] pertaining to the DSA's staunch anti-racism.<ref name=\"r8YTz\" /><ref name=\"where-we-stand-dsa\" />{{failed verification|date=April 2020}} The fist and rose logo had been originally designed by [[Didier Motchane]] and others for the new [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] founded in 1971<ref name=\"C4RUY\" /> and was later shared by socialist and labor political organizations worldwide.\n\nIn electoral politics, the DSA was very strongly associated with [[Michael Harrington]]'s position that \"the left wing of realism is found today in the Democratic Party\". In its early years, the DSA opposed [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidates by giving critical support to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nominees like [[Walter Mondale]] in 1984.<ref name=\"Davis\" /> In 1988, the DSA enthusiastically supported [[Jesse Jackson]]'s second presidential campaign.<ref name=\"JwDxg\" /> Since 1995, the DSA's position on [[Elections in the United States|American electoral politics]] has been that \"democratic socialists reject an either-or approach to electoral coalition building, focused solely on a new party or on realignment within the Democratic Party\".<ref name=\"sAAjr\" /> During the 1990s, the DSA gave the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]] an overall rating of C-, \"less than satisfactory\".<ref name=\"b8INp\" />\n\nThe DSA's elected leadership has often seen working within the Democratic Party as necessary rather than forming or support [[Third party (United States)|third parties]]. That said, the DSA is very critical of the corporate-funded Democratic Party leadership.<ref name=\"7z4rZ\" /> The organization has stated:<ref name=\"4RKOt\" /> {{quote|Much of progressive, independent political action will continue to occur in Democratic Party primaries in support of candidates who represent a broad progressive coalition. In such instances, democratic socialists will support coalitional campaigns based on labor, women, people of color and other potentially anti-corporate elements.\n\nElectoral tactics are only a means for democratic socialists; the building of a powerful anti-corporate coalition is the end.}}\n\n=== Electoral positions ===\nIn 2000, the DSA took no official position on the [[2000 United States presidential election|presidential election]], with several prominent DSA members backing [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]] presidential candidate [[Ralph Nader]] while others supported [[Socialist Party USA]] candidate [[David McReynolds]] and others voting for Democratic nominee [[Al Gore]].<ref name=\"Elteren2011\" /> In 2004, the organization backed [[John Kerry]] after he won the Democratic nomination. In its official magazine, the DSA's [[Political Action Committee]] declared:<ref name=\"zx1N8\" /> <blockquote>While we have no illusions about how a Kerry administration would govern \u2014 absent mass pressure from below \u2014 and are not impressed with his delayed criticism of the war and his earlier commitments in favor of 'free trade,' we also realize that the Bush administration is as reactionary as Reagan's. A Kerry defeat would be taken not as a defeat of the US political center, which Kerry represents, but of the mainstream Left. As a result, it would embolden the Right and demoralize the Left (as well as trade unionists and people of color) as much as [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]'s 1984 defeat of [[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] did. On the other hand, a Kerry victory will let us press onward, with progressives aggressively pressuring an administration that owed its victory to democratic mobilization from below.</blockquote>\n\nThe only resolution on upcoming elections at the DSA's 2005 convention focused on [[Bernie Sanders]]'s independent campaign for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"caZng\" /> The organization's 2007 convention in Atlanta featured record-breaking attendance and more participation by the organization's youth wing. Sanders gave the keynote address.<ref name=\"UN5Dq\" />\n\nIn 2008, the DSA supported Democratic presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] in his race against Republican candidate [[John McCain]]. In an article written in the March 24 edition of ''[[The Nation]]'', senior DSA strategists [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] and Bill Fletcher Jr., along with [[Tom Hayden]] and [[Danny Glover]], announced the formation of Progressives for Obama.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" /> In the article, the four issued a joint statement arguing that Obama was the most progressive viable Democratic presidential candidate since [[Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1968.<ref name=\"k;;;abv\" />\n\nFollowing Obama's election, many on the [[Right-wing politics|political right]]<ref name=\"yK8li\" /> began to allege that his administration's policies were \"socialistic\", a claim rejected by the DSA and the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] alike. The widespread use of the word \"socialism\" as a political [[epithet]] against the Obama administration by its opponents caused National Director [[Frank Llewellyn]] to declare that \"over the past 12 months, the Democratic Socialists of America has received more media attention than it has over the past 12 years\".<ref name=\"ui32s\" />\n\nFor the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 presidential election]], the DSA endorsed Sanders as the favored presidential candidate. While making it clear that Sanders' [[New Deal]]-inspired program did not fulfill the socialist aim of establishing social ownership of the economy, the DSA considered his campaign as a positive development in the context of contemporary American politics.<ref name=\"S1NCy\" /> The DSA noted the importance of his candidacy as a self-identified democratic socialist candidate as well as \"a lifelong champion of the public programs and democratic rights that empower working class people\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org\" /> The DSA managed the #WeNeedBernie campaign, an internally focused initiative directed towards mobilizing DSA supporters for Sanders.<ref name=\"dsausa.org\" /> After Sanders' defeat in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Democratic primaries]], the DSA called for the defeat of Donald Trump, but it did not officially endorse Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref name=\"1uCFu\" />\n\n=== 2017 off-year election gains ===\nIn the [[2017 United States elections|United States elections of 2017]], the DSA endorsed fifteen candidates for office, with the highest position gained being that of [[Lee Carter (politician)|Lee Carter]] in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]].<ref name=\"zRzXV\" /> DSA members won 15 electoral offices in thirteen states, bringing the total to thirty-five (the DSA, having changed its electoral strategy at its national convention, had anticipated picking up approximately five seats): [[city council]] seats in [[Pleasant Hill, Iowa]] ([[Ross Grooters]]), [[Billings, Montana]] ([[Denise Joy]]), [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] ([[Seema Singh Perez]]), [[Duluth, Minnesota]] ([[Joel Sipress]]) and [[Somerville, Massachusetts]] ([[JT Scott]] and [[Ben Ewen-Campen]]); and the seat in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] contested by Carter, among other offices.<ref name=\"The Democratic Socialists Scored Some Big Wins.

In 2017, the organization passed a resolution calling for the national office to provide the group's paid members with a copy of a financial report in non-convention years. A first such report covering the whole of 2017 and the first half of 2018 was published in August 2018.<ref name=\"2017Report\" /> As of June 2018, the organization claims over 40,000 members.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gstalter |first1=Morgan |title=Democratic Socialists of America see membership spike after Ocasio-Cortez win |url=https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/394679-democratic-socialists-of-america-see-membership-spike-after |website=The Hill |accessdate=April 19, 2020 |date=June 28, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Structure ==\nThe DSA is organized at the local level and works with [[Trade union|labor unions]], community organizations and campus activists on issues of common interest. Nationwide campaigns are coordinated by the organization's national office in [[New York City]]. {{As of|2017}}, the DSA website listed 85 local chapters, two statewide chapters, 29 Young Democratic Socialist chapters and 63 organizing committees.<ref name=\"TD7nV\" /> {{as of|2018|April|}}, 181 chapters were extant.<ref name=\"embracing-label-nytimes\" />\n\nGovernance of the DSA is by the group's National Political Committee (NPC), which since 2001 has been a 16-person body.<ref name=\"iv7gF\" /> The DSA's constitution states that at least eight of the NPC's members shall be women and at least four members of \"racial or national\" minority groups.<ref name=\"INLAg\" /> A 17th vote is cast by the representative of the DSA's youth affiliate who elects one male and one female delegate who split the vote.

This Steering Committee meets bi-monthly, either in person or by conference call.<ref name=\"ridvF\" />\n\n=== Party media ===\nThe DSA publishes ''Democratic Left'', a quarterly magazine of news and analysis. This publication continues in an uninterrupted run from the original ''Newsletter of the Democratic Left'' published by the DSOC (the DSA forerunner) since its establishment in 1973. In 2008, DSA members active in the American labor movement founded Talking Union, a blog that focuses on labor politics, working-class struggles and strategies.<ref name=\"TjltD\" />\n\nLeft-wing quarterly magazine ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' is also considered to be very close to the party, as its editor [[Bhaskar Sunkara]] is a DSA member; however, there is no official affiliations between the magazine and DSA.<ref name=\"mvO1A\" />\n\n=== Student section ===\n[[File:YDS logo.svg|thumb|upright|[[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] logo]]\nThe [[Young Democratic Socialists of America]] (YDSA) is the official student section of the DSA. The YDSA chapters and members are encouraged to pursue and promote a democratic socialist political education and participate in social justice activism, often taking part in anti-war, labor and student-issue marches and rallies. The YDSA publishes a newsletter called ''The Red Letter''<ref name=\"cwInh\" /> and until recently also a blog titled The Activist.<ref name=\"ajr3F\" /> The organization's national activities revolve around supporting the DSA campaigns and initiatives and organizing various student conferences, usually held in New York City. The YDSA is a full member of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] (IUSY).<ref name=\"BcHa0\" />\n\n=== National conventions ===\nThe highest decision-making authority of the organization is the organization's national conventions which are held biennially. DSA holds conventions every two years, with the last occurring in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]\n\n::\n\nA student and young adult outreach conference hosted by the YDSA took place on February 13\u201315, 2015 in [[Manhattan]].<ref name=\"tEwuX\" />\n\n== Political ideas of Michael Harrington ==\n{{American socialism|Active parties}}\nHarrington embraced a democratic interpretation of the writings of [[Karl Marx]] while rejecting the \"[[Actually existing socialism|actually existing]]\" systems of the [[Soviet Union]], [[China]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]]. In the 1980s, Harrington said:<ref name=\"michael-harrington-obit-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>Put it this way. Marx was a democrat with a small \"d\". The Democratic Socialists envision a humane social order based on popular control of resources and production, economic planning [...] and racial equality. I share an immediate program with liberals in this country because the best liberalism leads toward socialism. [...] I want to be on the left wing of the possible.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington made it clear that even if the traditional [[Marxism|Marxist]] vision of a marketless, stateless society was not possible, he did not understand why this needed to \"result in the social consequence of some people eating while others starve\".<ref name=\"eWu4O\" />\n\nBefore the collapse of the Soviet Union, the DSA voiced opposition to that nation's bureaucratically managed economy and control over its [[satellite state]]s.<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> The DSA welcomed [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reforms in the Soviet Union. Sociologist [[Bogdan Denitch]] wrote in the DSA's ''Democratic Left'' (quoted in 1989):<ref name=\"perestroika-nytimes\" /> <blockquote>The aim of democrats and socialists should be [...] to help the chances of successful reform in the Soviet bloc. [...] While supporting liberalization and economic reforms from above, socialists should be particularly active in contacting and encouraging the tender shoots of democracy from below.</blockquote>\n\nHarrington voiced admiration for [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|German Social Democratic]] Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]]'s ''[[Ostpolitik]]'', which sought to reduce antagonism between Western Europe and Soviet states.<ref name=\"the-other-american\" /> As co-chairman of the DSA, Michael Harrington wrote: <blockquote>[Willy Brandt] launched his famous ostpolitik (Eastern policy), and moved toward [[detente]] with the Soviets and Eastern Europeans\u2014a strategy that was to win him the Nobel Peace Prize. Disaster came in 1974. There was a spy scandal\u2014a member of Brandt's inner circle turned out to be an East German agent\u2014and the chancellor resigned his office.<ref name=\"willy-brandt-latimes\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Social democracy and welfare ===\nOne older leaflet detailing the group's official ideas, \"What is Democratic Socialism? Questions and Answers from the Democratic Socialists of America\", states that \"no country has fully instituted democratic socialism\". Nonetheless, according to the DSA there are lessons to be learned from \"the [[Nordic model|comprehensive welfare state]] maintained by the Swedes, from Canada's [[Medicare (Canada)|national healthcare system]], France's [[Child care#France|nationwide childcare program]], and Nicaragua's [[Nicaraguan Literacy Campaign|literacy programs]]\".<ref name=\"whatis\" /> The \"tremendous prosperity and relative economic equality\" established by the social democratic parties of the countries of [[Scandinavia]] and parts of [[Western Europe]] are lauded.<ref name=\"whatis\" />\n\n== Policy and ideology ==\nDSA members have views ranging from [[eco-socialism]],<ref name=\"climate-caucus-dsa\" /> [[democratic socialism]],<ref name=\"What is Democratic Socialism?\" /> [[libertarian socialism]],<ref name=\"libsoc-caucus-dsa\" /> and [[communism]].<ref name=\"communist-caucus-dsa\" />\n\nThe DSA regards the abolition of capitalism and the realization of socialism as a gradual long-term goal, therefore the organization focuses its immediate political energies on reforms within capitalism that empower working people while decreasing the power of corporations:<ref name=\"about-dsa\" /><ref name=\"socialist-vs-demsoc-insider\" /><ref name=\"9-questions-vox\" /><ref name=\"rise-of-dsa-the-week\" /> \n\nA member of the [[Socialist International]] (SI) from its founding in 1982, the DSA voted to leave the SI in August 2017 over its acceptance of what the DSA perceived as [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economic policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.leftvoice.org/DSA-Votes-for-BDS-Reparations-and-Out-of-the-Socialist-International |title=DSA Votes for BDS, Reparations, and Out of the Socialist International |accessdate=August 8, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Socialism ===\nThe DSA characterizes its vision of socialism as an economic system based on maximum decentralization that can be supportive of a range of models for [[social ownership]], including [[Public enterprise|publicly owned enterprises]] and [[Cooperative|worker-owned cooperatives]]. The DSA rejects centralized economic planning in favor of a combination of democratic planning and market mechanisms:<ref name=\"government-own-everything-socialism\" /> Because the DSA does not believe capitalism and private corporations can be immediately replaced with socialism, it is favorable to using government regulations and organized labor to make private businesses more accountable to the public interest:<ref name=\"corporations-socialism\" /> \n=== Internationalism ===\nAt the 2017 DSA Convention, the group announced its withdrawal from the [[Socialist International]] (SI). The resolution passed states that the DSA will \"[build] direct relationships with socialist and left parties and social movements around the world that we can learn from and which share our values. [...] Our affiliation with the Socialist International hinders our ability to develop stronger relationships with parties and social movements that share our values and which, in many cases, are bitterly opposed to their country's SI affiliate(s)\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /><ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" /> It also passed a resolution which solidified the DSA's solidarity with the cause of the [[Palestinians|Palestinian people]] and with the movement of [[Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions]]: \"Democratic Socialists of America condemns all efforts to deny the right of Palestinians in the United States and their allies to free speech, assembly, and academic freedom\".<ref name=\"d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net\" /> The resolution further condemned [[Israel]]i actions, comparing those actions to [[apartheid]].<ref name=\"leftvoice.org\" />\n\nThe DSA has shown its solidarity with [[Ahed Tamimi]]. The organization called for immediate release from detention. The statement also reiterated the DSA's support for the liberation of the [[Palestine (region)|Palestinian]] people.<ref name=\"ahed-tamimi\" />\n\nIn 2016, the DSA issued a statement of solidarity with [[Venezuela]]. The statement called the [[United States embargoes|sanctions placed on Venezuela]] by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] unjust and illegal. It called for the United States to cease its interference in Venezuelan affairs, saying: \"We call on the President and Congress to reverse these actions and stop seeking to undermine the Venezuelan people and their legitimate, democratically elected government\".<ref name=\"ven\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[International military intervention against ISIL|United States intervention]] in the [[Syrian Civil War]]. A statement issued in April 2017 called the intervention by the [[Presidency of Donald Trump|Trump administration]] both a violation of domestic and international law. In the same statement, the DSA called for protests of Trump's actions and for the lobbying of [[United States Congress|Congress]] to halt any further intervention.<ref name=\"syria-bombing\" />\n\nAt the 2019 DSA Convention, the group announced its support for [[open borders]].<ref name=\"deZI5\" />\n\n=== Anti-fascism ===\nThe DSA maintains itself as an [[Anti-racism|anti-racist]] and [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] organization.<ref name=\"giZwO\" /> Members have been present at various anti-fascist marches and protests, including counterprotests against the [[Unite the Right rally]] in [[Charlottesville]], [[Virginia]], the [[Boston Free Speech Rally]] and many other right-wing rallies surrounding the [[removal of Confederate monuments and memorials]]. The DSA positions itself with other left-wing groups who fight fascism in the United States, including the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] and groups involved in the [[Antifa (United States)|antifa movement]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization also criticizes the [[police in the United States]] for their handling of anti-fascist activities and activities of such groups as [[Black Lives Matter]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" />\n\nThe DSA connects this fight against fascist groups to its broader struggle against capitalism, saying on its website: \"We believe that the terror unleashed on our comrades can be defeated. We also believe that the wider system of racist oppression can be defeated, but only with the ending of the capitalist system which birthed it\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org1\" /> The organization believes in defending communities from [[neofascist]] violence and building a multi-racial working-class movement.<ref name=\"charlottesville-organizing\" /> This involves [[deplatforming]] [[reactionary]] and racist groups and events, believing that a [[united front]] of left-wing organizations needs to confront these forces wherever they appear.<ref name=\"Z9Prs\" />\n\n=== Labor movement and workers' rights ===\nThe DSA has long been a supporter and defender of the [[Labor history of the United States|labor movement in the United States]] and has also argued for the increase of international worker solidarity.<ref name=\"dsausa.org22\" /> The DSA believes in a livable [[minimum wage]] for all workers, but it notes that this fight only goes so far and is only the first step in building a more humane economic system: \"Ultimately the minimum wage only works for those lucky enough to find a job \u2013 even a low paying one \u2013 and it doesn't really \"work\" for them, because it doesn't come with health benefits, adequate schools, or enough money to set aside for retirement\".<ref name=\"0Utxz\" /> The DSA members have been supporters and active participants in fights to increase the minimum wage across the country, including the [[Fight for $15]] protests.<ref name=\"fast-food-wages\" /><ref name=\"Bup8i\" />\n\nThe DSA opposes [[right to work laws]], which are seen as an attack on the rights of workers and the historic advances or the labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> It is argued that the enactment of these laws reduces the efficacy of collective bargaining agreements, putting workers at a disadvantage.<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" /> In a statement released in 2014, the organization said: \"Such \"right to work\" laws consciously aim to weaken union strength; they are the main reason why the \"right to work\" is, as Martin Luther King, Jr. put it, \"the right to work for less\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org4\" />\n\nThe DSA argues that financial elites have consciously fought to destroy union power in an effort to solidify the hegemony of markets and corporate power.<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The organization believes that for an equitable and sustainable economic system that the production of wealth should be under the democratic control of those [[Proletariat|who produce it]].<ref name=\"dsausa.org2\" /> The DSA also emphasizes the role played by immigrants, women, disabled workers, LGBTQIA+ and workers of color in the broader [[labor movement]], believing that all barriers between working people must be broken in order to help create and maintain a broad and unified labor movement.<ref name=\"dsausa.org3\" />\n\n=== LGBT rights ===\nThe DSA is committed to the rights of the [[LGBT]] community, connecting anti-gay prejudice to capitalist exploitation. This includes pushes for equal rights and protections for all those who identify as LGBTQIA+ as well as rights to housing, jobs, education, public accommodations and healthcare. The DSA recognizes that those who are most discriminated against based on identity are disproportionately women and people of color. The organization also seeks to ensure public schools are safe places for LGBTQIA+ students and that students should have total access to facilities that reflect their gender. The DSA supports the protection of [[same-sex marriages]], but it \"views marriage as only a first step in recognizing the diversity of human relationships\".<ref name=\"dsausa.org5\" />\n\n=== Socialist feminism ===\nThe DSA aligns itself with the [[Socialist feminism|socialist-feminist]] movement. The organization holds that capitalism is built on [[white supremacy]] as well as [[patriarchy|male supremacy]]. The DSA maintains that reproductive rights are central to the [[feminist movement]]. Connecting democratic socialism and socialist feminism, the DSA says \"that birth control and safe abortion should be provided as part of a comprehensive single-payer healthcare program\". Believing that electoral politics can only take socialist feminism so far, the organization also says that the emphasis must be on community-based grassroots movements. The DSA further says that socialist feminism must include the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community.<ref name=\"dsausa.org6\" />\n\n=== Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict ===\n{{see also|Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict}}\nThe DSA is opposed to [[Zionism]] and the current form of the [[State of Israel]]. Members view them as [[imperialist]] and a form of [[ethnostate]].<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> The DSA formerly supported Israel throughout much of its history, including socialist and progressive individuals and movements inside the state. In 2018 Jo-Ann Mort, former vice-chair of DSA, described the group as formerly having been \"the place to go on the left if you were a socialist and you were pro-Israel\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> ''[[Alternet]]'' noted that this has been a dividing issue, with older members \"tried to reconcile socialism with Zionism\" while younger members recognize the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement as a \"time-tested means of nonviolent protest\" and \"the most powerful force to combat Israeli apartheid in the 21st century\".<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" />\n\nOn August 5, 2017, members of the organization voted almost unanimously, by 90%, to pass a motion to formally endorse the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement.<ref name=\"alternet_2017-08-09\" /><ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> Jewish Solidarity Caucus, a subgroup formed by Jewish DSA members prior to the motion, stated in their founding declaration that \"Zionism cannot vanquish antisemitism\" and \"as socialists we detest all exclusivist nationalisms\".<ref name=\"dailybeast_2018-12-02\" /> At a convention in Chicago, it was reported by ''The Times of Israel'' that a number of DSA members were recorded, in a video posted to social media, chanting \u201c[[Palestinian nationalism|from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free]],\" a Palestinian-nationalistic slogan interpreted as variously calling for the elimination of Israel within 1967 lines or for the end of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/democratic-socialists-of-america-launch-into-anti-israel-chant-at-convention/|title=Democratic Socialists of America launch into anti-Israel chant at convention|last=staff|first=T.

This was to be proven by a receipt of rent or personal capitation, and not by renting a room or staying in a furnished hotel.

Holders of registered occupations are considered to be bourgeois.\n\nDuring the 13th century, bourgeois dynasties were built: Sarrazins, Barbette, Bourdon (see rue des Bourdonnais), Pisdoe or Pizdoue, etc.\n\nThe capacity of bourgeois, that is to say of citizen of a city having political rights in opposition to the simple inhabitants, forms the base of the urban organization of cities. This urban system in Europe dates back for many cities still existing today to [[Classical antiquity|Greco-Latin antiquity]], others were founded around the year one thousand.<ref>[[Henri Pirenne]], ''Les villes du Moyen \u00c2ge, essai d\u2019histoire \u00e9conomique et sociale'', Bruxelles, Lamertin, 1927.

Dans le domaine des techniques, l'arch\u00e9ologie ne cesse de multiplier les preuves de cette situation. (...) Forges, charronnages ou poteries rurales sont, au d\u00e9but du Moyen \u00c2ge, tout \u00e0 fait dans la tradition de l'\u00e2ge du Fer. Tandis que notre mode traditionnel d'agriculture, fond\u00e9 \u00e0 la fois sur l'\u00e9levage pour la viande et le lait et sur la culture du bl\u00e9, remonte plus haut encore: \u00e0 l'origine m\u00eame du N\u00e9olithique europ\u00e9en continental (Danubien), c'est-\u00e0-dire au Ve mill\u00e9naire au moins.
