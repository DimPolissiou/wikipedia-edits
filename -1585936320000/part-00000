To the Mayas of the Classic period, they were the divine patrons of the artisans, especially scribes and sculptors. They were seen as gods in some tribes, and the long, sleek tail was worshipped for its beauty. Cop\u00e1n in particular is famous for its representations of [[howler monkey gods]]. Two howler monkey brothers play a role in the myth of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] included in the [[Popol Vuh]], a widely feared tale of soul and passion.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Alouattinae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Alouatta}}\n{{Commons category|Alouatta|howler monkeys}}\n* [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/links/alouatta Primate Info Net ''Alouatta'' Factsheets]\n* [http://www.monteverdeinfo.com/sounds/howler_monkey.mp3 Howler monkey audio recording]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090801031146/http://www.belizezoo.org/zoo/zoo/mammals/how/how1.html Information about howler monkeys from Belize Zoo (photos, video and audio included)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090425105823/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/SmallMammals/Exhibits/HowlerMonkeys/LoudestAnimal/default.cfm \"The Loudest Animal in the New World,\" Smithsonian National Zoological Park]\n\n{{Atelidae nav}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q504247}}\n\n[[Category:Folivores]]\n[[Category:Howler monkeys| ]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Guyana]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Honduras]]\n", "text_old": "{{Automatic taxobox\n| name = Howler monkey<ref name=msw3>{{MSW3 Groves|pages=148\u2013152|id=12100374}}</ref>\n| image = Alouatta guariba.jpg\n| image_caption = [[Brown howler]]\n| parent_authority = [[\u00c9douard Louis Trouessart|Trouessart]], 1897 (1825)\n| taxon = Alouatta\n| authority = [[Bernard Germain Etienne de la Ville, Comte de Lacepede|Lacepede]], 1799\n| type_species = ''[[red-handed howler|Simia belzebul]]''\n| type_species_authority = [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]], 1766\n| subdivision_ranks = Species\n| subdivision = \n''[[Alouatta arctoidea]] <br/> [[Alouatta belzebul]] <br/> [[Alouatta caraya]] <br/> [[Alouatta coibensis]] <br/> [[Alouatta discolor]] <br/> [[Alouatta guariba]] <br/> [[Alouatta juara]] <br/> [[Alouatta macconnelli]] <br/> [[Alouatta nigerrima]] <br/> [[Alouatta palliata]] <br/> [[Alouatta pigra]] <br/> [[Alouatta puruensis]] <br/> [[Alouatta sara]] <br/> [[Alouatta seniculus]] <br/> [[Alouatta ululata]]''\n| synonyms =\n'''''Mycetes''''' <small>Illiger, 1811</small><br/>\n'''''Stentor''''' <small>\u00c9.

However, the [[black howler]] (''Alouatta caraya'') is a relatively common pet monkey in contemporary [[Argentina]] due to its gentle nature, in comparison to the [[capuchin monkey]]'s aggressive tendencies, in spite of its lesser intelligence, as well as the liabilities meant by the size of its droppings and the males' loud vocalisations.\n\n[[John Lloyd Stephens]] described the howler monkeys at the Maya ruins of [[Cop\u00e1n]] as \"grave and solemn, almost emotionally wounded, as if officiating as the guardians of consecrated ground\". To the Mayas of the Classic period, they were the divine patrons of the artisans, especially scribes and sculptors. They were seen as gods in some tribes, and the long, sleek tail was worshipped for its beauty. Cop\u00e1n in particular is famous for its representations of [[howler monkey gods]]. Two howler monkey brothers play a role in the myth of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] included in the [[Popol Vuh]], a widely feared tale of soul and passion.\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikispecies|Alouattinae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Alouatta}}\n{{Commons category|Alouatta|howler monkeys}}\n* [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/links/alouatta Primate Info Net ''Alouatta'' Factsheets]\n* [http://www.monteverdeinfo.com/sounds/howler_monkey.mp3 Howler monkey audio recording]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090801031146/http://www.belizezoo.org/zoo/zoo/mammals/how/how1.html Information about howler monkeys from Belize Zoo (photos, video and audio included)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090425105823/http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Animals/SmallMammals/Exhibits/HowlerMonkeys/LoudestAnimal/default.cfm \"The Loudest Animal in the New World,\" Smithsonian National Zoological Park]\n\n{{Atelidae nav}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q504247}}\n\n[[Category:Folivores]]\n[[Category:Howler monkeys| ]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Guyana]]\n[[Category:Mammals of Honduras]]\n", "name_user": "Explosion27", "label": "safe", "comment": "full body changed to full-body", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howler_monkey"}

The campaign quickly won widespread support from a wide variety of environmental, student, and religious groups.\n\nIn August 2007 McKibben announced Step It Up 2, to take place November 3, 2007. In addition to the 80% by 2050 slogan from the first campaign, the second adds \"10% [reduction of emissions] in three years (''\"Hit the Ground Running\"''), a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants, and a ''Green Jobs Corps'' to help fix homes and businesses so those targets can be met\" (called ''\"Green Jobs Now, and No New Coal\"'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stepitup2007.org/#letter|title=Step It Up : Index|website=www.stepitup2007.org}}</ref>\n\n===350.org===\n{{Main|350.org}}\nIn the wake of Step It Up's achievements, the same team announced a new campaign in March 2008 called [[350.org]]. The organizing effort, aimed at the entire globe, drew its name from climate scientist [[James E. Hansen]]'s contention earlier that winter that any atmospheric concentration of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) above 350 parts per million was unsafe. \"If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO<sub>2</sub> will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that.\" Hansen et al. stated in the Abstract to their paper.<ref>Hansen, J., Mki.

The campaign quickly won widespread support from a wide variety of environmental, student, and religious groups.\n\nIn August 2007 McKibben announced Step It Up 2, to take place November 3, 2007. In addition to the 80% by 2050 slogan from the first campaign, the second adds \"10% [reduction of emissions] in three years (''\"Hit the Ground Running\"''), a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants, and a ''Green Jobs Corps'' to help fix homes and businesses so those targets can be met\" (called ''\"Green Jobs Now, and No New Coal\"'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stepitup2007.org/#letter|title=Step It Up : Index|website=www.stepitup2007.org}}</ref>\n\n===350.org===\n{{Main|350.org}}\nIn the wake of Step It Up's achievements, the same team announced a new campaign in March 2008 called [[350.org]].

[[Anna Del Conte]] (''The Gastronomy of Italy'' 2001) found a sausage mentioned in a document of the official body of meat preservers in Bologna dated 1376 that may be mortadella.\n\nElsewhere in Italy it may be made either in the Bolognese manner or in a distinctively local style. The mortadella of [[Prato]] is a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] speciality flavoured with pounded garlic and coloured with [[alchermes]]. The mortadella of [[Amatrice]], high in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] of northern [[Lazio]], is unusual in that it is lightly smoked. Because it originated in Bologna, this contributed to the naming of the American sausage meat \"[[Bologna sausage|bologna]]\".\n\n==Characteristics==\nMortadella Bologna has [[Protected designation of origin|Protected Geographical Indication]] status under [[European Union law]]. The zone of production is extensive: as well as [[Emilia-Romagna]] and the neighbouring regions of [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]], [[Marche]] and Tuscany, it includes Lazio and [[Trentino]].\n\n==Similar products outside Italy==\n\n===Lusitanic and Hispanic cultures===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Mortadela com azeitonas.jpg|thumb|Mortadella with olives from Portugal]]\nMortadella is very popular in Spain and Portugal, where a variety with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[olive]]s is widely consumed, especially in sandwiches. In eastern Spain, the standard mortadella is often referred to as ''mortadela italiana'' (Italian mortadella), to differentiate it from a local variant named ''catalana''.\n\nMortadella is also very popular in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela, thanks to the Italian immigrants who settled in these countries in the early 20th century. In these countries it is spelled ''mortadela'', and its recipe is quite similar to the traditional Italian, with additional pepper grains.\n\nIn Brazil, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] has a very popular ''mortadela'' sandwich sold in the Mercado Municipal.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, \"smoked mortadella\" is sometimes confused with commercial salami, or with salami cotto, because cafeterias, panaderias, colmados, and restaurants buy the bulk of whole smoked mortadella. While salami may contain pork, beef, veal and small pieces of fat uniformly distributed within the sausage, mortadella has the traditional larger chunks not so uniformly distributed. Its diameter is much larger than that of hard salami and more closely resembles salami cotto (cooked) in size, hence the confusion of some people. It is smaller in diameter than the traditional mortadella de Bologna because the smoking process causes some shrinkage. It is best served at room temperature to bring out its rich flavour.\n\n===Central, Southern and Eastern Europe===\nIn Romania, a similar cold cut is also known as ''parizer''. It is a type of artisan bologna.\nIn Hungary, a similar product is called, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], ''mortadella'' and a plain variety called ''pariser'', ''parizer'' or ''p\u00e1rizsi''. The term ''parizer'' is also often used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while ''parizier'' is used in other territories of the Balkans. The classic Italian ''mortadella'' is widely sold in supermarkets along the entire Adriatic coast. \n\nIn Greece, where there is a smaller version in addition to the regular one, that variety is called Parizaki or Mortadelaki, and in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia, the product known as ''mortadela'' is widely eaten. \n\nIn Poland, ''mortadela'' slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional [[pork chop]]s.\n\n===Middle East and North Africa===\nIn several countries, such as Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, [[halal]] or [[kosher]] mortadella is sold, which is made from chicken, beef, or turkey. The Palestinian Siniora brand, established in Jerusalem in 1920<ref>http://www.siniorafood.com/en-us/About-Us/Company-Overview</ref>, is the first in the region, a mortadella with sliced olives, pistachios or pepper.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Farmer Jack \u2014 a Siniora Sons Inc.

A variety that includes olives and pimentos is called [[olive loaf]].\n\nMortadella is one of the three meats in [[Central Grocery|Central Grocery's]] [[Muffaletta]] Sandwich in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]] along with Holland ham and Genoa salami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchquarter.com/best-muffulettas-french-quarter-nearby/|title=Best Muffulettas in the French Quarter and Nearby|website=FrenchQuarter.com}}</ref>\n\nMortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/weekinreview/february-6-12-the-return-of-mortadella.html|title=The Return of Mortadella|date=13 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref> This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film [[Lady Liberty (film)|''La mortadella'']] starring [[Sophia Loren]]. The title for the United States release was ''[[Lady Liberty (film)|Lady Liberty]]''.\n\nThe ban in the United States was lifted due to the [[Veterinary equivalency|Veterinary Equivalency Agreement]] that allowed countries to export products that had been shown to be disease-free as part of an overall agreement that would allow products deemed safe in the United States to be exported to the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/10/world/bologna-journal-coming-to-a-deli-near-you-a-long-taboo-sausage.html|title=Bologna Journal; Coming to a Deli Near You: A Long-Taboo Sausage|date=10 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Ukraine and Russia===\nIn Ukraine and Russia, a very similar product is called \"doctor's sausage\" ({{lang-ru|link=no|\u00ab\u0414\u043e\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f\u00bb \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0431\u0430\u0441\u0430}}). However, this product is normally made from a beef and pork mixture, and does not include pieces of fat (sausages with pieces of fat are called \"Lubitelskaya\" and \"Stolichnaya\") or myrtle as a primary spice, being instead flavoured with just [[coriander]] and [[nutmeg]]. It also traditionally contains eggs and milk, which are usually absent in traditional mortadella.\n\n===East Asia===\n''[[Ch\u1ea3 l\u1ee5a]]'' or Vietnamese mortadella is sometimes used as an accompaniment to the Vietnamese dish ''[[b\u00e1nh cu\u1ed1n]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noodlepie.typepad.com/blog/2004/07/stall_1006_banh.html|title=Stall 1006 - Banh Cuon - noodlepie|work=typepad.com}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Mortadella sandwich]]\n*[[Curing (food preservation)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Mortadella}}\n* [http://www.salumi-italiani.it/en/all-about-salumi/mortadella-eng.php Istituto per Valorizzazione dei Salumi]: Mortadella {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.prodottitipici.com/prodotto/0506/mortadella-di-bologna.htm Mortadella di Bologna] {{in lang|it}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050325132243/http://www.pubit.it/sunti/psi0102a.html Carlo Cantoni and Patrizia Cattaneo, \"La mortadella: aspetti attuali tecnici della sua produzione\"] {{in lang|it}}\n* [http://www.cliffordawright.com/history/sausage.html Clifford A.

One theory derives the name from the [[Latin]] word ''mortarium'' ([[Mortar and pestle|mortar]]), traditionally used to pound the meat to produce the sausage.<ref name=Hazan>{{cite book |last= Hazan|first= Marcella |date= 2012|title= The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking|url= https://books.google.ch/books?id=IciBQN-0VS4C&pg=PP17|location= |publisher= Pan Macmillan|page= 17|isbn= 9780752228044}}</ref><ref name=Oxford>{{cite book |last= Davidson|first= Alan |date= 2014|title= The Oxford Companion to Food|url= https://books.google.ch/books?id=bIIeBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA533|location= Oxford|publisher= OUP Oxford|page= 533|isbn= 9780191040726}}</ref> This theory, proposed by Giancarlo Susini, professor of ancient history in the [[University of Bologna]], relies on two funerary [[stele]]s kept in the [[Museo Civico Archeologico di Bologna|Archaeological Museum of Bologna]], believed to pertain to the same monument, one showing a herd of piglets and the other a mortar and pestle.<ref name=Roversi1>{{cite book|url= https://mortadellabologna.com/blog/etruschi-galli-bol-o-romani-chi-e-stato-l-inventore/|title= La Mortadella Bologna IGP.

[[Anna Del Conte]] (''The Gastronomy of Italy'' 2001) found a sausage mentioned in a document of the official body of meat preservers in Bologna dated 1376 that may be mortadella.\n\nElsewhere in Italy it may be made either in the Bolognese manner or in a distinctively local style. The mortadella of [[Prato]] is a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] speciality flavoured with pounded garlic and coloured with [[alchermes]]. The mortadella of [[Amatrice]], high in the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]] of northern [[Lazio]], is unusual in that it is lightly smoked. Because it originated in Bologna, this contributed to the naming of the American sausage meat \"[[Bologna sausage|bologna]]\".\n\n==Characteristics==\nMortadella Bologna has [[Protected designation of origin|Protected Geographical Indication]] status under [[European Union law]]. The zone of production is extensive: as well as [[Emilia-Romagna]] and the neighbouring regions of [[Piedmont]], [[Lombardy]], [[Veneto]], [[Marche]] and Tuscany, it includes Lazio and [[Trentino]].\n\n==Similar products outside Italy==\n\n===Lusitanic and Hispanic cultures===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Mortadela com azeitonas.jpg|thumb|Mortadella with olives from Portugal]]\nMortadella is very popular in Spain and Portugal, where a variety with [[black pepper|pepper]] and [[olive]]s is widely consumed, especially in sandwiches. In eastern Spain, the standard mortadella is often referred to as ''mortadela italiana'' (Italian mortadella), to differentiate it from a local variant named ''catalana''.\n\nMortadella is also very popular in Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Uruguay and Venezuela, thanks to the Italian immigrants who settled in these countries in the early 20th century. In these countries it is spelled ''mortadela'', and its recipe is quite similar to the traditional Italian, with additional pepper grains.\n\nIn Brazil, [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] has a very popular ''mortadela'' sandwich sold in the Mercado Municipal.\n\nIn Puerto Rico, \"smoked mortadella\" is sometimes confused with commercial salami, or with salami cotto, because cafeterias, panaderias, colmados, and restaurants buy the bulk of whole smoked mortadella. While salami may contain pork, beef, veal and small pieces of fat uniformly distributed within the sausage, mortadella has the traditional larger chunks not so uniformly distributed. Its diameter is much larger than that of hard salami and more closely resembles salami cotto (cooked) in size, hence the confusion of some people. It is smaller in diameter than the traditional mortadella de Bologna because the smoking process causes some shrinkage. It is best served at room temperature to bring out its rich flavour.\n\n===Central, Southern and Eastern Europe===\nIn Romania, a similar cold cut is also known as ''parizer''. It is a type of artisan bologna.\nIn Hungary, a similar product is called, in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], ''mortadella'' and a plain variety called ''pariser'', ''parizer'' or ''p\u00e1rizsi''. The term ''parizer'' is also often used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, while ''parizier'' is used in other territories of the Balkans. The classic Italian ''mortadella'' is widely sold in supermarkets along the entire Adriatic coast. \n\nIn Greece, where there is a smaller version in addition to the regular one, that variety is called Parizaki or Mortadelaki, and in Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia, the product known as ''mortadela'' is widely eaten. \n\nIn Poland, ''mortadela'' slices are sometimes dipped in batter, fried and served with potatoes and salads as a quicker (and cheaper) alternative to traditional [[pork chop]]s.\n\n===Middle East and North Africa===\nIn several countries, such as Morocco, Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Israel, [[halal]] or [[kosher]] mortadella is sold, which is made from chicken, beef, or turkey. The Palestinian Siniora brand, established in Jerusalem in 1920<ref>http://www.siniorafood.com/en-us/About-Us/Company-Overview</ref>, is the first in the region, a mortadella with sliced olives, pistachios or pepper.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Farmer Jack \u2014 a Siniora Sons Inc.

A variety that includes olives and pimentos is called [[olive loaf]].\n\nMortadella is one of the three meats in [[Central Grocery|Central Grocery's]] [[Muffaletta]] Sandwich in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], [[United States|USA]] along with Holland ham and Genoa salami.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frenchquarter.com/best-muffulettas-french-quarter-nearby/|title=Best Muffulettas in the French Quarter and Nearby|website=FrenchQuarter.com}}</ref>\n\nMortadella was banned from import into the United States from 1967 to 2000 due to an outbreak of African swine fever in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/13/weekinreview/february-6-12-the-return-of-mortadella.html|title=The Return of Mortadella|date=13 February 2000|work=The New York Times}}</ref> This ban was a pivotal part of the plot of the 1971 film [[Lady Liberty (film)|''La mortadella'']] starring [[Sophia Loren]].

The use of [[positive punishment]] by board certified behavior analysts is restricted to extreme circumstances when all other forms of treatment have failed and when the behavior to be modified is a danger to the person or to others (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]). In clinical settings positive punishment is usually restricted to using a spray bottle filled with water as an aversive event. When misused, more aversive punishment can lead to affective (emotional) disorders, as well as to the receiver of the punishment increasingly trying to avoid the punishment (i.e., \"not get caught\")..\n\nBehavior modification relies on the following:\n* [[Reinforcement]] (positive and negative)\n* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]] (positive and negative)\n* [[Extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]\n* [[Shaping (psychology)|Shaping]]\n* [[Applied behavior analysis#Fading|Fading]]\n* [[Chaining]]\n\n==Some areas of effectiveness==\n[[Functional analysis (psychology)|Functional behavior assessment]] forms the core of [[applied behavior analysis]].

The use of [[positive punishment]] by board certified behavior analysts is restricted to extreme circumstances when all other forms of treatment have failed and when the behavior to be modified is a danger to the person or to others (see [[professional practice of behavior analysis]]). In clinical settings positive punishment is usually restricted to using a spray bottle filled with water as an aversive event. When misused, more aversive punishment can lead to affective (emotional) disorders, as well as to the receiver of the punishment increasingly trying to avoid the punishment (i.e., \"not get caught\")..\n\nBehavior modification relies on the following:\n* [[Reinforcement]] (positive and negative)\n* [[Punishment (psychology)|Punishment]] (positive and negative)\n* [[Extinction (psychology)|Extinction]]\n* [[Shaping (psychology)|Shaping]]\n* [[Applied behavior analysis#Fading|Fading]]\n* [[Chaining]]\n\n==Some areas of effectiveness==\n[[Functional analysis (psychology)|Functional behavior assessment]] forms the core of [[applied behavior analysis]].

They have shown success in reducing recidivism for adolescents with conduct problems and adult offenders. One particular program that is of interest is ''teaching-family homes'' (see [[Teaching Family Model]]), which is based on a social learning model that emerged from [[radical behaviorism]].

They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status. If this was to be done, it would presumably require that the boundaries of the regions be slightly modified so that they correspond exactly with their constituent districts.\n\n* [[Regions of Assam]]\n* [[Regions of Gujarat]]\n\n== Districts ==\n{{main|List of districts in India}}\nStates and territories (or divisions) are further subdivided into [[Districts of India|districts]] (''zilla''), of which there are 722 (as of 2018).

They are purely geographic regions; some correspond to historic countries, states or provinces. A region may comprise one or more divisions, averaging about three divisions per region. However, the boundaries of the regions and the boundaries of the divisions do not always coincide exactly. So far there has been no movement to give the regions official administrative status. If this was to be done, it would presumably require that the boundaries of the regions be slightly modified so that they correspond exactly with their constituent districts.\n\n* [[Regions of Assam]]\n* [[Regions of Gujarat]]\n\n== Districts ==\n{{main|List of districts in India}}\nStates and territories (or divisions) are further subdivided into [[Districts of India|districts]] (''zilla''), of which there are 722 (as of 2018).

He was then appointed Chief of the Government Operations Section, Criminal Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he served until his appointment as [[United States Attorney]] for the Western District of Texas in 1971.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Federal judicial service==\nSessions was nominated by President [[Gerald Ford]] on December 11, 1974, to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]] vacated by Judge [[Ernest Allen Guinn]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on December 19, 1974, and received his commission on December 20, 1974. He served as Chief Judge from 1980 to 1987.

He worked to raise the image of the FBI in Congress and fought to raise the pay of FBI agents, which had lagged behind other law enforcement agencies.<ref name=\"Atlas\"/>\n\nDespite being a Republican who was appointed by Reagan, Sessions disappointed the administration of President [[George H. W. Bush]] for not being partisan, and he was personally disliked by Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]]. Sessions had an uneasy relationship with Thornburgh's successor [[William P. Barr]]. Reflecting the tensions between the Justice Department and the independent Bureau, Sessions announced that the FBI would be looking into whether Justice Department officials illegally misled a federal judge in a politically sensitive bank fraud case involving loans to Iraq before the [[Persian Gulf War]], and 48 hours later Sessions was the subject of an ethics investigation on whether he had abused his office perks.<ref name=\"Johnston\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/us/fbi-chief-plans-to-fight-for-job.html|work=The New York Times|first=David|last=Johnston|title=F.B.I.

By law it had to be included on all imported arcade games released in North America and continued to appear long after Sessions left office. The quote normally appeared in gold against a blue background between the FBI seal and Sessions' name. It first appeared in 1989, and was used until 2000.\n\nSessions' major contributions to the US criminal justice community include the encouraging of the FBI Laboratory to develop a DNA program with a strong legal underpinning and the automation of the national fingerprint process. The latter project, known as the [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS), reduced the turnaround time for fingerprint searches for both criminal arrest cycles and applicants for sensitive positions to include teachers from months to hours.<ref name=\"Atlas\"/>\n\nSessions was FBI director during the controversial 1992 [[Ruby Ridge|confrontation at Ruby Ridge, Idaho]], at which the unarmed Vicky Weaver was shot dead by an FBI sniper. This incident provoked heavy criticism of the Bureau, as did the [[Waco Siege|deadly assault]] on the [[Branch Davidian]] compound at [[Waco]] which lasted from February 28 to April 19, 1993. These incidents were also related to the discovery of severe procedural shortcomings at the FBI's crime laboratory.\n\nJust before [[Bill Clinton]] was inaugurated as the 42nd [[President of the United States]] on January 20, 1993, allegations of ethical improprieties were made against Sessions. A report by outgoing Attorney General [[William P.

He received a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1958 from [[Baylor Law School]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{FJC Bio|2146|nid=1387606|name=William Steele Sessions (1930\u2013) }}</ref> At Baylor, Sessions became a member of the [[Delta Chi]] fraternity. Sessions is an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]].\n\n==Legal career==\nSessions was an attorney for the firm of Haley, Fulbright, Winniford, Sessions, and Bice in [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], Texas from 1963 until 1969. He was then appointed Chief of the Government Operations Section, Criminal Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he served until his appointment as [[United States Attorney]] for the Western District of Texas in 1971.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Federal judicial service==\nSessions was nominated by President [[Gerald Ford]] on December 11, 1974, to a seat on the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Texas]] vacated by Judge [[Ernest Allen Guinn]]. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on December 19, 1974, and received his commission on December 20, 1974. He served as Chief Judge from 1980 to 1987. He served as a board member of the [[Federal Judicial Center]] from 1980 to 1984. His service terminated on November 1, 1987, due to his resignation.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (1987\u20131993)==\nAfter a two-month search, Sessions was nominated to succeed [[William H. Webster]] as FBI Director by President [[Ronald Reagan]] and was sworn in November 2, 1987.<ref name=\"Atlas\"/>\n\nSessions was viewed as combining tough direction with fairness and was respected even by the Reagan administration's critics, although he was sometimes ridiculed as straitlaced and dull and lacking hands-on leadership. He worked to raise the image of the FBI in Congress and fought to raise the pay of FBI agents, which had lagged behind other law enforcement agencies.<ref name=\"Atlas\"/>\n\nDespite being a Republican who was appointed by Reagan, Sessions disappointed the administration of President [[George H. W. Bush]] for not being partisan, and he was personally disliked by Attorney General [[Dick Thornburgh]]. Sessions had an uneasy relationship with Thornburgh's successor [[William P. Barr]]. Reflecting the tensions between the Justice Department and the independent Bureau, Sessions announced that the FBI would be looking into whether Justice Department officials illegally misled a federal judge in a politically sensitive bank fraud case involving loans to Iraq before the [[Persian Gulf War]], and 48 hours later Sessions was the subject of an ethics investigation on whether he had abused his office perks.<ref name=\"Johnston\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/19/us/fbi-chief-plans-to-fight-for-job.html|work=The New York Times|first=David|last=Johnston|title=F.B.I.

By law it had to be included on all imported arcade games released in North America and continued to appear long after Sessions left office. The quote normally appeared in gold against a blue background between the FBI seal and Sessions' name. It first appeared in 1989, and was used until 2000.\n\nSessions' major contributions to the US criminal justice community include the encouraging of the FBI Laboratory to develop a DNA program with a strong legal underpinning and the automation of the national fingerprint process. The latter project, known as the [[Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System]] (IAFIS), reduced the turnaround time for fingerprint searches for both criminal arrest cycles and applicants for sensitive positions to include teachers from months to hours.<ref name=\"Atlas\"/>\n\nSessions was FBI director during the controversial 1992 [[Ruby Ridge|confrontation at Ruby Ridge, Idaho]], at which the unarmed Vicky Weaver was shot dead by an FBI sniper. This incident provoked heavy criticism of the Bureau, as did the [[Waco Siege|deadly assault]] on the [[Branch Davidian]] compound at [[Waco]] which lasted from February 28 to April 19, 1993. These incidents were also related to the discovery of severe procedural shortcomings at the FBI's crime laboratory.\n\nJust before [[Bill Clinton]] was inaugurated as the 42nd [[President of the United States]] on January 20, 1993, allegations of ethical improprieties were made against Sessions. A report by outgoing Attorney General [[William P. Barr]] presented to the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] that month by the [[Office of Professional Responsibility]] included criticisms that he had used an FBI plane to travel to visit his daughter on several occasions, and had a security system installed in his home at government expense.<ref name=\"Johnston\"/> [[Janet Reno]], the 78th [[Attorney General of the United States]], announced that Sessions had exhibited \"serious deficiencies in judgment.\"<ref name=\"Time's Up for William Sessions\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/22/opinion/time-s-up-for-william-sessions.html | work=The New York Times | title=Time's Up for William Sessions  |date=1993-01-22}}</ref>\n\nAlthough Sessions denied that he had acted improperly, he was pressured to resign in early July, with some suggesting that President Clinton was giving Sessions the chance to step down in a dignified manner.

He started working on a sequel, ''[[Battle Royale II: Requiem]]'', but he died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Kitano. His son [[Kenta Fukasaku]], who wrote the screenplay for both films, completed the film in 2003.\n\n''Battle Royale'' became a cultural phenomenon, and has been highly influential in global [[popular culture]]. Since the film's release, the term \"[[battle royal]]e\" has been redefined to refer to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment inspired by the film, where a select group of people are instructed to kill each other off until there is a triumphant survivor. It has inspired numerous media, including films, manga, anime, comics, visual novels, and video games; the [[battle royale game]] genre, for example, is named after the film and fornite is ok.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nFollowing a major [[Lost Decade (Japan)|recession]], the [[Japanese government]] has passed the \"BR ACT\u201d to control Japan's unruly youth. Middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his father committed [[suicide in Japan|suicide]]. Noriko Nakagawa is the only student regularly attending class 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded by Yoshitoki Kuninobu, Shuya's best friend.\n\nOne year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces|JSDF soldiers]], explaining to the class that they are chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges, while explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within daily \"danger zones\". Each student is provided rations, water, a map of the island, compass, flashlight, and a random weapon. Kitano personally kills two of the students for disobedience, one of them being Kuninobu, who dies from collar detonation.\n\nThe first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide, and eight caused by the desperate, psychotic Mitsuko Souma and psychopathic volunteer Kazuo Kiriyama. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go after killing one student, while Shuya accidentally kills a student, Oki, which is witnessed by Yuko Sakaki, while basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system to disrupt the program. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe as Yoshitoki secretly loved her. He carries her to a clinic, where Kawada reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko Onuki, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs as a distraction. Shuya is wounded by  Kiriyama's [[Uzi]]. However, he is saved by Hiroki Sugimura, a martial artist who has recently had his friend Takako Chigusa die in his arms, and is on a personal mission to find his [[unrequited love]], Kayoko Kotohiki.\n\nShuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him. Five other girls are also hiding in the building, including Yuko, who attempts to poison Shuya out of fear of Shuya possibly killing them like he did Tatsumichi Oki. However, Yuka accidentally eats the food, leading to a shootout between the girls. Yuko is the only survivor; horrified and realizing her mistake, she apologizes to Shuya and commits suicide. Shuya finds Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura.\n\nNow only ten players left, Hiroki is killed by Kotohiki, who is then killed by Mitsuko. Kiriyama kills Mitsuko with her own weapon, making Noriko the last surviving girl.  Mimura and two others, Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima, infiltrate the military's computer system, but Kiriyama kills them, but not before Mirmura uses his homemade bomb to explode the base to hide all evidence. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills Kiriyama, who had his eyes burned out by the explosion, by detonating the collar with his shotgun, but in turn is seriously injured by Kiriyama's uzi.\n\nOn the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko by shooting them. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor. Kitano realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand, and has disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a homemade painting of the massacred class depicting Noriko as the sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter, and confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he threatens her with a gun. As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing the gun to be a water pistol. Kitano's daughter calls him; after an argument, he shoots the phone with an actual gun before dying of his wounds.\n\nShuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from the injuries, happy that he found friendship. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and are last seen on the run in the direction of [[Shibuya Station]]. Noriko gives Shuya the Seto Dragon Claw [[butterfly knife]] Kuninobu used to injure Kitano at the beginning of the film.

At that time, his class was made to work in a munitions factory. In July 1945, the factory came under artillery fire. The children could not escape so they dived under each other for cover. The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses.

When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word \"run\" in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as \"very positive\", Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewer's question as having \"a stronger meaning\" than \"a simple message.\" He further explained that the film simply contains his \"words to the next generation\", so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.<ref name=\"BRBritishInterview\"/><ref name=\"Midnighteyeint\">\"[http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kinji_fukasaku.shtml Kinji Fukasaku]\", ''Midnight Eye''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] of ''Battle Royale'' was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Masamichi Amano]], performed by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] and features several pieces of [[Western classical music]] along with Amano's original compositions.

Unusually, the extra material includes scenes newly filmed after the release of the original. Inserted scenes include (but are not limited to):\n* Flashbacks to a basketball game which is used as a framework for the entire story.\n* A flashback that expands on a likely contributor to Mitsuko Souma's [[mental illness]] or sociopathy. She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man, who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.\n* Three epilogues (referred to as \"requiems\"). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsuko's apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship that may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.\n* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.\n* Added reaction shots in the classroom, and extensions to existing shots.\n* Extra CGI throughout the film.\n\n===3D theatrical re-release===\nThe film was released to theaters in [[3-D film|3D]] in Japan on November 20, 2010.

He started working on a sequel, ''[[Battle Royale II: Requiem]]'', but he died of [[prostate cancer]] on January 12, 2003, after shooting only one scene with Kitano. His son [[Kenta Fukasaku]], who wrote the screenplay for both films, completed the film in 2003.\n\n''Battle Royale'' became a cultural phenomenon, and has been highly influential in global [[popular culture]]. Since the film's release, the term \"[[battle royal]]e\" has been redefined to refer to a fictional narrative genre and/or mode of entertainment inspired by the film, where a select group of people are instructed to kill each other off until there is a triumphant survivor. It has inspired numerous media, including films, manga, anime, comics, visual novels, and video games; the [[battle royale game]] genre, for example, is named after the film.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->\nFollowing a major [[Lost Decade (Japan)|recession]], the [[Japanese government]] has passed the \"BR ACT\u201d to control Japan's unruly youth. Middle school student Shuya Nanahara copes with life after his father committed [[suicide in Japan|suicide]]. Noriko Nakagawa is the only student regularly attending class 3-B. Their teacher, Kitano, resigns after being wounded by Yoshitoki Kuninobu, Shuya's best friend.\n\nOne year later, class 3-B takes a field trip, but they are gassed and taken to a remote island. Kitano reappears surrounded by [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces|JSDF soldiers]], explaining to the class that they are chosen to participate in the annual Battle Royale as a result of the Act: they have three days to fight to the death until a victor emerges, while explosive collars will kill uncooperative students or those within daily \"danger zones\". Each student is provided rations, water, a map of the island, compass, flashlight, and a random weapon. Kitano personally kills two of the students for disobedience, one of them being Kuninobu, who dies from collar detonation.\n\nThe first six hours see twelve deaths, four by suicide, and eight caused by the desperate, psychotic Mitsuko Souma and psychopathic volunteer Kazuo Kiriyama. Transfer student Shogo Kawada lets Shuya go after killing one student, while Shuya accidentally kills a student, Oki, which is witnessed by Yuko Sakaki, while basketball player Shinji Mimura plots to hack into the military's computer system to disrupt the program. Amid shifting loyalties and violent confrontations, Shuya promises to keep Noriko safe as Yoshitoki secretly loved her. He carries her to a clinic, where Kawada reveals that he won a previous Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend, Keiko Onuki, whose death he seeks to avenge. When Kiriyama attacks, Shuya entrusts Kawada to protect Noriko and runs as a distraction. Shuya is wounded by  Kiriyama's [[Uzi]]. However, he is saved by Hiroki Sugimura, a martial artist who has recently had his friend Takako Chigusa die in his arms, and is on a personal mission to find his [[unrequited love]], Kayoko Kotohiki.\n\nShuya awakens in the island's lighthouse, bandaged by female class representative Yukie Utsumi, who has a crush on him. Five other girls are also hiding in the building, including Yuko, who attempts to poison Shuya out of fear of Shuya possibly killing them like he did Tatsumichi Oki. However, Yuka accidentally eats the food, leading to a shootout between the girls. Yuko is the only survivor; horrified and realizing her mistake, she apologizes to Shuya and commits suicide. Shuya finds Noriko and Kawada, and they set out to find Mimura.\n\nNow only ten players left, Hiroki is killed by Kotohiki, who is then killed by Mitsuko. Kiriyama kills Mitsuko with her own weapon, making Noriko the last surviving girl.  Mimura and two others, Yutaka Seto and Keita Iijima, infiltrate the military's computer system, but Kiriyama kills them, but not before Mirmura uses his homemade bomb to explode the base to hide all evidence. When Kawada, Noriko and Shuya arrive at the hackers' burning base, Kawada confronts and kills Kiriyama, who had his eyes burned out by the explosion, by detonating the collar with his shotgun, but in turn is seriously injured by Kiriyama's uzi.\n\nOn the morning of the final day, Kawada, aware of the collars' internal microphones, seemingly kills Shuya and Noriko by shooting them. Suspicious, Kitano ends the game and dismisses the troops, intent on personally killing the supposed victor. Kitano realizes that Kawada hacked the system months beforehand, and has disabled Shuya and Noriko's tracking devices. The three survivors confront Kitano in the headquarters, and he unveils a homemade painting of the massacred class depicting Noriko as the sole survivor. He reveals that he was unable to bear the hatred between him and his students, having been rejected by his daughter, and confesses that he always thought of Noriko as a daughter. He asks her to kill him, but Shuya shoots him after he threatens her with a gun. As he falls, Kitano shoots, revealing the gun to be a water pistol. Kitano's daughter calls him; after an argument, he shoots the phone with an actual gun before dying of his wounds.\n\nShuya, Noriko and Kawada leave the island on a boat, but Kawada dies from the injuries, happy that he found friendship. Shuya and Noriko are declared fugitive murderers, and are last seen on the run in the direction of [[Shibuya Station]].

The surviving members of the class had to dispose of the corpses.

When the interviewer told Fukasaku that he asked the question specifically because of the word \"run\" in the concluding text, which the interviewer described as \"very positive\", Fukasaku explained that he developed the concept throughout the film. Fukasaku interpreted the interviewer's question as having \"a stronger meaning\" than \"a simple message.\" He further explained that the film simply contains his \"words to the next generation\", so the viewer should decide whether to take the words as advice or as a warning.<ref name=\"BRBritishInterview\"/><ref name=\"Midnighteyeint\">\"[http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/kinji_fukasaku.shtml Kinji Fukasaku]\", ''Midnight Eye''</ref>\n\n===Music===\nThe [[film score]] of ''Battle Royale'' was composed, arranged and conducted by [[Masamichi Amano]], performed by the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]] and features several pieces of [[Western classical music]] along with Amano's original compositions.

Unusually, the extra material includes scenes newly filmed after the release of the original. Inserted scenes include (but are not limited to):\n* Flashbacks to a basketball game which is used as a framework for the entire story.\n* A flashback that expands on a likely contributor to Mitsuko Souma's [[mental illness]] or sociopathy. She comes home from school to find her mother drunk with a strange man, who tries to molest her. She then pushes him down the staircase to his death.\n* Three epilogues (referred to as \"requiems\"). The first is an extension of the basketball scene, showing the students of Class 3-B winning their game. It also spotlights Mitsuko's apparent social anxiety and alienation from the classmates in 3-B. The second is a vision of Nobu telling Shuya to take care of Noriko (a replay of a hallucination seen earlier in the special version of the film). The third is a scene between Kitano and Noriko, who talk casually by a riverbank; parts of this scene (a dream sequence) also appear in the original version of the film, but with the dialogue muted whereas in the requiem it is audible and reveals a friendship or other relationship that may or may not have existed between Noriko and Kitano.\n* Added shots of the lighthouse after the shoot-out.\n* Added reaction shots in the classroom, and extensions to existing shots.\n* Extra CGI throughout the film.\n\n===3D theatrical re-release===\nThe film was released to theaters in [[3-D film|3D]] in Japan on November 20, 2010.
