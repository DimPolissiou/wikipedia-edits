Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.

Mentioning re-runs in later years takes up too much space considering they are not really necessarily in the context of a programming list. It would also cause difficulties in trying to keep track of every year a particular film is aired, especially with the films that have not aired in a long time. The same practice is used for sections like \"Former original programming\" and \"Pilots and specials\" listed above, as Adult Swim tends to re-air things for years and years on a non-consistent basis after their original debut airings.

The factory was located in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], and was called the [[Dodge Main|Dodge Main factory]] from 1910 until its closing in January 1980. Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920, and the company was sold by their families to [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. \n\nDodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of [[truck]]s and [[Full-size car|full-sized]] passenger cars through the 1970s, though it made compact cars (such as the 1963\u201376 [[Dodge Dart|Dart]]) and midsize cars (such as the \"B-Body\" [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] and [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] from 1966\u201378).\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the [[Chrysler K platform|K platform]] of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K [[automobile platform|platform]] and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s; one such derivative became the [[Dodge Caravan]].\n\nThe Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its short-lived merger with [[Daimler AG|Daimler-Benz AG]] from 1998 to 2007,<ref>{{cite web |title=Company History - \"World Corp.\" vision: the merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler (1995 - 2007) |url=https://www.daimler.com/company/tradition/company-history/1995-2007.html |publisher=Daimler |date=2019 |quote=On 7 May 1998, Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft in Germany and Chrysler Corporation in the United States of America signed a merger contract. |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> its subsequent sale to [[Cerberus Capital Management]], its 2009 [[Effects of the 2008\u20132010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|bailout by the United States government]], and its subsequent [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] and acquisition by [[Fiat]].\n\nIn 2011, Dodge and its model sub-brands, [[Ram Trucks|Dodge Ram]], and [[Dodge Viper]] were separated. Dodge said that the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] would be an [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] product and [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] will be a standalone marque. In 2014, [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]] was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, [[Chrysler|Chrysler Group]] was renamed [[FCA US LLC]], corresponding with the merger of [[Fiat S.p.A.]] and Chrysler Group into the single corporate structure of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 230\n | header = The Dodge brothers\n | image1 = John Francis Dodge.jpg\n | caption1 = John Francis Dodge\n | image2 = Horace Elgin Dodge.jpg\n | caption2 = Horace Elgin Dodge }}\n\n===Founding and early years===\n[[Horace Elgin Dodge|Horace]] and [[John Francis Dodge|John Dodge]] founded the ''Dodge Brothers'' Company in Detroit in 1900, and quickly found work manufacturing precision engine and [[chassis]] components for the city's growing number of automobile firms.

Henry Ford selected the Dodge brothers to supply a wide range of components for his original [[Ford Model A (1903\u201304)|Model A (1903\u201304)]] that included the complete chassis; thus Ford needed to add only the body and wheels to finish the cars.<ref>{{cite book |last=DeLorenzo |first=Matt |title=Dodge 100 Years |date=2014 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9781627880848 |pages=8\u20139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zm91AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> Henry offered the Dodge brothers a 10% share in his new company in return for $10,000 worth of goods.\n\nThe first machine shop where the brothers worked as parts suppliers for Olds and Ford was located at the Boydell Building on Beaubien Street at Lafayette. This location was replaced by a larger facility at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue, which is now a parking garage for the [[Greektown Casino Hotel]] (Hastings Street at this location has been renamed Chrysler Service Drive).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgemotorcar.com/history/early_history.php |title=Locations of earlier Dodge Brothers workshops |publisher=Dodgemotorcar.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> By 1910 the [[Dodge Main]] factory was built in Hamtramck, where it remained until 1979.\n\n[[File:1915-dodge-archives.jpg|right|thumb|1915 Model 30-35 touring car]]\n[[File:Royal baking trucks.jpg|thumb|Dodge Brothers delivery trucks, [[Salt Lake City]], 1920]]\n[[File:Light-repair-truck-FAJ19200910.jpg|thumb|[[M1918 light repair truck]] [[G-numbers|G10]], likely U.S. Army (Field Artillery Journal Sep-Oct 1920)]]\n\nThe Dodge Brothers Motor Company was established in 1913 and by 1914, John and Horace designed and debuted the first car of their own \u2013 the four-cylinder Dodge Model 30/35 touring car.<ref>{{cite web |title=This day in history: January 14: Dodge co-founder dies |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dodge-co-founder-dies |author=History.com Editors |publisher=A&E Television Networks |date=August 21, 2018 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> Marketed as a slightly more upscale competitor to the ubiquitous [[Ford Model T]], it pioneered or made standard many features later taken for granted, like all-steel body construction (as the vast majority of cars worldwide still used wood-framing under steel panels);<ref group=nb>though Stoneleigh and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] used steel bodies as early as 1911</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Tom |editor-last=Northey |last=Wise |first=David Burgess |chapter=Dodge |title=The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car |publisher=Purnell Reference Books |year=1977 |volume=5 |page=552 |isbn=978-0-8393-6009-4}}</ref> 12-volt electrical system (6-volt systems would remain the norm until the 1950s); 35 horsepower<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1920_Dodge_Brothers/1920_Dodge_Brothers_Brochure/1920%20Dodge%20Brothers-19.html |title=1920 Dodge Brothers Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> engines versus the Model T's 20 horsepower, and sliding-gear [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] (the best-selling Model T would retain an antiquated planetary design until its demise in 1927).

During this time, the Model 30 was evolved to become the new Series 116 (though it retained the same basic construction and engineering features). However, as the 1920s progressed, Dodge gradually lost its ranking as the third best-selling automobile manufacturer, slipping down to seventh in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, Dodge Brothers expanded the truck line and became a leading builder of light trucks. After greatly expanding production capacity, in 1921 Haynes signed a contract whereby Dodge's vast dealer network would exclusively market trucks with bodies built by Graham Brothers of Evansville, Indiana. This Graham truck line from then on used only Dodge-built chassis, from 1-ton to 3-ton capacity, and Dodge kept making light-duty trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\">{{cite web|url= https://forums.aaca.org/topic/210257-my-1934-dodge-4x4-15-ton/ |title=my 1934 Dodge 4x4 1.5 ton - Dodge Trucks |work=Antique Automobile Club of America - Discussion Forums |date=June 5, 2019 |accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStagnation in development was becoming apparent, however, and the public responded by dropping Dodge Brothers to fifth place in the industry by 1925. That year, the Dodge Brothers company was sold by the widows to the well-known investment group [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] for no less than US$146&nbsp;million (at the time, the largest cash transaction in history).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://usjunkyardsnearme.com/car-resources/dodge-history/ |title=Dodge History |publisher=usjunkyardsnearme.com |accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDillon, Read & Co. offered non-voting stock on the market in the new Dodge Brothers firm, and along with the sale of bonds was able to raise $160&nbsp;million, reaping a $14&nbsp;million (net) profit. All voting stock was retained by Dillon, Read. Frederick Haynes remained as company head until E.G. Wilmer was named board chairman in November, 1926. Wilmer was a banker with no auto experience and Haynes remained as president. Changes to the car, save for superficial things like [[trim level]]s and colors, remained minimal until 1927, when the new Senior six-cylinder line was introduced. The former four-cylinder line was kept on, but renamed the [[Dodge Fast Four|Fast Four]] line until it was dropped in favor of two lighter six-cylinder models (the Standard Six and Victory Six) for 1928.\n\nOn October 1, 1925, Dodge Brothers, Inc., acquired a 51% interest in [[Graham Brothers]], Inc., for $13&nbsp;million and the remaining 49% on May 1, 1926. Haynes purchased all of Graham's truck activity, and in 1926, the Graham branch took charge of all of Dodge's truck manufacturing.

The brothers established the [[Graham-Paige]] company to build a new line of Graham passenger cars.\n\nDespite all this, Dodge Brothers' sales had already dropped to seventh place in the industry by 1927, and Dillon, Read began looking for someone to take over the company on a more permanent basis. Eventually Dodge was sold to the new Chrysler Corporation in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://gearheads.org/the-dodge-motor-company/ |title=The Dodge Motor Company |date=May 21, 2012 |publisher=Gear Heads |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> On January 2, 1929, Chrysler announced that the Graham Badge was dropped, and Dodge Brothers were building Chrysler's trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\"/>\n\n===Pre-war years===\n[[File:1933 Dodge advert by Muray.jpg|thumb|Dodge aimed for the luxury market in this advertisement for the 1933 model Eight]]\nTo fit better in the Chrysler Corporation lineup, alongside low-priced [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and medium-priced [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], Dodge's lineup for early 1930 was trimmed down to a core group of two lines and thirteen models (from three lines and nineteen models just over a year previous). Prices started out just above DeSoto but were somewhat less than top-of-the-line [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]], in a small-scale recreation of [[General Motors Companion Make Program|General Motors' \"step-up\" marketing concept]]. (DeSoto and Dodge would swap places in the market for the 1933 model year, Dodge dropping down between Plymouth and DeSoto.) As Plymouth cars were sold at Chrysler dealerships, Dodge branded vehicles were sold as a lower cost alternative to DeSoto.\n\nFor 1930, Dodge took another step up by adding a new eight-cylinder line to replace the existing Senior six-cylinder. This basic format of a dual line with Six and Eight models continued through 1933, and the cars were gradually streamlined and lengthened in step with prevailing trends of the day. The Dodge Eight was replaced by a larger Dodge DeLuxe Six for 1934, which was dropped for 1935. A long-[[wheelbase]] edition of the remaining Six was added for 1936 and would remain a part of the lineup for many years. To enhance production, in 1932 Chrysler built a factory in [[Los Angeles (Maywood) Assembly|Los Angeles, California]] where Chrysler, DeSoto, Dodge and Plymouth vehicles were built until the factory closed in 1971.\n[[File:1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck.jpg|thumb|left|1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck]]\n[[File:Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939.jpg|thumb|Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939]]\n\nThe Dodge line, along with most of the corporation's output, was restyled in the so-called \"Wind Stream\" look for 1935. This was a mild form of [[streamliner|streamlining]], which saw sales jump remarkably over the previous year (even though Dodge as a whole still dropped to fifth place for the year after two years of holding down fourth). Dodge never got the radical [[Airflow Chrysler|Airflow]] styling that was the cause of depressed sales of Chryslers and DeSotos from 1934 to 1937, as a passenger sedan, but it was used on commercial truck for a short time. Dodge (along with the rest of Chrysler) added safety features such as a smooth, flat dashboard with no protruding knobs, curved in door handles, and padded front-seat backs for the benefit of the rear-seat occupants.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1940_Dodge/1940_Dodge_Brochure/1940%20Dodge-09-10.html |title=1940 Dodge Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother major restyle arrived for the 25th-anniversary 1939 models, which Dodge dubbed the Luxury Liner series. These were once again completely redesigned, with new bodies for 1940, again in 1941, and a refreshing for 1942. However, just after the 1942 models were introduced, Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] forced the shutdown of Dodge's passenger car [[assembly line]]s in favor of [[Military production during World War II|war production]] in February 1942. 1941 saw the introduction of Fluid Drive for Dodge cars, which eliminated stalling or bucking if the clutch were released too quickly. This feature put a fluid coupling in between the engine and the clutch, although the driver still had to shift gears manually.\n\n===World War II===\nChrysler was prolific in its production of [[Materiel|war materiel]], especially from 1942 to 1945.

The \"[[supply and demand|seller's market]]\" of the early [[postwar]] years, brought on by the lack of any new cars throughout the war, meant that every automaker found it easy to sell vehicles regardless of any drawbacks they might have. Like almost every other automaker, Dodge sold lightly [[facelift (product)|facelifted]] revisions of its 1942 design through the 1948 season. As before, these were a single series of six-cylinder models with two trim levels (basic Deluxe or plusher Custom). From 1949 until 1954, Fluid Drive could be combined with \"Gyro-Matic,\" a semi-automatic transmission which reduced (but did not eliminate) the need to shift gears.\n\nStyling was not initially Dodge's strong point during this period, though that began to change by 1953 under the direction of corporate design chief [[Virgil Exner]].  However the deluxe Coronet series, introduced for 1949, offered extra luxury as the top of the line.  The Coronet Diplomat, Dodge's first pillarless hardtop coupe, was new for 1950, at least one year before Ford, Plymouth, and other popular car makes offered it.  At the same time, Dodge also introduced its first V8 engine \u2013 the Red Ram Hemi, a smaller version of the original design of the famed [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Chrysler Hemi]]. The new 1953 bodies were smaller and based on the Plymouth. For 1954, sales dropped, the stubby styling not going over well with the public. 1954 also saw the introduction of the fully automatic PowerFlite transmission.\n\nChrysler borrowed $250 million from [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] in 1954 to finance expansion, acquisition, and updating the outdated styling of their car lines that was contributed to Chrysler failing to benefit from the postwar boom as GM and Ford were.<ref>{{cite book|last=Genat |first=Robert |title=Mopar Muscle |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610590839 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yARkK-FHHO8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |year=2004 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jefferys |first=Steve |title=Management and Managed: Fifty Years of Crisis at Chrysler |year=1986 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=9780521304412 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1954/03/02/83747978.html?pageNumber=33 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 2, 1954 |title=Chrysler Borrows $250 Million For Growth on Note Due in 2054 |pages=33, 36}}</ref>\n\nExner led creation of the new corporate \"[[Forward Look]]\" styling of 1955, beginning a new era for Dodge. With steadily upgraded styling and ever-stronger engines every year through 1960, Dodge found a ready market for its products as America discovered the joys of freeway travel. This situation improved when Dodge introduced a new line of Dodges called the Dart to do battle against Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth. The result was that Dodge sales in the middle price class collapsed. Special and regional models were sold as well, including the LaFemme (a white and orchid-trimmed hardtop marketed toward women) and the Texan, a gold-accented Dodge sold in the Lone Star State. 1957 saw the introduction of a new automatic transmission, three-speed TorqueFlite. Both PowerFlite and TorqueFlite were controlled by mechanical push-buttons until 1965.  1956 saw the introduction of the 4-door pillarless hardtop (the same year most other makes offered this body style) in all three Dodge series, Custom Royal, Royal, and Coronet.  Dodge's pillarless models were all badged \"Lancer.\"\n[[File:Dodge Coronet 1958.jpg|thumb|1958 Dodge Coronet Lancer hardtop coupe]]\n\nDodge entered the compact car field for 1961 with their new [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]], a variation on Plymouth's [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]]. Though it was not initially successful, the [[Dodge Dart|Dart]] range that succeeded the Lancer in 1963 would prove to be one of the division's top sellers for many years.\n\nChrysler made an ill-advised move to downsize the Dodge and Plymouth full-size lines for 1962, which resulted in a loss of sales. However, they turned this around in 1965 by turning those former full-sizes into \"new\" mid-size models; Dodge revived the [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] nameplate in this way and later added a sporty [[fastback]] version called the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] that became both a sales leader and a winner on the [[NASCAR]] circuit. Not only did this style dominate the racetrack for 4 full years, its aerodynamic improvements forever changed the face of NASCAR racing.\n\nFull-size models evolved gradually during this time. After Dodge dealers complained about not having a true full-size car in the fall of 1961, the Custom 880 was hurried into production. The Custom 880 used the 1962 Chrysler Newport body with the 1961 Dodge front end and interior. The 880 continued into 1965, the year a completely new full-size body was put into production, the [[Dodge Polara|Polara]] entered the medium price class and the [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]] was added as the top series. The Polara and Monaco were changed mostly in appearance for the next ten years or so. Unique \"[[fuselage]]\" styling was employed for 1969 through 1973 and then was toned down again for the 1974 to 1977 models.\n[[File:1967 Dodge Coronet.jpg|right|thumb|1967 Dodge Coronet 440 sedan]]\n\nDodge targeted the [[muscle car]] market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Along with the Charger, models like the Coronet R/T and [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]] were popular with buyers seeking performance. The pinnacle of this effort was the introduction of the [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]] sports coupe and convertible (Dodge's entry into the \"pony car\" class ) in 1970, which offered everything from mild economy engines up to the race-ready Hemi V8 in the same package.\n\nIn an effort to reach every segment of the market, Dodge even reached a hand across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to its partner, [[Mitsubishi Motors]], and marketed their subcompact as the [[Dodge Colt|Colt]] to compete with the [[AMC Gremlin]], [[Chevrolet Vega]], and [[Ford Pinto]]. Chrysler would over the years come to rely heavily on their relationship with Mitsubishi. At the same time, Dodge got a version of the Plymouth Duster, marketed as the Dodge [[Dodge Dart#Third generation (1963\u20131966)|Demon]]. It was inexpensive, but with its slant-six engine (or V8), the Demon could not achieve the fuel economy of the four-cylinder Colt. The Demon sold in much fewer numbers than the Duster, so it is considered more collectible today, especially the V8 versions.\n\n=== 1973\u20131980 ===\n[[File:Dodge Charger (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Charger]]\n[[File:1977Diplomat.jpg|right|thumb|1977 [[Dodge Diplomat]] sedan]]\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] caused significant changes at Dodge, as well as Chrysler as a whole. Except for the Colt and Slant Six models of the Dart, Dodge's lineup was quickly seen as extremely inefficient. In fairness, this was true of most American automakers at the time, but Chrysler was also not in the best financial shape to do anything about it. Consequently, while General Motors and Ford were quick to begin downsizing their largest cars, Chrysler (and Dodge) moved more slowly out of necessity.\n\nAt the very least, Chrysler was able to use some of its other resources. Borrowing the recently introduced [[Chrysler Horizon]] from their [[Chrysler Europe|European division]], Dodge was able to get its new [[Dodge Omni|Omni]] subcompact on the market fairly quickly. At the same time, they increased the number of models imported from Japanese partner [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] starting in 1971: first came a smaller Colt (based on Mitsubishi's [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]] line), then a revival of the Challenger ([[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda|Dodge Challenger]]) in 1976 as a compact hardtop coupe with nothing more than a four-cylinder under the hood, rather than the booming V8s of yore.\n\nThe 1975 model year had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba share the same new body based on the [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]]. The Chrysler Cordoba had replaced the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came with a wide variety engines from the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} \"LA\" series small block V8 to three versions of {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} big block V8. The standard engine was the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225&nbsp;hp) being available as an option<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.car.info/en-se/dodge/charger/charger-se-1975-16796485|title=Dodge Charger SE 1975|website=car.info|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>. Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812. \n\n1976 was the Dart's final year in the North American market. The [[rear-view mirror]] was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on 1 January 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake performance requirements, and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash T-handle used since the Dart's 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille's parking lamps were cast in [[amber (color)|amber]], whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs. The Dart Sport 360 was dropped as a separate model in 1976, but the {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} four-barrel, dual exhaust (without catalytic converters) V8 was a $376 option (except in California) for the $3,370 Dart Sport V8 models with automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite book|last= Statham|first=Steve|title=Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year= 2000|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz-ItcylfasC&pg=PA124&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=NHlLS8v7GY7qygTWvpH5DQ&client=safari&cd=1#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn= 978-0-7603-0760-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> ''Car & Driver'' magazine tested the Dart Sport 360 in the April 1976 issue, pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am, and found its top speed of {{convert|121.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to be second to the Corvette's {{convert|124.5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Corvette, 1968\u20131982|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year=2000|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrPjl25HbucC&pg=PA105&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=qnlLS96JOJjCM_7j5IQO&client=safari&cd=6#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn=978-0-7603-0418-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref>\n\nDodge's replacement for the Dart was the Aspen, introduced in mid-1975 as a 1976 model.  This new design featured lighter weight resulting in slightly improved fuel economy; it also had more interior and trunk room than the Dart.  Front suspension was a new design; it featured transverse-mounted torsion bars which not only improved ride, but cornering as well.  Its boxy styling gave the impression of a larger car; however sales had to be shared with the virtually identical Plymouth Volare.  Both cars were available in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles, and in both base and deluxe trim.  Despite its virtues, customers soon found out about the Aspen's rush to market when they saw their cars experience severe body rust within a couple years on the road; engine and drive train problems plagued the Aspen/Volare twins, and although the problems were largely worked out within a few years, the final Aspens were the 1980 models.  This car was available with either a 225 cubic-inch Slant Six, or a small block V8 displacing 318 or 360 cubic inches.\n\n[[File:Dodge-Dart-sedan-2.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Dart 4-door sedan]]\n\n1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet, at least so far as the name Coronet went, also its body style choices were relegated to just only two four-door models, the four-door wagon and the four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year only was replaced by the [[Dodge Charger]] Sport 2-door model, which, itself, appeared for only one model year. During the next model year (1977), the mid-size Dodge Coronet would be renamed [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]], which would be given stacked rectangular headlights and other minor cosmetic changes, that would provide a prompt sales boost. The Coronet and Charger were effectively replaced by the [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]] for 1977, which was actually a fancier Aspen.\n\nAlso, during that same model year, the full-size Dodge Monaco would be renamed Dodge Royal Monaco, which would appear for just one model year only and after that, both Dodge and Plymouth (which would include Dodge Royal Monaco's entire Plymouth Gran Fury counterpart line up as well) would discontinue all production of any more full-size models. It lost sales every year, until finally being replaced by the [[Dodge St. Regis|St. Regis]] for 1979 following a one-year absence from the big car market. In a reversal of what happened for 1965, the St. Regis was an upsized Coronet. During the following model year (1978), the mid-size Dodge Monaco (which would include its entire Plymouth Fury counterpart line up as well) would make its final appearance (for all during the remainder of the 1970s).\n\nWhile the Aspen got accolades for styling and handling, build quality was problematic, sullying the car's reputation at the time when sales were desperately needed. It was noted for having problems with its carburetors which resulted in frequent stalling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Aspen also had difficulty in starting, even after leaving the engine off for several minutes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} This resulted in several recalls.\n\nThe Dodge Magnum was introduced for 1978 to supplement the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]]. It was sold in two forms, the \"XE\" and the \"GT\" and was the last vehicle to use the long running [[Chrysler B platform]]. The appearance was somewhat of a rounded off Charger, and was in response to getting a car that would be eligible for [[NASCAR]] that would be more aerodynamic, something that the 1975\u20131978 Charger was not. Styling features included four rectangular headlights behind retractable clear covers, with narrow [[opera window]]s, and an optional T-bar or power sunroof. The Magnum was well-featured with power steering, brakes and seats; the suspension included Chrysler's standard adjustable, longitudinal torsion bars, lower trailing links, and front and rear anti-sway bars. The base engine was the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with [[Lean-burn#Chrysler Electronic Lean-Burn|Lean-Burn]], while two and four-barrel carbureted {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were optional; weight was nearly {{convert|3900|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Omni and Horizon appeared at a critical time for Chrysler, when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy and sought government support to survive. In 1978, Chrysler had beaten out Ford and General Motors to the market with a domestically-produced front-wheel drive car to challenge the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|VW Rabbit]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/motoring-memories/motoring-memories-dodge-omniplymouth-horizon-1978-1990/|first=Bill |last=Vance |title=Motoring Memories: Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, 1978-1990 |publisher=autos canada |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}</ref> However, the L-bodies miscarried at first, since 1978 was a year of strong sales for larger cars and demand for compacts and subcompacts noticeably shrank. These initial poor sales of the cars contributed to Chrysler's financial woes at the time, but when the company requested federal assistance, the Omni was an important piece of evidence that they were attempting to compete with imports and build small, fuel-efficient cars and might be worth saving. For the three years leading up to the introduction of [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler's K-cars]], the Omni/Horizon was Chrysler's best selling model line.<ref name=RT82>{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January\u2013February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 93 }}</ref>\n\nEverything came to a head in 1979 when Chrysler's new chairman, [[Lee Iacocca]], requested and received federal loan guarantees from the [[United States Congress]] in an effort to save the company from having to file bankruptcy. With a Federal Loan in hand, Chrysler quickly set to work on new models that would leave the past behind, while reorganizing to pay the government loan which stood at 29%.\n\nThe Dodge Mirada was a [[mid-size]]d, [[rear-wheel drive]] [[coupe]] manufactured and marketed by Dodge for model years 1980 to 1983 sharing the [[Chrysler J platform]] along with its [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] variants, the second generation [[Chrysler Cordoba]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Production of the Mirada reached just under 53,000 units, staying relatively unchanged during its 4-year run, with the exception of paint colors and engines. The Mirada was marketed as a sporty [[personal luxury car]] with limited advertising and marketing during a period when Chrysler was in deep financial difficulty.\n\n=== 1981\u20131990 ===\n[[File:Dodge Aries sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1981\u201382 Aries Special Edition]]\n\nThe first fruit of Chrysler's crash development program was the \"[[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]]\", the Dodge version of which was the [[Dodge Aries]]. This basic and durable [[front-wheel drive]] platform spawned a whole range of new models at Dodge during the 1980s, including the groundbreaking [[Dodge Caravan]]. [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for this type of vehicle during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. [[Henry Ford II]] rejected the idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974. Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler, and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan \u2013 a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the Magic-wagons.<ref name=\"allpar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}</ref> Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, using the [[Chrysler S platform]], an extended derivative of the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The Caravan not only helped save Chrysler as a serious high-volume American automaker, but also spawned an entirely new market segment that supplanted the role of the station wagon: the [[minivan]]. \n\nBy 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller [[front-wheel drive]] designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Chrysler's then executive vice president for manufacturing, Steve Sharf, met with officials at [[American Motors]] (AMC) to use the extra capacity at an assembly plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] to build the cars.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\">{{cite journal |url=http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143253/http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |title=Oldest Auto Plant to Make Newest V-6 |first=David C. |last=Smith |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=1 June 2008 |archivedate=6 April 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Chrysler's tooling was moved from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to Kenosha, and from 1987 until 1989 about 250,000 Chrysler and Dodge models were built by AMC at a lower cost than Chrysler could.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> This relationship evolved into Chrysler's purchase of AMC in 1987.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> Following the demise of the [[Dodge St. Regis]] R-body in 1981, the Diplomat remained, becoming the largest sedan in the Dodge lineup, despite technically being a mid-size car. Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the [[Dodge Monaco#Fifth generation (1989-92)|Monaco]] debuted as a 1990 model.\n\n[[File:1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe]]\n[[File:1989 Dodge Aries K coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1985\u20131989 Dodge Aries coupe]]\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Although sales were strong, Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iaccoca]] held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. Despite lower gas prices in the mid- to late-1980s and a 2.26:1 rear-end gear ratio, the Diplomat's carbureted engine and lack of an overdrive gear on its [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission resulted in poor fuel economy compared with its larger competitors from Ford and General Motors, as evidenced by comparing the EPA estimates for 1986 models:\n\n* Dodge Diplomat (5.2&nbsp;L V8, 3-speed automatic): 16 city, 21 highway, 18 combined\n* Chevrolet Caprice (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 17 city, 25 highway, 20 combined\n* Ford LTD Crown Victoria (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 18 city, 26 highway, 21 combined\n\nThe Daytona originally used the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]] in [[normally aspirated]] (93&nbsp;hp) or [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] (142&nbsp;hp) form. The 100 [[horsepower|hp]] 2.5&nbsp;L K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2&nbsp;L Turbo I engine's horsepower was increased to {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}}. The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver 10Best#1984|10Best]] list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler [[electronic voice alert]] system through 1987. A performance oriented \"[[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]\" version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987. For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally, and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a ''Shelby Z'' trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II ({{convert|174|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \u2013 {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}) intercooled version of the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]], as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with [[Getrag]] gears. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name ''Chrysler GS Turbo II''. A more luxury-oriented ''Pacifica'' trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment included a leather interior, eight-way power enthusiast driver's seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), digital instrument cluster, and a 12-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated travel times).\n\n[[File:87-91 Dodge Daytona.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1987\u20131991 Dodge Daytona]]\n[[File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg|thumb|left|1987 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z]]\n\nDiplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver's side [[airbag]] as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler's lineup (they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag). Diplomats with airbags differed from earlier models in that they were also equipped with a padded, color-keyed knee blocker which extended out from beneath the instrument panel in front of the driver.\n\nThe Dodge Dynasty is related to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]; both car lines were built on the [[Chrysler C platform]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]]. It is also similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] and [[Chrysler Imperial]], which were available from 1990 to 1993 on an extended wheelbase platform of the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. The [[Lee Iacocca]]-dictated styling was boxy and conservative compared to more aerodynamically styled competitors such as the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]. Dynasty trim levels included base and LE. Additionally, a \"Brougham\" package was offered on 1992\u201393 LE models that added a padded \"landau\" [[vinyl roof]]. When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers. This greatly reduced the amount and weight of wiring harnesses in the car. All models (1988\u20131993) featured power locks that automatically locked when the car's speed exceeded 15 miles per hour. \n\nThe 1989\u20131990 Ultradrive equipped models came with a 2.36:1 axle ratio, which was revised to 2.52:1 for 1991\u20131993. EPA mileage ratings were 21 city/25 highway MPG with the 4 cylinder & 3-speed TorqueFlite transmission. The 1988 3.0&nbsp;L V6 models with TorqueFlight transmission were rated at 18 city / 24 highway MPG. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG. The new 3.3&nbsp;L V6 engine for 1990, with Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG. A 2.5-litre [[inline-four engine|inline-4]] Chrysler engine (base model only), a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-sourced 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]], the 6G72 engine, and a [[Chrysler]]-built 3.3&nbsp;L V6 were available, although the 3.3&nbsp;L V6 was not available until 1990. The four-cylinder came equipped with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission (the A413), as did the 3.0&nbsp;L in 1988. The new electronically controlled four-speed [[automatic transmission]], known as the Ultradrive or A604 ([[List of Chrysler transmissions]]), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. The vast majority of Dynastys sold to private customers had V6 engines; four-cylinder models mostly went to the fleet market.\n\nThrough the late 1980s and 1990s, Dodge's designation as the sporty-car division was backed by a succession of high-performance and/or aggressively styled models including the:\n*[[Dodge Daytona|Daytona]]\n*[[Dodge 600|600]] \n*Performance variants of the [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]]\n*[[Dodge Viper|Viper]]\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:1991 Dodge Viper Indianapolis 500 Pace Car.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|The pre-production Dodge Viper (SR I) as the pace car for the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]].]]\n[[File:1990-92 Dodge Monaco.JPG|thumb|1990\u20131992 Dodge Monaco LE]]\n[[File:Spirit RT Front34.jpg|thumb|right|1991 [[Dodge Spirit#R/T|Dodge Spirit R/T]]]]\n[[File:Dodge Intrepid LB 1993-1997 19feb2007.jpg|thumb|Rear view]]\n[[File:1st Dodge Stratus.jpg|thumb|Cab Forward Design on a 1996 [[Dodge Stratus]]]]\n\nThe Omni and the Horizon ended production in 1990, and were replaced by the [[Dodge Shadow]]/[[Plymouth Sundance]], which were both introduced for 1987. Both the Monaco and Premier were discontinued during the 1992 model year.

The Spirit sold well and had higher consumer acceptance than the [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]] that replaced it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Dodge-branded Mitsubishi vehicles were phased out by 1993 except for the Dodge Stealth running through 1996, though Mitsubishi-made engines and electrical components were still widely used in American domestic Chrysler products. \n\nIn 1992, Dodge moved their performance orientation forward substantially with the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which featured an aluminum V10 engine and composite sports roadster body. This was the first step in what was marketed as \"The New Dodge\", which was an aggressive advertising campaign with a litany of new models, with television ads narrated by [[Edward Herrmann]] that pointed out the innovations in the vehicles and challenged their competitors. Also,he would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade.\n\nLater that year was the introduction of new [[Dodge Intrepid|Intrepid]] sedan, totally different from its boxy [[Dodge Dynasty|Dynasty]] predecessor. The Intrepid used what Chrysler called \"[[cab forward]]\" styling, with the wheels pushed out to the corners of the chassis for maximum passenger space. The Intrepid was available in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16-inch wheels with better tires, and stiffer \"touring\" suspension damping. All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock brakes were optional, as was traction control and the more powerful 3.5&nbsp;L SOHC engine rated at (214&nbsp;hp).\n\nIn 1994, the new second generation [[Dodge Ram]] pickup was introduced with bold styling that departed radically from the boxy designs of trucks made by the Big Three for two decades prior. The second-generation Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the \"Louisville Slugger\" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref> The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref> The redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named \"[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]\" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\"/> Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. \n\nThey followed up on this idea in a smaller scale with the [[Dodge Neon|Neon]] and [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]]. The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the [[Chrysler JA platform]] (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). The three cars differed only in the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels. The interiors also had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] ([[United States]] only). The Stratus, [[Plymouth Breeze]], and [[Chrysler Cirrus]] were all on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time.\n\nThe car was [[Badge engineering|badged and sold]] as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Mexico]] was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the '''Chrysler Neon'''. At the Neon's release, then president of [[Chrysler Corporation]] [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] said, \"There's an old saying in [[Detroit]]: 'Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.'

Rationalizing Chrysler's broad lineup was a priority, and Dodge's sister brand Plymouth was withdrawn from the market. With this move, Dodge became DaimlerChrysler's low-price division as well as its performance division.\n\nThe Intrepid, Stratus, and Neon updates of the 1998 to 2000 timeframe were largely complete before Daimler's presence, and Dodge's first experience of any platform sharing with the German side of the company was the 2005 [[Dodge Magnum|Magnum]] [[station wagon]], introduced as a replacement for the Intrepid.

The rear-drive chassis was then used in early 2008 to build a new [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], with styling reminiscent of the original 1970 Challenger. Like its predecessor, the new Challenger coupe was available with a powerful V8 engine (base models featured a V6). In Spring 2007, [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] reached an agreement with [[Cerberus Capital Management]] to sell its Chrysler Group subsidiary, of which the Dodge division was a part. Soon after, the housing bubble began to collapse the American market, and on May 1, 2009, Chrysler and GM filed for bankruptcy on the same day.\n\n===Fiat ownership===\nOn June 10, 2009, Italian automaker [[Fiat]] formed a partnership with Chrysler under [[Sergio Marchionne]], with the UAW, and the US Government to form Chrysler Group LLC, of which Dodge remained fully integrated. For its part, the US Government provided more than $6 billion in loans at 21%, called a \"bridge loan\" or \"bailout\". The newly formed company went on to fully repay that loan, remortgaging to reduce the interest rate several times down to 6%. They fully paid back the loan with interest to the U.S. Government on May 24, 2011, a full five years early. The UAW, being partners throughout the process, were paid well and above $3.9 billion in 2013 as Sergio's plan for full consolidation has continued on schedule. This has allowed Chrysler LLC to fully merge with Fiat to form FCA, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], in 2014.

This is a set up similar to [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]], which positions [[Peugeot]] as its mainstream brand while [[Citro\u00ebn]] is more performance-based, as well as [[Hyundai Motor Group]] having its two mainstream brands, [[Kia Motors]] and [[Hyundai Motor Company]] focusing on performance and mid-luxury, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} (Among the American press, it has drawn comparisons to the decades-long set up of [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac]] at [[General Motors]] before the phase-out of Pontiac in 2010.)

Although the Ram trucks are marketed separately from Dodge cars, Ram President Fred Diaz has said:\n\n<blockquote>Ram trucks will always and forever be Dodges. Ram will always have the Dodge emblem inside and outside and they will be ''<nowiki>'vinned'</nowiki>'' (from the acronym [[VIN]], or Vehicle Identification Number) as a Dodge. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers. The two should have distinct themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/01/ram-trucks-will-always-be-dodges-ram-president-says.html|title=Ram Trucks Will Always Be Dodges, Ram President Says - PickupTrucks.com News |website=news.pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Pickups and medium to heavy trucks===\n[[File:1934 Dodge Brothers 2-ton stake truck red.jpg|thumb|right|1934 Dodge K-34 stake bed truck]]\nEver since Dodge began building their own cars in 1914, the company also offered light truck models. Initially, these were largely based on the existing passenger cars, but eventually gained their own chassis and body designs as the market matured. During the 1930s and 1940s, light- and medium-duty models were offered at first, then a heavy-duty range was added. The very large, new [[Warren Truck Assembly]] plant was built in Michigan, just north of Detroit, and opened in 1938, producing Dodge trucks ever since.\n\nIn 1936, Dodge's light, car-based trucks were crucially redesigned\u2014not only receiving a new \"Fore-Point\" (similar to Cab Forward) design of the front side and cab\u2014but especially, the old car frames were dropped and for the first time replaced by modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails ''welded'' to the cross members.<ref name=AllparRam /> These welded frames were from here on introduced on half-ton to one-ton rated trucks, expanding Dodge into a heavier truck market segment than before.\n\nIn 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned [[Dodge T-, V-, W-Series|line of pickups and trucks]], with streamlined new, 'art-deco' front sheetmetal styling. Introducing the concept of \"Job-Rated\", Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit every job they were buying it for.<ref name=AllparRam>{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/ram-history.html |title=History of the Dodge Pickup Trucks, 1921-1953 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Allpar |access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> From the 1939 'Job-Rated' trucks onwards, Dodge's light and medium trucks were built in its 'Mound Road\" plant in Warren, Michigan.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]] and the successful application of [[four-wheel drive]] to the truck line, Dodge introduced a civilian version that it called the [[Dodge Power Wagon|Power Wagon]]. At first based almost exactly on the military-type design, variants of the standard truck line were eventually given 4WD and the same \"Power Wagon\" name.\n\nDodge was among the first to introduce car-like features to its trucks, adding the plush Adventurer package during the 1960s and offering sedan-like space in its Club Cab bodies of the 1970s. Declining sales and increased competition during the 1970s eventually forced the company to drop its medium- and heavy-duty models, an arena the company has only recently begun to reenter.\n\nDodge introduced what they called the \"Adult Toys\" line to boost its truck sales in the late 1970s, starting off with the limited edition Lil' Red Express pickup (featuring, a 360 c.i. police interceptor engine and visible [[semi-trailer truck|big rig]]-style [[exhaust system|exhaust]] stacks). Later came the more widely available [[Dodge Warlock|Warlock]]. Other \"Adult Toys\" from Dodge included the \"Macho Power Wagon\" and \"Street Van\".\n\nAs part of a general decline in the commercial vehicle field during the 1970s, Dodge eliminated their [[Dodge LCF Series|LCF Series]] heavy-duty trucks in 1975, along with the Bighorn and medium-duty D-Series trucks, and affiliated S Series [[school bus]]es were dropped in 1978. On the other hand, Dodge produced several thousand pickups for the [[United States armed forces|United States Military]] under the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle|CUCV]] program from the late 1970s into the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:89RamF34.jpg|thumb|1989 Dodge Ram pickup]]\nContinuing financial problems meant that even Dodge's light-duty models \u2013 renamed as the [[Dodge Ram|Ram Pickup]] line for 1981 \u2013 were carried over with the most minimal of updates until 1993. Two things helped to revitalize Dodge's fortunes during this time. One was the introduction of [[Cummins]]' powerful and reliable [[Cummins B Series engine|B Series]] turbo-[[diesel engine]] as an option for 1989. This innovation raised Dodge's profile among consumers who needed power for towing or large loads. The second was a class-exclusive V8 engine option for the mid-sized [[Dodge Dakota|Dakota]] pickup.\n\nDodge introduced the Ram's all-new \"big-rig\" styling treatment for 1994. Besides its instantly [[Attitude polarization|polarizing]] looks, exposure was also gained by usage of the new truck on the hit TV show ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' starring [[Chuck Norris]]. The new Ram also featured a totally new interior with a console box big enough to hold a laptop computer, and ventilation and radio controls that were designed to be easily used even with gloves on. A V10 engine derived from that used in the Viper sports car was also new, and the previously offered Cummins [[turbodiesel]] remained available. The smaller Dakota was redesigned for 1997 using the big rig styling, thus giving Dodge trucks a definitive \"face\" that set them apart from the competition.\n\nThe Ram was redesigned again for 2002, and the Dakota in 2005, and was basically an evolution of the original, but adding the Hemi V8 engine to the list of available options, due to the revival of the legendary Chrysler Hemi V8 engine. New medium duty chassis cab models were introduced for 2007 with standard Cummins turbodiesel power as a way of gradually getting Dodge back into the business truck market again.\n\nFor a time during the 1980s, Dodge imported a line of small pickups from Mitsubishi, known as the D50, or later the [[Dodge Ram 50|Ram 50]] and were carried on as a stopgap until the Dakota's sales eventually made the imported trucks irrelevant. Reversing the role, Mitsubishi has more recently purchased Dakota pickups from Dodge and restyled them into their own [[Mitsubishi Raider|Raider]] line for sale in North America.\n\n===Vans===\nDodge had offered panel delivery models for many years since its founding, but their first purpose-built van model arrived for 1964 with the compact [[Dodge A100|A Series]]. Based on the Dodge Dart platform and using its proven six-cylinder or V8 engines, the A-series was a strong competitor for both its domestic rivals (from Ford and Chevrolet/[[GMC Truck|GMC]]) and the diminutive [[Volkswagen Transporter]] line.\n\nAs the market evolved, Dodge realized that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future, and thus the [[Dodge B Series|B Series]] was introduced for 1971, and offered both car-like comfort in its Sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its Tradesman cargo line. A chassis cab version was also offered for use with bigger cargo boxes or flatbeds. Like the trucks, Chrysler's dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years. Rebadged as the [[Dodge Ram Van|Ram Van]] and [[Dodge Ram Wagon|Ram Wagon]] for 1981, this old design carried on for 33 years with little more than cosmetic and safety updates all the way to 2003.\n[[File:2001-2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.jpg|thumb|right|2001\u20132004 [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]]]]\n\nThe DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998 made it possible for Dodge to explore new ideas; hence the European-styled [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] line of vans was brought over and given a Dodge styling treatment. Redesigned for 2006 as a 2007 model, the economical diesel-powered Sprinters have become very popular for city usage among delivery companies like [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in recent years. Because of their fuel efficiency major motorhome manufacturer Thor Motor Coach made several Class C and Class A [[Motorhomes]] available on the Dodge Sprinter Chassis including their popular Four Winds Siesta & Chateau Citation product lines.\n\nDodge also offered a cargo version of its best-selling Caravan for many years, at first calling it the Mini Ram Van, which was a name originally applied to the short-wheelbase B Series Ram Vans, and later naming it the Caravan C/V, the C/V stood for Cargo Van. For model year 2012, the Caravan C/V was rebranded as a Ram, and was renamed the Ram C/V.\n\n===Sport utility vehicles===\nDodge's first experiments with anything like a sport utility vehicle appeared in the late 1950s with a windowed version of their standard panel-truck \u2013 known as the [[Dodge Town Wagon|Town Wagon]]. These were built in the same style through the mid-1960s.\n\nBut the division did not enter the SUV arena in earnest until 1974, with the purpose-built [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ramcharger]]. Offering the then-popular open body style and Dodge's powerful V8 engines, the Ramcharger was a strong competitor for trucks like the [[Ford Bronco]], [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[International Harvester Scout]] II.\n\nOnce again, though, Dodge was left with outdated products during the 1980s as the market evolved. The Ramcharger hung on through 1993 with only minor updates. When the Ram truck was redesigned for the 1994 model year, the Ramcharger was discontinued in the American and Canadian markets. A version using the updated styling was made for the Mexican Market but was never imported to the U.S. or Canada.\n\nInstead, Dodge tried something new in 1997. Using the mid-sized Dakota pickup's chassis as a base, they built the four-door [[Dodge Durango|Durango]] SUV with seating for eight people and created a new niche. Sized between smaller SUVs (like the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[Ford Explorer]]) and larger models (like the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Ford Expedition]]), Durango was both a bit more and bit less{{original research inline|date=May 2012}} of everything. The redesigned version for 2004 grew a little bit in every dimension, becoming a full-size SUV (and thus somewhat less efficient), but was still sized between most of its competitors on either side of the aisle. For 2011 a new unibody Durango based on the Jeep Grand Cherokee was released. The 2011 Durango shrank slightly to size comparable to the original model.\n\nDodge also imported a version of Mitsubishi's popular Montero ([[Mitsubishi Pajero|Pajero]] in Japan) as the [[Dodge Raider|Raider]] from 1987 to 1989.\n\n=== High performance vehicles ===\nFrom the late 20th century onwards, Dodge's highest performing vehicles fell under the category [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]]. These models often came equipped with high performance V8s under the hood. These models included the [[Dodge Challenger]] SRT (2008\u2013current), [[Dodge Charger]] SRT (2006\u2013current), [[Dodge Magnum]] SRT (2006\u20132008) and [[Dodge Durango]] SRT (2018-current-). They also produced the [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] (2003\u20132005), [[Dodge Caliber]] SRT-4 (2008\u20132009), [[Dodge Viper]] (1991\u20132010; 2012\u20132017), and [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]] (2004\u20132006). In 2015, [[Chrysler|FCA]] introduced the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hellcat|Hellcat]], a 707 HP, [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L [[Hemispherical combustion chamber|HEMI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. In 2017, Dodge released the [[Dodge Challenger]] Demon. It is powered by an 840 HP [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L HEMI [[V8 engine|V8]], and comes from the factory with a toolbox known as the \"Demon Toolbox\" that has everything a buyer will need to drag race, including the skinny front drag tires. However, buyers will only get 840 HP on race fuel. On regular pump gas, it produces 808 HP, a 101 HP increase over the Hellcat.\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Dodge Polara (Argentina).jpg|thumb|right|An Argentine Dodge Polara, produced from 1968 to 1980]]\n\nDodge came to Argentina in the early 20th century with imported cars and trucks. In 1960, it partnered with Fevre-Basset as a local manufacturer. The first vehicle made in Argentina was the D-100 \"Sweptline\" pickup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |title=Dodge Sweptline |publisher=Coche Argentino |language=Spanish |accessdate=August 17, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821234742/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_pick_up.htm#sweptile |archivedate=August 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Between 1961 and 1980, a variety of trucks were produced, including the D-400/DP-400,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-400.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D/DP-400 |work=camionargentino |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> D-500<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2016/02/dodge-d-500-4x4.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D-500 4x4|first=Matias|last=Lerch|date=February 24, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>/DP-500,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-ddp-500.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge D/DP-500 |work=camionargentino |date=March 22, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> DP600,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/06/dodge-dp-600.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DP-600 |work=camionargentino |date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> DD900<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/09/dodge-dd-900.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DD-900 |work=camionargentino |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> and DD1000 (the last two with one curiosity: the air-cooled [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] engine rather Perkins or Chrysler<ref>{{cite web|url= http://camionargentino.blogspot.com.ar/2012/08/dodge-dd-1000.html |title=Cami\u00f3n Argentino: Dodge DD-1000 |work=camionargentino |date=May 16, 2014 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>). Passenger cars were also produced, namely the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant I and II]], and the local versions of the 1966 [[Dodge Dart]] (called Valiant III and IV). In 1971, the Dodge 1500, a rebadged [[Hillman Avenger]] from the United Kingdom was introduced. In 1982, production of Dodge vehicles ceased when German company [[Volkswagen]] bought the Fevre plant and the shares.\n\nIn Argentina, the name \"Polara\" was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed on the basis of the fourth generation North American [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]]. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980, by the subsidiary Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A.<ref name=\"Chrysler Argentina \">{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |title=Chrysler Argentina S.A., Dodge Coronado and Polara specifications |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115144202/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |date=May 18, 2009 |language=Spanish |archivedate=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Dodge began marketing cars and pick-ups directly in Argentina. Currently, both the Journey and the Ram are available to Argentine customers.\n\n===Asia===\nDodge entered the Japanese market in mid-2007, and re-entered the Chinese market in late 2007. [[Soueast Motors]] of China assembles the Caravan for the Chinese market. Dodge began marketing its vehicles in South Korea in 2004, starting with the Dakota.\n\n===Australia===\nDodge re-entered the Australian market in 2006 with the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]], their first offering since the AT4/D5N trucks in 1979 and the first Dodge passenger car to be marketed in Australia since the [[Dodge Phoenix|Phoenix]] sedan was discontinued in 1973. The second model to be introduced was the [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]], with the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] and [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] followed. Dodge chose not use the full model lines and engines available to them, the 2.7&nbsp;L V6 being available in the Journey and Avenger instead of the 3.2&nbsp;L in the North American versions. However, diesel engines were introduced in all their cars.\nFollowing the Global Financial Crisis, Chrysler introduced the facelifted model of the Caliber and discontinued the Avenger imports. From early 2012 on, model year 2010 cars were available. By early 2012 no new cars were being brought into Australia aside from the new facelifted 2012 Journey.\n\nThere were rumors that Dodge cars will be re-badged as Fiats in the Australian market as was the case in Europe. The Dodge nameplate continued due to consistent sales of the Journey.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bruce |last=Newton |url= http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2012/fiat-punto-heading-back-to-australia-32839 |title=Fiat Punto heading back to Australia |publisher=carpoint.com.au |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> However, the brand was discontinued in the Australian market after 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Maclean |first=Andrew |title=Dodge brand dropped from Australia - Dodge disappears from Australia |url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/dodge-brand-dropped-from-australia-20161014-gs2od1 |website=Drive |accessdate=6 December 2019 |language=en-au |date=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nIn Brazil, Dodge cars were produced between 1969 and 1981 with the models Dart, Charger, Magnum, LeBaron (all powered by the same 318&nbsp;cid V8 engine), and the compact 1800/Polara, based on the British [[Hillman Avenger]]. The manufacturer was acquired by Volkswagen in 1981. In 1998, the Dakota pickup started production in a new plant in [[Campo Largo, Paran\u00e1]] by [[Mercedes-Benz]], which belongs to its former partner [[Daimler AG]]. It was built there until 2001 with petrol and diesel engines and regular, extended and crew cabs. In 2010, Dodge started sales of the imported pickup Ram 2500. The model portfolio is being expanded, starting with the Journey crossover for the 2009 model year.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, the Dodge lineup of cars started down the road to elimination along with the Plymouth line when in 1988 the [[Dodge Dynasty]] was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty and sold at both Plymouth and Dodge dealers. Similarly, the new [[Dodge Intrepid]], the Dynasty's replacement, was sold as the Chrysler Intrepid.\n\nFor 2000, the new Neon became the Chrysler Neon. The Chrysler Cirrus and Mitsubishi-built Dodge Avenger were dropped. Dodge trucks, which have been sold at Canadian Plymouth dealers since 1973, continued without change. All Plymouth-Chrysler and Dodge-Chrysler dealers became Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep dealers.\n\nThe diluting of the Chrysler name did not go well in Canada, especially as the nameplate had been pushed as a luxury line since the 1930s. For 2003, the revamped Neon appeared in Canada as the Dodge SX 2.0. Since then, all new Dodge models have been sold in Canada under the Dodge name.\n\n===Europe===\nDodge started assembling lorries (trucks) in the United Kingdom from imported parts in 1922. In 1933 it began to manufacture a British chassis at its works in [[Kew]], using American engines and gearboxes.<ref>{{cite web|author=doctor colin |url= http://www.dodge50.co.uk/dodgehistory.htm |title=1922 To 1983 a brief history of Dodge in the U.K. |publisher=Dodge50.co.uk |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Right-hand drive Dodge trucks\n{{gallery | height = 120\n|File:Dodge D 15.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:Preserved dodge, Limestone Museum, Malta Siggiewa. feb 2011 - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:1952 Dodge Kew \"Parrot Nose\" truck in red.jpg|1952 Kew-built Dodge D100\n}}\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Dodge Kew was part of the [[London Aircraft Production Group]], building fuselage sections for [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers. The pre-war and wartime truck range was replaced by the [[Dodge 100 \"Kew\"]] truck (1949\u20131957), nicknamed the \"parrot nose\" due to the sculpted lines of its bonnet.  Subsequent normal-control Dodges built at Kew were the 200 series (1957\u20131963) and the 400 series (1963\u20131965). The 400 series was a version of the American [[Dodge D series|D series]] medium-duty models. Also built at Kew were the [[Cab over|cab-over]] [[Dodge 300|300 series]] (1957\u20131965) and its successor the [[Dodge 500|500 series/K-series]] (1964\u20131978) tilt-cab. In 1964 Chrysler acquired its first stake in the British [[Rootes Group]] and it was decided to consolidate all truck production at Rootes' factory in Dunstable.  British assembly of the 400 series was discontinued due to declining sales of normal-control trucks, and production of the 500 series was transferred to Dunstable in 1967.  \n\nIn some export markets British-built Dodge trucks used the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] or [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] marques, and the situation was further complicated after takeover of the Rootes Group whose commercial vehicles were sold under the [[Commer]] and [[Karrier]] marques. Some Dodge 500s were given Commer badges, whilst the [[Dodge 100 \"Commando\"|100 series \"Commando\"]] light truck (1970\u20131989) developed by Rootes was initially marketed under all five marques. In the UK market Commers were usually lighter than Dodges, whereas the Karrier marque tended to be used on vehicles sold to public sector operators such as local authorities. Some of the smaller Commer/Karrier vans were also sold as Fargos in export markets.  In 1976 Chrysler Europe  rationalised its marques and thereafter all the British-built commercial vehicles were sold as Dodges or (increasingly rarely) Karriers. This included the smaller [[Commer FC|Commer SpaceVan]] (1960\u20131983) and [[Commer Walk-Thru]] (1961\u20131979), which became Dodges for their final years. The van and pick-up versions of Chrysler Europe's French-built [[Simca 1100]] were also branded as Dodges in Britain from 1976, although they remained Simcas elsewhere (and became Talbots in Britain after 1979).\n\nAmerican Chrysler Corporation cars, including some Dodge models, were assembled from [[Knock-down kit|CKD]] kits at various locations in Europe until the 1970s, including Kew (1920s-30s), Antwerp (1926\u20131958) and Rotterdam (1958\u20131970), but sales volumes were low as even 'compact' American cars like the [[Dodge Dart]] were enormous [[Gas-guzzler|gas-guzzlers]] by European standards. However, [[protectionist]] policies in some countries encouraged small local manufacturers to license-build CKD models, including [[AMAG Automobil- und Motoren|AMAG]] in Switzerland (building Chryslers and Dodges 1948\u20131972) and [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]] in Spain (building Dodge Darts from 1965 as the Barreiros Dart). By 1969 Chrysler had acquired full control of Barreiros, and Darts were being exported to other European countries under the Dodge name (precipitating closure of the Rotterdam plant). From 1970 the Spanish-built Dart was replaced by the Barreiros/Dodge 3700 which remained in production until 1977. The Dodge cars were a relatively small part of the Madrid factory's output, which was dominated by smaller Simca-designed cars and Barreiros-designed heavy duty trucks. From 1972 such trucks were sold as the [[Dodge 300]] (though unrelated to the earlier British 300 series), which was available as 4\u00d72, 6\u00d74, 8\u00d72 and 8\u00d74 rigids, as well as 4\u00d72 semi-trailer tractors.\n\nFollowing Chrysler Europe's collapse in 1977 and the sale of their assets to [[Peugeot]], the van and truck range and the associated factories in Dunstable and Madrid were quickly passed on to [[Renault Trucks|Renault V\u00e9hicules Industriels]]. Chrysler licensed the Dodge name to be used on Renault trucks sold in certain European markets \u2013 most notably the United Kingdom. However the only subsequent new model to carry the Dodge name was the [[Dodge 50 series]] (1979\u20131992), which replaced the earlier Walk-Thru and was widely used in Britain by utility companies, the military and as a minibus, but was rarely seen outside the UK. Thereafter all new models were Renaults, and in 1987 the Dodge name was dropped from the remaining inherited models (50 and Commando), which became Renaults for their last few years of production.\n\nDodge vehicles would not return to Europe until the introduction of the Neon, badged as a Chrysler, in the mid-1990s.\n\nChrysler reintroduced the Dodge marque to Europe on a broad scale in 2006, with a lineup consisting of North American-built Caliber, Avenger, Viper SRT-10, Nitro and [[Dodge Journey]] cars and SUVs, but this proved to be a shortlived return due to the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and the takeover of Chrysler by Fiat. In 2010 the Dodge marque was pulled from the UK due to poor sales<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/05/19/dodge-stops-selling-nitro-caliber-in-uk/ |title=Dodge stops selling Nitro, Caliber in UK |publisher=Autoblog |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> and on June 1, 2011 it was dropped from the rest of Europe. All of the Dodge models were discontinued in Europe except the Dodge Journey, which became the [[Fiat Freemont]] (and which was not available in the right-hand-drive Ireland or UK markets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofacil.es/problemas-coche/2011/07/11/pasa-tienes-chrysler-o-dodge/7432.html |title=Qu\u00e9 pasa si tienes un Chrysler o Dodge|publisher=Autof\u00e1cil (Luike) |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nIn Mexico, the [[Hyundai Accent]], [[Hyundai Atos]], and [[Hyundai Porter|Hyundai H100]] were branded as \"Dodge\", [[Dodge Attitude]], \"Verna by Dodge\", \"Atos by Dodge\" and \"Dodge H100\" respectively, and sold at Chrysler/Dodge dealers. Current models are marketed with Hyundai logos instead of the \"Ram\" logo on previous model years since 2014. Dodge and Hyundai ended the venture and Dodge will use rebadged and reworked Fiats (2014). Also, to the next year with [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] is sold as the new Dodge Attitude since 2015.\n\n==Logos==\n* Star: The original Dodge was a circle, with two Greek [[Delta (letter)|deltas]] intertwined representing the letter \"[[D]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/world/canada/3-dodge.html |title=History of Dodge Brothers |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref> forming a six-pointed star in the middle; an interlocked \"DB\" was at the center of the star, and the words \"Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicles\" encircled the outside edge. Although similar to the [[Star of David]], the Dodge brothers were not [[Jewish]]; they were [[Methodist]]s. Although the \"Brothers\" was dropped from the name for trucks in 1929 and cars in 1930, the DB star remained in the cars until the 1939 models were introduced.\n* Ram: For 1932 Dodge cars adopted a leaping ram as the car's hood ornament. Starting with the 1940 models the leaping ram became more streamlined and by 1951 only the head, complete with curving horns, remained. The 1954 model cars were the last to use the ram's head before the reintroduction in the 1980s. Dodge trucks adopted the ram as the hood ornament for the 1940 model year with the 1950 models as the last.\n* Crest: For 1941 Dodge introduced a crest, supposedly the Dodge family crest. The design had four horizontal bars broken in the middle by one vertical bar with an \"O\" in the center. A knight's head appeared at the top of the emblem. Although the head would be dropped for 1955, the emblem would survive through 1957 and reappear on the 1976 Aspen. The crest would be used through to 1981 on its second time around, being replaced by the Pentastar for 1982. The knight's head without the crest would be used for 1959.\n* Forward Look: Virgil Exner's radical Forward Look redesign of Chrysler's vehicles for the 1955 model year was emphasized by the adoption of a logo by the same name, applied to all Chrysler Corporation vehicles. The Forward Look logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting [[space age]] rocket-propelled motion. This logo was incorporated into Dodge advertising, decorative trim, ignition and door key heads, and accessories through September 1962.\n* Fratzog: Dodge's logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a fractured [[Kite (geometry)|deltoid]] composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo first appeared on the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers came up with the meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1962-1964-dodge-8802.htm |title=1962\u20131964 Dodge 880 article |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sealey |first=Mike |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/logos.html |title=Mike Sealey's history of Chrysler's logos |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> As the Dodge Division's logo, Fratzog was incorporated in various badges and emblems on Dodge vehicles. It was also integrated into the design of such parts as steering wheel center hubs and road wheel covers.\n* Pentastar: From 1982 to 1995, Dodge used Chrysler's [[Pentastar]] logo on its cars and trucks to replace the Dodge crest, although it had been used for corporate recognition since late 1962. In advertisements and on dealer signage, Dodge's Pentastar was red, while Chrysler-Plymouth's was blue.\n* [[Ram Trucks|Ram]]'s head: Dodge reintroduced the ram's head hood ornament on the new 1973 Dodge Bighorn heavy duty tractor units. Gradually the ram's head began appearing on the pickup trucks as Dodge began to refer to their trucks as Ram. The present iteration of the [[Bighorn sheep|Ram]]'s-head logo appeared in late 1992 on the 1993 Intrepid, standardizing on that logo in 1996 for all vehicles except the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which uses the [[Viperidae|Viper's]] Head.\n* New logo: In 2010, with the separation of the Ram brand, two new Dodge logos were unveiled. The first logo features the word \"DODGE\" with two red inclined stripes. It was originally used strictly for marketing purposes, however Dodge introduced the logo onto the grilles of the 2012 lineup.\n\nA second emblem was revealed during the unveiling of the 2011 Durango, which used the same five-point shield-shaped outline of the old emblem, but with the ram's head replaced with a chrome cross reminiscent of the brand's signature cross-haired grille.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/|title=New Dodge emblem revealed |publisher=VehiCast |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112925/http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/ |archivedate=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> This was only used on the [[steering wheel]].

The factory was located in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], and was called the [[Dodge Main|Dodge Main factory]] from 1910 until its closing in January 1980. Both the Dodge brothers died in 1920, and the company was sold by their families to [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] in 1925 before being sold to Chrysler in 1928. \n\nDodge branded vehicles mainly consisted of [[truck]]s and [[Full-size car|full-sized]] passenger cars through the 1970s, though it made compact cars (such as the 1963\u201376 [[Dodge Dart|Dart]]) and midsize cars (such as the \"B-Body\" [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] and [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] from 1966\u201378).\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] and its subsequent impact on the American automobile industry led Chrysler to develop the [[Chrysler K platform|K platform]] of compact to midsize cars for the 1981 model year. The K [[automobile platform|platform]] and its derivatives are credited with reviving Chrysler's business in the 1980s; one such derivative became the [[Dodge Caravan]].\n\nThe Dodge brand has withstood the multiple ownership changes at Chrysler from 1998 to 2009, including its short-lived merger with [[Daimler AG|Daimler-Benz AG]] from 1998 to 2007,<ref>{{cite web |title=Company History - \"World Corp.\" vision: the merger between Daimler-Benz and Chrysler (1995 - 2007) |url=https://www.daimler.com/company/tradition/company-history/1995-2007.html |publisher=Daimler |date=2019 |quote=On 7 May 1998, Daimler-Benz Aktiengesellschaft in Germany and Chrysler Corporation in the United States of America signed a merger contract. |accessdate=6 October 2019}}</ref> its subsequent sale to [[Cerberus Capital Management]], its 2009 [[Effects of the 2008\u20132010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|bailout by the United States government]], and its subsequent [[Chrysler Chapter 11 reorganization|Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] and acquisition by [[Fiat]].\n\nIn 2011, Dodge and its model sub-brands, [[Ram Trucks|Dodge Ram]], and [[Dodge Viper]] were separated. Dodge said that the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]] would be an [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] product and [[Ram Trucks|Ram]] will be a standalone marque. In 2014, [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]] was merged back into Dodge. Later that year, [[Chrysler|Chrysler Group]] was renamed [[FCA US LLC]], corresponding with the merger of [[Fiat S.p.A.]] and Chrysler Group into the single corporate structure of [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]].\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 230\n | header = The Dodge brothers\n | image1 = John Francis Dodge.jpg\n | caption1 = John Francis Dodge\n | image2 = Horace Elgin Dodge.jpg\n | caption2 = Horace Elgin Dodge }}\n\n===Founding and early years===\n[[Horace Elgin Dodge|Horace]] and [[John Francis Dodge|John Dodge]] founded the ''Dodge Brothers'' Company in Detroit in 1900, and quickly found work manufacturing precision engine and [[chassis]] components for the city's growing number of automobile firms. Chief among these customers were the established [[Oldsmobile#Early history|Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] and the new [[Ford Motor Company]]. Henry Ford selected the Dodge brothers to supply a wide range of components for his original [[Ford Model A (1903\u201304)|Model A (1903\u201304)]] that included the complete chassis; thus Ford needed to add only the body and wheels to finish the cars.<ref>{{cite book |last=DeLorenzo |first=Matt |title=Dodge 100 Years |date=2014 |publisher=Motorbooks |isbn=9781627880848 |pages=8\u20139 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zm91AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA8 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> Henry offered the Dodge brothers a 10% share in his new company in return for $10,000 worth of goods.\n\nThe first machine shop where the brothers worked as parts suppliers for Olds and Ford was located at the Boydell Building on Beaubien Street at Lafayette. This location was replaced by a larger facility at Hastings Street and Monroe Avenue, which is now a parking garage for the [[Greektown Casino Hotel]] (Hastings Street at this location has been renamed Chrysler Service Drive).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodgemotorcar.com/history/early_history.php |title=Locations of earlier Dodge Brothers workshops |publisher=Dodgemotorcar.com |date= |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref> By 1910 the [[Dodge Main]] factory was built in Hamtramck, where it remained until 1979.\n\n[[File:1915-dodge-archives.jpg|right|thumb|1915 Model 30-35 touring car]]\n[[File:Royal baking trucks.jpg|thumb|Dodge Brothers delivery trucks, [[Salt Lake City]], 1920]]\n[[File:Light-repair-truck-FAJ19200910.jpg|thumb|[[M1918 light repair truck]] [[G-numbers|G10]], likely U.S. Army (Field Artillery Journal Sep-Oct 1920)]]\n\nThe Dodge Brothers Motor Company was established in 1913 and by 1914, John and Horace designed and debuted the first car of their own \u2013 the four-cylinder Dodge Model 30/35 touring car.<ref>{{cite web |title=This day in history: January 14: Dodge co-founder dies |url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/dodge-co-founder-dies |author=History.com Editors |publisher=A&E Television Networks |date=August 21, 2018 |accessdate=November 11, 2018}}</ref> Marketed as a slightly more upscale competitor to the ubiquitous [[Ford Model T]], it pioneered or made standard many features later taken for granted, like all-steel body construction (as the vast majority of cars worldwide still used wood-framing under steel panels);<ref group=nb>though Stoneleigh and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA]] used steel bodies as early as 1911</ref><ref>{{cite book|editor-first=Tom |editor-last=Northey |last=Wise |first=David Burgess |chapter=Dodge |title=The World of Automobiles: An Illustrated Encyclopedia of the Motor Car |publisher=Purnell Reference Books |year=1977 |volume=5 |page=552 |isbn=978-0-8393-6009-4}}</ref> 12-volt electrical system (6-volt systems would remain the norm until the 1950s); 35 horsepower<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1920_Dodge_Brothers/1920_Dodge_Brothers_Brochure/1920%20Dodge%20Brothers-19.html |title=1920 Dodge Brothers Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> engines versus the Model T's 20 horsepower, and sliding-gear [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] (the best-selling Model T would retain an antiquated planetary design until its demise in 1927).

During this time, the Model 30 was evolved to become the new Series 116 (though it retained the same basic construction and engineering features). However, as the 1920s progressed, Dodge gradually lost its ranking as the third best-selling automobile manufacturer, slipping down to seventh in the U.S. market.\n\nAt the same time, Dodge Brothers expanded the truck line and became a leading builder of light trucks. After greatly expanding production capacity, in 1921 Haynes signed a contract whereby Dodge's vast dealer network would exclusively market trucks with bodies built by Graham Brothers of Evansville, Indiana. This Graham truck line from then on used only Dodge-built chassis, from 1-ton to 3-ton capacity, and Dodge kept making light-duty trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\">{{cite web|url= https://forums.aaca.org/topic/210257-my-1934-dodge-4x4-15-ton/ |title=my 1934 Dodge 4x4 1.5 ton - Dodge Trucks |work=Antique Automobile Club of America - Discussion Forums |date=June 5, 2019 |accessdate=December 5, 2019}}</ref>\n\nStagnation in development was becoming apparent, however, and the public responded by dropping Dodge Brothers to fifth place in the industry by 1925. That year, the Dodge Brothers company was sold by the widows to the well-known investment group [[Dillon, Read & Co.]] for no less than US$146&nbsp;million (at the time, the largest cash transaction in history).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://usjunkyardsnearme.com/car-resources/dodge-history/ |title=Dodge History |publisher=usjunkyardsnearme.com |accessdate=August 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\nDillon, Read & Co. offered non-voting stock on the market in the new Dodge Brothers firm, and along with the sale of bonds was able to raise $160&nbsp;million, reaping a $14&nbsp;million (net) profit. All voting stock was retained by Dillon, Read. Frederick Haynes remained as company head until E.G. Wilmer was named board chairman in November, 1926. Wilmer was a banker with no auto experience and Haynes remained as president. Changes to the car, save for superficial things like [[trim level]]s and colors, remained minimal until 1927, when the new Senior six-cylinder line was introduced. The former four-cylinder line was kept on, but renamed the [[Dodge Fast Four|Fast Four]] line until it was dropped in favor of two lighter six-cylinder models (the Standard Six and Victory Six) for 1928.\n\nOn October 1, 1925, Dodge Brothers, Inc., acquired a 51% interest in [[Graham Brothers]], Inc., for $13&nbsp;million and the remaining 49% on May 1, 1926. Haynes purchased all of Graham's truck activity, and in 1926, the Graham branch took charge of all of Dodge's truck manufacturing.

Eventually Dodge was sold to the new Chrysler Corporation in 1928.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://gearheads.org/the-dodge-motor-company/ |title=The Dodge Motor Company |date=May 21, 2012 |publisher=Gear Heads |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> On January 2, 1929, Chrysler announced that the Graham Badge was dropped, and Dodge Brothers were building Chrysler's trucks.<ref name=\"Dodge-my1934\"/>\n\n===Pre-war years===\n[[File:1933 Dodge advert by Muray.jpg|thumb|Dodge aimed for the luxury market in this advertisement for the 1933 model Eight]]\nTo fit better in the Chrysler Corporation lineup, alongside low-priced [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] and medium-priced [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]], Dodge's lineup for early 1930 was trimmed down to a core group of two lines and thirteen models (from three lines and nineteen models just over a year previous). Prices started out just above DeSoto but were somewhat less than top-of-the-line [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]], in a small-scale recreation of [[General Motors Companion Make Program|General Motors' \"step-up\" marketing concept]]. (DeSoto and Dodge would swap places in the market for the 1933 model year, Dodge dropping down between Plymouth and DeSoto.) As Plymouth cars were sold at Chrysler dealerships, Dodge branded vehicles were sold as a lower cost alternative to DeSoto.\n\nFor 1930, Dodge took another step up by adding a new eight-cylinder line to replace the existing Senior six-cylinder. This basic format of a dual line with Six and Eight models continued through 1933, and the cars were gradually streamlined and lengthened in step with prevailing trends of the day. The Dodge Eight was replaced by a larger Dodge DeLuxe Six for 1934, which was dropped for 1935. A long-[[wheelbase]] edition of the remaining Six was added for 1936 and would remain a part of the lineup for many years. To enhance production, in 1932 Chrysler built a factory in [[Los Angeles (Maywood) Assembly|Los Angeles, California]] where Chrysler, DeSoto, Dodge and Plymouth vehicles were built until the factory closed in 1971.\n[[File:1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck.jpg|thumb|left|1939 Dodge Airflow Texaco tanker truck]]\n[[File:Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939.jpg|thumb|Dodge D11 Luxury Liner 4-Door Sedan 1939]]\n\nThe Dodge line, along with most of the corporation's output, was restyled in the so-called \"Wind Stream\" look for 1935. This was a mild form of [[streamliner|streamlining]], which saw sales jump remarkably over the previous year (even though Dodge as a whole still dropped to fifth place for the year after two years of holding down fourth). Dodge never got the radical [[Airflow Chrysler|Airflow]] styling that was the cause of depressed sales of Chryslers and DeSotos from 1934 to 1937, as a passenger sedan, but it was used on commercial truck for a short time. Dodge (along with the rest of Chrysler) added safety features such as a smooth, flat dashboard with no protruding knobs, curved in door handles, and padded front-seat backs for the benefit of the rear-seat occupants.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/Dodge/1940_Dodge/1940_Dodge_Brochure/1940%20Dodge-09-10.html |title=1940 Dodge Brochure |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nAnother major restyle arrived for the 25th-anniversary 1939 models, which Dodge dubbed the Luxury Liner series. These were once again completely redesigned, with new bodies for 1940, again in 1941, and a refreshing for 1942. However, just after the 1942 models were introduced, Japan's [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] forced the shutdown of Dodge's passenger car [[assembly line]]s in favor of [[Military production during World War II|war production]] in February 1942. 1941 saw the introduction of Fluid Drive for Dodge cars, which eliminated stalling or bucking if the clutch were released too quickly. This feature put a fluid coupling in between the engine and the clutch, although the driver still had to shift gears manually.\n\n===World War II===\nChrysler was prolific in its production of [[Materiel|war materiel]], especially from 1942 to 1945.

The \"[[supply and demand|seller's market]]\" of the early [[postwar]] years, brought on by the lack of any new cars throughout the war, meant that every automaker found it easy to sell vehicles regardless of any drawbacks they might have. Like almost every other automaker, Dodge sold lightly [[facelift (product)|facelifted]] revisions of its 1942 design through the 1948 season. As before, these were a single series of six-cylinder models with two trim levels (basic Deluxe or plusher Custom). From 1949 until 1954, Fluid Drive could be combined with \"Gyro-Matic,\" a semi-automatic transmission which reduced (but did not eliminate) the need to shift gears.\n\nStyling was not initially Dodge's strong point during this period, though that began to change by 1953 under the direction of corporate design chief [[Virgil Exner]].  However the deluxe Coronet series, introduced for 1949, offered extra luxury as the top of the line.  The Coronet Diplomat, Dodge's first pillarless hardtop coupe, was new for 1950, at least one year before Ford, Plymouth, and other popular car makes offered it.  At the same time, Dodge also introduced its first V8 engine \u2013 the Red Ram Hemi, a smaller version of the original design of the famed [[Chrysler FirePower engine|Chrysler Hemi]]. The new 1953 bodies were smaller and based on the Plymouth. For 1954, sales dropped, the stubby styling not going over well with the public. 1954 also saw the introduction of the fully automatic PowerFlite transmission.\n\nChrysler borrowed $250 million from [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] in 1954 to finance expansion, acquisition, and updating the outdated styling of their car lines that was contributed to Chrysler failing to benefit from the postwar boom as GM and Ford were.<ref>{{cite book|last=Genat |first=Robert |title=Mopar Muscle |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610590839 |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yARkK-FHHO8C&pg=PA18&lpg=PA18&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |year=2004 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Jefferys |first=Steve |title=Management and Managed: Fifty Years of Crisis at Chrysler |year=1986 |publisher=CUP Archive |isbn=9780521304412 |page=107 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iE49AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA107&lpg=PA107&dq=1955+Prudential+chrysler+$250+million |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1954/03/02/83747978.html?pageNumber=33 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 2, 1954 |title=Chrysler Borrows $250 Million For Growth on Note Due in 2054 |pages=33, 36}}</ref>\n\nExner led creation of the new corporate \"[[Forward Look]]\" styling of 1955, beginning a new era for Dodge. With steadily upgraded styling and ever-stronger engines every year through 1960, Dodge found a ready market for its products as America discovered the joys of freeway travel. This situation improved when Dodge introduced a new line of Dodges called the Dart to do battle against Ford, Chevrolet and Plymouth. The result was that Dodge sales in the middle price class collapsed. Special and regional models were sold as well, including the LaFemme (a white and orchid-trimmed hardtop marketed toward women) and the Texan, a gold-accented Dodge sold in the Lone Star State. 1957 saw the introduction of a new automatic transmission, three-speed TorqueFlite. Both PowerFlite and TorqueFlite were controlled by mechanical push-buttons until 1965.  1956 saw the introduction of the 4-door pillarless hardtop (the same year most other makes offered this body style) in all three Dodge series, Custom Royal, Royal, and Coronet.  Dodge's pillarless models were all badged \"Lancer.\"\n[[File:Dodge Coronet 1958.jpg|thumb|1958 Dodge Coronet Lancer hardtop coupe]]\n\nDodge entered the compact car field for 1961 with their new [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]], a variation on Plymouth's [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant]]. Though it was not initially successful, the [[Dodge Dart|Dart]] range that succeeded the Lancer in 1963 would prove to be one of the division's top sellers for many years.\n\nChrysler made an ill-advised move to downsize the Dodge and Plymouth full-size lines for 1962, which resulted in a loss of sales. However, they turned this around in 1965 by turning those former full-sizes into \"new\" mid-size models; Dodge revived the [[Dodge Coronet|Coronet]] nameplate in this way and later added a sporty [[fastback]] version called the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Charger]] that became both a sales leader and a winner on the [[NASCAR]] circuit. Not only did this style dominate the racetrack for 4 full years, its aerodynamic improvements forever changed the face of NASCAR racing.\n\nFull-size models evolved gradually during this time. After Dodge dealers complained about not having a true full-size car in the fall of 1961, the Custom 880 was hurried into production. The Custom 880 used the 1962 Chrysler Newport body with the 1961 Dodge front end and interior. The 880 continued into 1965, the year a completely new full-size body was put into production, the [[Dodge Polara|Polara]] entered the medium price class and the [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]] was added as the top series. The Polara and Monaco were changed mostly in appearance for the next ten years or so. Unique \"[[fuselage]]\" styling was employed for 1969 through 1973 and then was toned down again for the 1974 to 1977 models.\n[[File:1967 Dodge Coronet.jpg|right|thumb|1967 Dodge Coronet 440 sedan]]\n\nDodge targeted the [[muscle car]] market of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Along with the Charger, models like the Coronet R/T and [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]] were popular with buyers seeking performance. The pinnacle of this effort was the introduction of the [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]] sports coupe and convertible (Dodge's entry into the \"pony car\" class ) in 1970, which offered everything from mild economy engines up to the race-ready Hemi V8 in the same package.\n\nIn an effort to reach every segment of the market, Dodge even reached a hand across the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] to its partner, [[Mitsubishi Motors]], and marketed their subcompact as the [[Dodge Colt|Colt]] to compete with the [[AMC Gremlin]], [[Chevrolet Vega]], and [[Ford Pinto]]. Chrysler would over the years come to rely heavily on their relationship with Mitsubishi. At the same time, Dodge got a version of the Plymouth Duster, marketed as the Dodge [[Dodge Dart#Third generation (1963\u20131966)|Demon]]. It was inexpensive, but with its slant-six engine (or V8), the Demon could not achieve the fuel economy of the four-cylinder Colt. The Demon sold in much fewer numbers than the Duster, so it is considered more collectible today, especially the V8 versions.\n\n=== 1973\u20131980 ===\n[[File:Dodge Charger (Auto classique Laval '10).jpg|thumb|right|Dodge Charger]]\n[[File:1977Diplomat.jpg|right|thumb|1977 [[Dodge Diplomat]] sedan]]\n\nThe [[1973 oil crisis]] caused significant changes at Dodge, as well as Chrysler as a whole. Except for the Colt and Slant Six models of the Dart, Dodge's lineup was quickly seen as extremely inefficient. In fairness, this was true of most American automakers at the time, but Chrysler was also not in the best financial shape to do anything about it. Consequently, while General Motors and Ford were quick to begin downsizing their largest cars, Chrysler (and Dodge) moved more slowly out of necessity.\n\nAt the very least, Chrysler was able to use some of its other resources. Borrowing the recently introduced [[Chrysler Horizon]] from their [[Chrysler Europe|European division]], Dodge was able to get its new [[Dodge Omni|Omni]] subcompact on the market fairly quickly. At the same time, they increased the number of models imported from Japanese partner [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]] starting in 1971: first came a smaller Colt (based on Mitsubishi's [[Mitsubishi Galant|Galant]] line), then a revival of the Challenger ([[Mitsubishi Galant Lambda|Dodge Challenger]]) in 1976 as a compact hardtop coupe with nothing more than a four-cylinder under the hood, rather than the booming V8s of yore.\n\nThe 1975 model year had the Dodge Charger and Chrysler Cordoba share the same new body based on the [[Chrysler B platform|B platform]]. The Chrysler Cordoba had replaced the Plymouth Satellite Sebring. The Charger SE (Special Edition) was the only model offered. It came with a wide variety engines from the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} \"LA\" series small block V8 to three versions of {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} big block V8. The standard engine was the {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl small block, along with the code E58 4-bbl and dual exhaust high performance version (225&nbsp;hp) being available as an option<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.car.info/en-se/dodge/charger/charger-se-1975-16796485|title=Dodge Charger SE 1975|website=car.info|accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref>. Sales in 1975 amounted to 30,812. \n\n1976 was the Dart's final year in the North American market. The [[rear-view mirror]] was mounted on the windshield rather than from the roof. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on 1 January 1976 in accord with more stringent U.S. federal brake performance requirements, and a new foot-operated parking brake replaced the under-dash T-handle used since the Dart's 1963 introduction as a compact car. The grille's parking lamps were cast in [[amber (color)|amber]], whereas the previous years had clear lenses with amber-colored bulbs. The Dart Sport 360 was dropped as a separate model in 1976, but the {{convert|360|CID|L|abbr=on}} four-barrel, dual exhaust (without catalytic converters) V8 was a $376 option (except in California) for the $3,370 Dart Sport V8 models with automatic transmission.<ref>{{cite book|last= Statham|first=Steve|title=Dodge Dart and Plymouth Duster|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year= 2000|page=124|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz-ItcylfasC&pg=PA124&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=NHlLS8v7GY7qygTWvpH5DQ&client=safari&cd=1#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn= 978-0-7603-0760-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref> ''Car & Driver'' magazine tested the Dart Sport 360 in the April 1976 issue, pitting it against the Chevrolet Corvette and Pontiac Trans Am, and found its top speed of {{convert|121.6|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to be second to the Corvette's {{convert|124.5|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Corvette, 1968\u20131982|publisher=MotorBooks/MBI Publishing|year=2000|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BrPjl25HbucC&pg=PA105&dq=1976+360+Dart+Sport&ei=qnlLS96JOJjCM_7j5IQO&client=safari&cd=6#v=onepage&q=1976%20360%20Dart%20Sport&f=false|isbn=978-0-7603-0418-1|accessdate=2009-01-11}}</ref>\n\nDodge's replacement for the Dart was the Aspen, introduced in mid-1975 as a 1976 model.  This new design featured lighter weight resulting in slightly improved fuel economy; it also had more interior and trunk room than the Dart.  Front suspension was a new design; it featured transverse-mounted torsion bars which not only improved ride, but cornering as well.  Its boxy styling gave the impression of a larger car; however sales had to be shard with the virtually identical Plymouth Volare.  Both cars were available in coupe, sedan, and station wagon body styles, and in both base and deluxe trim.  Despite its virtues, customers soon found out about the Aspen's rush to market when they saw their cars experience severe body rust within a couple years on the road; engine and drive train problems plagued the Aspen/Volare twins, and although the problems were largely worked out within a few years, the final Aspens were the 1980 models.  This car was available with either a 225 cubic-inch Slant Six, or a small block V8 displacing 318 or 360 cubic inches.\n\n[[File:Dodge-Dart-sedan-2.jpg|thumb|right|1976 Dart 4-door sedan]]\n\n1976 was the final model year for the Dodge Coronet, at least so far as the name Coronet went, also its body style choices were relegated to just only two four-door models, the four-door wagon and the four-door sedan. The former Dodge Coronet 2-door model, which appeared for just the previous model year only was replaced by the [[Dodge Charger]] Sport 2-door model, which, itself, appeared for only one model year. During the next model year (1977), the mid-size Dodge Coronet would be renamed [[Dodge Monaco|Monaco]], which would be given stacked rectangular headlights and other minor cosmetic changes, that would provide a prompt sales boost. The Coronet and Charger were effectively replaced by the [[Dodge Diplomat|Diplomat]] for 1977, which was actually a fancier Aspen.\n\nAlso, during that same model year, the full-size Dodge Monaco would be renamed Dodge Royal Monaco, which would appear for just one model year only and after that, both Dodge and Plymouth (which would include Dodge Royal Monaco's entire Plymouth Gran Fury counterpart line up as well) would discontinue all production of any more full-size models. It lost sales every year, until finally being replaced by the [[Dodge St. Regis|St. Regis]] for 1979 following a one-year absence from the big car market. In a reversal of what happened for 1965, the St. Regis was an upsized Coronet. During the following model year (1978), the mid-size Dodge Monaco (which would include its entire Plymouth Fury counterpart line up as well) would make its final appearance (for all during the remainder of the 1970s).\n\nWhile the Aspen got accolades for styling and handling, build quality was problematic, sullying the car's reputation at the time when sales were desperately needed. It was noted for having problems with its carburetors which resulted in frequent stalling.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The Aspen also had difficulty in starting, even after leaving the engine off for several minutes.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} This resulted in several recalls.\n\nThe Dodge Magnum was introduced for 1978 to supplement the [[Dodge Charger (B-body)|Dodge Charger]]. It was sold in two forms, the \"XE\" and the \"GT\" and was the last vehicle to use the long running [[Chrysler B platform]]. The appearance was somewhat of a rounded off Charger, and was in response to getting a car that would be eligible for [[NASCAR]] that would be more aerodynamic, something that the 1975\u20131978 Charger was not. Styling features included four rectangular headlights behind retractable clear covers, with narrow [[opera window]]s, and an optional T-bar or power sunroof. The Magnum was well-featured with power steering, brakes and seats; the suspension included Chrysler's standard adjustable, longitudinal torsion bars, lower trailing links, and front and rear anti-sway bars. The base engine was the {{convert|318|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 with [[Lean-burn#Chrysler Electronic Lean-Burn|Lean-Burn]], while two and four-barrel carbureted {{convert|360|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8s were optional; weight was nearly {{convert|3900|lb|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe Omni and Horizon appeared at a critical time for Chrysler, when the company was on the brink of bankruptcy and sought government support to survive. In 1978, Chrysler had beaten out Ford and General Motors to the market with a domestically-produced front-wheel drive car to challenge the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk1|VW Rabbit]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.autos.ca/motoring-memories/motoring-memories-dodge-omniplymouth-horizon-1978-1990/|first=Bill |last=Vance |title=Motoring Memories: Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon, 1978-1990 |publisher=autos canada |date=28 April 2006 |accessdate=12 January 2013 }}</ref> However, the L-bodies miscarried at first, since 1978 was a year of strong sales for larger cars and demand for compacts and subcompacts noticeably shrank. These initial poor sales of the cars contributed to Chrysler's financial woes at the time, but when the company requested federal assistance, the Omni was an important piece of evidence that they were attempting to compete with imports and build small, fuel-efficient cars and might be worth saving. For the three years leading up to the introduction of [[Chrysler K platform|Chrysler's K-cars]], the Omni/Horizon was Chrysler's best selling model line.<ref name=RT82>{{cite journal | ref = 81bg | journal = Road & Track's Road Test Annual & Buyer's Guide 1981 | issue = January\u2013February 1981 | title = 1981 Buyer's Guide | editor-first = Tony | editor-last = Hogg | page = 93 }}</ref>\n\nEverything came to a head in 1979 when Chrysler's new chairman, [[Lee Iacocca]], requested and received federal loan guarantees from the [[United States Congress]] in an effort to save the company from having to file bankruptcy. With a Federal Loan in hand, Chrysler quickly set to work on new models that would leave the past behind, while reorganizing to pay the government loan which stood at 29%.\n\nThe Dodge Mirada was a [[mid-size]]d, [[rear-wheel drive]] [[coupe]] manufactured and marketed by Dodge for model years 1980 to 1983 sharing the [[Chrysler J platform]] along with its [[badge engineering|badge engineered]] variants, the second generation [[Chrysler Cordoba]] and the [[Imperial (automobile)|Imperial]]. Production of the Mirada reached just under 53,000 units, staying relatively unchanged during its 4-year run, with the exception of paint colors and engines. The Mirada was marketed as a sporty [[personal luxury car]] with limited advertising and marketing during a period when Chrysler was in deep financial difficulty.\n\n=== 1981\u20131990 ===\n[[File:Dodge Aries sedan.jpg|thumb|left|1981\u201382 Aries Special Edition]]\n\nThe first fruit of Chrysler's crash development program was the \"[[Chrysler K platform|K-Car]]\", the Dodge version of which was the [[Dodge Aries]]. This basic and durable [[front-wheel drive]] platform spawned a whole range of new models at Dodge during the 1980s, including the groundbreaking [[Dodge Caravan]]. [[Lee Iacocca]] and Hal Sperlich had conceived their idea for this type of vehicle during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. [[Henry Ford II]] rejected the idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974. Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler, and together they created what was internally designated the T-115 minivan \u2013 a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the Magic-wagons.<ref name=\"allpar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/m/history.html |title=A Brief History of the Chrysler Minivan |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=May 11, 2014}}</ref> Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year, using the [[Chrysler S platform]], an extended derivative of the [[Chrysler K platform]]. The Caravan not only helped save Chrysler as a serious high-volume American automaker, but also spawned an entirely new market segment that supplanted the role of the station wagon: the [[minivan]]. \n\nBy 1981, Chrysler was switching to smaller [[front-wheel drive]] designs. However, its older and larger rear-wheel drive Dodge Diplomat (as well as the Chrysler LeBaron and Fifth Avenue) continued to sell. Chrysler's then executive vice president for manufacturing, Steve Sharf, met with officials at [[American Motors]] (AMC) to use the extra capacity at an assembly plant in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] to build the cars.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\">{{cite journal |url=http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406143253/http://wardsauto.com/news-analysis/oldest-auto-plant-make-newest-v-6 |title=Oldest Auto Plant to Make Newest V-6 |first=David C. |last=Smith |journal=Ward's AutoWorld |date=1 June 2008 |archivedate=6 April 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Chrysler's tooling was moved from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to Kenosha, and from 1987 until 1989 about 250,000 Chrysler and Dodge models were built by AMC at a lower cost than Chrysler could.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> This relationship evolved into Chrysler's purchase of AMC in 1987.<ref name=\"AMCbuilt\" /> Following the demise of the [[Dodge St. Regis]] R-body in 1981, the Diplomat remained, becoming the largest sedan in the Dodge lineup, despite technically being a mid-size car. Dodge would not market another truly full-size car (at least based upon [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) passenger volume statistics) until the [[Dodge Monaco#Fifth generation (1989-92)|Monaco]] debuted as a 1990 model.\n\n[[File:1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe, front right.jpg|thumb|left|1981 Dodge Diplomat coupe]]\n[[File:1989 Dodge Aries K coupe.jpg|thumb|left|1985\u20131989 Dodge Aries coupe]]\n\nAs the 1980s progressed, fewer private customers purchased the Diplomat, and the M-body was eventually dropped during the 1989 model year. Although sales were strong, Chrysler CEO [[Lee Iaccoca]] held a low opinion of the M-body line as a relic of the pre-K car era and declined to invest any money in them. Despite lower gas prices in the mid- to late-1980s and a 2.26:1 rear-end gear ratio, the Diplomat's carbureted engine and lack of an overdrive gear on its [[TorqueFlite]] automatic transmission resulted in poor fuel economy compared with its larger competitors from Ford and General Motors, as evidenced by comparing the EPA estimates for 1986 models:\n\n* Dodge Diplomat (5.2&nbsp;L V8, 3-speed automatic): 16 city, 21 highway, 18 combined\n* Chevrolet Caprice (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 17 city, 25 highway, 20 combined\n* Ford LTD Crown Victoria (5.0&nbsp;L V8, 4-speed automatic with overdrive): 18 city, 26 highway, 21 combined\n\nThe Daytona originally used the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]] in [[normally aspirated]] (93&nbsp;hp) or [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]] (142&nbsp;hp) form. The 100 [[horsepower|hp]] 2.5&nbsp;L K engine was added for 1986. In 1985, the 2.2&nbsp;L Turbo I engine's horsepower was increased to {{convert|146|hp|abbr=on}}. The 1984 Daytona was available in three trim lines: standard, Turbo and Turbo Z. Total production was 49,347. The Daytona Turbo was on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver 10Best#1984|10Best]] list for 1984. Both the Daytona and Chrysler Laser were available with the Chrysler [[electronic voice alert]] system through 1987. A performance oriented \"[[Carroll Shelby|Shelby]]\" version of the Daytona was introduced in 1987. For 1987, the Daytona was restyled externally, and featured pop-up headlights. New in 1987 was a ''Shelby Z'' trim level with an available Chrysler developed Turbo II ({{convert|174|hp|kW|abbr=on}} \u2013 {{convert|200|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}) intercooled version of the 2.2&nbsp;L [[Chrysler K engine]], as well as a heavy-duty A555 transaxle with [[Getrag]] gears. The Shelby Z also featured numerous suspension upgrades, including a larger diameter front sway bar and disc brakes on all four wheels. This version was sold in Europe under the name ''Chrysler GS Turbo II''. A more luxury-oriented ''Pacifica'' trim line was also added to replace the Chrysler Laser, which was dropped in mid-year 1986. Among the optional equipment included a leather interior, eight-way power enthusiast driver's seat (with mechanical thigh and lumbar controls), digital instrument cluster, and a 12-button trip computer (with instant fuel ratings as well as trip averages and estimated travel times).\n\n[[File:87-91 Dodge Daytona.jpg|thumb|left|250px|1987\u20131991 Dodge Daytona]]\n[[File:Daytonashelbyz.jpg|thumb|left|1987 Dodge Daytona Shelby Z]]\n\nDiplomats built from mid-1988 until the end of production were among the first Chrysler-built products to have a driver's side [[airbag]] as standard equipment, some two model years before the remainder of Chrysler's lineup (they were also among the only cars at the time to offer a tilt steering column with an airbag). Diplomats with airbags differed from earlier models in that they were also equipped with a padded, color-keyed knee blocker which extended out from beneath the instrument panel in front of the driver.\n\nThe Dodge Dynasty is related to the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]; both car lines were built on the [[Chrysler C platform]] in [[Belvidere, Illinois]]. It is also similar to the [[Chrysler New Yorker Fifth Avenue]] and [[Chrysler Imperial]], which were available from 1990 to 1993 on an extended wheelbase platform of the [[Chrysler New Yorker]]. The [[Lee Iacocca]]-dictated styling was boxy and conservative compared to more aerodynamically styled competitors such as the [[Ford Taurus (first generation)|Ford Taurus]]. Dynasty trim levels included base and LE. Additionally, a \"Brougham\" package was offered on 1992\u201393 LE models that added a padded \"landau\" [[vinyl roof]]. When the new front-wheel-drive Chrysler Corporation C-body cars (Dynasty and New Yorker) debuted for the 1988 model year, they were the first mass-produced cars in the world to have a fully multiplexed, fiber-optic wiring buss connecting all electronic accessories and controllers. This greatly reduced the amount and weight of wiring harnesses in the car. All models (1988\u20131993) featured power locks that automatically locked when the car's speed exceeded 15 miles per hour. \n\nThe 1989\u20131990 Ultradrive equipped models came with a 2.36:1 axle ratio, which was revised to 2.52:1 for 1991\u20131993. EPA mileage ratings were 21 city/25 highway MPG with the 4 cylinder & 3-speed TorqueFlite transmission. The 1988 3.0&nbsp;L V6 models with TorqueFlight transmission were rated at 18 city / 24 highway MPG. In 1989 the EPA rating for the 3.0/Ultradrive power-train changed to 18 city / 26 highway MPG. The new 3.3&nbsp;L V6 engine for 1990, with Ultradrive transmission, was rated at 19 city/ 26 highway MPG. A 2.5-litre [[inline-four engine|inline-4]] Chrysler engine (base model only), a [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]]-sourced 3.0&nbsp;L [[V6 engine|V6]], the 6G72 engine, and a [[Chrysler]]-built 3.3&nbsp;L V6 were available, although the 3.3&nbsp;L V6 was not available until 1990. The four-cylinder came equipped with a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission (the A413), as did the 3.0&nbsp;L in 1988. The new electronically controlled four-speed [[automatic transmission]], known as the Ultradrive or A604 ([[List of Chrysler transmissions]]), debuted in 1989, and became the sole transmission for V6 models through the 1993 final production year of the Dynasty. The vast majority of Dynastys sold to private customers had V6 engines; four-cylinder models mostly went to the fleet market.\n\nThrough the late 1980s and 1990s, Dodge's designation as the sporty-car division was backed by a succession of high-performance and/or aggressively styled models including the:\n*[[Dodge Daytona|Daytona]]\n*[[Dodge 600|600]] \n*Performance variants of the [[Dodge Lancer|Lancer]]\n*[[Dodge Viper|Viper]]\n\n=== 1990s ===\n[[File:1991 Dodge Viper Indianapolis 500 Pace Car.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|The pre-production Dodge Viper (SR I) as the pace car for the [[1991 Indianapolis 500]].]]\n[[File:1990-92 Dodge Monaco.JPG|thumb|1990\u20131992 Dodge Monaco LE]]\n[[File:Spirit RT Front34.jpg|thumb|right|1991 [[Dodge Spirit#R/T|Dodge Spirit R/T]]]]\n[[File:Dodge Intrepid LB 1993-1997 19feb2007.jpg|thumb|Rear view]]\n[[File:1st Dodge Stratus.jpg|thumb|Cab Forward Design on a 1996 [[Dodge Stratus]]]]\n\nThe Omni and the Horizon ended production in 1990, and were replaced by the [[Dodge Shadow]]/[[Plymouth Sundance]], which were both introduced for 1987. Both the Monaco and Premier were discontinued during the 1992 model year. However, its state of the art manufacturing plant and the key executive from American Motors behind the Premier/Monaco design, [[Francois Castaing]], would lead to the successful and highly rated \"[[Cab forward#Automobiles|cab-forward]]\" [[Chrysler LH platform|LH]] [[Dodge Intrepid]], [[Chrysler Concorde]], and [[Eagle Vision]] versions in late 1992 when production resumed at [[Brampton Assembly]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Francois J.

The Spirit sold well and had higher consumer acceptance than the [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]] that replaced it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Dodge-branded Mitsubishi vehicles were phased out by 1993 except for the Dodge Stealth running through 1996, though Mitsubishi-made engines and electrical components were still widely used in American domestic Chrysler products. \n\nIn 1992, Dodge moved their performance orientation forward substantially with the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which featured an aluminum V10 engine and composite sports roadster body. This was the first step in what was marketed as \"The New Dodge\", which was an aggressive advertising campaign with a litany of new models, with television ads narrated by [[Edward Herrmann]] that pointed out the innovations in the vehicles and challenged their competitors. Also,he would go on to serve as the brand's spokesperson for the rest of the decade.\n\nLater that year was the introduction of new [[Dodge Intrepid|Intrepid]] sedan, totally different from its boxy [[Dodge Dynasty|Dynasty]] predecessor. The Intrepid used what Chrysler called \"[[cab forward]]\" styling, with the wheels pushed out to the corners of the chassis for maximum passenger space. The Intrepid was available in two trim levels: base and the sportier, better-equipped ES, which added four-wheel disc brakes, 16-inch wheels with better tires, and stiffer \"touring\" suspension damping. All Intrepids received driver and front passenger airbags, a rarity at the time, as well as air conditioning and the four-speed automatic transmission. Anti-lock brakes were optional, as was traction control and the more powerful 3.5&nbsp;L SOHC engine rated at (214&nbsp;hp).\n\nIn 1994, the new second generation [[Dodge Ram]] pickup was introduced with bold styling that departed radically from the boxy designs of trucks made by the Big Three for two decades prior. The second-generation Ram began development in 1986. The original concept, dubbed the \"Louisville Slugger\" by Chrysler's Advanced Packaging Studio, was to be a modular platform that would accommodate a full-size truck and full-size van, which would have provided a roomy cab and cargo bed.<ref name=\"Jalopnik\">{{cite web |url=https://jalopnik.com/the-original-design-for-the-second-gen-dodge-ram-was-a-1825251176 |title=The Original Design For The Second-Gen Dodge Ram Was A Styling Disaster |author=Westbrook, Justin T. |work=Jalopnik |date=August 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 5, 2018}}</ref> The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref> The redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named \"[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]\" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\"/> Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''. Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. \n\nThey followed up on this idea in a smaller scale with the [[Dodge Neon|Neon]] and [[Dodge Stratus|Stratus]]. The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the [[Chrysler JA platform]] (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). The three cars differed only in the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels. The interiors also had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume [[Dodge Spirit|Spirit]] ([[United States]] only). The Stratus, [[Plymouth Breeze]], and [[Chrysler Cirrus]] were all on ''[[Car and Driver]]'' magazine's [[Car and Driver Ten Best|Ten Best list]] for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time.\n\nThe car was [[Badge engineering|badged and sold]] as both a Dodge and a Plymouth in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]; in [[Mexico]] was sold as Dodge and Chrysler, and in Europe, Australia and other export markets it was sold as the '''Chrysler Neon'''. At the Neon's release, then president of [[Chrysler Corporation]] [[Bob Lutz (businessman)|Bob Lutz]] said, \"There's an old saying in [[Detroit]]: 'Good, fast, or cheap. Pick any two.'

The first two generations were very similar in that both were based on the [[Dodge Dakota]], both featured a [[body-on-frame]] construction and both were produced at the [[Newark Assembly]] Plant in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]], Delaware.

Rationalizing Chrysler's broad lineup was a priority, and Dodge's sister brand Plymouth was withdrawn from the market. With this move, Dodge became DaimlerChrysler's low-price division as well as its performance division.\n\nThe Intrepid, Stratus, and Neon updates of the 1998 to 2000 timeframe were largely complete before Daimler's presence, and Dodge's first experience of any platform sharing with the German side of the company was the 2005 [[Dodge Magnum|Magnum]] [[station wagon]], introduced as a replacement for the Intrepid. Featuring Chrysler's first mainstream [[rear-wheel drive]] platform since the 1980s and a revival of the Hemi V8 engine. The [[Dodge Charger (LX)|Charger]] was launched in 2006 on the same platform.\n\nIn 2000, the Stratus became the last of the surviving Cloud Cars, with the Cirrus renamed as the Sebring,<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/chrysler-sebring-lxi-road-test |title=Chrysler Sebring LXi Road Test |magazine=Car and Driver |date=December 2000 |accessdate=January 14, 2015 |first=Larry |last=Webster}}</ref> and the Breeze discontinued (along with the Plymouth brand).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://consumerguide.com/used/1996-00-plymouth-breeze/ |title=1996\u20132000 Plymouth Breeze |publisher=Consumer Guide Auto |accessdate=14 January 2015}}</ref> \n\nThis generation of the Dodge Stratus was not sold in [[Canada]], although 1999 was the last year for Dodge Stratus sales in Canada. 2002 models dropped the \"DODGE\" badges from the doors.

The base engine in the '''SE''' and '''SXT''' trim levels was the 2.4&nbsp;L [[Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance|GEMA]] I4 naturally aspirated \"World Engine\", a joint venture between [[DaimlerChrysler]], [[Mitsubishi Motors|Mitsubishi]], and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Additional engines included an optional 2.7&nbsp;L V6 in the '''SXT''' and a standard 3.5&nbsp;L V6 in the '''R/T''' trim level. In addition to the 2.4&nbsp;L \"World Engine\" and the V6s, export vehicles were offered with the 2.0&nbsp;L naturally aspirated \"World Engine\", as well as a 2.0&nbsp;L turbocharged diesel ([[Unit injector|Pumpe-D\u00fcse]]) made by [[Volkswagen]].<ref name=\"2008-2014allpar\">{{cite web |url=http://www.allpar.com/cars/dodge/avenger.html |title=2008-2014 Dodge Avenger cars |publisher=AllPar |accessdate=July 11, 2014}}</ref> As a 2008 model, the Dodge Avenger came to showrooms in February 2007.\n[[File:Dodge Avenger rear 20080517.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]\n\nFurther cost savings were explored in the form of an extensive platform-sharing arrangement with Mitsubishi, which spawned the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]] subcompact as a replacement for the Neon, and the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] sedan. The rear-drive chassis was then used in early 2008 to build a new [[Dodge Challenger|Challenger]], with styling reminiscent of the original 1970 Challenger. Like its predecessor, the new Challenger coupe was available with a powerful V8 engine (base models featured a V6). In Spring 2007, [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler]] reached an agreement with [[Cerberus Capital Management]] to sell its Chrysler Group subsidiary, of which the Dodge division was a part. Soon after, the housing bubble began to collapse the American market, and on May 1, 2009, Chrysler and GM filed for bankruptcy on the same day.\n\n===Fiat ownership===\nOn June 10, 2009, Italian automaker [[Fiat]] formed a partnership with Chrysler under [[Sergio Marchionne]], with the UAW, and the US Government to form Chrysler Group LLC, of which Dodge remained fully integrated. For its part, the US Government provided more than $6 billion in loans at 21%, called a \"bridge loan\" or \"bailout\". The newly formed company went on to fully repay that loan, remortgaging to reduce the interest rate several times down to 6%. They fully paid back the loan with interest to the U.S. Government on May 24, 2011, a full five years early. The UAW, being partners throughout the process, were paid well and above $3.9 billion in 2013 as Sergio's plan for full consolidation has continued on schedule. This has allowed Chrysler LLC to fully merge with Fiat to form FCA, [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]], in 2014. The combined company will be based in [[London]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ebhardt |first=Tommaso |last2=Clothier |first2=Mark |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-05-08/marchionne-says-london-to-have-fiat-chrysler-headquarters.html |title=Marchionne Says London to Have Fiat Chrysler Headquarters |publisher=Bloomberg |date=May 9, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Dodge reintroduced a compact car based on an [[Alfa Romeo]] design called the Dart. It was the first new Dodge model produced under FCA.\n\nOn May 6, 2014, FCA announced a major restructuring, in which Dodge would focus solely on performance vehicles and will be positioned between [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] (which is moving downmarket into mainstream vehicles) and a relaunched [[Alfa Romeo]] (making its return to North America after a 20-year absence) in the FCA lineup. This is a set up similar to [[PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn]], which positions [[Peugeot]] as its mainstream brand while [[Citro\u00ebn]] is more performance-based, as well as [[Hyundai Motor Group]] having its two mainstream brands, [[Kia Motors]] and [[Hyundai Motor Company]] focusing on performance and mid-luxury, respectively.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} (Among the American press, it has drawn comparisons to the decades-long set up of [[Chevrolet]] and [[Pontiac]] at [[General Motors]] before the phase-out of Pontiac in 2010.) As part of the restructuring, Dodge will discontinue the [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]] (after 32 years) and [[Dodge Avenger]] without replacements, while launching a sporty [[Subcompact car|subcompact]] below the Dart in 2018. Additionally, while the [[Ram Trucks]] division will remain separate (although the [[Dodge Durango]] will remain in production as a Dodge), the [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]] division was merged back into Dodge.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jerry |last=Hirsh |first2=David |last2=Unredcoffler |url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-chrysler-revamp-20140507-story.html#page=1 |title=Fiat Chrysler unveils aggressive five-year plan |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 6, 2014 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Dodge trucks==\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 320\n | header = Dodge and Ram emblems\n | image1 = Dodge Ram pickup hood ornament sop.jpg\n | caption1 =\n | image2 =\n | caption2 =\n | footer = Ram hood ornaments adorned every Dodge car and truck from 1932 to 1954.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allpar.com/corporate/bios/fairbanks.html|title=Avard T.

Although the Ram trucks are marketed separately from Dodge cars, Ram President Fred Diaz has said:\n\n<blockquote>Ram trucks will always and forever be Dodges. Ram will always have the Dodge emblem inside and outside and they will be ''<nowiki>'vinned'</nowiki>'' (from the acronym [[VIN]], or Vehicle Identification Number) as a Dodge. We need to continue to market as Ram so Dodge can have a different brand identity: hip, cool, young, energetic. That will not fit the campaign for truck buyers. The two should have distinct themes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.pickuptrucks.com/2010/01/ram-trucks-will-always-be-dodges-ram-president-says.html|title=Ram Trucks Will Always Be Dodges, Ram President Says - PickupTrucks.com News |website=news.pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=May 30, 2019}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Pickups and medium to heavy trucks===\n[[File:1934 Dodge Brothers 2-ton stake truck red.jpg|thumb|right|1934 Dodge K-34 stake bed truck]]\nEver since Dodge began building their own cars in 1914, the company also offered light truck models. Initially, these were largely based on the existing passenger cars, but eventually gained their own chassis and body designs as the market matured. During the 1930s and 1940s, light- and medium-duty models were offered at first, then a heavy-duty range was added. The very large, new [[Warren Truck Assembly]] plant was built in Michigan, just north of Detroit, and opened in 1938, producing Dodge trucks ever since.\n\nIn 1936, Dodge's light, car-based trucks were crucially redesigned\u2014not only receiving a new \"Fore-Point\" (similar to Cab Forward) design of the front side and cab\u2014but especially, the old car frames were dropped and for the first time replaced by modern, truck-style chassis, with side rails ''welded'' to the cross members.<ref name=AllparRam /> These welded frames were from here on introduced on half-ton to one-ton rated trucks, expanding Dodge into a heavier truck market segment than before.\n\nIn 1939 again, Dodge presented a completely redesigned [[Dodge T-, V-, W-Series|line of pickups and trucks]], with streamlined new, 'art-deco' front sheetmetal styling. Introducing the concept of \"Job-Rated\", Dodge tried to offer customers the truck that fit every job they were buying it for.<ref name=AllparRam>{{cite web |url=https://www.allpar.com/model/ram/ram-history.html |title=History of the Dodge Pickup Trucks, 1921-1953 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Allpar |access-date=2018-02-15}}</ref> From the 1939 'Job-Rated' trucks onwards, Dodge's light and medium trucks were built in its 'Mound Road\" plant in Warren, Michigan.\n\nFollowing [[World War II]] and the successful application of [[four-wheel drive]] to the truck line, Dodge introduced a civilian version that it called the [[Dodge Power Wagon|Power Wagon]]. At first based almost exactly on the military-type design, variants of the standard truck line were eventually given 4WD and the same \"Power Wagon\" name.\n\nDodge was among the first to introduce car-like features to its trucks, adding the plush Adventurer package during the 1960s and offering sedan-like space in its Club Cab bodies of the 1970s. Declining sales and increased competition during the 1970s eventually forced the company to drop its medium- and heavy-duty models, an arena the company has only recently begun to reenter.\n\nDodge introduced what they called the \"Adult Toys\" line to boost its truck sales in the late 1970s, starting off with the limited edition Lil' Red Express pickup (featuring, a 360 c.i. police interceptor engine and visible [[semi-trailer truck|big rig]]-style [[exhaust system|exhaust]] stacks). Later came the more widely available [[Dodge Warlock|Warlock]]. Other \"Adult Toys\" from Dodge included the \"Macho Power Wagon\" and \"Street Van\".\n\nAs part of a general decline in the commercial vehicle field during the 1970s, Dodge eliminated their [[Dodge LCF Series|LCF Series]] heavy-duty trucks in 1975, along with the Bighorn and medium-duty D-Series trucks, and affiliated S Series [[school bus]]es were dropped in 1978. On the other hand, Dodge produced several thousand pickups for the [[United States armed forces|United States Military]] under the [[Commercial Utility Cargo Vehicle|CUCV]] program from the late 1970s into the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:89RamF34.jpg|thumb|1989 Dodge Ram pickup]]\nContinuing financial problems meant that even Dodge's light-duty models \u2013 renamed as the [[Dodge Ram|Ram Pickup]] line for 1981 \u2013 were carried over with the most minimal of updates until 1993. Two things helped to revitalize Dodge's fortunes during this time. One was the introduction of [[Cummins]]' powerful and reliable [[Cummins B Series engine|B Series]] turbo-[[diesel engine]] as an option for 1989. This innovation raised Dodge's profile among consumers who needed power for towing or large loads. The second was a class-exclusive V8 engine option for the mid-sized [[Dodge Dakota|Dakota]] pickup.\n\nDodge introduced the Ram's all-new \"big-rig\" styling treatment for 1994. Besides its instantly [[Attitude polarization|polarizing]] looks, exposure was also gained by usage of the new truck on the hit TV show ''[[Walker, Texas Ranger]]'' starring [[Chuck Norris]]. The new Ram also featured a totally new interior with a console box big enough to hold a laptop computer, and ventilation and radio controls that were designed to be easily used even with gloves on. A V10 engine derived from that used in the Viper sports car was also new, and the previously offered Cummins [[turbodiesel]] remained available. The smaller Dakota was redesigned for 1997 using the big rig styling, thus giving Dodge trucks a definitive \"face\" that set them apart from the competition.\n\nThe Ram was redesigned again for 2002, and the Dakota in 2005, and was basically an evolution of the original, but adding the Hemi V8 engine to the list of available options, due to the revival of the legendary Chrysler Hemi V8 engine. New medium duty chassis cab models were introduced for 2007 with standard Cummins turbodiesel power as a way of gradually getting Dodge back into the business truck market again.\n\nFor a time during the 1980s, Dodge imported a line of small pickups from Mitsubishi, known as the D50, or later the [[Dodge Ram 50|Ram 50]] and were carried on as a stopgap until the Dakota's sales eventually made the imported trucks irrelevant. Reversing the role, Mitsubishi has more recently purchased Dakota pickups from Dodge and restyled them into their own [[Mitsubishi Raider|Raider]] line for sale in North America.\n\n===Vans===\nDodge had offered panel delivery models for many years since its founding, but their first purpose-built van model arrived for 1964 with the compact [[Dodge A100|A Series]]. Based on the Dodge Dart platform and using its proven six-cylinder or V8 engines, the A-series was a strong competitor for both its domestic rivals (from Ford and Chevrolet/[[GMC Truck|GMC]]) and the diminutive [[Volkswagen Transporter]] line.\n\nAs the market evolved, Dodge realized that a bigger and stronger van line would be needed in the future, and thus the [[Dodge B Series|B Series]] was introduced for 1971, and offered both car-like comfort in its Sportsman passenger line or expansive room for gear and materials in its Tradesman cargo line. A chassis cab version was also offered for use with bigger cargo boxes or flatbeds. Like the trucks, Chrysler's dire financial straits of the late 1970s precluded any major updates for the vans for many years. Rebadged as the [[Dodge Ram Van|Ram Van]] and [[Dodge Ram Wagon|Ram Wagon]] for 1981, this old design carried on for 33 years with little more than cosmetic and safety updates all the way to 2003.\n[[File:2001-2004 Dodge Grand Caravan.jpg|thumb|right|2001\u20132004 [[Dodge Caravan|Dodge Grand Caravan]]]]\n\nThe DaimlerChrysler merger of 1998 made it possible for Dodge to explore new ideas; hence the European-styled [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]] line of vans was brought over and given a Dodge styling treatment. Redesigned for 2006 as a 2007 model, the economical diesel-powered Sprinters have become very popular for city usage among delivery companies like [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] in recent years. Because of their fuel efficiency major motorhome manufacturer Thor Motor Coach made several Class C and Class A [[Motorhomes]] available on the Dodge Sprinter Chassis including their popular Four Winds Siesta & Chateau Citation product lines.\n\nDodge also offered a cargo version of its best-selling Caravan for many years, at first calling it the Mini Ram Van, which was a name originally applied to the short-wheelbase B Series Ram Vans, and later naming it the Caravan C/V, the C/V stood for Cargo Van. For model year 2012, the Caravan C/V was rebranded as a Ram, and was renamed the Ram C/V.\n\n===Sport utility vehicles===\nDodge's first experiments with anything like a sport utility vehicle appeared in the late 1950s with a windowed version of their standard panel-truck \u2013 known as the [[Dodge Town Wagon|Town Wagon]]. These were built in the same style through the mid-1960s.\n\nBut the division did not enter the SUV arena in earnest until 1974, with the purpose-built [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ramcharger]]. Offering the then-popular open body style and Dodge's powerful V8 engines, the Ramcharger was a strong competitor for trucks like the [[Ford Bronco]], [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[International Harvester Scout]] II.\n\nOnce again, though, Dodge was left with outdated products during the 1980s as the market evolved. The Ramcharger hung on through 1993 with only minor updates. When the Ram truck was redesigned for the 1994 model year, the Ramcharger was discontinued in the American and Canadian markets. A version using the updated styling was made for the Mexican Market but was never imported to the U.S. or Canada.\n\nInstead, Dodge tried something new in 1997. Using the mid-sized Dakota pickup's chassis as a base, they built the four-door [[Dodge Durango|Durango]] SUV with seating for eight people and created a new niche. Sized between smaller SUVs (like the [[Chevrolet S-10 Blazer|Chevrolet Blazer]] and [[Ford Explorer]]) and larger models (like the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Ford Expedition]]), Durango was both a bit more and bit less{{original research inline|date=May 2012}} of everything. The redesigned version for 2004 grew a little bit in every dimension, becoming a full-size SUV (and thus somewhat less efficient), but was still sized between most of its competitors on either side of the aisle. For 2011 a new unibody Durango based on the Jeep Grand Cherokee was released. The 2011 Durango shrank slightly to size comparable to the original model.\n\nDodge also imported a version of Mitsubishi's popular Montero ([[Mitsubishi Pajero|Pajero]] in Japan) as the [[Dodge Raider|Raider]] from 1987 to 1989.\n\n=== High performance vehicles ===\nFrom the late 20th century onwards, Dodge's highest performing vehicles fell under the category [[Street & Racing Technology|SRT]]. These models often came equipped with high performance V8s under the hood. These models included the [[Dodge Challenger]] SRT (2008\u2013current), [[Dodge Charger]] SRT (2006\u2013current), [[Dodge Magnum]] SRT (2006\u20132008) and [[Dodge Durango]] SRT (2018-current-). They also produced the [[Dodge Neon SRT-4]] (2003\u20132005), [[Dodge Caliber]] SRT-4 (2008\u20132009), [[Dodge Viper]] (1991\u20132010; 2012\u20132017), and [[Dodge Ram SRT-10]] (2004\u20132006). In 2015, [[Chrysler|FCA]] introduced the [[Chrysler Hemi engine#Hellcat|Hellcat]], a 707 HP, [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L [[Hemispherical combustion chamber|HEMI]] [[V8 engine|V8]]. In 2017, Dodge released the [[Dodge Challenger]] Demon. It is powered by an 840 HP [[Supercharger|supercharged]] 6.2&nbsp;L HEMI [[V8 engine|V8]], and comes from the factory with a toolbox known as the \"Demon Toolbox\" that has everything a buyer will need to drag race, including the skinny front drag tires. However, buyers will only get 840 HP on race fuel. On regular pump gas, it produces 808 HP, a 101 HP increase over the Hellcat.\n\n==International markets==\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Dodge Polara (Argentina).jpg|thumb|right|An Argentine Dodge Polara, produced from 1968 to 1980]]\n\nDodge came to Argentina in the early 20th century with imported cars and trucks.

Passenger cars were also produced, namely the [[Plymouth Valiant|Valiant I and II]], and the local versions of the 1966 [[Dodge Dart]] (called Valiant III and IV). In 1971, the Dodge 1500, a rebadged [[Hillman Avenger]] from the United Kingdom was introduced. In 1982, production of Dodge vehicles ceased when German company [[Volkswagen]] bought the Fevre plant and the shares.\n\nIn Argentina, the name \"Polara\" was used to refer to a series of vehicles developed on the basis of the fourth generation North American [[Dodge Dart#1967\u20131969|Dodge Dart]]. These cars were manufactured between 1968 and 1980, by the subsidiary Chrysler-Fevre Argentina S.A.<ref name=\"Chrysler Argentina \">{{cite web|url= http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |title=Chrysler Argentina S.A., Dodge Coronado and Polara specifications |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111115144202/http://www.cocheargentino.com.ar/d/dodge_sedan_cupe.htm |date=May 18, 2009 |language=Spanish |archivedate=November 15, 2011 |accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, Dodge began marketing cars and pick-ups directly in Argentina. Currently, both the Journey and the Ram are available to Argentine customers.\n\n===Asia===\nDodge entered the Japanese market in mid-2007, and re-entered the Chinese market in late 2007. [[Soueast Motors]] of China assembles the Caravan for the Chinese market. Dodge began marketing its vehicles in South Korea in 2004, starting with the Dakota.\n\n===Australia===\nDodge re-entered the Australian market in 2006 with the [[Dodge Caliber|Caliber]], their first offering since the AT4/D5N trucks in 1979 and the first Dodge passenger car to be marketed in Australia since the [[Dodge Phoenix|Phoenix]] sedan was discontinued in 1973. The second model to be introduced was the [[Dodge Nitro|Nitro]], with the [[Dodge Avenger|Avenger]] and [[Dodge Journey|Journey]] followed. Dodge chose not use the full model lines and engines available to them, the 2.7&nbsp;L V6 being available in the Journey and Avenger instead of the 3.2&nbsp;L in the North American versions. However, diesel engines were introduced in all their cars.\nFollowing the Global Financial Crisis, Chrysler introduced the facelifted model of the Caliber and discontinued the Avenger imports. From early 2012 on, model year 2010 cars were available. By early 2012 no new cars were being brought into Australia aside from the new facelifted 2012 Journey.\n\nThere were rumors that Dodge cars will be re-badged as Fiats in the Australian market as was the case in Europe. The Dodge nameplate continued due to consistent sales of the Journey.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bruce |last=Newton |url= http://www.carpoint.com.au/news/2012/fiat-punto-heading-back-to-australia-32839 |title=Fiat Punto heading back to Australia |publisher=carpoint.com.au |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> However, the brand was discontinued in the Australian market after 2016.<ref>{{cite web |last=Maclean |first=Andrew |title=Dodge brand dropped from Australia - Dodge disappears from Australia |url=https://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/dodge-brand-dropped-from-australia-20161014-gs2od1 |website=Drive |accessdate=6 December 2019 |language=en-au |date=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nIn Brazil, Dodge cars were produced between 1969 and 1981 with the models Dart, Charger, Magnum, LeBaron (all powered by the same 318&nbsp;cid V8 engine), and the compact 1800/Polara, based on the British [[Hillman Avenger]]. The manufacturer was acquired by Volkswagen in 1981. In 1998, the Dakota pickup started production in a new plant in [[Campo Largo, Paran\u00e1]] by [[Mercedes-Benz]], which belongs to its former partner [[Daimler AG]]. It was built there until 2001 with petrol and diesel engines and regular, extended and crew cabs. In 2010, Dodge started sales of the imported pickup Ram 2500. The model portfolio is being expanded, starting with the Journey crossover for the 2009 model year.\n\n===Canada===\nIn Canada, the Dodge lineup of cars started down the road to elimination along with the Plymouth line when in 1988 the [[Dodge Dynasty]] was sold in Canada as the Chrysler Dynasty and sold at both Plymouth and Dodge dealers. Similarly, the new [[Dodge Intrepid]], the Dynasty's replacement, was sold as the Chrysler Intrepid.\n\nFor 2000, the new Neon became the Chrysler Neon. The Chrysler Cirrus and Mitsubishi-built Dodge Avenger were dropped. Dodge trucks, which have been sold at Canadian Plymouth dealers since 1973, continued without change. All Plymouth-Chrysler and Dodge-Chrysler dealers became Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep dealers.\n\nThe diluting of the Chrysler name did not go well in Canada, especially as the nameplate had been pushed as a luxury line since the 1930s. For 2003, the revamped Neon appeared in Canada as the Dodge SX 2.0. Since then, all new Dodge models have been sold in Canada under the Dodge name.\n\n===Europe===\nDodge started assembling lorries (trucks) in the United Kingdom from imported parts in 1922. In 1933 it began to manufacture a British chassis at its works in [[Kew]], using American engines and gearboxes.<ref>{{cite web|author=doctor colin |url= http://www.dodge50.co.uk/dodgehistory.htm |title=1922 To 1983 a brief history of Dodge in the U.K. |publisher=Dodge50.co.uk |date= |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\n;Right-hand drive Dodge trucks\n{{gallery | height = 120\n|File:Dodge D 15.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:Preserved dodge, Limestone Museum, Malta Siggiewa. feb 2011 - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpg|Dodge D15\n|File:1952 Dodge Kew \"Parrot Nose\" truck in red.jpg|1952 Kew-built Dodge D100\n}}\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Dodge Kew was part of the [[London Aircraft Production Group]], building fuselage sections for [[Handley Page Halifax]] bombers. The pre-war and wartime truck range was replaced by the [[Dodge 100 \"Kew\"]] truck (1949\u20131957), nicknamed the \"parrot nose\" due to the sculpted lines of its bonnet.  Subsequent normal-control Dodges built at Kew were the 200 series (1957\u20131963) and the 400 series (1963\u20131965). The 400 series was a version of the American [[Dodge D series|D series]] medium-duty models. Also built at Kew were the [[Cab over|cab-over]] [[Dodge 300|300 series]] (1957\u20131965) and its successor the [[Dodge 500|500 series/K-series]] (1964\u20131978) tilt-cab. In 1964 Chrysler acquired its first stake in the British [[Rootes Group]] and it was decided to consolidate all truck production at Rootes' factory in Dunstable.  British assembly of the 400 series was discontinued due to declining sales of normal-control trucks, and production of the 500 series was transferred to Dunstable in 1967.  \n\nIn some export markets British-built Dodge trucks used the [[Fargo Trucks|Fargo]] or [[DeSoto (automobile)|DeSoto]] marques, and the situation was further complicated after takeover of the Rootes Group whose commercial vehicles were sold under the [[Commer]] and [[Karrier]] marques. Some Dodge 500s were given Commer badges, whilst the [[Dodge 100 \"Commando\"|100 series \"Commando\"]] light truck (1970\u20131989) developed by Rootes was initially marketed under all five marques. In the UK market Commers were usually lighter than Dodges, whereas the Karrier marque tended to be used on vehicles sold to public sector operators such as local authorities. Some of the smaller Commer/Karrier vans were also sold as Fargos in export markets.  In 1976 Chrysler Europe  rationalised its marques and thereafter all the British-built commercial vehicles were sold as Dodges or (increasingly rarely) Karriers. This included the smaller [[Commer FC|Commer SpaceVan]] (1960\u20131983) and [[Commer Walk-Thru]] (1961\u20131979), which became Dodges for their final years. The van and pick-up versions of Chrysler Europe's French-built [[Simca 1100]] were also branded as Dodges in Britain from 1976, although they remained Simcas elsewhere (and became Talbots in Britain after 1979).\n\nAmerican Chrysler Corporation cars, including some Dodge models, were assembled from [[Knock-down kit|CKD]] kits at various locations in Europe until the 1970s, including Kew (1920s-30s), Antwerp (1926\u20131958) and Rotterdam (1958\u20131970), but sales volumes were low as even 'compact' American cars like the [[Dodge Dart]] were enormous [[Gas-guzzler|gas-guzzlers]] by European standards. However, [[protectionist]] policies in some countries encouraged small local manufacturers to license-build CKD models, including [[AMAG Automobil- und Motoren|AMAG]] in Switzerland (building Chryslers and Dodges 1948\u20131972) and [[Barreiros (manufacturer)|Barreiros]] in Spain (building Dodge Darts from 1965 as the Barreiros Dart). By 1969 Chrysler had acquired full control of Barreiros, and Darts were being exported to other European countries under the Dodge name (precipitating closure of the Rotterdam plant). From 1970 the Spanish-built Dart was replaced by the Barreiros/Dodge 3700 which remained in production until 1977. The Dodge cars were a relatively small part of the Madrid factory's output, which was dominated by smaller Simca-designed cars and Barreiros-designed heavy duty trucks. From 1972 such trucks were sold as the [[Dodge 300]] (though unrelated to the earlier British 300 series), which was available as 4\u00d72, 6\u00d74, 8\u00d72 and 8\u00d74 rigids, as well as 4\u00d72 semi-trailer tractors.\n\nFollowing Chrysler Europe's collapse in 1977 and the sale of their assets to [[Peugeot]], the van and truck range and the associated factories in Dunstable and Madrid were quickly passed on to [[Renault Trucks|Renault V\u00e9hicules Industriels]]. Chrysler licensed the Dodge name to be used on Renault trucks sold in certain European markets \u2013 most notably the United Kingdom. However the only subsequent new model to carry the Dodge name was the [[Dodge 50 series]] (1979\u20131992), which replaced the earlier Walk-Thru and was widely used in Britain by utility companies, the military and as a minibus, but was rarely seen outside the UK. Thereafter all new models were Renaults, and in 1987 the Dodge name was dropped from the remaining inherited models (50 and Commando), which became Renaults for their last few years of production.\n\nDodge vehicles would not return to Europe until the introduction of the Neon, badged as a Chrysler, in the mid-1990s.\n\nChrysler reintroduced the Dodge marque to Europe on a broad scale in 2006, with a lineup consisting of North American-built Caliber, Avenger, Viper SRT-10, Nitro and [[Dodge Journey]] cars and SUVs, but this proved to be a shortlived return due to the onset of the [[Great Recession]] and the takeover of Chrysler by Fiat. In 2010 the Dodge marque was pulled from the UK due to poor sales<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2010/05/19/dodge-stops-selling-nitro-caliber-in-uk/ |title=Dodge stops selling Nitro, Caliber in UK |publisher=Autoblog |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> and on June 1, 2011 it was dropped from the rest of Europe. All of the Dodge models were discontinued in Europe except the Dodge Journey, which became the [[Fiat Freemont]] (and which was not available in the right-hand-drive Ireland or UK markets).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autofacil.es/problemas-coche/2011/07/11/pasa-tienes-chrysler-o-dodge/7432.html |title=Qu\u00e9 pasa si tienes un Chrysler o Dodge|publisher=Autof\u00e1cil (Luike) |date=July 11, 2011 |accessdate=July 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nIn Mexico, the [[Hyundai Accent]], [[Hyundai Atos]], and [[Hyundai Porter|Hyundai H100]] were branded as \"Dodge\", [[Dodge Attitude]], \"Verna by Dodge\", \"Atos by Dodge\" and \"Dodge H100\" respectively, and sold at Chrysler/Dodge dealers. Current models are marketed with Hyundai logos instead of the \"Ram\" logo on previous model years since 2014. Dodge and Hyundai ended the venture and Dodge will use rebadged and reworked Fiats (2014). Also, to the next year with [[Mitsubishi Mirage]] is sold as the new Dodge Attitude since 2015.\n\n==Logos==\n* Star: The original Dodge was a circle, with two Greek [[Delta (letter)|deltas]] intertwined representing the letter \"[[D]]\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/world/canada/3-dodge.html |title=History of Dodge Brothers |publisher=Allpar.com |date=2015-07-02 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}</ref> forming a six-pointed star in the middle; an interlocked \"DB\" was at the center of the star, and the words \"Dodge Brothers Motor Vehicles\" encircled the outside edge. Although similar to the [[Star of David]], the Dodge brothers were not [[Jewish]]; they were [[Methodist]]s. Although the \"Brothers\" was dropped from the name for trucks in 1929 and cars in 1930, the DB star remained in the cars until the 1939 models were introduced.\n* Ram: For 1932 Dodge cars adopted a leaping ram as the car's hood ornament. Starting with the 1940 models the leaping ram became more streamlined and by 1951 only the head, complete with curving horns, remained. The 1954 model cars were the last to use the ram's head before the reintroduction in the 1980s. Dodge trucks adopted the ram as the hood ornament for the 1940 model year with the 1950 models as the last.\n* Crest: For 1941 Dodge introduced a crest, supposedly the Dodge family crest. The design had four horizontal bars broken in the middle by one vertical bar with an \"O\" in the center. A knight's head appeared at the top of the emblem. Although the head would be dropped for 1955, the emblem would survive through 1957 and reappear on the 1976 Aspen. The crest would be used through to 1981 on its second time around, being replaced by the Pentastar for 1982. The knight's head without the crest would be used for 1959.\n* Forward Look: Virgil Exner's radical Forward Look redesign of Chrysler's vehicles for the 1955 model year was emphasized by the adoption of a logo by the same name, applied to all Chrysler Corporation vehicles. The Forward Look logo consisted of two overlapped boomerang shapes, suggesting [[space age]] rocket-propelled motion. This logo was incorporated into Dodge advertising, decorative trim, ignition and door key heads, and accessories through September 1962.\n* Fratzog: Dodge's logo from September 1962 through 1981 was a fractured [[Kite (geometry)|deltoid]] composed of three arrowhead shapes forming a three-pointed star. The logo first appeared on the 1962 Polara 500 and the mid-year 1962 Custom 880. One of its designers came up with the meaningless name Fratzog for the logo, which ultimately stuck.<ref>{{cite web|author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1962-1964-dodge-8802.htm |title=1962\u20131964 Dodge 880 article |publisher=Auto.howstuffworks.com |date=August 23, 2007 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Sealey |first=Mike |url= http://www.allpar.com/history/logos.html |title=Mike Sealey's history of Chrysler's logos |publisher=Allpar.com |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> As the Dodge Division's logo, Fratzog was incorporated in various badges and emblems on Dodge vehicles. It was also integrated into the design of such parts as steering wheel center hubs and road wheel covers.\n* Pentastar: From 1982 to 1995, Dodge used Chrysler's [[Pentastar]] logo on its cars and trucks to replace the Dodge crest, although it had been used for corporate recognition since late 1962. In advertisements and on dealer signage, Dodge's Pentastar was red, while Chrysler-Plymouth's was blue.\n* [[Ram Trucks|Ram]]'s head: Dodge reintroduced the ram's head hood ornament on the new 1973 Dodge Bighorn heavy duty tractor units. Gradually the ram's head began appearing on the pickup trucks as Dodge began to refer to their trucks as Ram. The present iteration of the [[Bighorn sheep|Ram]]'s-head logo appeared in late 1992 on the 1993 Intrepid, standardizing on that logo in 1996 for all vehicles except the [[Dodge Viper|Viper]], which uses the [[Viperidae|Viper's]] Head.\n* New logo: In 2010, with the separation of the Ram brand, two new Dodge logos were unveiled. The first logo features the word \"DODGE\" with two red inclined stripes. It was originally used strictly for marketing purposes, however Dodge introduced the logo onto the grilles of the 2012 lineup.\n\nA second emblem was revealed during the unveiling of the 2011 Durango, which used the same five-point shield-shaped outline of the old emblem, but with the ram's head replaced with a chrome cross reminiscent of the brand's signature cross-haired grille.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/|title=New Dodge emblem revealed |publisher=VehiCast |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120425112925/http://vehicast.blog.com/2010/09/02/new-dodge-emblem-revealed/ |archivedate=April 25, 2012 |accessdate=August 17, 2014}}</ref> This was only used on the [[steering wheel]]. In 2014, the cross logo was replaced by the word \"DODGE\" on the Durango steering wheel. A modified version of the Ram's head logo is still used for the Ram brand, with \"RAM\" written across the bottom in bold white or black lettering.\n\n===Dodge logo evolution===\n<gallery>\nFile:DodgeBros.JPG|Dodge Brothers emblem c. 1910, removed from the gate of the [[Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly|\"Dodge Main\"]] before its 1981 demolition\nFile:Dodge Brothers logo.svg|1914 Dodge Brothers logo\nFile:Forward Look D100.jpg|Forward Look, 1955\u20131962\nFile:1965 Dodge Dart 270, pict9.JPG|Fratzog, 1962\u20131981\nFile:Dodge Red Pentastar.svg|Red Chrysler Pentastar logo, 1966\u20131996\nFile:A new Dodge logo.png|Variant of 2010 logo\nFile:Dodge logo 2010.png|Textured metal word, 2010\u2013 <ref>{{cite web|title=Brand New: Dodge Loses its Horns |url=http://www.underconsideration.com/brandnew/archives/dodge_loses_its_horns.php|website=underconsideration.com|date=May 26, 2010|accessdate=January 12, 2018}}</ref>\nFile:Dodge logo bars.png|Current Dodge logo\n</gallery>\n\n==Slogans==\n* Dependability, The Dependables.

In the 1930s, he made photographs on the streets of [[Paris]]. He was a champion of [[humanist photography]] and with [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] a pioneer of [[photojournalism]].<ref>W. Scott Haine, Culture and Customs of France (London Greenwood, 2006), p. 289</ref>\n\nDoisneau is renowned for his 1950 image ''Le baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville'' (''The Kiss by the City Hall''), a photograph of a couple kissing on a busy Parisian street.\n\nHe was appointed a ''Chevalier'' (Knight) of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1984 by then French president, [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]].<ref name=\"Ency\"/>\n\n==Photographic career==\nDoisneau was known for his modest, playful, and ironic images of amusing juxtapositions, mingling social classes, and eccentrics in contemporary Paris streets and cafes. Influenced by the work of [[Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Atget]], and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], in more than twenty books he presented a charming vision of human frailty and life as a series of quiet, incongruous moments.\n{{quote|The marvels of daily life are so exciting; no movie director can arrange the unexpected that you find in the street.|Robert Doisneau}}\n\nDoisneau's work gives unusual prominence and dignity to [[children's street culture]]; returning again and again to the theme of children at play in the city, unfettered by parents. His work treats their play with seriousness and respect.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n==Early life==\nDoisneau's father, a [[plumber]], died in active service in [[World War I]] when Robert was about four. His mother died when he was seven. He then was raised by an unloving aunt.<ref name=\"Ency\">{{cite book|author=Lynne Warren|title=Encyclopedia of 20th Century Photography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YeK7FXhKrw0C&pg=PA413|accessdate=14 April 2012|year=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-415-97665-7|pages=413\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"SunTim 2005\">[https://archive.is/20130114015347/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/article583515.ece Sunday Times. 6 November 2005.

There he had his first contact with the arts, taking classes in [[figure drawing]] and [[still life]].\n\nWhen he was 16 he took up amateur photography, but was reportedly so shy that he started by photographing cobble-stones before progressing to children and then adults.<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n\nAt the end of the 1920s Doisneau found work as a [[Drafter|draughtsman]] (lettering artist) in the advertising industry at ''Atelier Ullmann'' (''Ullmann Studio''), a creative graphics studio that specialised in the [[pharmaceutical industry]]. Here he took an opportunity to change career by also acting as camera assistant in the studio and then becoming a staff photographer.<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/><ref name=\"ArtC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.artscenecal.com/ArticlesFile/Archive/Articles1999/Articles0699/RDoisneauA.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000118192045/http://artscenecal.com/ArticlesFile/Archive/Articles1999/Articles0699/RDoisneauA.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 January 2000 |title=ArtCentral Profile of Robert Doisneau |publisher=Artcentral.com |accessdate=12 August 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Skj\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skjstudio.com/doisneau/index.html |title=Profile of Robert Doisneau |publisher=SKJ Studio |accessdate=12 August 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719025828/http://www.skjstudio.com/doisneau/index.html |archivedate=19 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Photography in the 1930s==\nIn 1931 he left both the studio and advertising, taking a job as an assistant with the modernist photographer [[Andr\u00e9 Vigneau]].<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/><ref name=\"ArtC\"/><ref name=\"Skj\"/>\n\nIn 1932, he sold his first photographic story to ''Excelsior'' magazine.<ref name=\"Ency\"/>\n\nIn 1934, he began working as an industrial advertising photographer for the [[Renault]] car factory at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]].<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/> Working at Renault increased Doisneau's interest in working with photography and people. Five years later in 1939, he was dismissed because he was constantly late. He was forced to try freelance advertising, engraving, and [[postcard]] photography to earn his living. At that time the French postcard industry was the largest in Europe, postcards served as [[greetings card]]s as well as vacation souvenirs.<ref name=\"Nouv\"/> In 1991 he said that the years at the Renault car factory marked \"the beginning of his career as a photographer and the end of his youth.\"\n\nIn 1939, he was later hired by Charles Rado of the [[Rapho (agency)|Rapho photographic agency]] and traveled throughout France in search of picture stories. This is where he took his first professional street photographs.\n\n==War service and resistance==\nDoisneau worked at the Rapho agency until the outbreak of [[World War II]], whereupon he was drafted into the French army as both a soldier and photographer. He was in the army until 1940 and from then until the end of the war in 1945 used his draughtsmanship, lettering artistry, and engraving skills to forge passports and identification papers for the [[French Resistance]].\n\n==Post-war photography==\n[[File:Photographers Robert Doisneau (left) and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz in 1975 a.jpg|thumb|Doisneau (left) and [[Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz]] in 1975  at Arles]]\nSome of Doisneau's most memorable photographs were taken after the war. He returned to freelance photography and sold photographs to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and other international magazines. He briefly joined the Alliance Photo Agency but rejoined the Rapho agency in 1946 and remained with them throughout his working life, despite receiving an invitation from [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] to join [[Magnum Photos]].<ref name=\"Ency\"/><ref name=\"Nouv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvellesimages.com/Robert-Doisneau_id~artistes_aut~402054 |title=Nouvelles Images, Our Artists, Profile of Robert Doisneau |publisher=Nouvellesimages.com |date=14 April 1912 |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nHis photographs never ridiculed the subjects; thus he refused to photograph women whose heads had been shaved as punishment for sleeping with Germans.<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n{{quote|I don't photograph life as it is, but life as I would like it to be.|Robert Doisneau<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>}}\nIn 1948 he was contracted by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' to work as a fashion photographer. The editors believed he would bring a fresh and more casual look the magazine but Doisneau didn\u2019t enjoy photographing beautiful women in elegant surroundings; he preferred street photography. When he could escape from the studio, he photographed ever more in the streets of Paris.\n\n[[Le Groupe des XV]] was established in 1946 in Paris to promote photography as art and drawing attention to the preservation of French photographic heritage. Doisneau joined the Group in 1950 and participated alongside Rene-Jacques, Willy Ronis, and Pierre Jahan.\n\nThe 1950s were Doisneau's peak, but the 1960s were his wilderness years. In the 1970s Europe began to change and editors looked for new reportage that would show the sense of a new social era. All over Europe, the old-style picture magazines were closing as television received the public's attention. Doisneau continued to work, producing children's books, advertising photography, and celebrity portraits including Alberto Giacometti, [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Georges Braque]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nDoisneau worked with writers and poets such as [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Jacques Pr\u00e9vert]], and he credited Prevert with giving him the confidence to photograph the everyday street scenes that most people simply ignored.<ref name=\"Ency\"/>\n\nThe photography of Doisneau has had a revival since his death in 1994. Many of his portraits and photographs of Paris from the end of World War II through the 1950s have been turned into calendars and postcards, and have become icons of French life.\n\n== ''Le Baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville'' (''The Kiss'') ==\nIn 1950 Doisneau created his most recognizable work for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|fr|Le Baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville}} (''Kiss by the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]''), a photograph of a couple kissing in the busy streets of [[Paris]],<ref>Shown here [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2129634/Robert-Doisneau-French-photographer-centenary-birth-celebrated-Google-Doodle.html].</ref> which became an internationally recognised symbol of young love in Paris. The identity of the couple remained a mystery until 1992.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nJean and Denise Lavergne erroneously believed themselves to be the couple in ''The Kiss'', and when Robert and Annette Doisneau (his older daughter and also his assistant at the time) met them for lunch in the 1980s he \"did not want to shatter their dream\" so he said nothing. This resulted in them taking him to court for \"taking their picture without their knowledge\", because under French law an individual owns the rights to their own likeness. The court action forced Doisneau to reveal that he posed the shot using Fran\u00e7oise Delbart and Jacques Carteaud, lovers whom he had just seen kissing, but had not photographed initially because of his natural reserve; he approached them and asked if they would repeat the kiss. He won the court case against the Lavergnes.<ref name=\"Ency\"/><ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/><ref name=\"posed\">{{Citation| last1 = Lucas| first1 = Dean| title = Famous Pictures Magazine&nbsp;\u2013 Kissing Couple | date = 17 April 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/kissing-couple/}}</ref><ref name=\"BlueArt\">{{cite web|url=http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/art/ |title=BlueArt reproduction of the ''Smithsonian Magazine'' article about Robert Doisneau |publisher=Bluegirlredstate.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref> Doisneau said in 1992, \"I would never have dared to photograph people like that.

In 2005 Fran\u00e7oise Bornet (n\u00e9e Delbart) stated that, \"He told us we were charming, and asked if we could kiss again for the camera. We didn't mind. We were used to kissing. We were doing it all the time then, it was delicious. Monsieur Doisneau was adorable, very low key, very relaxed.\" They posed at the [[Place de la Concorde]], the [[Rue de Rivoli]] and finally the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]. The photograph was published in 12 June 1950, issue of ''Life''.<ref name=\"BlueArt\"/> The relationship between Delbart and Carteaud only lasted for nine months.<ref name=\"posed\"/> Delbart continued her acting career, but Carteaud gave up acting to become a wine producer.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nIn 1950 Fran\u00e7oise Bornet was given an original print of the photograph, bearing Doisneau's signature and stamp, as part of the payment for her \"work\". In April 2005 she sold the print at auction for [[Euro|\u20ac]]155,000 to an unidentified Swiss collector via the Paris auctioneers Artcurial Briest-Poulain-Le Fur.<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/><ref name=\"BBC\"/><ref name=ettinger>The Photographs of Robert Doisneau, \"Promenades dans les Passages avec Robert Doisneau\" with Rosi Huhn (Interview), Bracha L.

They had two daughters, Annette (b. 1942) and Francine (b. 1947). From 1979 until his death, Annette worked as his assistant.<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n\nHis wife died in 1993 suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Doisneau died six months later in 1994, having had a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple heart bypass]] and suffering from [[acute pancreatitis]]. Annette said \"We won in the courts (re: ''The Kiss''), but my father was deeply shocked. He discovered a world of lies, and it hurt him. 'The Kiss' ruined the last years of his life. Add that to my mother suffering from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and I think it's fair to say he died of sadness.\"<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n\nDoisneau was in many ways a shy and humble man, similar to his photography, still delivering his own work at the height of his fame. He chastised Francine for charging an \"indecent\" daily fee of \u00a32,000 for his work on a beer advertising campaign&nbsp;\u2013 he wanted only the rate of an \"artisan photographer\".<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n{{quote|Maybe if I were 20, success would change me. But now I'm a dinosaur of photography.|Robert Doisneau<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>}}\n\nHe lived in southern Paris ([[Gentilly, Val-de-Marne]], [[Montrouge]], and the [[13th arrondissement of Paris|13th arrondissement]]) throughout his life. He is buried in the cemetery at [[Raizeux]] beside his wife.\n\n==Awards and commemoration==\n[[File:Corbeil-Essonnes Lyc\u00e9e Doisneau.JPG|thumb|Lyc\u00e9e Robert Doisneau de Corbeil-Essonnes]]\n*Kodak Prize, 1947\n*[[Ni\u00e9pce Prize]], 1956 ([[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]])\n*Grand Prix National de la Photographie, 1983\n*Balzac Prize, 1986 ([[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]])\n*Chevalier of the Order of the [[Legion of Honour]], 1984.<ref name=\"Ency\"/>\n*Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) from the [[Royal Photographic Society]], 1991.<ref>http://www.rps.org/annual-awards/Honorary-Fellowships Accessed 18 August 2012 {{deadlink|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n*The [[Maison de la photographie Robert Doisneau]] in [[Gentilly, Val-de-Marne]], is a photography gallery named in his honour.\n*Several ''Ecole Primaire'' ([[primary school]]s) are named after him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Ecole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire Robert Doisneau is at [[V\u00e9retz]] (Indre-et-Loire).<ref>[http://www.education.gouv.fr/annuaire/37-indre-et-loire/veretz/etab/ecole-primaire-publique-doisneau-(robert).html France - Education.gouv, Ecole Primaire Publique Doisneau (Robert)]</ref>\n*The ''All\u00e9e Robert Doisneau'' is named in his honour at the 'Parc de Billancourt' on the site of the old [[Renault]] factory at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]].\n*On April 14, 2012, [[Google]] celebrated his 100th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/robert-doisneaus-100th-birthday|title=Robert Doisneau's 100th Birthday|website=Google|date=14 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n* ''Paris d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par son peuple.''

Influenced by the work of [[Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Atget]], and [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]], in more than twenty books he presented a charming vision of human frailty and life as a series of quiet, incongruous moments.\n{{quote|The marvels of daily life are so exciting; no movie director can arrange the unexpected that you find in the street.|Robert Doisneau}}\n\nDoisneau's work gives unusual prominence and dignity to [[children's street culture]]; returning again and again to the theme of children at play in the city, unfettered by parents.

Five years later in 1939, he was dismissed because he was constantly late. He was forced to try freelance advertising, engraving, and [[postcard]] photography to earn his living. At that time the French postcard industry was the largest in Europe, postcards served as [[greetings card]]s as well as vacation souvenirs.<ref name=\"Nouv\"/> In 1991 he said that the years at the Renault car factory marked \"the beginning of his career as a photographer and the end of his youth.\"\n\nIn 1939, he was later hired by Charles Rado of the [[Rapho (agency)|Rapho photographic agency]] and traveled throughout France in search of picture stories. This is where he took his first professional street photographs.\n\n==War service and resistance==\nDoisneau worked at the Rapho agency until the outbreak of [[World War II]], whereupon he was drafted into the French army as both a soldier and photographer. He was in the army until 1940 and from then until the end of the war in 1945 used his draughtsmanship, lettering artistry, and engraving skills to forge passports and identification papers for the [[French Resistance]].\n\n==Post-war photography==\n[[File:Photographers Robert Doisneau (left) and Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz in 1975 a.jpg|thumb|Doisneau (left) and [[Andr\u00e9 Kert\u00e9sz]] in 1975  at Arles]]\nSome of Doisneau's most memorable photographs were taken after the war. He returned to freelance photography and sold photographs to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' and other international magazines. He briefly joined the Alliance Photo Agency but rejoined the Rapho agency in 1946 and remained with them throughout his working life, despite receiving an invitation from [[Henri Cartier-Bresson]] to join [[Magnum Photos]].<ref name=\"Ency\"/><ref name=\"Nouv\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nouvellesimages.com/Robert-Doisneau_id~artistes_aut~402054 |title=Nouvelles Images, Our Artists, Profile of Robert Doisneau |publisher=Nouvellesimages.com |date=14 April 1912 |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nHis photographs never ridiculed the subjects; thus he refused to photograph women whose heads had been shaved as punishment for sleeping with Germans.<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n{{quote|I don't photograph life as it is, but life as I would like it to be.|Robert Doisneau<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>}}\nIn 1948 he was contracted by ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' to work as a fashion photographer. The editors believed he would bring a fresh and more casual look the magazine but Doisneau didn\u2019t enjoy photographing beautiful women in elegant surroundings; he preferred street photography. When he could escape from the studio, he photographed ever more in the streets of Paris.\n\n[[Le Groupe des XV]] was established in 1946 in Paris to promote photography as art and drawing attention to the preservation of French photographic heritage. Doisneau joined the Group in 1950 and participated alongside Rene-Jacques, Willy Ronis, and Pierre Jahan.\n\nThe 1950s were Doisneau's peak, but the 1960s were his wilderness years. In the 1970s Europe began to change and editors looked for new reportage that would show the sense of a new social era. All over Europe, the old-style picture magazines were closing as television received the public's attention. Doisneau continued to work, producing children's books, advertising photography, and celebrity portraits including Alberto Giacometti, [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Fernand L\u00e9ger]], [[Georges Braque]], and [[Pablo Picasso]].\n\nDoisneau worked with writers and poets such as [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[Jacques Pr\u00e9vert]], and he credited Prevert with giving him the confidence to photograph the everyday street scenes that most people simply ignored.<ref name=\"Ency\"/>\n\nThe photography of Doisneau has had a revival since his death in 1994. Many of his portraits and photographs of Paris from the end of World War II through the 1950s have been turned into calendars and postcards, and have become icons of French life.\n\n== ''Le Baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville'' (''The Kiss'') ==\nIn 1950 Doisneau created his most recognizable work for ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''&nbsp;\u2013 {{lang|fr|Le Baiser de l'h\u00f4tel de ville}} (''Kiss by the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|H\u00f4tel de Ville]]''), a photograph of a couple kissing in the busy streets of [[Paris]],<ref>Shown here [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2129634/Robert-Doisneau-French-photographer-centenary-birth-celebrated-Google-Doodle.html].</ref> which became an internationally recognised symbol of young love in Paris. The identity of the couple remained a mystery until 1992.<ref name=\"BBC\"/>\n\nJean and Denise Lavergne erroneously believed themselves to be the couple in ''The Kiss'', and when Robert and Annette Doisneau (his older daughter and also his assistant at the time) met them for lunch in the 1980s he \"did not want to shatter their dream\" so he said nothing. This resulted in them taking him to court for \"taking their picture without their knowledge\", because under French law an individual owns the rights to their own likeness. The court action forced Doisneau to reveal that he posed the shot using Fran\u00e7oise Delbart and Jacques Carteaud, lovers whom he had just seen kissing, but had not photographed initially because of his natural reserve; he approached them and asked if they would repeat the kiss. He won the court case against the Lavergnes.<ref name=\"Ency\"/><ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/><ref name=\"posed\">{{Citation| last1 = Lucas| first1 = Dean| title = Famous Pictures Magazine&nbsp;\u2013 Kissing Couple | date = 17 April 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/kissing-couple/}}</ref><ref name=\"BlueArt\">{{cite web|url=http://bluegirlredstate.typepad.com/blue_girl/art/ |title=BlueArt reproduction of the ''Smithsonian Magazine'' article about Robert Doisneau |publisher=Bluegirlredstate.typepad.com |date= |accessdate=12 August 2011}}</ref> Doisneau said in 1992, \"I would never have dared to photograph people like that.

In 2005 Fran\u00e7oise Bornet (n\u00e9e Delbart) stated that, \"He told us we were charming, and asked if we could kiss again for the camera. We didn't mind. We were used to kissing.

They had two daughters, Annette (b. 1942) and Francine (b. 1947). From 1979 until his death, Annette worked as his assistant.<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n\nHis wife died in 1993 suffering from [[Alzheimer's disease]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. Doisneau died six months later in 1994, having had a [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|triple heart bypass]] and suffering from [[acute pancreatitis]]. Annette said \"We won in the courts (re: ''The Kiss''), but my father was deeply shocked. He discovered a world of lies, and it hurt him. 'The Kiss' ruined the last years of his life. Add that to my mother suffering from Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, and I think it's fair to say he died of sadness.\"<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n\nDoisneau was in many ways a shy and humble man, similar to his photography, still delivering his own work at the height of his fame. He chastised Francine for charging an \"indecent\" daily fee of \u00a32,000 for his work on a beer advertising campaign&nbsp;\u2013 he wanted only the rate of an \"artisan photographer\".<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>\n{{quote|Maybe if I were 20, success would change me. But now I'm a dinosaur of photography.|Robert Doisneau<ref name=\"SunTim 2005\"/>}}\n\nHe lived in southern Paris ([[Gentilly, Val-de-Marne]], [[Montrouge]], and the [[13th arrondissement of Paris|13th arrondissement]]) throughout his life. He is buried in the cemetery at [[Raizeux]] beside his wife.\n\n==Awards and commemoration==\n[[File:Corbeil-Essonnes Lyc\u00e9e Doisneau.JPG|thumb|Lyc\u00e9e Robert Doisneau de Corbeil-Essonnes]]\n*Kodak Prize, 1947\n*[[Ni\u00e9pce Prize]], 1956 ([[Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]])\n*Grand Prix National de la Photographie, 1983\n*Balzac Prize, 1986 ([[Honor\u00e9 de Balzac]])\n*Chevalier of the Order of the [[Legion of Honour]], 1984.<ref name=\"Ency\"/>\n*Honorary Fellowship (HonFRPS) from the [[Royal Photographic Society]], 1991.<ref>http://www.rps.org/annual-awards/Honorary-Fellowships Accessed 18 August 2012 {{deadlink|date=September 2019}}</ref>\n*The [[Maison de la photographie Robert Doisneau]] in [[Gentilly, Val-de-Marne]], is a photography gallery named in his honour.\n*Several ''Ecole Primaire'' ([[primary school]]s) are named after him.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} Ecole \u00e9l\u00e9mentaire Robert Doisneau is at [[V\u00e9retz]] (Indre-et-Loire).<ref>[http://www.education.gouv.fr/annuaire/37-indre-et-loire/veretz/etab/ecole-primaire-publique-doisneau-(robert).html France - Education.gouv, Ecole Primaire Publique Doisneau (Robert)]</ref>\n*The ''All\u00e9e Robert Doisneau'' is named in his honour at the 'Parc de Billancourt' on the site of the old [[Renault]] factory at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]].\n*On April 14, 2012, [[Google]] celebrated his 100th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/robert-doisneaus-100th-birthday|title=Robert Doisneau's 100th Birthday|website=Google|date=14 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Publications==\n* ''Paris d\u00e9livr\u00e9 par son peuple.''

Some filmmakers have also combined fact with fiction and merged Stoker's Dracula with the real [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III Dracula]], often called Vlad Tepes and Vlad the Impaler.<br><br>\n! width=\"390\" | Title\n! width=\"70\" | Release date\n! width=\"185\" | Country\n! width=\"250\" | Director\n! width=\"370\" | Leading cast\n! width=\"450\" | Notes\n|-\n| ''[[Drakula (1920 film)|Drakula]]'' (\u0414\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0443\u043b\u0430) \n| 1920 \n| Russia\n|\n|\n| {{small|Nothing regarding this [[silent film]] is known to survive; there are no known production stills, and there is very little information about this film available.

It has approximately 2,300 undergraduate and graduate students through the College of Arts and Sciences, the McColl School of Business, the Wayland H. Cato, Jr. School of Education, the James L. Knight School of Communication, and the Andrew Blair College of Health, which features the Presbyterian School of Nursing.  Established in 1857, the university offers 34 undergraduate majors and 66 concentrations, and 10 graduate programs. It is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Queens 1900 sign.jpg|thumb|350x350px|The main entrance to Queens University of Charlotte]]\nFounded in 1857 as the Charlotte Female Institute, the school was originally at College and 9th streets in what is now Uptown Charlotte. From 1891 to 1896, it was called the Seminary for Girls. In 1896, the Concord and Mecklenburg Presbyteries chartered the Presbyterian Female College. The seminary merged with this new college. In 1912, anticipating the move to the present campus in the [[Myers Park (Charlotte neighborhood)|Myers Park neighborhood]], the school became Queens College.\n\nThe name Queens College was adopted for three reasons: at the request of the Alumnae Association to disarm prejudice in deference to other Presbyterian colleges which claimed an equal right to the denominational name; to commemorate Queen's Museum, a classical school established in Charlotte in 1771; and to honor [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg]].  In the aftermath of World War II, Queens admitted its first male students. A co-educational Evening College was established in 1948 that provided instruction for adults. It was the forerunner of the New College, which was inaugurated in 1979 as an undergraduate evening program designed for working adults. In 1995, New College was renamed the Pauline Lewis Hayworth College.\n\nIn 1979, the traditional undergraduate liberal arts college at Queens was renamed the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). It began admitting resident males in 1987 when Queens went [[Mixed-sex education|co-ed]].\n\nIn 1989, CAS adopted the innovative Foundations of Liberal Learning program, which is now known as the Core Program in Liberal Arts and is required of all first-year students.\n\nThe International Experience Program, now known as the [[John M. Belk|John Belk]] International Program, was established in 1989. Juniors and seniors participate in a variety of study programs that range from study tours, language programs, a month-long environmental studies program in Yap in Micronesia or a summer-long foreign internship, to semester-long study abroad exchanges in Hong Kong or Ireland. Since its inception, the program has received national recognition from ''U.S. News & World Report''. Queens ranked no. 2 in the country for its \"percentage of students who travel abroad\" (2009) with close to 90 percent participation. In 2008, the program added study tours to Vietnam and South Africa.\n\nIn 1996, the Internship and Career Development Program, also nationally recognized, began requiring a minimum of six credit hours for all students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. The program has been recognized in the past by ''U.S. News & World Report'' as one of the leading internship programs in the country; it boasts 100 percent participation from the university's student body.\n\nQueens' first master's degree program, the Master of Business Administration, launched in 1980. Since then, Queens has added the Master of Education (1983); the Executive Master of Business (1990); the Master of Arts in Teaching (1992); the Master of Science in Nursing (1998); the Master of Arts in Organizational and Strategic Communication (1999); the Low-Residency Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing (2001); the Master of Science in Organization Development (2008) and Master of School Administration (2008).\n\nWith the additional master's degree programs, Queens achieved a university level rank in the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the ''U.S. News & World Report''. The Board of Trustees voted in the Spring of 2002 to recognize Queens' true university status and changed the institutional name from \"Queens College\" to \"Queens University of Charlotte.\" The change became official on June 1, 2002.\n\nThe university obtained the former Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing to form the Presbyterian School of Nursing at Queens in 2004. One of the most popular majors at Queens, the program produces the third-largest number of new registered nurses among higher education institutions in North Carolina.\n\nIn 2006, the university officially opened its 65-acre Sports Complex at Marion Diehl Park, a planned $15 million project that is a partnership between Mecklenburg County and the university. Additionally, in 2008, Queens opened the Knight School of Communication and Wayland H. Cato School of Education that became its fifth and sixth primary units on its Myers Park campus. The Wayland H. Cato School of Education focuses on undergraduate education and runs graduate programs.\n\nIn 2010, the School of Communication was renamed the James L. Knight School of Communication through a naming grant from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]]. The grant initiatives include working to improve digital and media literacy in the Charlotte community.\n\nDaniel G. Lugo assumed the role of Queens' 21st president on July 1, 2019, after the retirement of Dr. Pamela Davies, who led Queens for 17 years.\n\n==Academics==\nMany of Queens University's students are enrolled in either the Business and Marketing programs (33% of undergraduates) or the Communications and Journalism programs (15% of undergraduates). Rounding out the top three most popular majors are the health professions, which are studied by approximately 10% of the undergraduate population, according to the College Board.<ref>[http://apps.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=572&profileId=7]</ref>\n\n===General Education program===\nQueens University has an undergraduate general education curriculum called the \"Queens Advantage\". Students join learning communities, where they work together to develop solutions and build connections between their experiences at Queens and the world around them. Learning communities gather small groups of students from diverse backgrounds and interests to collaborate towards common objectives. A learning community that includes students studying history, biology, and communication may collaborate to examine a topic such as sustainability, social justice, or immigration. Within these interdisciplinary environments, the groups explore new concepts, express their voice, and activate higher levels of thinking to evaluate themes and address real-world issues. During their senior year, students weave together all they've learned during Queens Advantage into one culminating experience. When they complete the curriculum, students are able to evaluate approaches to complex problems, integrate learning from multiple contexts, and communicate fluently.\n\n===Blair College of Health===\nThe Blair College of Health houses the Presbyterian School of Nursing, Human Service Studies Department, and Kinesiology Department.\n\n===Knight School of Communication===\nThe Knight School of Communication was established in 2010 and is the only school of communications in the country to be endowed by the Knight Foundation.  It houses two undergraduate programs (Bachelor of Arts in Communication and a Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Storytelling) and two graduate programs (Master of Arts in Communication and a Master of Arts in Communication\u2014Online).\n\n===McColl School of Business===\nThe McColl School of Business was established in 1993 and is named after Bank of America chairman [[Hugh McColl|Hugh McColl, Jr.]] The school has been accredited by AACSB International since 2007 and offers undergraduate business degrees in accounting, business administration, finance, management and marketing leading to the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree.  The school is known for its internship program (all students complete internships), its study abroad program (John Belk Study Abroad Program), and its high placement rate for graduating seniors.  The school is home to the McColl School of Business DECA Chapter and the McColl Investment Club.\n\nThe McColl School of Business is the home of two graduate programs - Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Master of Science in Organization Development (MSOD). The Flexible MBA enables flexible delivery options through on-campus study or through distance education. Students may elect to follow one mode exclusively or mix and match modes.\n\n==Student life==\n===Greek life===\nQueens University of Charlotte has six sororities and two [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]].\n\n====Sororities====\n* [[Alpha Delta Pi]]: Beta Iota Chapter - chartered in 1931\n* [[Chi Omega]]: Theta Gamma Chapter - chartered in 1928\n* [[Kappa Delta]]: Alpha Omicron Chapter - chartered in 1928\n* [[Phi Mu]]: Gamma Gamma Chapter - chartered in 1929\n* [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]: Tau Beta Chapter - chartered in 2009\n* [[Zeta Phi Beta]]: Sigma Upsilon Chapter - chartered in 2015\n\n====Fraternities====\n* [[Pi Kappa Phi]]: Eta Zeta Chapter - chartered in 1992\n* [[Alpha Tau Omega]]: Colony - founded in 2016\n\n===Clubs and organizations===\nQueens University of Charlotte has more than 30 clubs and student organizations, ranging from musical ensembles to nature groups. Politically minded students spar in debate between the College Republicans and College Democrats; aspiring journalists write pieces for the ''Queens Chronicle''; service-minded students travel to Guatemala; and the Campus Union Board plans on-campus activities.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|Queens Royals}}\nQueens University of Charlotte's athletic teams take the identity of the Queens Royals on the field and cheer their teams on via their mascot, Rex. Queens is a member of the [[NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] program nationally; regionally, the Royals participate in the South Atlantic Conference.

It has approximately 2,300 undergraduate and graduate students through the College of Arts and Sciences, the McColl School of Business, the Wayland H. Cato, Jr. School of Education, the James L. Knight School of Communication, and the Andrew Blair College of Health, which features the Presbyterian School of Nursing.  Established in 1857, the university offers 34 undergraduate majors and 66 concentrations, and 10 graduate programs. It is affiliated with the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Queens 1900 sign.jpg|thumb|350x350px|The main entrance to Queens University of Charlotte]]\nFounded in 1857 as the Charlotte Female Institute, the school was originally at College and 9th streets in what is now Uptown Charlotte. From 1891 to 1896, it was called the Seminary for Girls. In 1896, the Concord and Mecklenburg Presbyteries chartered the Presbyterian Female College. The seminary merged with this new college. In 1912, anticipating the move to the present campus in the [[Myers Park (Charlotte neighborhood)|Myers Park neighborhood]], the school became Queens College.\n\nThe name Queens College was adopted for three reasons: at the request of the Alumnae Association to disarm prejudice in deference to other Presbyterian colleges which claimed an equal right to the denominational name; to commemorate Queen's Museum, a classical school established in Charlotte in 1771; and to honor [[Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg]].  In the aftermath of World War II, Queens admitted its first male students. A co-educational Evening College was established in 1948 that provided instruction for adults. It was the forerunner of the New College, which was inaugurated in 1979 as an undergraduate evening program designed for working adults. In 1995, New College was renamed the Pauline Lewis Hayworth College.\n\nIn 1979, the traditional undergraduate liberal arts college at Queens was renamed the College of Arts and Sciences (CAS). It began admitting resident males in 1987 when Queens went [[Mixed-sex education|co-ed]].\n\nIn 1989, CAS adopted the innovative Foundations of Liberal Learning program, which is now known as the Core Program in Liberal Arts and is required of all first-year students.\n\nThe International Experience Program, now known as the [[John M. Belk|John Belk]] International Program, was established in 1989. Juniors and seniors participate in a variety of study programs that range from study tours, language programs, a month-long environmental studies program in Yap in Micronesia or a summer-long foreign internship, to semester-long study abroad exchanges in Hong Kong or Ireland. Since its inception, the program has received national recognition from ''U.S. News & World Report''. Queens ranked no. 2 in the country for its \"percentage of students who travel abroad\" (2009) with close to 90 percent participation. In 2008, the program added study tours to Vietnam and South Africa.\n\nIn 1996, the Internship and Career Development Program, also nationally recognized, began requiring a minimum of six credit hours for all students enrolled in the College of Arts and Sciences. The program has been recognized in the past by ''U.S. News & World Report'' as one of the leading internship programs in the country; it boasts 100 percent participation from the university's student body.\n\nQueens' first master's degree program, the Master of Business Administration, launched in 1980. Since then, Queens has added the Master of Education (1983); the Executive Master of Business (1990); the Master of Arts in Teaching (1992); the Master of Science in Nursing (1998); the Master of Arts in Organizational and Strategic Communication (1999); the Low-Residency Master of Fine Arts in Creative Writing (2001); the Master of Science in Organization Development (2008) and Master of School Administration (2008).\n\nWith the additional master's degree programs, Queens achieved a university level rank in the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and the ''U.S. News & World Report''. The Board of Trustees voted in the Spring of 2002 to recognize Queens' true university status and changed the institutional name from \"Queens College\" to \"Queens University of Charlotte.\" The change became official on June 1, 2002.\n\nThe university obtained the former Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing to form the Presbyterian School of Nursing at Queens in 2004. One of the most popular majors at Queens, the program produces the third-largest number of new registered nurses among higher education institutions in North Carolina.\n\nIn 2006, the university officially opened its 65-acre Sports Complex at Marion Diehl Park, a planned $15 million project that is a partnership between Mecklenburg County and the university. Additionally, in 2008, Queens opened the Knight School of Communication and Wayland H. Cato School of Education that became its fifth and sixth primary units on its Myers Park campus. The Wayland H. Cato School of Education focuses on undergraduate education and runs graduate programs.\n\nIn 2010, the School of Communication was renamed the James L. Knight School of Communication through a naming grant from the [[John S. and James L. Knight Foundation]]. The grant initiatives include working to improve digital and media literacy in the Charlotte community.\n\nDaniel G. Lugo assumed the role of Queens' 21st president on July 1, 2019, after the retirement of Dr. Pamela Davies, who led Queens for 17 years.\n\n==Academics==\nMany of Queens University's students are enrolled in either the Business and Marketing programs (33% of undergraduates) or the Communications and Journalism programs (15% of undergraduates). Rounding out the top three most popular majors are the health professions, which are studied by approximately 10% of the undergraduate population, according to the College Board.<ref>[http://apps.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=572&profileId=7]</ref>\n\n===General Education program===\nQueens University has an undergraduate general education curriculum called the \"Queens Advantage\". Students join learning communities, where they work together to develop solutions and build connections between their experiences at Queens and the world around them. Learning communities gather small groups of students from diverse backgrounds and interests to collaborate towards common objectives. A learning community that includes students studying history, biology, and communication may collaborate to examine a topic such as sustainability, social justice, or immigration. Within these interdisciplinary environments, the groups explore new concepts, express their voice, and activate higher levels of thinking to evaluate themes and address real-world issues. During their senior year, students weave together all they've learned during Queens Advantage into one culminating experience. When they complete the curriculum, students are able to evaluate approaches to complex problems, integrate learning from multiple contexts, and communicate fluently.\n\n===Blair College of Health===\nThe Blair College of Health houses the Presbyterian School of Nursing, Human Service Studies Department, and Kinesiology Department.\n\n===Knight School of Communication===\nThe Knight School of Communication was established in 2010 and is the only school of communications in the country to be endowed by the Knight Foundation.  It houses two undergraduate programs (Bachelor of Arts in Communication and a Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia Storytelling) and two graduate programs (Master of Arts in Communication and a Master of Arts in Communication\u2014Online).\n\n===McColl School of Business===\nThe McColl School of Business was established in 1993 and is named after Bank of America chairman [[Hugh McColl|Hugh McColl, Jr.]] The school has been accredited by AACSB International since 2007 and offers undergraduate business degrees in accounting, business administration, finance, management and marketing leading to the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree.  The school is known for its internship program (all students complete internships), its study abroad program (John Belk Study Abroad Program), and its high placement rate for graduating seniors.  The school is home to the McColl School of Business DECA Chapter and the McColl Investment Club.\n\nThe McColl School of Business is the home of two graduate programs - Master of Business Administration (MBA) and Master of Science in Organization Development (MSOD). The Flexible MBA enables flexible delivery options through on-campus study or through distance education. Students may elect to follow one mode exclusively or mix and match modes.\n\n==Student life==\n===Greek life===\nQueens University of Charlotte has six sororities and two [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]].\n\n====Sororities====\n* [[Alpha Delta Pi]]: Beta Iota Chapter - chartered in 1931\n* [[Chi Omega]]: Theta Gamma Chapter - chartered in 1928\n* [[Kappa Delta]]: Alpha Omicron Chapter - chartered in 1928\n* [[Phi Mu]]: Gamma Gamma Chapter - chartered in 1929\n* [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]]: Tau Beta Chapter - chartered in 2009\n* [[Zeta Phi Beta]]: Sigma Upsilon Chapter - chartered in 2015\n\n====Fraternities====\n* [[Pi Kappa Phi]]: Eta Zeta Chapter - chartered in 1992\n* [[Alpha Tau Omega]]: Colony - founded in 2016\n\n===Clubs and organizations===\nQueens University of Charlotte has more than 30 clubs and student organizations, ranging from musical ensembles to nature groups. Politically minded students spar in debate between the College Republicans and College Democrats; aspiring journalists write pieces for the ''Queens Chronicle''; service-minded students travel to Guatemala; and the Campus Union Board plans on-campus activities.\n\n==Athletics==\n{{main|Queens Royals}}\nQueens University of Charlotte's athletic teams take the identity of the Queens Royals on the field and cheer their teams on via their mascot, Rex. Queens is a member of the [[NCAA]]'s [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] program nationally; regionally, the Royals participate in the South Atlantic Conference.  Prior to 2013 the Royals participated in [[Conference Carolinas]].\n\nA statue of Rex at the Queens Sports Complex is the largest standing lion sculpture in the world.\n\nEffective as of the 2013\u201314 academic year, Queens joined the [[South Atlantic Conference]] along with fellow Conference Carolinas member, Coker College to become the SAC's 11th and 12th members.\n\nCurrently, the Royals are home to two (2016, 9th and 2017 5th) top 10 Learfield Cup finishes as one of the top athletic departments in the country.
