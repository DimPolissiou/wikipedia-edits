One hails from a small town in Punjab while the other is an NRI who has been brought up across the seven seas. The story takes many turns, romantic, emotional, dramatic and purely funny when the two girls start living under the same roof.\n\nAbhay is the son of Ranveer (the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Singh, manipulative and coldhearted) and Rama (humble and respectful of her elders, fears her husband), he returns home for his grandparents's anniversary, after being in the US. His father makes a surprise announcement that, Abhay will marry his friend's daughter, Lajwanti (Lamita). However, Abhay has already fallen in love with his then girlfriend and now wife, Lisa. Abhay and Lisa eventually marry, causing Abhay to be disowned by his own father.\n\nUday is the son of Ranjeet (the youngest son of Mr. and Mrs. Singh, Ranveer's brother. Often disrespected by his wife and brother) and Rekha (malicious and takes pleasure in destroying the happiness of her family), he decides to marry Lajwanti (Lamita) at Rekha's dismay, to bring peace in the family. With so many failed attempts to stop the wedding, Uday and Lajwanti (Lamita) get married after her father undergoes a heart attack. Rekha refuses to accept Lajwanti (Lamita) as Uday's wife, unless Ranveer accepts Lisa. Ranveer reluctantly brings Abhay and Lisa home to Rekha's surprise.\n\nThe two daughters-in-law are given a warm welcome in the Singh Family. Rekha vows to get rid of Lajwanti (Lamita) and Ranveer has the same motives with Lisa. Rekha and Ranveer go head to head trying to stop each other from each of their motives.\n\nLisa (a very beautiful, intelligent, modern girl, respectful, yet sassy) and Lajwanti [Lamita] (illiterate, cultured village girl, humble and respectful) are two different girls, who develop a very powerful, strong and unbreakable bond much to Ranveer and Rekha's surprise and dismay. Rekha tries to break Lisa and Lajwanti's relationship, but to no avail. Lisa becomes aware of Rekha's plans to get rid of Lajwanti and does everything to stop her. Rekha then decides to get rid of Lisa by bringing Lisa's old friend Vikrant to live with them. Vikrant causes many problems in Lisa's marriage, the final straw was when Vikrant at Rekha's orders made Lisa sign Uma (Abhay's little sister)'s abortion papers as hers, with Vikrant as the father. Lisa is thrown out of the house.\n\nWith Lisa gone, Lajwanti faces many difficulties alone. Rekha causes many problems for her as well, including getting her (Rekha) sister Jax to poison Ranveer and Lajwanti is falsely accused. Lajwanti too is thrown out of the house.\n\nWith help of a woman named Saraswati, Lisa and Lajwanti fight for their place in the Singh family.

One hails from a small town in Punjab while the other is an NRI who has been brought up across the seven seas. The story takes many turns, romantic, emotional, dramatic and purely funny when the two girls start living under the same roof.\n\nAbhay is the son of Ranveer (the eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. Singh, manipulative and coldhearted) and Rama (humble and respectful of her elders, fears her husband), he returns home for his grandparents's anniversary, after being in the US. His father makes a surprise announcement that, Abhay will marry his friend's daughter, Lajwanti(Lamita). However, Abhay has already fallen in love with his then girlfriend and now wife, Lisa. Abhay and Lisa eventually get married, causing Abhay to be disowned by his own father.\n\nUday is the son of Ranjeet (the youngest son of Mr. and Mrs. Singh, Ranveer's brother. Often disrespected by his wife and brother) and Rekha (malicious and takes pleasure in destroying the happiness of her family), he decides to marry Lajwanti (Lamita) at Rekha's dismay, to bring peace in the family. With so many failed attempts to stop the wedding, Uday and Lajwanti (Lamita) get married after her father undergoes a heart attack. Rekha refuses to accept Lajwanti (Lamita) as Uday's wife, unless Ranveer accepts Lisa. Ranveer reluctantly brings Abhay and Lisa home to Rekha's surprise.\n\nThe two daughters-in-law are given a warm welcome in the Singh Family. Rekha vows to get rid of Lajwanti (Lamita) and Ranveer has the same motives with Lisa. Rekha and Ranveer go head to head trying to stop each other from each of their motives.\n\nLisa (a very beautiful, intelligent, modern girl, respectful, yet sassy) and Lajwanti [Lamita] (illiterate, cultured village girl, humble and respectful) are two different girls, who develop a very powerful, strong and unbreakable bond much to Ranveer and Rekha's surprise and dismay. Rekha tries to break Lisa and Lajwanti's relationship, but to no avail. Lisa becomes aware of Rekha's plans to get rid of Lajwanti and does everything to stop her. Rekha then decides to get rid of Lisa by bringing Lisa's old friend Vikrant to live with them. Vikrant causes many problems in Lisa's marriage, the final straw was when Vikrant at Rekha's orders made Lisa sign Uma (Abhay's little sister)'s abortion papers as hers, with Vikrant as the father. Lisa is thrown out of the house.\n\nWith Lisa gone, Lajwanti faces many difficulties alone. Rekha causes many problems for her as well, including getting her (Rekha) sister Jax to poison Ranveer and Lajwanti is falsely accused. Lajwanti too is thrown out of the house.\n\nWith help of a woman named Saraswati, Lisa and Lajwanti fight for their place in the Singh family. With so many failed attempts to expose Rekha, Lisa manages to gather enough evidence against Aunt Rekha. The truth eventually comes to light during Puja ceremony, after Lisa took a gunshot ordered by Rekha for Lajwanti.

The greatest isometric active tension is developed when a muscle is at its optimal length. In most relaxed skeletal muscle fibers, passive elastic properties maintain the muscle fibers length near optimal, as determined usually by the fixed distance between the attachment points of tendons to the bones (or the exoskeleton of arthropods) at either end of the muscle. In contrast, the relaxed sarcomere length of cardiac muscle cells, in a resting ventricle, is lower than the optimal length for contraction.<ref name=\":0\" /> There is no bone to fix sarcomere length in the heart (of any animal) so sarcomere length is very variable and depends directly upon blood filling and thereby expanding the heart chambers. In the human heart, maximal force is generated with an initial sarcomere length of 2.2 micrometers, a length which is rarely exceeded in a normal heart. Initial lengths larger or smaller than this optimal value will decrease the force the muscle can achieve. For longer sarcomere lengths, this is the result of there being less overlap of the thin and thick filaments;<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huxley|first=H.|last2=Hanson|first2=J.|date=1954-05-22|title=Changes in the cross-striations of muscle during contraction and stretch and their structural interpretation|journal=Nature|volume=173|issue=4412|pages=973\u2013976|issn=0028-0836|pmid=13165698|doi=10.1038/173973a0}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Huxley|first=A.

Is happening and will continue to be.\n\nHe is also known by many other names like Sultan (Raja), Lakhdata (Giver of Lakhs), Lalanwala, Rubies (Gem ie Diamonds), Nigahiah Peer (Saint of Nigha) and Rohiwala (Owner of forests). Your disciples are known as Sultans or Servi\u0a0fs, allies.\n\n\nBirth\n\nSakhi server, the great Sufi saint was born in the 12th century. His father's name is Abdul Zain-ul-Abidin and his mother's name is Ayesha. Sakhi had a brother of Sarwar Ji, whose name is Khan Dhodha.\n\nLife\n\nWhen the father of Sakhi Sarwar left Baghdad Sharif, according to the message of Hazrat Muhammad Sahib with his wife Aesha and in 1126, he came to Shahkot near Multan in India. Shortly afterwards, Bibi Amina died and again Shahkot Pir Peer Arrihan Johor was born in Brihad with Bibi Ayesha in 520 AH, and mother Aisha was born 1130 A.D Sa'id Ahmad. Two years later, Abdul Ghani Khan Khoda was born. The whole family worked as a farmer in Shahkot. Sufiana heard the colors as well as the people of the time.\nHe used to serve Hazrat Muhammad Sahib acorss the globe and get three powers - Qadri Gonsal-e-Azam Abdul Qader Zilani Baghdad Sharif Farrana-e-Qadri, Silasila-e-Chishti Yuza-Mudhain Chaudhay Chhatiyah Chaudhry Chahajdhay Chahajid Shahayyah Azad. Even though he had learned from all three beans, he was the master of two worlds.\n\nPlace (sights)\n\nThe Shrine is located in the Dhunkal built  by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and in the whole of Sarwar Sarwar city the Saint chose the Nighaha town as his home. Due to the enemy's geographical and weather conditions, it is known as the 'last place'. For the first time, the existence of Lakhpatrai and Jaspat Rai Diwan was made his shrine in Sakhi Sarwar Town by the king, and other articles related to this will be preparing by Sarvari or Sakhi Malang Jaskaran and Baba Vishal Chand as soon as possible. According to H. Rose (1970), the buildings of this place correspond to the tomb of Sakhi Sarwar in the west and a place belonging to Guru Nanak Dev Ji in the north-west. There is an apartment on the east, there is a Thakurdwara, and another apartment has a picture of Bhairon.\n\nSurrounding this place are Sakhi Sarwar, your wife, also known as Bibi Bai, at their place on the west side of the courtyard are two dead trees inside the wall which are said to have risen from the coin which was a saint's horse. Cucumber heads and heels were used for ropes.\n\n\nOther places\n\nThe shrine is located at Daunkal in Wazirabad district and also in Peshawar and Lahore. In addition to this historical facts are found in India, Baghdad, Pakistan and other Middle Ages.\n\nThere are many places of worship in Indian Punjab where they are known as 'eyes'. In some places, the worship of the Sakhi server along with the Guga is worshiped and their common places, as well as other deities, are called five pir or eyes.\n\nBaba Lakhdata Ji's place in district Una in Himachal Pradesh is called a small watch, where a big fair is held every year.\n\n\nWorship, worship\n\nYour followers, known at the Pir's place at Nighaha, are known as Nirgahia and Servaria, who call each other salient. Boards of people who serve as professional guides and priests at local shrines are called pirmanas. Members of a choir called each other Piribhai and Piribhin (brother or sister respectively).\n\nTheir stop points on the routes are known as the outposts (where the pilgrims traditionally sleep on the ground). Pilgrims unable to travel to Nigah will attend at least one outpost. If they could not, they went to another village on the way for a night. Those who could not go anywhere slept on the ground for at least one night a year.

The school is located at the center of the city. In front of Mituo Mountain and near [[West Lake]], the school is energized by the atmosphere of Baochu Mountain and Baopu Monastery, as well as the luxurious shopping of Yan'an Road and Wulinmen. The building area is about thirty thousand square meters. Although its history goes back more than 100 years, it is not the oldest school in Hangzhou. Its objective is to make the campus modern and luxurious. Hangzhou Senior Middle School and [[Hangzhou No. 2 High School]] were founded in 1899, making them older than Hangzhou No. 14. Hangzhou Xuejun High School was set up in 1956 and Hangzhou Zhongce Vocational School in 1979.\n\nIn the 30th year of Emperor Guangxu\u2019s reign, a group of students including Shao Zhang (\u7ecd\u5f20), Sun Zhimin and Hu Huan came back to Hangzhou after graduating in Japan, and applied to establish \u201cHangzhou Girls\u2019 School\u201d, and wished this school to become the first girls\u2019 school in China.\n\nThe application was approved, and the school opened on May 2, 1904. Lady Gu Wenyu was the first principal, and there were 45 girls at that time.\n\nSome years later, the school moved the place from Jishan Square to its current location on Fengqi Road. The street was originally called \u201cCopper Money\u201d in Chinese, but has since changed to \u201cPhoenix Rising.\u201d\n\nNo.14 Secondary School went through the Second Sino-Japanese War, adding to the interesting history of the school. In November 1937, the Japanese landed in Hangzhou Bay, and the students were forced to move from its Fengqi Road location to the rural city of Tonglu. A month later, they moved again, this time to Chunan, and used some parts of the Chunan County Middle School. Unfortunately, sinking into Thousand Island Lake in 1959, the old Chunan County Middle School was buried along with the capital city of the Southern Song Dynasty forever. Although the Japanese came, then left, then came again, then left again, the cultural spirit of the Girls\u2019 School remained. In 1937, teacher Zhen Jisu and another five teachers moved to Shanghai, where they established the Shanghai Municipal Hangzhou Girls' School on Changde Road, Shanghai. The next year, on Jiaozhou Road, the school formally became Shanghai Private Nanping Girls' School. Shanghai is not a quiet place, however, so in the spring of 1941, the school returned to Hangzhou, this time to Xinmin Road, and began the term on November 1 using the Tongjiangqiao Middle School\u2019s campus. In the spring of 1949, the school moved back to Fengqi Road, this time permanently, and in 1956, changed its name to Hangzhou Girls' High School.\nThe first headmaster of this school was Gu Wenyu, but now a new leader, Qiu Feng holds this title.\nAnother campus of No.14 Secondary School is located at 500,Long Teng Road,Hangzhou. It has a 400-meter runway, a rich collection of books, and excellent teaching facilities.\nHang Zhou No.14 high school is the first high school that opened a climbing course to students in Hangzhou.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hz.zhongkao.com/e/20131024/526896365ae1f.shtml |title=\u676d\u5dde\u7b2c\u5341\u56db\u4e2d\u5b66\u5f00\u8bbe\u6500\u5ca9\u8bfe |date=2013-10-24 <!-- 11:38:30  --> |publisher= E\u5ea6\u6559\u80b2|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nNo.14 second's students are top students of Hangzhou.

The school is located at the center of the city. In front of MItuo Mountain and beside [[West Lake]], the school is energized by the atmosphere of Baochu Mountain and Baopu Monastery, as well as the luxurious shopping of Yan'an Road and Wulinmen. The entire proportion is about fifty thousand square meters and the building area is about thirty thousand square meters. Although its history goes back more than 100 years, it is not the oldest school in Hangzhou. And its target is to make the campus modern, luxurious and delicate. There are Hangzhou Senior Middle School and [[Hangzhou No. 2 High School]] which were founded in 1899. On the other hand, Hangzhou Xuejun high School was set up in 1956 and Hangzhou Zhongce Vocational School in 1979.\n\nIn the 30th year of Emperor Guangxu\u2019s reign, a group of students including Shao Zhang(\u7ecd\u5f20), Sun Zhimin and Hu Huan came back to Hangzhou after graduating in Japan, and applied to establish \u201cHangzhou Girls\u2019 School\u201d, and wished this school to become the first girls\u2019 school in China.\n\nThe application was approved, and the school opened on May 2, 1904. Lady Gu Wenyu was the first principal, and there were 45 girls at that time.\n\nSome years later, the school moved the place from Jishan Square to its current location on Fengqi Road. The street was originally called \u201cCopper Money\u201d in Chinese, but has since changed to \u201cPhoenix Rising.\u201d\n\nNo.14 Secondary School went through the Second Sino-Japanese War, adding to the interesting history of the school. In November 1937, the Japanese landed in Hangzhou Bay, and the students were forced to move from its Fengqi Road location to the rural city of Tonglu. A month later, they moved again, this time to Chunan, and used some parts of the Chunan County Middle School. Unfortunately, sinking into Thousand Island Lake in 1959, the old Chunan County Middle School was buried along with the capital city of the Southern Song Dynasty forever. Although the Japanese came, then left, then came again, then left again, the cultural spirit of the Girls\u2019 School remained. In 1937, teacher Zhen Jisu and another five teachers moved to Shanghai, where they established the Shanghai Municipal Hangzhou Girls' School on Changde Road, Shanghai. The next year, on Jiaozhou Road, the school formally became Shanghai Private Nanping Girls' School. Shanghai is not a quiet place, however, so in the spring of 1941, the school returned to Hangzhou, this time to Xinmin Road, and began the term on November 1 using the Tongjiangqiao Middle School\u2019s campus. In the spring of 1949, the school moved back to Fengqi Road, this time permanently, and in 1956, changed its name to Hangzhou Girls' High School.\nThe first headmaster of this school was Gu Wenyu, but now a new leader, Qiu Feng holds this title.\nAnother campus of No.14 Secondary School is located at 500,Long Teng Road,Hangzhou. It has a 400-meter runway, a rich collection of books, and excellent teaching facilities.\nHang Zhou No.14 high school is the first high school that opened a climbing course to students in Hangzhou.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hz.zhongkao.com/e/20131024/526896365ae1f.shtml |title=\u676d\u5dde\u7b2c\u5341\u56db\u4e2d\u5b66\u5f00\u8bbe\u6500\u5ca9\u8bfe |date=2013-10-24 <!-- 11:38:30  --> |publisher= E\u5ea6\u6559\u80b2|accessdate=2014-01-01}}</ref>\n\n==Honors==\nNo.14 second's students are top students of Hangzhou.

Due to the 16-bit-wide data bus and more efficient instruction decoding of the 80186, the Tandy 2000 ran significantly faster than other PC compatibles, and slightly faster than the PC AT. (Later IBM upgraded the 80286 in new PC AT models to 8&nbsp;MHz, though with [[wait state]]s.) The Tandy 2000 was the company's first computer built around an Intel x86 series microprocessor; previous models used the Z80 and 68000 CPUs.\n\nWhile touted as being compatible with the [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM XT]], the Tandy 2000 was different enough that most existing PC software that was not purely text-oriented failed to work properly.\n\nThe Tandy 2000 and its special version of MS-DOS supported up to 768 KB of RAM, significantly more than the 640 KB limit imposed by the IBM architecture. It used 80-track double-sided \"quad-density\"<ref group=\"note\">Quad density refers to a disk format having double-density sectors (MFM encoding) and 96 tracks-per-inch track density</ref> floppy drives of 720 KB capacity; the IBM standard at the time of the introduction of the Tandy 2000 was only 360 KB.\n\nThe Tandy 2000 had both \"Tandy\" and \"TRS-80\" logos on its case, marking the start of the phaseout of the \"TRS-80\" brand.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tandy 2000 Ad, BYTE, July 1984.png|thumb|Ad in ''[[Byte (magazine)|Byte]]'' magazine, July 1984, co-marketing [[MAI/Basic Four]] software]]\nThe introduction of [[IBM]]'s Model 5150 [[IBM PC|Personal Computer]] in August 1981 created an entirely new market for microcomputers. Many hardware and software companies were founded specifically to exploit IBM's and [[Microsoft]]'s new presence as a standard-setter for small computers, and most other established manufacturers shifted focus to it as well.\n\nBy this date Tandy/Radio Shack had been in the small-computer market for four years, since its August 1977 introduction of the [[TRS-80 Model I]].<ref name=\"white198708\">{{Cite magazine |last=White |first=Ron |date=August 1987 |title=The Tandy Story: 10 years after the TRS-80 Model I |url=https://www.vintageisthenewold.com/the-story-of-tandy-10-years-after-the-trs-80-model-1/ |magazine=80 Micro |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> The new computer division followed in October 1979 with the [[TRS-80 Model II]]\u2014a high-end business-oriented system.<ref group=\"note\">The TRS-80 Model II used a 4 Mhz Z-80, 64 KB RAM, 8-inch floppy drives, and an expanded professional keyboard and screen.</ref> In 1983 the [[TRS-80 Model 4]] succeeded the Model III (which itself had replaced the Model I) in the consumer and educational markets. In the business segment the [[TRS-80 Model 12]] and [[TRS-80 Model 16|Model 16]] succeeded the Model II, adding higher-end features.<ref group=\"note\">These higher-end features included hard drives, interoffice networking, specialized software for accounting, legal, and medical practices, and the [[Motorola 68000]] CPU running [[Xenix]] OS.</ref> Thus far Tandy/Radio Shack's computer lines occupied their own niches in the market because of their proprietary system software and applications.<ref group=\"note\">Like the CP/M and Apple niche markets.</ref> Tandy attempted to monopolize software and peripheral sales by not offering third-party products in company stores.{{r|white198708}} Until the IBM PC was introduced the nearest thing to an industry standard in small computers was CP/M-80;<ref group=\"note\">CP/M was the common OS for most all business-oriented 8080/Z80 computers, though lacking a common disk format for 5.25 inch floppy drives</ref> no single manufacturer dominated.\n\nBy 1983 the IBM PC, and Tandy's discouraging of third-party products, had halved the company's market share and stopped profit growth.{{r|white198708}} Tandy's motive for moving into the new [[MS-DOS]] domain was twofold: to capitalize on the new market and to leverage sales opportunities afforded by their solid position in small computers. Marketing management believed that many Tandy customers would prefer to stay with Tandy products when (inevitably, it seemed) they made the jump onto the burgeoning IBM/Microsoft bandwagon; it was figured that the company was well-positioned in this regard because of its large base of customers in both the consumer and business markets (with its Z80-based TRS-80 Models I/III/4 and 68000-based Models 12 and 16, respectively). Tandy's large presence as a computer retailer, with several thousand [[Radio Shack]] stores throughout the US, was deemed an advantage as well. All other PC manufacturers, especially IBM, relied mainly on sales to corporate accounts, not consumer retail as did Tandy/Radio Shack. Thus the company would become the market leader offering the hottest new trend\u2014affordable 16-bit<ref group=\"note\">The 8088 offers 16-bit registers and operations but its 8-bit external bus hampered speed of execution for most processing tasks. A fast 8-bit CPU could outperform it. Also touted was its ability to address more than 64 KB RAM but this was accomplished only with a segmented architecture that greatly complicated programming and was not much better than an 8-bit CPU with bank-switched RAM (indeed, 8088 segment registers perform as a type of internal bank-switching).</ref> computers running MS-DOS\u2014directly to the computing public.\n\nTherefore, Tandy would have to produce an IBM-style computer running the now industry-standard MS-DOS. The company decided to distinguish it from similar products by producing a better computer.{{r|white198708}} The new machine would be aimed at the mid-price market between high-end consumers and low-end businesses. This was deemed prudent in order not to seriously cannibalize their current product lines serving both market segments. Most other big-name computer manufacturers made the same leap into the PC/MS-DOS market:\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|- align=\"center\"\n! colspan=4 style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | First-generation PC workalikes by IBM competitors<ref group=\"note\">The [[Epson QX-16]] deserves inclusion but technical data for it is too scant at this time</ref>\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Computer name\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Manufacturer\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Date introduced\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | CPU\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | clock rate\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Max RAM\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Floppy disk capacity\n! style=\"background: #CCCCCC;\" | Notable features\n|-\n| [[Olivetti&nbsp;M24]]/[[AT&T&nbsp;6300]]\n| [[Olivetti]], marketed by [[AT&T]]\n| 1983 (AT&T&nbsp;6300 June&nbsp;1984)\n| 8086\n| 8&nbsp;MHz (later 10&nbsp;MHz)\n| 640 KB\n| 360 KB (later 720&nbsp;KB)\n| true IBM compatible; optional 640x400 color graphics\n|-\n| [[Zenith Z-100]]\n| [[Zenith Data Systems]]\n| June 1982\n| 8088\n| 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n| 768 KB\n| 360 KB\n| optional 8 color 640x255 graphics, external 8\" floppy drives\n|-\n| [[HP-150]]\n| [[Hewlett-Packard]]\n| Nov 1983\n| 8088\n| 8&nbsp;MHz\n| 640 KB\n| 270 KB (later 710&nbsp;KB)\n| primitive touchscreen\n|-\n| [[Compaq Portable]]\n| [[Compaq]]\n| Jan 1983\n| 8088\n| 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n| 640 KB\n| 360 KB\n| true IBM compatible\n|-\n| [[Compaq Deskpro]]\n| [[Compaq]]\n| 1984\n| 8086\n| 8&nbsp;MHz\n| 640 KB\n| 360 KB\n| true IBM compatible\n|-\n| MPC 1600\n| [[Columbia Data Products]]\n| June 1982\n| 8088\n| 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n| 640 KB\n| 360 KB\n| true IBM compatible, credited as first PC&nbsp;clone\n|-\n| Eagle PC / 1600 series\n| [[Eagle Computer]]\n| 1982\n| 8086\n| 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n| 640 KB\n| 360 KB \n| 750\u00d7352 mono graphics\n|-\n| [[Texas Instruments Professional Computer|TI Professional Computer]]\n| [[Texas Instruments]]\n| Jan 1983\n| 8088\n| 5&nbsp;MHz\n| 256 KB\n| 320 KB\n| 720x300 color graphics\n|-\n| [[DEC Rainbow]]\n| [[Digital Equipment Corporation]]\n| 1982\n| 8088\n| 4.81&nbsp;MHz\n| 768 KB\n| 400 KB\n| 132x24 text mode, 8088 and [[Z80]] CPUs\n|-\n| Wang PC\n| [[Wang Laboratories]]\n| Aug 1985\n| 8086\n| 8&nbsp;MHz\n| 512 KB\n| 360 KB\n| 800x300 mono graphics\n|-\n| [[MBC-550]]\n| [[Sanyo]]\n| 1982\n| 8088\n| 3.6&nbsp;MHz\n| 256 KB\n| 360 KB (later 720&nbsp;KB)\n| 640x200 8 color graphics (R, G, B bitplanes)\n|-\n| [[Apricot PC]]\n| [[Apricot Computers]]\n| late 1983\n| 8086\n| 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n| 768 KB\n| 720 KB\n| 800x400 mono graphics, 132x50 text mode\n|-\n| TS-1603\n| [[Televideo]]\n| Apr 1983\n| 8088\n| 4.77&nbsp;MHz\n| 256 KB\n| 737 KB\n| keyboard had palm rests, 16 function keys; built-in modem\n|-\n| '''Tandy 2000'''\n| [[Tandy Corporation]]\n| Sept 1983\n| 80186\n| 8&nbsp;MHz\n| 768 KB\n| 720 KB\n| redefinable character set, optional 640x400 8-color or mono graphics\n|}\n\nApplications software compatible with the MS-DOS operating system would run properly on the Tandy 2000. This means that the software had to access the computer's hardware (particularly the video display) strictly through calls to the operating system's [[BIOS]]. However, programs written to run under the similar [[PC DOS]] operating system on an actual [[IBM PC]] computer often bypassed calls to the operating system because the IBM BIOS was poorly designed and implemented. To function with adequate speed of execution, and to perform operations not provided for by the IBM BIOS, applications programmers often coded their programs to directly address the hardware of the IBM PC. Therefore any computer such as the Tandy 2000 that had hardware that differed in its details from an IBM PC would not execute programs the same way, which most often manifested incorrect results by those programs.\n\nTandy engineers tested one hundred of the most popular PC programs and half were found to be incompatible with the 2000's hardware.<ref group=\"note\">One was the bestselling Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet/database, but Lotus programmers were so excited by the new computer's ultrafast performance that they agreed to adapt it for the 2000.</ref> Tandy's marketing department failed to appreciate that similar non-compatible computers from DEC, TI and Eagle were not successful.{{r|white198708}} Its strategy of offering a high-performance PC was the origin of the Tandy 2000's technical specifications. Some of the rival computers improved the PC hardware and matched the Tandy 2000 in one or two dimensions, but none offered across-the-board enhancement. Except as noted, they ran MS-DOS but were incompatible with the IBM PC at the hardware level.

However, most DOS software of the time bypassed the operating system and BIOS and directly accessed the hardware (especially video and external ports) to achieve higher performance, rendering such software incompatible with the Tandy 2000.\n\n=== Graphics ===\nThe base-model Tandy 2000 supported only a text-mode display in monochrome. The Tandy VM-1 monitor used the 8-pin video port on the computer's rear panel. The text-mode address space was in a different location but third-party memory-resident software hacks remedied this by copying the PC-compatible text-mode memory to the Tandy 2000's text space at a rate of 5\u201310 times per second. This sometimes caused some choppiness in the display. It produced a fast text display rate\u2014often too fast to read\u2014but the 'HOLD' key on the keyboard could be used to pause text output.\n\nThe bit pattern for each text character's raster image was maintained in RAM and could be modified by the user. With clever programming the display's ability to present fine lines provided by the 640x400 screen resolution could be accessed in text mode even without the optional graphics board.\n\nThe display was upgradable to support pixel-addressable graphics via the Tandy 2000 Graphics Adapter, a circuit board that fit into an expansion slot. It had its own connector for the monochrome VM-1 monitor; the video connector in the rear-panel cabinet was disabled when this expansion board was installed. The graphics resolution was 640x400 and supported high intensity pixels.\n\nColor capability was provided by the Color Graphics Option, which was a set of chips that were inserted into the empty sockets on the monochrome Graphics Adapter provided for this purpose.<ref group=\"note\">The Color chipset comprises 16 readily-available chips: eight 4416-15 DRAMs, four 74F245s, and four 25LS22 chips. A trace cut on the graphics board was also required.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Model 2000 Color Graphics Option Kit Installation Instructions|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Tandy/Tandy%202000%20Color%20Chip%20Kit%20Install%20Manual.pdf|website=ClassicCMP|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> Resolution for the color board was the same 640x400, non-interlaced, and eight colors out of a palette of sixteen available colors were displayable on the Tandy CM-1 monitor (~$799). This was a particularly high-resolution and colorful display for its day. The CM-1 accepted, as input from the color graphics board, digital RGBI signals (indicating separate Red, Green, and Blue signals with an Intensity bit). CGA compatibility was hit-or-miss.\n\nThere were only three non-Tandy monitors that worked with the Tandy 2000 graphics card, all of which are long out of production. These were the original (1986\u201388) Mitsubishi Diamond Scan, and the Nippon Electronics Corporation (NEC) Multisync and Multisync GS (grayscale).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 2000 FAQ|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/docs/t2kfaq.txt|website=Classiccmp.org|publisher=Classic Computer, Jeff Hellige|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> The required horizontal scan frequency for the Tandy 2000 is 26.4&nbsp;kHz. Modern flat-screen multisync computer monitors cannot sync at frequencies below 30&nbsp;kHz. The CM-1 monitor is also digital RGB; all modern CRT monitors are analog-only.\n\n=== Media ===\nThe Tandy 2000 used quad-density 5.25\" floppy disks formatted at 720k. This format (80-track disks at the double-density bitrate) was not used by PC-compatibles, although some CP/M machines and the [[Commodore 8050]]/8250 drives had them. Normal PCs of the time had 40-track double-density floppy drives and could not read quad-density due to the drive heads being too wide to read the narrower tracks. 1.2MB 5.25\" drives (introduced on the IBM AT) could read quad-density disks as they were 80-track and had thinner heads. Various utility programs for DOS existed that allowed nonstandard formats, such as the Tandy 2000's disks, to be read. Much like 1.2MB drives, the Tandy 2000 had problems reliably writing 360k PC disks due to the smaller heads not completely erasing the tracks and causing 40-track drives to become confused by residual magnetic signals on the outer edge of the track. Tandy distributed the computer with a utility called PC-Maker that would read and format 40-track disks in the 2000s 80-track drives, and were readable in drives on ordinary PCs.\n\nThe floppy controller on the Tandy 2000 will accept 3.5\" low-density 720 KB floppy drives.\n\nAs of May 2019, there is an abandonware site (winworldpc.com) that has available for download a disk image for the latest version of MS-DOS for the Tandy 2000. It includes instructions for using the IBM 1.2MB 5.25-inch disk drive (80-track) to create a system disk bootable in the Tandy 2000 5.25-inch drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft MS-DOS 2.11 [Tandy 2000 OEM] (02.02.00) (5.25-DSQD 720k)|url=https://winworldpc.com/download/40e280b9-7b22-18c3-9a11-c3a4e284a2ef|website=WinWorld|publisher=WinWorld|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> This procedure can also be used to create a bootable 3.5-inch system disk using an ordinary 720KB 3.5-inch PC drive; this will boot a Tandy 2000 if its 5.25-inch boot drive is replaced with a low-density 720 KB 3.5 inch PC drive.\n\n=== Keyboard ===\nThe keyboard was an entirely new design made expressly for the Tandy 2000. It would later be the same keyboard shipped with the [[Tandy 1000]] and its successors.\n\nThe arrangement of the function keys was changed from that of the IBM PC/XT, which had ten on the left hand side of the keyboard in two columns of five. Tandy was among the first PC manufacturers to change this to the modern arrangement of twelve function keys arranged horizontally across the top. IBM gave a nod to the new standard by making this its arrangement for the PC-AT keyboard.\n\n=== Serial port ===\nThe serial port hardware was completely different from the PC/XT's.  PC-compatible terminal emulation software had to either maintain strict BIOS usage of the serial hardware, or else use a [[FOSSIL]] driver, a software wrapper that virtualized the serial hardware (see also [[DEC Rainbow]]), allowing the terminal software to work on a wider variety of hardware.\n\nSeveral terminal programs were available for the Tandy 2000, making it possible to log on to [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]'s, e-mail, and other remote systems.\n\n=== Operating system ===\nThe Tandy 2000 required a specific version of [[MS-DOS]] that would run only on this machine.  Standard MS-DOS or [[PC DOS]] (for generic IBM-compatibles) would not run on a Tandy 2000.  It was standard practice and Microsoft's expectation at the time that a customized version of MS-DOS would be prepared for each different machine, with I/O drivers designed for the hardware of that model.  The highest version of DOS that Tandy Corporation released for the Tandy 2000 was 2.11.03, with a few minor third-party patches after the fact.  A modified version of [[Windows 1.0]] was able to run on the Tandy 2000.\n\nMS-DOS for the Tandy 2000 resided entirely in RAM, unlike the IBM PCs which contained the BIOS portion of the OS in ROM. The complete MS-DOS system (BIOS and BDOS) occupied about 53 KB of RAM.<ref>{{cite web|title=Byte review of Tandy 2000|url=http://tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/acrobat/8412-b.pdf|website=tech-insider dot org|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}</ref> This means that the RAM required to run applications on the Tandy 2000 was a little greater. However, the Tandy 2000 fared better in comparison to the later IBM PC-AT in that the AT was required to run MS-DOS version 3.x in order to operate its 1.2 MB floppy drives and hard drive. Version 3 of MS-DOS was rather larger than Version 2.x running on the Tandy 2000. It also proved advantageous that the Tandy 2000's OS resided entirely in RAM and therefore could be updated and hacked with rather less effort.\n\nThe Microsoft BASIC interpreter was supplied with the computer. It was highly customized for the Tandy 2000 hardware, particularly its high-resolution color graphics. Although IBM produced the Enhanced Graphics Adapter a little more than a year later (October 1984), the Microsoft BASIC interpreter would not support its greater color and resolution capabilities until 1988.\n\nTandy/Radio Shack produced print advertising featuring [[Bill Gates]] of Microsoft extolling the superior performance of the Tandy 2000 and how it was advantageous in Microsoft's development of Windows 1.0.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack print ad with Bill Gates and Tandy 2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=bill%20gates%20tandy%202000&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|website=Google books|accessdate=May 23, 2016|date = 1984-11-05}}</ref>\n\n== Software ==\nSoftware packages that were released for the Tandy 2000 included [[WordPerfect]] 4.2 (WP5.1 could work with software patches), [[Lotus 1-2-3]], Ashton-Tate's [[Framework (office suite)|Framework]], [[DBase]], [[MultiMate]], [[Pfs:Write]], [[AutoCAD]], Lumena (from Time Arts) [[shareware]] office programs, and the complete line of Microsoft language products. Microsoft released a version of [[Xenix]] for the Tandy 2000 (used with Western Digital's ViaNet network card, distributed by Tandy).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nBetter BASIC for both the Tandy 2000 and the PC was used to write BBS software for the Tandy 2000 and later ported to the IBM PC.\nRadio Shack's [[Deskmate]] was also used with the Tandy 2000 and the Tandy 1000.\n\nMicroPro's [[Wordstar]] (versions 3.3 and 4.0 only) would run on the Tandy 2000 provided the user ran the WINSTALL installation utility and, when prompted for the type of video display to be used, selected \"ROM BIOS\". While this would result in a functional installation, none of the T2000's special features would be operative (except for increased speed).<ref>{{cite book|title=Wordstar 4.0 User Manual|date=1987|publisher=MicroPro|page=xx}}</ref>\n\nThe only version of Lotus 1-2-3 offered for the Tandy 2000 was Release 1A. This was customized to take advantage of the unique hardware of the computer, including its full 768K of RAM, high resolution color graphics, and two extra function keys.\n\nRelease 1A's executable code was about 60 KB smaller than the later Release 2, which provided greater macro programming facilities. This extra space for data, with the additional 128 KB of RAM available to a fully expanded Tandy 2000, made it possible to construct larger worksheets than later PCs running Release 2 (until the advent of machines with [[Expanded memory]]). For nearly two years following its introduction, the Tandy 2000 was the top performer for processing large models in Lotus 1-2-3.\n\nThe Tandy 2000's 720 KB floppy drives were a distinct advantage for running Lotus, because they were large enough to store even the largest worksheets on a single diskette. This is in stark contrast to the IBM PC and XT with 360 KB floppy disks. In order to store his largest worksheets, a PC user would have to split them and save them on two disks\u2014and then he'd have to recombine them in memory later. Although the XT had a hard drive that could store large Lotus worksheets in a single file, the user could not rely on a single storage device for permanent storage of important data files; again he'd be forced to segment worksheets for storage on separate disks. The Tandy 2000's large-capacity floppy disks made backup maintenance relatively effortless.\n\n== End of life ==\nAfter Tandy dropped support of the Tandy 2000, a group of users formed the Tandy 2000 Orphans, with software reviews, software and hardware hacks, and a shareware/freeware repository.  It was discovered by amateur programmers that many commercial MS-DOS applications needed only minor modifications to function on the Tandy 2000's unique hardware.\n\nThere was also a [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] based in Texas that had an extensive library of compatible software available for download; neither the BBS nor its web-based descendant is active today.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Tandy 1000]]\n* [[Mindset (computer)]], another PC compatible with enhanced graphics using the 80186\n\n==Note==\n{{reflist|group=note|liststyle=lower-roman}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=1219 Old Computers museum Web site]\n* [http://cchaven.com/t2kfaq.txt FAQ @ CCHAVEN.COM]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=oC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&ots=fTkwI2v2um&dq=bill%20gates%20tandy%202000&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false Tandy 2000 advertisement] featuring Bill Gates, ''InfoWorld'', Nov 5, 1984\n* [http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Tandy/Tandy%202000%20Programmer's%20Reference.pdf Tandy 2000 Programmers Reference PDF ]\n* [http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Tandy/Tandy%202000%20Technical%20Reference.pdf Tandy 2000 Technical Reference Manual PDF ]\n* [https://winworldpc.com/download/40e280b9-7b22-18c3-9a11-c3a4e284a2ef WinWorldPC.com page] - download for Tandy version of MS-DOS 2.11, 5.25-DSQD 720 KB\n* [http://lowendmac.com/2015/tandys-pc-compatible-computers/ Low End Mac's retrospective] on the Tandy 2000 computer and Tandy 1000 series (Daniel Knight - 2015-12-19)\n\n{{TRS-80 and Tandy computers}}\n\n[[Category:Home computers]]\n[[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]\n[[Category:RadioShack]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox computer\n|Name = Tandy 2000\n|Photo = <!-- Anyone? -->\n|Type = [[Personal computer]]\n|Released = {{Start date and age|1983}}\n|Discontinued = 1988\n|price        = {{nowrap|$2750 (two floppy drives, 128KB RAM)}}, {{nowrap|$4250 (2000HD: one drive, 10 MB hard drive, 256KB RAM)}},<ref>{{cite web|title=first Tandy Model 2000 computer catalog entry 1984 RSC-11|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1984_rsc-11/h004.html|website=radioshackcatalogs dot com|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> {{nowrap|$249 extra for monochrome monitor}}\n|Processor = Intel 80186\n|CPUspeed = 8 MHz\n|Memory = 128&nbsp;[[Kilobyte|KB]] - 768&nbsp;KB (896KB w/mods)\n|Storage = 10&nbsp;[[MB]] hard drive, 1 or 2 720&nbsp;KB 5.25\" floppies\n|OS = [[MS-DOS|MS-DOS 2.11.03]]; [[Xenix]]\n| display      = text 25 rows by 80 columns, {{nowrap|character matrix in RAM is modifiable}}\n| graphics     = optional: monochrome 640 by 400 pixels with intensity bit {{nowrap|or 8 RBG colors with intensity, 640 by 400 pixel}}\n|predecessor = [[TRS-80]] [[Z80]]-based series\n|successor = [[Tandy 1000]] series\n}}\nThe '''Tandy 2000''' is a [[personal computer]] introduced by [[Radio Shack]] in September 1983 based on the 8&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 80186]] [[microprocessor]] running [[MS-DOS]].<ref name=derfler>{{cite news\n  | author = Frank Derfler\n  | title = Tandy 2000: A superior machine and a good value\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wi4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA74&pg=PA71\n  | work = [[InfoWorld]]\n  | publisher = \n  | page = 71\n  | date = 1984-06-18\n  | accessdate = 2016-05-04\n  | quote = \n}}</ref> By comparison, the [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM PC XT]] (introduced in March 1983) used the older 4.77&nbsp;MHz 8088 processor, and the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM PC AT]] (introduced in 1984) would later use the newer 6&nbsp;MHz [[Intel 80286]]. Due to the 16-bit-wide data bus and more efficient instruction decoding of the 80186, the Tandy 2000 ran significantly faster than other PC compatibles, and slightly faster than the PC AT. (Later IBM upgraded the 80286 in new PC AT models to 8&nbsp;MHz, though with [[wait state]]s.) The Tandy 2000 was the company's first computer built around an Intel x86 series microprocessor; previous models used the Z80 and 68000 CPUs.\n\nWhile touted as being compatible with the [[IBM Personal Computer XT|IBM XT]], the Tandy 2000 was different enough that most existing PC software that was not purely text-oriented failed to work properly.\n\nThe Tandy 2000 and its special version of MS-DOS supported up to 768 KB of RAM, significantly more than the 640 KB limit imposed by the IBM architecture.

In the business segment the [[TRS-80 Model 12]] and [[TRS-80 Model 16|Model 16]] succeeded the Model II, adding higher-end features.<ref group=\"note\">These higher-end features included hard drives, interoffice networking, specialized software for accounting, legal, and medical practices, and the [[Motorola 68000]] CPU running [[Xenix]] OS.</ref> Thus far Tandy/Radio Shack's computer lines occupied their own niches in the market because of their proprietary system software and applications.<ref group=\"note\">Like the CP/M and Apple niche markets.</ref> Tandy attempted to monopolize software and peripheral sales by not offering third-party products in company stores.{{r|white198708}} Until the IBM PC was introduced the nearest thing to an industry standard in small computers was CP/M-80;<ref group=\"note\">CP/M was the common OS for most all business-oriented 8080/Z80 computers, though lacking a common disk format for 5.25 inch floppy drives</ref> no single manufacturer dominated.\n\nBy 1983 the IBM PC, and Tandy's discouraging of third-party products, had halved the company's market share and stopped profit growth.{{r|white198708}} Tandy's motive for moving into the new [[MS-DOS]] domain was twofold: to capitalize on the new market and to leverage sales opportunities afforded by their solid position in small computers. Marketing management believed that many Tandy customers would prefer to stay with Tandy products when (inevitably, it seemed) they made the jump onto the burgeoning IBM/Microsoft bandwagon; it was figured that the company was well-positioned in this regard because of its large base of customers in both the consumer and business markets (with its Z80-based TRS-80 Models I/III/4 and 68000-based Models 12 and 16, respectively). Tandy's large presence as a computer retailer, with several thousand [[Radio Shack]] stores throughout the US, was deemed an advantage as well. All other PC manufacturers, especially IBM, relied mainly on sales to corporate accounts, not consumer retail as did Tandy/Radio Shack. Thus the company would become the market leader offering the hottest new trend\u2014affordable 16-bit<ref group=\"note\">The 8088 offers 16-bit registers and operations but its 8-bit external bus hampered speed of execution for most processing tasks. A fast 8-bit CPU could outperform it. Also touted was its ability to address more than 64 KB RAM but this was accomplished only with a segmented architecture that greatly complicated programming and was not much better than an 8-bit CPU with bank-switched RAM (indeed, 8088 segment registers perform as a type of internal bank-switching).</ref> computers running MS-DOS\u2014directly to the computing public.\n\nTherefore, Tandy would have to produce an IBM-style computer running the now industry-standard MS-DOS. The company decided to distinguish it from similar products by producing a better computer.{{r|white198708}} The new machine would be aimed at the mid-price market between high-end consumers and low-end businesses. This was deemed prudent in order not to seriously cannibalize their current product lines serving both market segments.

This means that the software had to access the computer's hardware (particularly the video display) strictly through calls to the operating system's [[BIOS]]. However, programs written to run under the similar [[PC DOS]] operating system on an actual [[IBM PC]] computer often bypassed calls to the operating system because the IBM BIOS was poorly designed and implemented. To function with adequate speed of execution, and to perform operations not provided for by the IBM BIOS, applications programmers often coded their programs to directly address the hardware of the IBM PC. Therefore any computer such as the Tandy 2000 that had hardware that differed in its details from an IBM PC would not execute programs the same way, which most often manifested incorrect results by those programs.\n\nTandy engineers tested one hundred of the most popular PC programs and half were found to be incompatible with the 2000's hardware.<ref group=\"note\">One was the bestselling Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet/database, but Lotus programmers were so excited by the new computer's ultrafast performance that they agreed to adapt it for the 2000.</ref> Tandy's marketing department failed to appreciate that similar non-compatible computers from DEC, TI and Eagle were not successful.{{r|white198708}} Its strategy of offering a high-performance PC was the origin of the Tandy 2000's technical specifications. Some of the rival computers improved the PC hardware and matched the Tandy 2000 in one or two dimensions, but none offered across-the-board enhancement. Except as noted, they ran MS-DOS but were incompatible with the IBM PC at the hardware level. The copycat computers competed primarily on lower pricing and, like Tandy, exploiting their installed customer bases.\n\nTandy described the 2000 as having a \"'next generation' true 16-bit CPU\", and with \"More speed. More disk storage. More expansion\" than the IBM PC or \"other MS-DOS computers\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-12, page 4|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1985_rsc-12/hr004.html|website=radioshackcatalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref> While admitting in 1984 that many MS-DOS programs did not support the computer, the company stated that \"the most popular, sophisticated software on the market\" was available, either immediately or \"over the next six months\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack Computer Catalog RSC-11, page 6|url=http://www.radioshackcatalogs.com/html/catalogs_extra/1984_rsc-11/h006.html|website=radioshackcatalogs dot com|publisher=Tandy/Radio Shack|accessdate=June 27, 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo models of Tandy 2000 were introduced: a dual-drive floppy-only model for $2,750 and the 2000HD with a single floppy drive and a half-height 10 MB hard drive for $4,250.

However, most DOS software of the time bypassed the operating system and BIOS and directly accessed the hardware (especially video and external ports) to achieve higher performance, rendering such software incompatible with the Tandy 2000.\n\n=== Graphics ===\nThe base-model Tandy 2000 supported only a text-mode display in monochrome. The Tandy VM-1 monitor used the 8-pin video port on the computer's rear panel. The text-mode address space was in a different location but third-party memory-resident software hacks remedied this by copying the PC-compatible text-mode memory to the Tandy 2000's text space at a rate of 5\u201310 times per second. This sometimes caused some choppiness in the display. It produced a fast text display rate\u2014often too fast to read\u2014but the 'HOLD' key on the keyboard could be used to pause text output.\n\nThe bit pattern for each text character's raster image was maintained in RAM and could be modified by the user. With clever programming the display's ability to present fine lines provided by the 640x400 screen resolution could be accessed in text mode even without the optional graphics board.\n\nThe display was upgradable to support pixel-addressable graphics via the Tandy 2000 Graphics Adapter, a circuit board that fit into an expansion slot. It had its own connector for the monochrome VM-1 monitor; the video connector in the rear-panel cabinet was disabled when this expansion board was installed. The graphics resolution was 640x400 and supported high intensity pixels.\n\nColor capability was provided by the Color Graphics Option, which was a set of chips that were inserted into the empty sockets on the monochrome Graphics Adapter provided for this purpose.<ref group=\"note\">The Color chipset comprises 16 readily-available chips: eight 4416-15 DRAMs, four 74F245s, and four 25LS22 chips. A trace cut on the graphics board was also required.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Model 2000 Color Graphics Option Kit Installation Instructions|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Tandy/Tandy%202000%20Color%20Chip%20Kit%20Install%20Manual.pdf|website=ClassicCMP|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> Resolution for the color board was the same 640x400, non-interlaced, and eight colors out of a palette of sixteen available colors were displayable on the Tandy CM-1 monitor (~$799). This was a particularly high-resolution and colorful display for its day. The CM-1 accepted, as input from the color graphics board, digital RGBI signals (indicating separate Red, Green, and Blue signals with an Intensity bit). CGA compatibility was hit-or-miss.\n\nThere were only three non-Tandy monitors that worked with the Tandy 2000 graphics card, all of which are long out of production. These were the original (1986\u201388) Mitsubishi Diamond Scan, and the Nippon Electronics Corporation (NEC) Multisync and Multisync GS (grayscale).<ref>{{cite web|title=Tandy 2000 FAQ|url=http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/docs/t2kfaq.txt|website=Classiccmp.org|publisher=Classic Computer, Jeff Hellige|accessdate=May 23, 2016}}</ref> The required horizontal scan frequency for the Tandy 2000 is 26.4&nbsp;kHz. Modern flat-screen multisync computer monitors cannot sync at frequencies below 30&nbsp;kHz. The CM-1 monitor is also digital RGB; all modern CRT monitors are analog-only.\n\n=== Media ===\nThe Tandy 2000 used quad-density 5.25\" floppy disks formatted at 720k. This format (80-track disks at the double-density bitrate) was not used by PC-compatibles, although some CP/M machines and the [[Commodore 8050]]/8250 drives had them. Normal PCs of the time had 40-track double-density floppy drives and could not read quad-density due to the drive heads being too wide to read the narrower tracks. 1.2MB 5.25\" drives (introduced on the IBM AT) could read quad-density disks as they were 80-track and had thinner heads. Various utility programs for DOS existed that allowed nonstandard formats, such as the Tandy 2000's disks, to be read. Much like 1.2MB drives, the Tandy 2000 had problems reliably writing 360k PC disks due to the smaller heads not completely erasing the tracks and causing 40-track drives to become confused by residual magnetic signals on the outer edge of the track. Tandy distributed the computer with a utility called PC-Maker that would read and format 40-track disks in the 2000s 80-track drives, and were readable in drives on ordinary PCs.\n\nThe floppy controller on the Tandy 2000 will accept 3.5\" low-density 720 KB floppy drives.\n\nAs of May 2019, there is an abandonware site (winworldpc.com) that has available for download a disk image for the latest version of MS-DOS for the Tandy 2000. It includes instructions for using the IBM 1.2MB 5.25-inch disk drive (80-track) to create a system disk bootable in the Tandy 2000 5.25-inch drive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Microsoft MS-DOS 2.11 [Tandy 2000 OEM] (02.02.00) (5.25-DSQD 720k)|url=https://winworldpc.com/download/40e280b9-7b22-18c3-9a11-c3a4e284a2ef|website=WinWorld|publisher=WinWorld|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}</ref> This procedure can also be used to create a bootable 3.5-inch system disk using an ordinary 720KB 3.5-inch PC drive; this will boot a Tandy 2000 if its 5.25-inch boot drive is replaced with a low-density 720 KB 3.5 inch PC drive.\n\n=== Keyboard ===\nThe keyboard was an entirely new design made expressly for the Tandy 2000. It would later be the same keyboard shipped with the [[Tandy 1000]] and its successors.\n\nThe arrangement of the function keys was changed from that of the IBM PC/XT, which had ten on the left hand side of the keyboard in two columns of five. Tandy was among the first PC manufacturers to change this to the modern arrangement of twelve function keys arranged horizontally across the top. IBM gave a nod to the new standard by making this its arrangement for the PC-AT keyboard.\n\n=== Serial port ===\nThe serial port hardware was completely different from the PC/XT's.  PC-compatible terminal emulation software had to either maintain strict BIOS usage of the serial hardware, or else use a [[FOSSIL]] driver, a software wrapper that virtualized the serial hardware (see also [[DEC Rainbow]]), allowing the terminal software to work on a wider variety of hardware.\n\nSeveral terminal programs were available for the Tandy 2000, making it possible to log on to [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]'s, e-mail, and other remote systems.\n\n=== Operating system ===\nThe Tandy 2000 required a specific version of [[MS-DOS]] that would run only on this machine.  Standard MS-DOS or [[PC DOS]] (for generic IBM-compatibles) would not run on a Tandy 2000.  It was standard practice and Microsoft's expectation at the time that a customized version of MS-DOS would be prepared for each different machine, with I/O drivers designed for the hardware of that model.  The highest version of DOS that Tandy Corporation released for the Tandy 2000 was 2.11.03, with a few minor third-party patches after the fact.  A modified version of [[Windows 1.0]] was able to run on the Tandy 2000.\n\nMS-DOS for the Tandy 2000 resided entirely in RAM, unlike the IBM PCs which contained the BIOS portion of the OS in ROM. The complete MS-DOS system (BIOS and BDOS) occupied about 53 KB of RAM.<ref>{{cite web|title=Byte review of Tandy 2000|url=http://tech-insider.org/personal-computers/research/acrobat/8412-b.pdf|website=tech-insider dot org|accessdate=May 25, 2016}}</ref> This means that the RAM required to run applications on the Tandy 2000 was a little greater. However, the Tandy 2000 fared better in comparison to the later IBM PC-AT in that the AT was required to run MS-DOS version 3.x in order to operate its 1.2 MB floppy drives and hard drive. Version 3 of MS-DOS was rather larger than Version 2.x running on the Tandy 2000. It also proved advantageous that the Tandy 2000's OS resided entirely in RAM and therefore could be updated and hacked with rather less effort.\n\nThe Microsoft BASIC interpreter was supplied with the computer. It was highly customized for the Tandy 2000 hardware, particularly its high-resolution color graphics. Although IBM produced the Enhanced Graphics Adapter a little more than a year later (October 1984), the Microsoft BASIC interpreter would not support its greater color and resolution capabilities until 1988.\n\nTandy/Radio Shack produced print advertising featuring [[Bill Gates]] of Microsoft extolling the superior performance of the Tandy 2000 and how it was advantageous in Microsoft's development of Windows 1.0.<ref>{{cite web|title=Radio Shack print ad with Bill Gates and Tandy 2000|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&dq=bill%20gates%20tandy%202000&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false|website=Google books|accessdate=May 23, 2016|date = 1984-11-05}}</ref>\n\n== Software ==\nSoftware packages that were released for the Tandy 2000 included [[WordPerfect]] 4.2 (WP5.1 could work with software patches), [[Lotus 1-2-3]], Ashton-Tate's [[Framework (office suite)|Framework]], [[DBase]], [[MultiMate]], [[Pfs:Write]], [[AutoCAD]], Lumena (from Time Arts) [[shareware]] office programs, and the complete line of Microsoft language products. Microsoft released a version of [[Xenix]] for the Tandy 2000 (used with Western Digital's ViaNet network card, distributed by Tandy).{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nBetter BASIC for both the Tandy 2000 and the PC was used to write BBS software for the Tandy 2000 and later ported to the IBM PC.\nRadio Shack's [[Deskmate]] was also used with the Tandy 2000 and the Tandy 1000.\n\nMicroPro's [[Wordstar]] (versions 3.3 and 4.0 only) would run on the Tandy 2000 provided the user ran the WINSTALL installation utility and, when prompted for the type of video display to be used, selected \"ROM BIOS\". While this would result in a functional installation, none of the T2000's special features would be operative (except for increased speed).<ref>{{cite book|title=Wordstar 4.0 User Manual|date=1987|publisher=MicroPro|page=xx}}</ref>\n\nThe only version of Lotus 1-2-3 offered for the Tandy 2000 was Release 1A. This was customized to take advantage of the unique hardware of the computer, including its full 768K of RAM, high resolution color graphics, and two extra function keys.\n\nRelease 1A's executable code was about 60 KB smaller than the later Release 2, which provided greater macro programming facilities. This extra space for data, with the additional 128 KB of RAM available to a fully expanded Tandy 2000, made it possible to construct larger worksheets than later PCs running Release 2 (until the advent of machines with [[Expanded memory]]). For nearly two years following its introduction, the Tandy 2000 was the top performer for processing large models in Lotus 1-2-3.\n\nThe Tandy 2000's 720 KB floppy drives were a distinct advantage for running Lotus, because they were large enough to store even the largest worksheets on a single diskette. This is in stark contrast to the IBM PC and XT with 360 KB floppy disks. In order to store his largest worksheets, a PC user would have to split them and save them on two disks\u2014and then he'd have to recombine them in memory later. Although the XT had a hard drive that could store large Lotus worksheets in a single file, the user could not rely on a single storage device for permanent storage of important data files; again he'd be forced to segment worksheets for storage on separate disks. The Tandy 2000's large-capacity floppy disks made backup maintenance relatively effortless.\n\n== End of life ==\nAfter Tandy dropped support of the Tandy 2000, a group of users formed the Tandy 2000 Orphans, with software reviews, software and hardware hacks, and a shareware/freeware repository.  It was discovered by amateur programmers that many commercial MS-DOS applications needed only minor modifications to function on the Tandy 2000's unique hardware.\n\nThere was also a [[Bulletin board system|BBS]] based in Texas that had an extensive library of compatible software available for download; neither the BBS nor its web-based descendant is active today.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Tandy 1000]]\n* [[Mindset (computer)]], another PC compatible with enhanced graphics using the 80186\n\n==Note==\n{{reflist|group=note|liststyle=lower-roman}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?st=1&c=1219 Old Computers museum Web site]\n* [http://cchaven.com/t2kfaq.txt FAQ @ CCHAVEN.COM]\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=oC4EAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA1&ots=fTkwI2v2um&dq=bill%20gates%20tandy%202000&pg=PA1#v=onepage&q&f=false Tandy 2000 advertisement] featuring Bill Gates, ''InfoWorld'', Nov 5, 1984\n* [http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Tandy/Tandy%202000%20Programmer's%20Reference.pdf Tandy 2000 Programmers Reference PDF ]\n* [http://www.classiccmp.org/cini/pdf/Tandy/Tandy%202000%20Technical%20Reference.pdf Tandy 2000 Technical Reference Manual PDF ]\n* [https://winworldpc.com/download/40e280b9-7b22-18c3-9a11-c3a4e284a2ef WinWorldPC.com page] - download for Tandy version of MS-DOS 2.11, 5.25-DSQD 720 KB\n* [http://lowendmac.com/2015/tandys-pc-compatible-computers/ Low End Mac's retrospective] on the Tandy 2000 computer and Tandy 1000 series (Daniel Knight - 2015-12-19)\n\n{{TRS-80 and Tandy computers}}\n\n[[Category:Home computers]]\n[[Category:IBM PC compatibles]]\n[[Category:RadioShack]]\n", "name_user": "Yevrowl", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_2000"}

A new passenger terminal building is under construction and is expected to be finished in 2020.\n\n==History==\n{{For|information on the history of Clark Airport prior to the explosion of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in 1991 and the departure of U.S. forces from the [[Philippines]]|Clark Air Base}}\n[[File:Clark International Airport (CRK).svg|thumb|200px|right|The logo of Clark International Airport used until 2019]]\n\nThe United States Cavalry established Fort Stotsenberg in 1902 and later converted a portion of which into an air field, which was, in turn, renamed Clark Air Field in 1919\u2014in honor of aviator Major [[Harold M. Clark|Harold Melville Clark]]\u2014and was used as one of the most important overseas bases during the 2nd World War.\n\nIn 1947, the RP-US Military Bases Agreement was signed, integrating Clark Air Field and Fort Stotsenberg into Clark Air Base but, after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991 and the non-renewal of the military bases agreement, Clark Air Base was reverted to the Philippine Government.\n\nThe Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992 accelerated the conversion of Clark Air Base into a Special Economic Zone, and in 2007, the Philippine Congress enacted a law (RA 9400) which renamed the base to Clark Freeport Philippines. It is now segregated in two separate entities:  Clark Freeport Zone administered by the Clark Development Corporation, and the Clark Civil Aviation Complex administered by the Clark International Airport Corporation.\n\nIn 1993, the former Clark Air Base was reopened as the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) after the area was cleared from [[lahar]] debris from the [[Mount Pinatubo]] explosion and a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] that followed. During the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]], it was designated to be the future primary international gateway of the Philippines and the major international airport of [[Metro Manila]] and its neighboring provinces when [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Metro Manila]] has reached full capacity and can no longer be expanded.\n\nCIAC traces its origin from Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992\", which authorized the conversion of several military reservations, including the former Clark Air Base, into sustainable economic zones. Jurisdiction over the corporation shifted from the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) since its formal incorporation with the SEC in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] renamed Clark International Airport as the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA), in memory of her father, former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], and ordered the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) in February 2007 to fund the US$1.7 billion (PH\u20b176.5 billion) expansion of DMIA and the approval of a US$2 million (PH\u20b190 million) study plan financed by the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The first stage of Clark Airport's expansion program, a PH\u20b1130 million terminal expansion, was completed in January 2008 to accommodate more than 2 million passengers annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.$2m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928144135/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.%242m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|url-status=dead|title=Sunstar.com|archivedate=28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, CIAC was transferred from the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] and became an attached agency of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President [[Benigno Aquino III]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2011/12/21/executive-order-no-64-s-2011/|title=Executive Order No. 64, s. 2011|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's name reverted to Clark International Airport in February 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/28/12/clark-airport-name-change-plan-sparks-debate |title=Clark airport name-change plan sparks debate |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=28 February 2012}}</ref> but the passenger terminal continued to bear Diosdado Macapagal's name.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] issued Executive Order No. 14, reverting CIAC as a subsidiary of the BCDA, but with the Department of Transportation maintaining supervision and operational control of the airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2017/02feb/20170228-EO-14-RRD.pdf|title=Executive Order No. 14, s. 2017|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the airport was temporarily closed as all flights to and from Clark are canceled due to a [[2019 Luzon earthquake|magnitude 6.1 earthquake]] occurred, originating in [[Zambales]].

Clark|Harold Melville Clark]]\u2014and was used as one of the most important overseas bases during the 2nd World War.\n\nIn 1947, the RP-US Military Bases Agreement was signed, integrating Clark Air Field and Fort Stotsenberg into Clark Air Base but, after the eruption of [[Mount Pinatubo]] in June 1991 and the non-renewal of the military bases agreement, Clark Air Base was reverted to the Philippine Government.\n\nThe Bases Conversion Development Act of 1992 accelerated the conversion of Clark Air Base into a Special Economic Zone, and in 2007, the Philippine Congress enacted a law (RA 9400) which renamed the base to Clark Freeport Philippines. It is now segregated in two separate entities:  Clark Freeport Zone administered by the Clark Development Corporation, and the Clark Civil Aviation Complex administered by the Clark International Airport Corporation.\n\nIn 1993, the former Clark Air Base was reopened as the Clark Special Economic Zone (CSEZ) after the area was cleared from [[lahar]] debris from the [[Mount Pinatubo]] explosion and a [[Pacific typhoon|typhoon]] that followed. During the administration of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Fidel V. Ramos]], it was designated to be the future primary international gateway of the Philippines and the major international airport of [[Metro Manila]] and its neighboring provinces when [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in [[Metro Manila]] has reached full capacity and can no longer be expanded.\n\nCIAC traces its origin from Republic Act No. 7227, otherwise known as the \"Bases Conversion and Development Act of 1992\", which authorized the conversion of several military reservations, including the former Clark Air Base, into sustainable economic zones. Jurisdiction over the corporation shifted from the Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA) and the Clark Development Corporation (CDC) since its formal incorporation with the SEC in 1995.\n\nIn 2003, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] renamed Clark International Airport as the Diosdado Macapagal International Airport (DMIA), in memory of her father, former President [[Diosdado Macapagal]], and ordered the Clark International Airport Corporation (CIAC) in February 2007 to fund the US$1.7 billion (PH\u20b176.5 billion) expansion of DMIA and the approval of a US$2 million (PH\u20b190 million) study plan financed by the Korean International Cooperation Agency. The first stage of Clark Airport's expansion program, a PH\u20b1130 million terminal expansion, was completed in January 2008 to accommodate more than 2 million passengers annually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.$2m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928144135/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/pam/2007/12/23/news/korean.firm.prepares.%242m.clark.airport.master.plan..html|url-status=dead|title=Sunstar.com|archivedate=28 September 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, CIAC was transferred from the [[Bases Conversion and Development Authority]] and became an attached agency of the [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation and Communications]] (DOTC) by virtue of Executive Order No. 64 issued by President [[Benigno Aquino III]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2011/12/21/executive-order-no-64-s-2011/|title=Executive Order No. 64, s. 2011|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|date=21 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe airport's name reverted to Clark International Airport in February 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/02/28/12/clark-airport-name-change-plan-sparks-debate |title=Clark airport name-change plan sparks debate |publisher=ABS-CBN News |date=28 February 2012}}</ref> but the passenger terminal continued to bear Diosdado Macapagal's name.\n\nOn 28 February 2017, President [[Rodrigo Duterte]] issued Executive Order No. 14, reverting CIAC as a subsidiary of the BCDA, but with the Department of Transportation maintaining supervision and operational control of the airport.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/downloads/2017/02feb/20170228-EO-14-RRD.pdf|title=Executive Order No. 14, s. 2017|newspaper=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette]]|accessdate=28 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 22 April 2019, the airport was temporarily closed as all flights to and from Clark are canceled due to a [[2019 Luzon earthquake|magnitude 6.1 earthquake]] occurred, originating in [[Zambales]].

The airport lies in between the [[Mount Pinatubo]] on the West and the [[Mount Arayat]] on the East.\n\nThe airport site is inside the Clark Freeport Zone's Civil Aviation Complex which occupies {{convert|2367|ha}} and directly linked to the [[Subic\u2013Clark\u2013Tarlac Expressway]] (SCTEx) which is connected to the [[North Luzon Expressway]] (NLEx) providing a direct link to Metro Manila.\n\nIt has a local catchment area with an estimated population of 23 million covering Regions 1, 2 and 3, Cordillera Administrative Region, and the northern part of Metro Manila (Quezon City and CAMANAVA area).\n\n==Passenger terminal complex==\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | image1    = Clark International Airport Departure Hall.jpg\n | width1    = 220\n | caption1  = \n | image2    = Clark International Airport Departure Hall View.jpg\n | width2    = 220\n | caption2  = Views of the departure hall of the passenger terminal\n}}\nThe original terminal was expanded for $3 million (PH\u20b1130 million) to accommodate 1 million passengers annually. The expansion project was inaugurated by President Arroyo on April 2008 to serve the growing passenger volume due to the entry of foreign and local budget carriers at the airport.\n\nPhase I expansion started in April 2010 for $12 million (PH\u20b1550 million) that saw a second story, arrival and departure lounges, and two aerobridges added to the terminal building. The expansion boosted Clark's capacity to 2.5 million annually.\n\nIn 2013, Phase II expansion which costs $9.6 million (PH\u20b1417 million) increased the capacity of the passenger terminal from 2.5 million to 4.2 million passengers per annum. The expansion increased the size of the passenger terminal building from 11,439m\u00b2 to 19,799m\u00b2. It added 21 new check-in counters, increasing the total number of counters from 13 to 34. Five arrival counters and 12 departures counters were also constructed. The expanded terminal currently has eight entry points and three customs stations. The modernized terminal started operations in May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.airport-technology.com/projects/clark-international-airport-cia-expansion-pampanga/|title=Clark International Airport (CIA) Expansion, Pampanga|website=Airport-technology.com}}</ref>\n\n==Runways==\nClark Airport used to have two 3,200-meter parallel runways.

The first white explorer, George Wilson Evans, entered the [[Wyangala#Water resources|Lachlan Valley]] in 1815. He named the area the Oxley Plains after his superior the surveyor-general, John Oxley.
