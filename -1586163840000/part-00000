It is the way that individuals perceive the social world around them and react to it. These dispositions are usually shared by people with similar backgrounds (such as social class, religion, nationality, ethnicity, education and profession). The habitus is acquired through imitation (''[[Mimesis|mimesis]]'') and is the reality in which individuals are socialized, which includes their individual experience and opportunities. Thus, the habitus represents the way group culture and personal history shape the body and the mind; as a result, it shapes present social actions of an individual.<ref>Lizardo, O. 2004, \"The cognitive origins of Bourdieu's Habitus\", Journal for the Theory of Social Behaviour, vol. 34, no. 4, pp. 375-448.</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Cambridge University Press.|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=|newspaper=}}</ref>\n\nFrench sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] suggested that the habitus consists of both the ''[[hexis]]'' (the tendency to hold and use one's body in a certain way, such as posture and accent) and more abstract mental habits, schemes of perception, classification, appreciation, feeling, as well as action.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Pascalian Meditations|newspaper=Stanford University Press.|year=2000}}</ref> These schemes are not mere [[habit]]s: Bourdieu suggested they allow individuals to find new solutions to new situations without calculated deliberation, based on their gut feelings and intuitions, which he believed were collective and socially shaped.

Bourdieu argued that the reproduction of the social structure results from the habitus of individuals.\n\nThe notion of habitus is extremely influential (with 400,000 Google Scholar publications using it), yet it also evoked criticism for its alleged determinism, as Bourdieu compared social actors to ''automata'' (while relying on [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz's]] theory of [[Monadology|Monads]]).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Origins ==\nThe concept of habitus has been used as early as [[Aristotle]] but in contemporary usage was introduced by [[Marcel Mauss]] and later [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. However, it was [[Pierre Bourdieu]] who turned it into a cornerstone of his sociology, and used it to address the sociological problem of [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] and structure: the habitus is shaped by structural position and generates action, thus when people act and demonstrate agency they simultaneously reflect and reproduce social structure. Bourdieu elaborated his theory of the habitus while borrowing ideas on cognitive and generative schemes from [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[Jean Piaget]] dependency on history and human memory. For instance, a certain behaviour or belief becomes part of a society's structure when the original purpose of that behaviour or belief can no longer be recalled and becomes socialized into individuals of that culture.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=78\u201379}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Community and society|last=T\u00f6nnies|first=Ferdinand|publisher=Harper and Row.|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}</ref>\n\n[[Lo\u00efc Wacquant]] wrote that habitus is an old philosophical notion, originating in the thought of [[Aristotle]], whose notion of ''[[hexis]]'' (\"state\") was translated into ''habitus'' by the Medieval [[Scholastics]].  Bourdieu first adapted the term in his 1967 postface to [[Erwin Panofsky]]'s ''Gothic Architecture and Scholasticism''.<ref>[http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Winter2007/Premodern.htm Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409100449/http://www.brynmawr.edu/bmrcl/Winter2007/Premodern.htm |date=2009-04-09 }} of Holsinger, ''The Premodern Condition'', in ''Bryn Mawr Review of Comparative Literature'' 6:1 (Winter 2007).</ref>  The term was earlier used in sociology by [[Norbert Elias]] in ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939) and in [[Marcel Mauss]]'s account of \"body techniques\" (techniques du corps).  The concept is also present in the work of [[Max Weber]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], and [[Edmund Husserl]].\n\nMauss defined habitus as those aspects of culture that are anchored in the body or daily practices of individuals, groups, societies, and nations.  It includes the totality of learned [[Habit (psychology)|habits]], bodily skills, styles, tastes, and other non-discursive knowledges that might be said to \"go without saying\" for a specific group (Bourdieu 1990:66-67)\u2014in that way it can be said to operate beneath the level of rational [[ideology]].\n\nAccording to Bourdieu, habitus is composed of:\n\n{{quote|[s]ystems of durable, transposable dispositions, structured structures predisposed to function as structuring structures, that is, as principles which generate and organize practices and representations that can be objectively adapted to their outcomes without presupposing a conscious aiming at ends or an express mastery of the operations necessary in order to attain them.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=The Logic of Practice|newspaper=Polity Press.|year=1990}}</ref>}}\n\n==Non-sociological uses==\n\n=== Literary criticism ===\nThe term has also been adopted in literary criticism, adapting from Bourdieu's usage of the term. For example, Joe Moran's examination of authorial identities in ''Star Authors: Literary Celebrity in America'' uses the term in discussion of how authors develop a habitus formed around their own celebrity and status as authors, which manifests in their writing.\n\n=== Use in literary theory ===\nBourdieu's principle of habitus is interwoven with the concept of structuralism in literary theory. Peter Barry explains, \"in the structuralist approach to literature there is a constant movement away from interpretation of the individual literary work and a parallel drive towards understanding the larger structures which contain them\" (2009, p.&nbsp;39). There is therefore a strong desire to understand the larger influencing factors which makes an individual literary work. As Bourdieu explains, habitus \"are structured structures, generative principles of distinct and distinctive practices \u2013 what the worker eats, and especially the way he eats it, the sport he practices and the way he practices it, his political opinions and the way he expresses them are systematically different from the industrial proprietor's corresponding activities / habitus are also structuring structures, different classifying schemes classification principles, different principles of vision and division, different tastes. Habitus make different differences; they implement distinctions between what is good and what is bad, what is right and what is wrong, between what is distinguished and what is vulgar, and so on, but they are not the same. Thus, for instance, the same behaviour or even the same good can appear distinguished to one person, pretentious to someone else, and cheap or showy to yet another\" (Bourdieu, 1996). As a result, habitus may be employed in literary theory in order to understand those larger, external structures which influence individual theories and works of literature.\n\n=== Body habitus ===\nBody habitus (or \"bodily habitus\") is the medical term for physique, and is categorized as either endomorphic (relatively short and stout), ectomorphic (relatively long and thin) or mesomorphic (average dimensions). In this sense, habitus has in the past been interpreted as the physical and constitutional characteristics of an individual, especially as related to the tendency to develop a certain disease.<ref>''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'' (4th Ed) Houghton Mifflin Company, 2003</ref> For example, \"[[marfan syndrome|Marfanoid]] bodily habitus\".\n\n== Scholars researching habitus ==\n* [[Lo\u00efc Wacquant]] \u2013 a sociologist and ethnographer who studied the construction of the \"pugilistic habitus\" in a boxing gym of the black ghetto of Chicago in ''Body and Soul: Notebooks of an Apprentice Boxer'' (2004) and in \"Habitus as Topic and Tool\" (2009).\n* Bernard Lahire \u2013 a French sociologist who suggested that the habitus is not (or no longer) a system shared by a class, but rather an eclectic set of dispositions that are often contradictory, due to non-typical socialization paths in late modernity.<ref>Lahire, Bernard. 2011.

The purpose of a boycott is to inflict some economic loss on the target, or to indicate a moral outrage, to try to compel the target to alter an objectionable behavior.\n\nSometimes, a boycott can be a form of [[consumer activism]], sometimes called [[moral purchasing]]. When a similar practice is legislated by a national government, it is known as a [[Economic sanctions|sanction]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:Charles Cunningham Boycott (Vanity Fair).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' caricature of Charles C. Boycott]]\nThe word ''boycott'' entered the English language during the [[Ireland|Irish]] \"[[Land War]]\" and derives from Captain [[Charles Boycott]], the land agent of an absentee landlord, [[John Crichton, 3rd Earl Erne|Lord Erne]], who lived in  Lough Mask House, near [[Ballinrobe]] in [[County Mayo]], [[Ireland]], who was subject to social [[ostracism]] organized by the [[Irish Land League]] in 1880. As harvests had been poor that year, Lord Erne offered his tenants a ten percent reduction in their rents. In September of that year, protesting tenants demanded a twenty five percent reduction, which Lord Erne refused. Boycott then attempted to evict eleven tenants from the land. [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], in a speech in [[Ennis]] prior to the events in Lough Mask, proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. While Parnell's speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was first applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated \u2013 his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marlow|first=Joyce|title=Captain Boycott and the Irish|year=1973|publisher=[[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]]|isbn=978-0-233-96430-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wW4uAAAAMAAJ&q=Captain+Boycott&dq=Captain+Boycott|pages=133\u2013142}}</ref>\n\nThe concerted action taken against him meant that Boycott was unable to hire anyone to [[harvest]] the crops in his charge. Eventually 50 [[Orange Institution|Orangemen]] from [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] volunteered to do the work. They were escorted to and from [[Claremorris]] by one thousand [[Royal Irish Constabulary|policemen]] and soldiers, despite the fact that the local Land League leaders had said that there would be no violence from them, and in fact no violence happened.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marlow|first=Joyce|title=Captain Boycott and the Irish|year=1973|publisher=[[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]]|isbn=978-0-233-96430-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wW4uAAAAMAAJ&q=Captain+Boycott&dq=Captain+Boycott|pages=157\u2013173}}</ref> This protection ended up costing far more than the harvest was worth. After the harvest, the \"boycott\" was successfully continued. Within weeks Boycott's name was everywhere. The ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' reporter, James Redpath, first wrote of the boycott in the international press. The Irish author, George Moore, reported: 'Like a comet the verb 'boycott' appeared.'<ref>Stanford, Jane, That Irishman: the Life and Times of John O'Connor Power, pp. 95\u201397.</ref> It was used by ''[[The Times]]'' in November 1880 as a term for organized isolation. According to an account in the book ''The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland'' by [[Michael Davitt]], the term was promoted by Fr. John O'Malley of County Mayo to \"signify ostracism applied to a landlord or agent like Boycott\". ''The Times'' first reported on November 20, 1880: \"The people of New Pallas have resolved to 'boycott' them and refused to supply them with food or drink.\" The ''Daily News'' wrote on December 13, 1880: \"Already the stoutest-hearted are yielding on every side to the dread of being 'Boycotted'.\" By January of the following year, the word was being used figuratively: \"Dame Nature arose.... She 'Boycotted' London from Kew to Mile End\" (The Spectator, January 22, 1881).\n\n'''Girlcott''' is a [[portmanteau]] of girl and boycott intended to focus on the rights or actions of women. The term was coined in 1968 by American [[Track and Field|track]] star Lacey O'Neal during the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], in the context of [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|protests]] by male [[African American]] athletes. Speaking for black women athletes, she advised that the group would not \"girlcott\" the [[Olympic Games]], because female athletes were still focused on being recognized. It also appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1970, and was later used by retired [[tennis]] player [[Billie Jean King]] in reference to [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], to emphasize her argument regarding [[equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] for women players.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The term \"girlcott\" was revived in 2005 by women in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] protesting what they said were sexist and degrading [[T-shirt#Decoration|T-shirt slogan]]s on [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] merchandise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&id=3590221 |title=Teen Girls Protest Abercrombie & Fitch Shirts |publisher=ABC Inc. |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Notable boycotts==\n[[File:Olympic boycotts 1976 1980 1984.PNG|thumb|The 1976, 1980 and 1984 Olympic boycotts]]\n[[File:LiebenthalRechtsanwalt2.jpg|thumb|[[Nameplate]] of Dr. Werner Liebenthal, [[Notary]] & [[Advocate]].

The first Olympic boycott was in the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] with several countries boycotting the games for different reasons. Iran also has an informal Olympic boycott against participating against Israel, and Iranian athletes typically bow out or claim injuries when pitted against Israelis (see [[Arash Miresmaeili]]).\n\n==Application and uses==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2011}}\n[[File:BP Oil Flood Protest Boycott Wheres Cheney.JPG|thumb|Protesters advocating boycott of [[BP]] due to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]]]\nA boycott is typically a one-time affair intended to correct an outstanding single wrong. When extended for a long period of time, or as part of an overall program of awareness-raising or reforms to laws or regimes, a boycott is part of [[moral purchasing]], and some prefer those economic or political terms.\n\nMost organized consumer boycotts today are focused on long-term change of buying habits, and so fit into part of a larger political program, with many techniques that require a longer structural commitment, e.g. reform to [[commodity markets]], or government commitment to [[moral purchasing]], e.g. the longstanding boycott of [[South Africa]]n businesses to protest [[apartheid]] already alluded to.  These stretch the meaning of a \"boycott.\"\n\nBoycotts are now much easier to successfully initiate due to the [[Internet]].  Examples include the [[homosexuality|gay and lesbian]] boycott of advertisers of the \"[[Dr. Laura]]\" [[talk show]], gun owners' similar boycott of advertisers of [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s talk show and (later) magazine, and gun owners' boycott of [[Smith & Wesson]] following that company's March 2000 settlement with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration.  They may be initiated very easily using either Web sites (the Dr. Laura boycott), newsgroups (the Rosie O'Donnell boycotts), or even mailing lists.  Internet-initiated boycotts \"snowball\" very quickly compared to other forms of organization.\n\n''Viral Labeling'' is a new boycott method using the new digital technology proposed by the Multitude Project and applied for the first time against Walt Disney around Christmas time in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effective boycott campaigns \u2013 Multitude Project|work=Outreach|url=http://sites.google.com/site/multitude2008/Home/organize-efficient-boycott-campaigns|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAnother form of consumer boycotting is substitution for an equivalent product; for example, [[Mecca Cola]] and [[Qibla Cola]] have been marketed as substitutes for [[Coca-Cola]] among [[Muslim]] populations.\n\nAcademic boycotts have been organized against countries. For example, the mid and late 20th century [[academic boycotts of South Africa]] in protest of [[apartheid]] practices and the more recent{{when|date=October 2017}} [[academic boycotts of Israel]].\n[[File:Dontstopdontshop.JPG|thumb|right|African-Americans in Dallas boycotting a Korean owned [[Diamond Shamrock and Kwik Stop Boycott|Kwik Stop]] in a mostly black community.]]\nSome boycotts center on particular businesses, such as recent{{when|date=October 2017}} protests regarding [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[Ford Motor Company]], or the diverse products of [[Altria Group#Food .26 Beverage|Philip Morris]]. Another form of boycott identifies a number of different companies involved in a particular issue, such as the Sudan Divestment campaign, the [http://www.boycottbush.net Boycott Bush] campaign. The [http://www.boycottbush.net Boycott Bush] website was set up by [[Ethical Consumer]] after U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] failed to ratify the [[Kyoto Protocol]] \u2013 the website identifies Bush's corporate funders and the brands and products they produce. A prime target of boycotts is [[consumerism]] itself, e.g. \"[[International Buy Nothing Day]]\" celebrated globally on the Friday after [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] in the United States.\n\nAnother version of the boycott is targeted divestment, or disinvestment. Targeted divestment involves campaigning for withdrawal of investment, for example the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216155609/http://www.sudandivestment.org/home.asp Sudan Divestment] campaign involves putting pressure on companies, often through shareholder activism, to withdraw investment that helps the Sudanese government perpetuate genocide in Darfur. Only if a company refuses to change its behavior in response to shareholder engagement does the targeted divestment model call for divestment from that company. Such targeted divestment implicitly excludes companies involved in agriculture, the production and distribution of consumer goods, or the provision of goods and services intended to relieve human suffering or to promote health, religious and spiritual activities, or education.\n\nAs a response to consumer boycotts of large-scale and multinational businesses, some companies have marketed brands that do not bear the company's name on the packaging or in advertising. Activists such as [[Ethical Consumer]] produce information that reveals which companies own which brands and products so consumers can practice boycotts or moral purchasing more effectively. Another organization, [[Buycott.com]], provides an Internet-based smart-phone application that scans [[Universal Product Code]]s and displays corporate relationships to the user.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite web|last=O'Conner |first=Claire |title=New App Lets You Boycott Koch Brothers, Monsanto And More By Scanning Your Shopping Cart |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/05/14/new-app-lets-you-boycott-koch-brothers-monsanto-and-more-by-scanning-your-shopping-cart/ |publisher=Forbes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140321130346/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fclareoconnor%2F2013%2F05%2F14%2Fnew-app-lets-you-boycott-koch-brothers-monsanto-and-more-by-scanning-your-shopping-cart%2F |archivedate=March 21, 2014 |date=May 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |quote=Burner figured the average supermarket shopper had no idea that buying Brawny paper towels, Angel Soft toilet paper or Dixie cups meant contributing cash to Koch Industries through its subsidiary Georgia-Pacific. }}</ref>\n\n\"Boycotts\" may be formally organized by governments as well.

Boycotts have been characterized by some as different from traditional forms of collective behavior in that they appear to be highly rational and dependent on existing norms and structures. Lewis Killian criticizes that characterization, pointing to the [[Tallahassee bus boycott]] as one example of a boycott that aligns with traditional collective behavior theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Killian|first=Lewis M.|date=1984-01-01|title=Organization, Rationality and Spontaneity in the Civil Rights Movement|jstor=2095529|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=49|issue=6|pages=770\u2013783|doi=10.2307/2095529}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Balsiger points out that political consumption (e.g., boycotts) tends to follow dual-purpose action repertoires, or scripts, which are used publicly to pressure boycott targets and to educate and recruit consumers. Balsiger finds one example in Switzerland, documenting activities of the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]], a public [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-backed campaign, that highlighted and disseminated information about local companies' ethical practices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balsiger|first=Philip|date=2010-08-01|title=Making Political Consumers: The Tactical Action Repertoire of a Campaign for Clean Clothes|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=9|issue=3|pages=311\u2013329|doi=10.1080/14742837.2010.493672|issn=1474-2837|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306807/files/Balsiger_Philip_-_Making_Political_Consumers_The_Tactital_Action_20180209.pdf}}</ref>\n\nDixon, Martin, and Nau analyzed 31 collective behavior campaigns against corporations that took place during the 1990s and 2000s. Protests considered successful included boycotts and were found to include a third party, either in the capacity of state intervention or of media coverage. State intervention may make boycotts more efficacious when corporation leaders fear the imposition of regulations. Media intervention may be a crucial contributor to a successful boycott because of its potential to damage the reputation of a corporation. Target corporations that were the most visible were found to be the most vulnerable to either market (protest causing economic loss) or mediated (caused by third-party) disruption. Third-party actors (i.e., the state or media) were more influential when a corporation had a high reputation\u2014when third-party activity was low, highly reputable corporations did not make the desired concessions to boycotters; when third-party activity was high, highly reputable corporations satisfied the demands of boycotters. The boycott, a prima facie market-disruptive tactic, often precipitates mediated disruption. The researchers' analysis led them to conclude that when boycott targets are highly visible and directly interact with and depend on local consumers who can easily find substitutes, they are more likely to make concessions. Koku, Akhigbe, and Springer also emphasize the importance of boycotts' threat of reputational damage, finding that boycotts alone pose more of a threat to a corporation's reputation than to its finances directly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Marc|last2=Martin|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Nau|first3=Michael|date=2016-04-12|title=Social Protest and Corporate Change: Brand Visibility, Third-Party Influence, and the Responsiveness of Corporations to Activist Campaigns *|journal=Mobilization: An International Quarterly|language=EN|volume=21|issue=1|pages=65\u201382|doi=10.17813/1086-671x-21-1-65}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koku|first=Paul Sergius|last2=Akhigbe|first2=Aigbe|last3=Springer|first3=Thomas M.|date=1997-09-01|title=The Financial Impact of Boycotts and Threats of Boycott|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=40|issue=1|pages=15\u201320|doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(96)00279-2}}</ref>\n\nPhilippe Delacote points out that a problem contributing to a generally low probability of success for any boycott is the fact that the consumers with the most power to cause market disruption are the least likely to participate; the opposite is true for consumers with the least power. Another collective behavior problem is the difficulty, or impossibility, of direct coordination amongst a dispersed group of boycotters. Yuksel and Mryteza emphasize the collective behavior problem of free riding in consumer boycotts, noting that some individuals may perceive participating to be too great an immediate personal utility sacrifice. They also note that boycotting consumers took the collectivity into account when deciding to participate, that is, consideration of joining a boycott as goal-oriented collective activity increased one's likelihood of participating. A corporation-targeted protest repertoire including boycotts and education of consumers presents the highest likelihood for success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delacote|first=Philippe|date=2009-09-01|title=On the Sources of Consumer Boycotts Ineffectiveness|journal=The Journal of Environment & Development|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=306\u2013322|doi=10.1177/1070496509338849|issn=1070-4965|citeseerx=10.1.1.1030.5274}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yuksel|first=Ulku|last2=Mryteza|first2=Victoria|date=2009-02-01|title=An evaluation of strategic responses to consumer boycotts|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Anti-consumption|volume=62|issue=2|pages=248\u2013259|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.032}}</ref>\n\n==Legality==\n\n[[File:HANDS OFF GAZA STOP THE BOMBING FREE PALESTINE - UK NATIONAL DEMONSTRATION.jpg|thumb|Protesters calling for a boycott of Israel]]\n\nBoycotts are generally legal in developed countries.

The right to engage in commerce, social intercourse, and friendship includes the implied right not to engage in commerce, social intercourse, and friendship. Since a boycott is voluntary and nonviolent, the law cannot stop it. Opponents of boycotts historically have the choice of suffering under it, yielding to its demands, or attempting to suppress it through extralegal means, such as force and coercion.\n\nIn the United States, the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) apply to all \"U.S. persons\", defined to include individuals and companies located in the United States and their foreign affiliates. The antiboycott provisions are intended to prevent United States citizens and companies being used as instrumentalities of a foreign government's foreign policy. The EAR forbids participation in or material support of boycotts initiated by foreign governments, for example, the [[Arab League]] boycott of [[Israel]]. These persons are subject to the law when their activities relate to the sale, purchase, or transfer of goods or services (including the sale of information) within the United States or between the United States and a foreign country. This covers exports and imports, financing, forwarding and shipping, and certain other transactions that may take place wholly offshore.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security|work=Office of Antiboycott Compliance|url=http://www.bis.doc.gov/AntiboycottCompliance/oacrequirements.html#whatscovered|accessdate=March 20, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060319092529/http://www.bis.doc.gov/AntiboycottCompliance/oacrequirements.html#whatscovered <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = March 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the EAR only applies to ''foreign government initiated'' boycotts: a domestic boycott campaign arising within the United States that has the same object as the foreign-government-initiated boycott appears to be lawful, assuming that it is an independent effort not connected with the foreign government's boycott. \nOther legal impediments to certain boycotts remain. One set are [[Refusal to deal]] laws, which prohibit concerted efforts to eliminate competition by refusal to buy from or to sell to a party.<ref>[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/concerted-refusal-to-deal.html Business Dictionary]</ref>  Similarly, boycotts may also run afoul of [[Anti-discrimination laws]]; for example, [[New Jersey]]'s Law Against Discrimination prohibits any place that offers goods, services and facilities to the general public, such as a restaurant, from denying or withholding any accommodation to (''i.e.'', not to engage in commerce with) an individual because of that individual's race (etc.).<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/dcr/accom.html New Jersey State official website]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Boycott}}\n* [[List of boycotts]]\n* [[Anti-boycott]]\n* [[Call-out culture]]\n* [[Cancel culture]]\n* [[Dollar voting]]\n* [[Economic secession]]\n* [[Election boycott]]\n* [[Export restriction]]\n* [[Group boycott]]\n* [[Moral purchasing]]\n* [[No Platform]]\n* [[Non-violent resistance]]\n* [[Solidarity action]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Friedman, M.

The purpose of a boycott is to inflict some economic loss on the target, or to indicate a moral outrage, to try to compel the target to alter an objectionable behavior.\n\nSometimes, a boycott can be a form of [[consumer activism]], sometimes called [[moral purchasing]]. When a similar practice is legislated by a national government, it is known as a [[Economic sanctions|sanction]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[Image:Charles Cunningham Boycott (Vanity Fair).jpg|thumb|right|200px|''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' caricature of Charles C. Boycott]]\nThe word ''boycott'' entered the English language during the [[Ireland|Irish]] \"[[Land War]]\" and derives from Captain [[Charles Boycott]], the land agent of an absentee landlord, [[John Crichton, 3rd Earl Erne|Lord Erne]], who lived in  Lough Mask House, near [[Ballinrobe]] in [[County Mayo]], [[Ireland]], who was subject to social [[ostracism]] organized by the [[Irish Land League]] in 1880. As harvests had been poor that year, Lord Erne offered his tenants a ten percent reduction in their rents. In September of that year, protesting tenants demanded a twenty five percent reduction, which Lord Erne refused. Boycott then attempted to evict eleven tenants from the land. [[Charles Stewart Parnell]], in a speech in [[Ennis]] prior to the events in Lough Mask, proposed that when dealing with tenants who take farms where another tenant was evicted, rather than resorting to violence, everyone in the locality should shun them. While Parnell's speech did not refer to land agents or landlords, the tactic was first applied to Boycott when the alarm was raised about the evictions. Despite the short-term economic hardship to those undertaking this action, Boycott soon found himself isolated \u2013 his workers stopped work in the fields and stables, as well as in his house. Local businessmen stopped trading with him, and the local postman refused to deliver mail.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marlow|first=Joyce|title=Captain Boycott and the Irish|year=1973|publisher=[[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]]|isbn=978-0-233-96430-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wW4uAAAAMAAJ&q=Captain+Boycott&dq=Captain+Boycott|pages=133\u2013142}}</ref>\n\nThe concerted action taken against him meant that Boycott was unable to hire anyone to [[harvest]] the crops in his charge. Eventually 50 [[Orange Institution|Orangemen]] from [[County Cavan|Cavan]] and [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]] volunteered to do the work. They were escorted to and from [[Claremorris]] by one thousand [[Royal Irish Constabulary|policemen]] and soldiers, despite the fact that the local Land League leaders had said that there would be no violence from them, and in fact no violence happened.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marlow|first=Joyce|title=Captain Boycott and the Irish|year=1973|publisher=[[Andr\u00e9 Deutsch]]|isbn=978-0-233-96430-0|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wW4uAAAAMAAJ&q=Captain+Boycott&dq=Captain+Boycott|pages=157\u2013173}}</ref> This protection ended up costing far more than the harvest was worth. After the harvest, the \"boycott\" was successfully continued. Within weeks Boycott's name was everywhere. The ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' reporter, James Redpath, first wrote of the boycott in the international press. The Irish author, George Moore, reported: 'Like a comet the verb 'boycott' appeared.'<ref>Stanford, Jane, That Irishman: the Life and Times of John O'Connor Power, pp. 95\u201397.</ref> It was used by ''[[The Times]]'' in November 1880 as a term for organized isolation. According to an account in the book ''The Fall of Feudalism in Ireland'' by [[Michael Davitt]], the term was promoted by Fr. John O'Malley of County Mayo to \"signify ostracism applied to a landlord or agent like Boycott\". ''The Times'' first reported on November 20, 1880: \"The people of New Pallas have resolved to 'boycott' them and refused to supply them with food or drink.\" The ''Daily News'' wrote on December 13, 1880: \"Already the stoutest-hearted are yielding on every side to the dread of being 'Boycotted'.\" By January of the following year, the word was being used figuratively: \"Dame Nature arose.... She 'Boycotted' London from Kew to Mile End\" (The Spectator, January 22, 1881).\n\n'''Girlcott''' is a [[portmanteau]] of girl and boycott intended to focus on the rights or actions of women. The term was coined in 1968 by American [[Track and Field|track]] star Lacey O'Neal during the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] in [[Mexico City]], in the context of [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|protests]] by male [[African American]] athletes. Speaking for black women athletes, she advised that the group would not \"girlcott\" the [[Olympic Games]], because female athletes were still focused on being recognized. It also appeared in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1970, and was later used by retired [[tennis]] player [[Billie Jean King]] in reference to [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], to emphasize her argument regarding [[equal pay for equal work|equal pay]] for women players.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}} The term \"girlcott\" was revived in 2005 by women in [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania]] protesting what they said were sexist and degrading [[T-shirt#Decoration|T-shirt slogan]]s on [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] merchandise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&id=3590221 |title=Teen Girls Protest Abercrombie & Fitch Shirts |publisher=ABC Inc. |date=October 31, 2005 |accessdate=March 18, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Notable boycotts==\n[[File:Olympic boycotts 1976 1980 1984.PNG|thumb|The 1976, 1980 and 1984 Olympic boycotts]]\n[[File:LiebenthalRechtsanwalt2.jpg|thumb|[[Nameplate]] of Dr. Werner Liebenthal, [[Notary]] & [[Advocate]].

The first Olympic boycott was in the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] with several countries boycotting the games for different reasons. Iran also has an informal Olympic boycott against participating against Israel, and Iranian athletes typically bow out or claim injuries when pitted against Israelis (see [[Arash Miresmaeili]]).\n\n==Application and uses==\n{{More citations needed section|date=July 2011}}\n[[File:BP Oil Flood Protest Boycott Wheres Cheney.JPG|thumb|Protesters advocating boycott of [[BP]] due to the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]]]\nA boycott is typically a one-time affair intended to correct an outstanding single wrong. When extended for a long period of time, or as part of an overall program of awareness-raising or reforms to laws or regimes, a boycott is part of [[moral purchasing]], and some prefer those economic or political terms.\n\nMost organized consumer boycotts today are focused on long-term change of buying habits, and so fit into part of a larger political program, with many techniques that require a longer structural commitment, e.g. reform to [[commodity markets]], or government commitment to [[moral purchasing]], e.g. the longstanding boycott of [[South Africa]]n businesses to protest [[apartheid]] already alluded to.  These stretch the meaning of a \"boycott.\"\n\nBoycotts are now much easier to successfully initiate due to the [[Internet]].  Examples include the [[homosexuality|gay and lesbian]] boycott of advertisers of the \"[[Dr. Laura]]\" [[talk show]], gun owners' similar boycott of advertisers of [[Rosie O'Donnell]]'s talk show and (later) magazine, and gun owners' boycott of [[Smith & Wesson]] following that company's March 2000 settlement with the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] administration.  They may be initiated very easily using either Web sites (the Dr. Laura boycott), newsgroups (the Rosie O'Donnell boycotts), or even mailing lists.  Internet-initiated boycotts \"snowball\" very quickly compared to other forms of organization.\n\n''Viral Labeling'' is a new boycott method using the new digital technology proposed by the Multitude Project and applied for the first time against Walt Disney around Christmas time in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effective boycott campaigns \u2013 Multitude Project|work=Outreach|url=http://sites.google.com/site/multitude2008/Home/organize-efficient-boycott-campaigns|accessdate=December 26, 2009}}</ref>\n\nAnother form of consumer boycotting is substitution for an equivalent product; for example, [[Mecca Cola]] and [[Qibla Cola]] have been marketed as substitutes for [[Coca-Cola]] among [[Muslim]] populations.\n\nAcademic boycotts have been organized against countries. For example, the mid and late 20th century [[academic boycotts of South Africa]] in protest of [[apartheid]] practices and the more recent{{when|date=October 2017}} [[academic boycotts of Israel]].\n[[File:Dontstopdontshop.JPG|thumb|right|African-Americans in Dallas boycotting a Korean owned [[Diamond Shamrock and Kwik Stop Boycott|Kwik Stop]] in a mostly black community.]]\nSome boycotts center on particular businesses, such as recent{{when|date=October 2017}} protests regarding [[Costco]], [[Walmart]], [[Ford Motor Company]], or the diverse products of [[Altria Group#Food .26 Beverage|Philip Morris]]. Another form of boycott identifies a number of different companies involved in a particular issue, such as the Sudan Divestment campaign, the [http://www.boycottbush.net Boycott Bush] campaign. The [http://www.boycottbush.net Boycott Bush] website was set up by [[Ethical Consumer]] after U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] failed to ratify the [[Kyoto Protocol]] \u2013 the website identifies Bush's corporate funders and the brands and products they produce. A prime target of boycotts is [[consumerism]] itself, e.g. \"[[International Buy Nothing Day]]\" celebrated globally on the Friday after [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] in the United States.\n\nAnother version of the boycott is targeted divestment, or disinvestment. Targeted divestment involves campaigning for withdrawal of investment, for example the [https://web.archive.org/web/20081216155609/http://www.sudandivestment.org/home.asp Sudan Divestment] campaign involves putting pressure on companies, often through shareholder activism, to withdraw investment that helps the Sudanese government perpetuate genocide in Darfur. Only if a company refuses to change its behavior in response to shareholder engagement does the targeted divestment model call for divestment from that company. Such targeted divestment implicitly excludes companies involved in agriculture, the production and distribution of consumer goods, or the provision of goods and services intended to relieve human suffering or to promote health, religious and spiritual activities, or education.\n\nAs a response to consumer boycotts of large-scale and multinational businesses, some companies have marketed brands that do not bear the company's name on the packaging or in advertising. Activists such as [[Ethical Consumer]] produce information that reveals which companies own which brands and products so consumers can practice boycotts or moral purchasing more effectively. Another organization, [[Buycott.com]], provides an Internet-based smart-phone application that scans [[Universal Product Code]]s and displays corporate relationships to the user.<ref name=Forbes>{{cite web|last=O'Conner |first=Claire |title=New App Lets You Boycott Koch Brothers, Monsanto And More By Scanning Your Shopping Cart |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2013/05/14/new-app-lets-you-boycott-koch-brothers-monsanto-and-more-by-scanning-your-shopping-cart/ |publisher=Forbes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140321130346/http%3A%2F%2Fwww.forbes.com%2Fsites%2Fclareoconnor%2F2013%2F05%2F14%2Fnew-app-lets-you-boycott-koch-brothers-monsanto-and-more-by-scanning-your-shopping-cart%2F |archivedate=March 21, 2014 |date=May 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |accessdate=September 3, 2016 |quote=Burner figured the average supermarket shopper had no idea that buying Brawny paper towels, Angel Soft toilet paper or Dixie cups meant contributing cash to Koch Industries through its subsidiary Georgia-Pacific. }}</ref>\n\n\"Boycotts\" may be formally organized by governments as well.

Boycotts have been characterized by some as different from traditional forms of collective behavior in that they appear to be highly rational and dependent on existing norms and structures. Lewis Killian criticizes that characterization, pointing to the [[Tallahassee bus boycott]] as one example of a boycott that aligns with traditional collective behavior theory.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Killian|first=Lewis M.|date=1984-01-01|title=Organization, Rationality and Spontaneity in the Civil Rights Movement|jstor=2095529|journal=American Sociological Review|volume=49|issue=6|pages=770\u2013783|doi=10.2307/2095529}}</ref>\n\nPhilip Balsiger points out that political consumption (e.g., boycotts) tends to follow dual-purpose action repertoires, or scripts, which are used publicly to pressure boycott targets and to educate and recruit consumers. Balsiger finds one example in Switzerland, documenting activities of the [[Clean Clothes Campaign]], a public [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]]-backed campaign, that highlighted and disseminated information about local companies' ethical practices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Balsiger|first=Philip|date=2010-08-01|title=Making Political Consumers: The Tactical Action Repertoire of a Campaign for Clean Clothes|journal=Social Movement Studies|volume=9|issue=3|pages=311\u2013329|doi=10.1080/14742837.2010.493672|issn=1474-2837|url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/306807/files/Balsiger_Philip_-_Making_Political_Consumers_The_Tactital_Action_20180209.pdf}}</ref>\n\nDixon, Martin, and Nau analyzed 31 collective behavior campaigns against corporations that took place during the 1990s and 2000s. Protests considered successful included boycotts and were found to include a third party, either in the capacity of state intervention or of media coverage. State intervention may make boycotts more efficacious when corporation leaders fear the imposition of regulations. Media intervention may be a crucial contributor to a successful boycott because of its potential to damage the reputation of a corporation. Target corporations that were the most visible were found to be the most vulnerable to either market (protest causing economic loss) or mediated (caused by third-party) disruption. Third-party actors (i.e., the state or media) were more influential when a corporation had a high reputation\u2014when third-party activity was low, highly reputable corporations did not make the desired concessions to boycotters; when third-party activity was high, highly reputable corporations satisfied the demands of boycotters. The boycott, a prima facie market-disruptive tactic, often precipitates mediated disruption. The researchers' analysis led them to conclude that when boycott targets are highly visible and directly interact with and depend on local consumers who can easily find substitutes, they are more likely to make concessions. Koku, Akhigbe, and Springer also emphasize the importance of boycotts' threat of reputational damage, finding that boycotts alone pose more of a threat to a corporation's reputation than to its finances directly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Marc|last2=Martin|first2=Andrew W.|last3=Nau|first3=Michael|date=2016-04-12|title=Social Protest and Corporate Change: Brand Visibility, Third-Party Influence, and the Responsiveness of Corporations to Activist Campaigns *|journal=Mobilization: An International Quarterly|language=EN|volume=21|issue=1|pages=65\u201382|doi=10.17813/1086-671x-21-1-65}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Koku|first=Paul Sergius|last2=Akhigbe|first2=Aigbe|last3=Springer|first3=Thomas M.|date=1997-09-01|title=The Financial Impact of Boycotts and Threats of Boycott|journal=Journal of Business Research|volume=40|issue=1|pages=15\u201320|doi=10.1016/S0148-2963(96)00279-2}}</ref>\n\nPhilippe Delacote points out that a problem contributing to a generally low probability of success for any boycott is the fact that the consumers with the most power to cause market disruption are the least likely to participate; the opposite is true for consumers with the least power. Another collective behavior problem is the difficulty, or impossibility, of direct coordination amongst a dispersed group of boycotters. Yuksel and Mryteza emphasize the collective behavior problem of free riding in consumer boycotts, noting that some individuals may perceive participating to be too great an immediate personal utility sacrifice. They also note that boycotting consumers took the collectivity into account when deciding to participate, that is, consideration of joining a boycott as goal-oriented collective activity increased one's likelihood of participating. A corporation-targeted protest repertoire including boycotts and education of consumers presents the highest likelihood for success.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Delacote|first=Philippe|date=2009-09-01|title=On the Sources of Consumer Boycotts Ineffectiveness|journal=The Journal of Environment & Development|language=en|volume=18|issue=3|pages=306\u2013322|doi=10.1177/1070496509338849|issn=1070-4965|citeseerx=10.1.1.1030.5274}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yuksel|first=Ulku|last2=Mryteza|first2=Victoria|date=2009-02-01|title=An evaluation of strategic responses to consumer boycotts|journal=Journal of Business Research|series=Anti-consumption|volume=62|issue=2|pages=248\u2013259|doi=10.1016/j.jbusres.2008.01.032}}</ref>\n\n==Legality==\n\n[[File:HANDS OFF GAZA STOP THE BOMBING FREE PALESTINE - UK NATIONAL DEMONSTRATION.jpg|thumb|Protesters calling for a boycott of Israel]]\n\nBoycotts are generally legal in developed countries.

Opponents of boycotts historically have the choice of suffering under it, yielding to its demands, or attempting to suppress it through extralegal means, such as force and coercion.\n\nIn the United States, the antiboycott provisions of the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) apply to all \"U.S. persons\", defined to include individuals and companies located in the United States and their foreign affiliates. The antiboycott provisions are intended to prevent United States citizens and companies being used as instrumentalities of a foreign government's foreign policy. The EAR forbids participation in or material support of boycotts initiated by foreign governments, for example, the [[Arab League]] boycott of [[Israel]]. These persons are subject to the law when their activities relate to the sale, purchase, or transfer of goods or services (including the sale of information) within the United States or between the United States and a foreign country. This covers exports and imports, financing, forwarding and shipping, and certain other transactions that may take place wholly offshore.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security|work=Office of Antiboycott Compliance|url=http://www.bis.doc.gov/AntiboycottCompliance/oacrequirements.html#whatscovered|accessdate=March 20, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060319092529/http://www.bis.doc.gov/AntiboycottCompliance/oacrequirements.html#whatscovered <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = March 19, 2006}}</ref>\n\nHowever, the EAR only applies to ''foreign government initiated'' boycotts: a domestic boycott campaign arising within the United States that has the same object as the foreign-government-initiated boycott appears to be lawful, assuming that it is an independent effort not connected with the foreign government's boycott. \nOther legal impediments to certain boycotts remain. One set are [[Refusal to deal]] laws, which prohibit concerted efforts to eliminate competition by refusal to buy from or to sell to a party.<ref>[http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/concerted-refusal-to-deal.html Business Dictionary]</ref>  Similarly, boycotts may also run afoul of [[Anti-discrimination laws]]; for example, [[New Jersey]]'s Law Against Discrimination prohibits any place that offers goods, services and facilities to the general public, such as a restaurant, from denying or withholding any accommodation to (''i.e.'', not to engage in commerce with) an individual because of that individual's race (etc.).<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/dcr/accom.html New Jersey State official website]</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Boycott}}\n* [[List of boycotts]]\n* [[Anti-boycott]]\n* [[Call-out culture]]\n* [[Cancel culture]]\n* [[Dollar voting]]\n* [[Economic secession]]\n* [[Election boycott]]\n* [[Export restriction]]\n* [[Group boycott]]\n* [[Moral purchasing]]\n* [[No Platform]]\n* [[Non-violent resistance]]\n* [[Solidarity action]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Friedman, M.

Vice versa, his documentary films include elements of fiction. The scenes of gold diggers carrying sacks of mud uphill from their claims in the documentary ''Searching for El Dorado'' reminds the viewer of monumental feature movies. This evokes a mythologization of the real life, revealing the general in the particular. One can describe Herbrich\u2019s films as stories about human behavior, depicting the mechanisms of reality. Reaching limits and crossing borders is something to be taken in the literal sense in Herbrich\u2019s oeuvre.\u201c (Dieter Kosslick, 1994).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://582b21a9-78cb-4db6-9393-a87d88b491be.filesusr.com/ugd/1150ef_f943a2006f944fed97cc8d6bb0a017c2.pdf|title=Laudation Film Prize Munich|last=Kosslick|first=Dieter|date=1994|website=(German)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Filmography ==\n\n* 1979/80 ''The Proud and Sad Life of Mathias Kneissl'' (Das stolze und traurige Leben des Mathias Knei\u00dfl)\n* 1982 ''Dead Heart'' (Totes Herz)\n* 1983/84 ''Searching for El Dorado'' (Auf der Suche nach El Dorado)\n* 1983/84 ''Wodzeck''\n* 1985/86 ''The Bavarian Al Capone'' (Der Al Capone vom Donaumoos)\n* 1986/87 The World beyond the World (Die Welt jenseits der Welt)\n* 1987 ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1988/89 ''Earthbound'' (Erdenschwer)\n* 1991 ''Priests of the Condemned'' (Priester der Verdammten)\n* 1992/93 ''Rules of the Road'' (Gesetz der Stra\u00dfe)\n\n== Awards ==\n\n* 1980 and 1984 [[Deutsche Film- und Medienbewertung (FBW)|rating]] \u201cHighly Recommended\u201d for ''Mathias Kneissl'' and ''Searching for El Dorado''\n* 1985 Prix d'[[France 2|Antenne II]], Paris (Festival [[Cin\u00e9ma du R\u00e9el|Cinema du Re\u00e9l)]] for ''Searching for El Dorado''; 2nd Price Cine-stud Film Fest, Amsterdam for ''Searching for El Dorado''; Best Male Actor (International Film Festival Moskow) for Detlef K\u00fcgow in ''Wodzeck''\n* 1989 Honorary Mention at 4th Medikinale International Parma, Italy for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''; Honorary Mention at Red Cross and Health Film Fest Varna, Bulgaria for ''Bikini \u2013 mon amour''\n* 1990 Best Screenplay (Festival Imag Fic, Madrid) for ''Earthbound''; Best Artistic Contribution (Festival Europa Cinema, Viareggio)  for ''Earthbound''; Prix de la F\u00e9d\u00e9ration international del Cine Club (Festival Figuera da Foz, Portugal)  for ''Earthbound''\n* 1994 Film Prize of the City of Munich (lifetime achievement)\n\n== Retrospectives ==\n\n* 1987 Low Budget Festival Hamburg, Germany\n* 1989 Film Week Onikon Cinema Herdecke, Germany\n* 1990 West Virginia Film Festival, Charleston, USA\n* 1993 Film Museum D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany\n* 1994 Film Museum Munich, Germany\n* 2018 Breitwand Cinema Gauting, Germany\n\n== Social Engagement ==\n\n* 1990\u20132000 Sponsor \u201cAward for the Outstanding Documentary\u201c ([[Internationales Dokumentarfilmfestival M\u00fcnchen|International Documentary Film Festival Munich]]) \n* 2010 start of charity NGO \u201cFoundation Oliver Herbrich Children's' Fund\u201d\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Further reading ==\n*[https://portal.dnb.de/opac.htm?method=simpleSearch&query=1062258479 Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[German National Library]]\n*[https://search.onb.ac.at/primo-explore/search?institution=43ACC_ONB&vid=ONB&tab=default_tab&search_scope=ONB_gesamtbestand&mode=basic&displayMode=full&bulkSize=10&highlight=true&dum=true&query=any,contains,Oliver%20Herbrich&displayField=all&lang=de_DE Literature by Oliver Herbrich] in the [[Austrian National Library]]\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://oliver-herbrich.wixsite.com/archiv/english Oliver Herbrich Filmarchive] (English)\n*[https://www.filmportal.de/en/person/oliver-herbrich_f31295e67ff5a3cfe03053d50b373efb Oliver Herbrich] on filmportal.de (English)\n*[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0378688/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 Oliver Herbrich] on IMDb.com (English)\n*[https://www.zweitausendeins.de/filmlexikon/?sucheNach=personNr&wert=44 Oliver Herbrich] in Lexikon des int.
