One of the few prominent features of the northeast shore is [[San Sebasti\u00e1n Bay]]. To the south the island is bounded by the [[Beagle Channel]], south of which lie a series of islands included in Chilean territory. To the west the island has two major inlets, [[In\u00fatil Bay]] and [[Almirantazgo Fjord]]. The latter lies along the [[Magallanes\u2013Fagnano Fault]] and is a continuation of the [[Cami Lake]] depression in southern Tierra del Fuego.\n\nThe southwest part of the island, between the Almirantazgo Fjord and the Beagle Channel and extending west to end at Brecknock Peninsula on the Pacific Ocean, is mountainous with a heavily indented coastline, dominated by the [[Cordillera Darwin]]. Most of this part of the island is included in the [[Alberto de Agostini National Park]] of Chile.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Tierra del Fuego Gold Rush}}\nThe earliest human settlement occurred more than 10,000 years ago, as people migrated from the mainland, perhaps under pressure from competitors. The Yaghan people were some of the earliest known humans settling in Tierra del Fuego. Certain archeological sites at locations such as [[Navarino Island]], within the islands of Tierra del Fuego, have yielded artifacts and evidence of their culture from the Megalithic era.\n\nThe name Tierra del Fuego derives from Portuguese explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]], who was the first European to visit these lands in 1520, on his voyage to the [[Philippines]] from [[Spain]]. He believed he was seeing the many fires (fuego in Spanish) of the Amerindians, which were visible from the sea and that the \"Indians\" were waiting in the forests to ambush his armada. These were fires lit by the Yamana Indians who lived in the northern part of the island, to ward off the low temperatures in the area. Originally called the \"Land of Smoke,\" it was later changed to the more exciting \"Land of Fire.\"\n\nThe British commander [[Robert Fitzroy]], on his first voyage aboard {{HMS|Beagle}} in 1830, captured four native Fuegians after they stole a boat from his ship. The men included ''Orundellico,'' later named [[Jemmy Button]] by his crew. Fitzroy taught them English and took them with him on his return to England, where he took them to Court to meet the King and Queen in London. They became early celebrities. The surviving three were returned to Tierra del Fuego on the second voyage of ''Beagle'', which included the naturalist [[Charles Darwin]], who made extensive notes about his visit to the islands.\n\nIn 1881 [[Boundary Treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina|the island was divided]] between Argentina and Chile, each of which had previously claimed it entirely.\n\nThe [[1949 Tierra del Fuego earthquake]] took place on 17 December 1949, at 06:53:30 AM. It recorded magnitude 7.8 in the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]]. Its [[epicenter]] was located in the east of the Chilean [[Tierra del Fuego Province, Chile|Tierra del Fuego Province]], close to the Argentine border, at a depth of 30&nbsp;km (19&nbsp;mi).<ref name=\"sismica\"/>\n\nThis was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in the south of [[Argentina]]. It was felt with grade VIII in the [[Mercalli intensity scale]], and affected the settlements and some others like [[Punta Arenas, Chile|Punta Arenas]] and [[R\u00edo Gallegos]]. Due to low population density, damage was limited.<ref name=\"sismica\"/>\n\n==Climate==\nThe region has a [[subpolar oceanic climate]] (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Cfc) with short, cool summers and long, wet, moderate winters. The northeast is characterized by strong winds and little precipitation, while in the south and west it is very windy, foggy, and wet most of the year, with precipitation levels averaging {{convert|3,000|mm}} a year. The permanent snow line begins at {{convert|700|m}}. Places in the world with comparable climates are [[Aleutian Islands]], [[Iceland]], [[Kuril Islands]], [[Campbell Island (New Zealand)|Campbell Island]], the [[Fiordland]] area of [[New Zealand]], the [[Kerguelen Islands]], the [[Scottish Highlands]], and coastal areas of [[Norway]].\n\n==Flora==\nOnly 30% of the islands have forests, which are classified as [[Magellanic subpolar forests|Magellanic subpolar]]; the northeast is made up by [[steppe]] and cool [[semidesert]].\n\nThere are six species of tree found in Tierra del Fuego: [[Canelo (tree)|Canelo]] or [[Winter's Bark]] ([[Drimys winteri]]), [[Maytenus magellanica]], [[Pilgerodendron uviferum]] the southernmost conifer in the world, and three kinds of [[Nothofagus|southern beech]]; ''[[Nothofagus antarctica]]'', ''[[Nothofagus pumilio]]'' and the evergreen ''[[Nothofagus betuloides]]''. Edible fruits grow in open spaces in these forests, such as [[beach strawberry]] (''[[Fragaria chiloensis]]'' var. chiloensis forma chiloensis) and [[calafate]] (''[[Berberis buxifolia]]''), which have been collected by Indians and residents alike. These forests are unique in the world for having developed in a climate with such cold summers. Tree cover extends very close to the southernmost tip of South America. Winds are so strong that trees in wind-exposed areas grow twisted by the force of winds, and people call the trees \"[[Flag tree|flag-trees]]\" for the shape that they need to take in the fight with the wind. Tree vegetation extends as far south as the [[Isla de los Estados]], [[Navarino Island]] and the north of [[Hoste Island]]. At altitudes above, dwarf [[nothofagus]] communities are found. Going further south, [[Wollaston Islands]] and the south of Hoste Island are covered by subantarctic tundra.\n\nThe forests of Tierra del Fuego have been a source of trees that have been planted abroad in places with a similar climate but that were devoid of trees, such as the Faroe Islands and nearby archipelagos. Most species were gathered from the coldest places in Tierra del Fuego bordering the tundra. This resulted in positive changes, as the heavy winds and cool summers in the Faroe Islands had not formerly allowed the growth of trees from other regions in the world. In the Faroe Islands, the imported trees are used ornamentally, as curtains against wind, and for fighting erosion caused by storms and grazing.\n\n==Economy==\nThe main industries are oil, natural gas, sheep farming and ecotourism. On the Argentine side several electronics companies have been established. Ushuaia is home to the small brewing company Cervecer\u00eda Fueguina, which produces three beers under the Beagle brand name.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Diego Ram\u00edrez Islands]]\n* [[Karukinka Natural Park]]\n* [[List of divided islands]]\n* [[Magallanes and Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena Region]]\n* [[Tierra del Fuego gold rush]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{commons category-inline|Tierra del Fuego}}\n\n{{World's largest islands}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Isla Grande de Tierra Del Fuego}}\n[[Category:Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego| ]]\n[[Category:Islands of Tierra del Fuego|*]]\n[[Category:Islands of Argentina]]\n[[Category:Islands of Chile]]\n[[Category:Islands of Magallanes Region]]\n[[Category:Landforms of Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina]]\n[[Category:International islands]]\n[[Category:Argentina\u2013Chile border]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Island of Argentina and Chile}}\n{{about|the Island|the archipelago|Tierra del Fuego|the Argentine Province|Tierra del Fuego Province, Argentina}}\n{{distinguish|Isla del Fuego}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2014}}\n{{Infobox islands\n| name             = Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego\n| image_name       = Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego (5762115835).jpg\n| image_caption    = View of a part of Tierra del Fuego\n| map              = Tierra del Fuego\n| map_caption      = Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego\n| native_name      =\n| native_name_link =\n| location         = [[Tierra del Fuego]]\n| coordinates      = {{coord|54|S|69|W|region:CL_type:isle_scale:2500000|display=inline,title}}\n| archipelago      = [[Tierra del Fuego]]\n| total_islands    =\n| major_islands    =\n| area_km2         = 47992\n| rank             = 29th\n| highest_mount    = {{interlanguage link|Monte Shipton|es}}\n| elevation_m      = 2580\n| country          = {{ARG}}\n| country_admin_divisions_title   = [[Provinces of Argentina|Province]]\n| country_admin_divisions         = {{flag|Tierra del Fuego|name=Tierra del Fuego}}\n| country_largest_city            = [[R\u00edo Grande, Tierra del Fuego|R\u00edo Grande]]\n| country_largest_city_population = 67,038\n| country1                         = {{Flag|Chile}}\n| country1_admin_divisions_title   = [[Regions of Chile|Region]]\n| country1_admin_divisions         = {{Flag|Magallanes y Ant\u00e1rtica Chilena|name=Magallanes Region}}\n| country1_largest_city            = [[Porvenir, Chile|Porvenir]]\n| country1_largest_city_population = 4,807\n| population       =  133,902\n| population_as_of =\n| density_km2      =\n| ethnic_groups    =\n}}\n\n'''Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego''' ([[English language|English]]: ''Big Island of Land of Fire'') also formerly ''Isla de X\u00e1tiva''<ref>[http://www.cch.cat/pdf/el_mercantil_valenciano_140607.pdf Tierra de Fuego, antes \u00abIsla de Xativa\u00bb]</ref> is an island near the southern tip of [[South America]] from which it is separated by the [[Strait of Magellan]].

{"title_page": "Hemsley Winfield", "text_new": "'''Hemsley Winfield''' (April 20, 1907 \u2013 January 15, 1934) was an African-American dancer who created the New Negro Art Theater Dance Group.\n\n==Early years==\nHe was born Osborne Hemsley Winfield to a middle-class, African-American family in [[Yonkers, New York]]. Winfield struggled in Yonkers as jobs available to African-Americans remained menial. Contrary to the natural inclination to the residents of Yonkers at that time, Winfield pursued a career in the Arts, developing a strong background as an actor, director, stage technician, dancer and eventually a choreographer. With combination of Winfield's middle-class ambition as well as the growing cultural movement of the African-Americans at that time, Winfield was able to achieve acclaim by the Art world. In 1928, Winfield played the roles of Porter, Male Black Figure, Ethiopian, and the King of Borneo in [[E. E. Cummings]]' [[Him (Cummings play)|play ''Him'']] at the [[Provincetown Playhouse]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.gvsu.edu/websterm/cummings/Him_program.html|title=Him Program (1928)|website=faculty.gvsu.edu|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> Winfield first won his fame as the leading role of [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[Salome (play)|Salome]]'', which he won acclaim to in 1929. Winfield came upon the role as Salome when the female lead of the company fell ill, causing Winfield to dress in drag as the show was staged at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, New York. Winfield, during this time, continued to attend concerts by the great trailblazers of modern dance, who later served as an influence and sponsor for his choreographic work.\n\n==The New Negro Art Theater Dance Group==\nAs part of the \u201cLittle Theater movement\u201d Winfield started and directed the Sekondi Players of Yonkers in 1925.<ref>The New York Age. \"The Sekondi Players of Yonkers Present a Comedy Sketch at the Red Cross Exercises.\" July 10, 1926, p 10.</ref> Taking words from the Negro's African heritage Sekondi is the name of a city that is located on the south west coast of Ghana. In November 1927 Winfield and the Sekondi Players were performing a children's play, The Princess and the Cat, written by his mother, Jeroline Hemsley Winfield. This inaugural opening of children's plays was under his direction of The New Negro Art Theater.<ref>The New York Age. \"Negro Art Theatre to Give Children\u2019s Plays.\" Old Fulton New York Post Cards. November 12, 1927.</ref> This is the first reference to the New Negro Art Theater group that Winfield directed during the rest of his acting and dance career. On March 6, 1931, at the Saunders Trade School the dance company gave its first performance. Winfield served as the head organizer and director of the company. The first name of the dance company was The Bronze Ballet Plastique,<ref>Program (1931). All Star Benefit Performance for the Colored Citizens' Unemployment and Relief Committee of Yonkers, N.Y.  Saunders Trade School, Friday Ev'g, March 6, 1931.</ref> which lasted only one performance. Edna Guy was trained by [[Ruth St. Denis]] of the Denis-Shawn School of Dance, and performed as a guest in at least two of Winfield's concerts which soon grew to draw massive crowds. Edna Guy was never a member of the New Negro Art Theater Dance Group, the leading female dancers of the company were Ollie Burgoyne, Drusela Drew, and Midgie Lane. Winfield's choreographic work during this time fused uniquely German [[Expressionism]] with African-American themes and [[spiritual (music)|spirituals]]. \n  \nIn 1933, the company appeared in the premier of Louis Gruenberg's opera ''[[The Emperor Jones (opera)|The Emperor Jones]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City. Winfield took on the role of the Congo [[witch doctor]] in the piece.<ref>\n   \"'A Wall of Darkness Dividing the World': Blackness and Whiteness\",\n   JsSTOR: ''Cambridge Opera Journal'', 7 (March 1995), p.55-71, web:\n   [https://www.jstor.org/pss/823581 JS81].\n</ref> His first performance as the Witch Doctor was listed as January 7, 1933 and his last performance was March 18, 1933 Winfield also danced the role of the Witch Doctor in the performances in Philadelphia and Baltimore that year.<ref>\"Met Performance CID:113580.\" archives.metoperafamily.org. n.d. http://archives.metoperafamily.org/archives/</ref> Controversy around the work resulted from the Met's original request to blacken White dancers' faces rather than use Black dancers, but Tibbett threatened to quit, and the Met relented.<ref name=\"PBS_c\">\n   \"Great Performances - Behind the Dance\",\n   Pioneers in Negro Concert Dance: 1931-1937, webpage:\n   [https://www.pbs.org/wnet/freetodance/behind/behind_pioneers_c.html BPc].\n</ref> His final performance of the 1933 season was reviewed as \u201ca thrilling exhibition of savage dancing\u201d<ref>Gulden, Bruce. \"Louis Gruenberg's Opera \"The Emperor Jones.\" Dance Culture, March 1933: 12.</ref> and \u201chis sinister and frantic caperings as the Witch Doctor made even the most sluggish, opera-infected blood run cold.\u201d<ref>Watkins, M.

He achieved amazing results in such a short time.\"<ref>New York Herald Tribune. \"Winfield Dead at 27.\" New York Herald Tribune, 1934.</ref>\n\n==Contributions==\nWinfield's most influential contribution was his ongoing support of the \"new negro\", promoting a rush of African-American talent during this period of time. Winfield used the black body in dance and other art forms as raw material in order to show racial configuration within his company to an audience. Winfield projected this \"new negro\" in support of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], a movement referring to the artistic and sociocultural awakening among African-Americans during the 1920s and 1930s as a response to the political and economic events resulting from World War 1. In October 1933, one of Winfield's first Forum Recitals was \u201cWhat shall the Negro dance about?\u201d He opened the forum discussion by stating: \u201call races, no matter what color, had fundamental human feelings and ideas to express in movement.\u201d The Negro has primitive African material that he should never lose. The Negro has his work songs of the South which he alone can express. It's hard for me to say what the Negro should dance about. What has anyone to dance about?\"<ref>The Washington Tribune. \"Colored Artists Play Big Part in Workers' Dance in New York.\" The Washington Tribune, October 12, 1933.</ref>\n\n== Response to his work==\nThe majority of supporters of the Harlem Renaissance Movement endorsed the work of Winfield and his counterparts such as Dunham and Edna Guy. Critics considered Winfield to be \"the initiator and chief exponent of Negro concert dancing in the United States.\" Some, however, did not quite support the message he had been trying to create with his [[choreography|choreographic]] style. Critic John Martin remarked that he felt as though the \"Negro dancers [were] performing material associated with white dancers.\" This inevitable gap between what the public thought to be suitable for black and white dancers respectively was, in fact, the gap that Winfield spent his career trying to fill. Martin also noted that Winfield had not fallen into the trap of reproducing \u201cwhite\u201d choreography or to associating himself with the \u201camusement business\u201d of Harlem. The first trap would have made his company a novelty and his company would not have lasted, and the second would have put him into the category of performances for \u201cwhite amusement seekers.\u201d<ref>Martin, J. \"The Dance: A Negro Play.\" New York Times, March 12, 1932: 17.</ref> Part of Winfield's struggle both politically and choreographically, naturally, was from where he drew inspiration. Having come from a period of time where the past was predominately filled with white dancers, The question of what black dancers should look like, move like, and reflect on, was brought to the table by Winfield and his peers. The question was not completely solved until the 1940s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n; Sources\n* Foulkes, Julia L. ''Modern Bodies''. North Carolina: UNC P, 2002.\n* Manning, Susan.

The first trap would have made his company a novelty and his company would not have lasted, and the second would have put him into the category of performances for \u201cwhite amusement seekers.\u201d<ref>Martin, J. \"The Dance: A Negro Play.\" New York Times, March 12, 1932: 17.</ref> Part of Winfield's struggle both politically and choreographically, naturally, was from where he drew inspiration. Having come from a period of time where the past was predominately filled with white dancers, The question of what black dancers should look like, move like, and reflect on, was brought to the table by Winfield and his peers. The question was not completely solved until the 1940s.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n; Sources\n* Foulkes, Julia L. ''Modern Bodies''. North Carolina: UNC P, 2002.\n* Manning, Susan.

It was the second time that the important [[Persian Gulf]] city had fallen to the Iranian [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]].\n\n[[Basra]], located in present-day [[Iraq]], had already been under Safavid control from 1508 to 1524, when it was lost upon [[Shah]] (\"King\") [[Ismail I]]'s death. In the ensuing period, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], rivals of the Safavids, managed to establish nominal rule over the city. ''De facto'' rule of Basra remained in the hands of the local Arab Al-Mughamis tribe, a branch of the [[Al-Muntafiq|Banu'l-Muntafiq]]. In 1596, the Ottoman governor of Basra, Ali Pasha, sold his office to a local named Afrasiyab. Over the next {{circa|70}} years, Basra was considered a hereditary ''[[eyalet]]'' under Afrasiyab and his descendants.\n\nThe Safavid attempts to retake Basra in 1624, 1625, and 1628\u20131629 proved unsuccessful, through a combination of [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] interference, pressing concerns on other fronts and, finally, Shah [[Abbas the Great]]'s ({{reign|1588|1629}}) death. Basra continued to be pulled towards the Safavids due to geographical and economic reasons. Issues related to pilgrimage, uneasy Ottoman relations with the rulers of Basra, and unrest in the southern part of Ottoman-held Iraq continued to irk the Safavids and prompt Safavid involvement in southern Iraq. When the Safavids were given the opportunity to regain territory in Iraq under Shah [[Suleiman of Persia|Suleiman I]] ({{reign|1666|1694}}) however, they did not act. For instance, in 1667, when the Ottomans conducted a punitive expedition to Basra, its ruler Husayn Pasha of the Afrasiyab dynasty evacuated the city's population to Safavid territory and offered control of Basra to the Safavids. Shah Suleiman I dismissed Husayn Pasha's pleas as he did not want to antagonize the Ottomans.\n\nIn 1690, plague and famine led to tribal unrest among the Muntafiqs in southern Iraq. In 1695, the local Arab tribal leader Shaykh Mane ibn Mughamis led his tribesmen in a revolt against the Ottomans. Shaykh Mane and his men gained control of Basra with the support of 5,000 members of the [[Musha'sha'iyyah|Moshasha]], a Muslim [[Shia Islam|Shi'i sect]]. In 1697, members of the Moshasha loyal to Farajollah Khan, the Safavid-appointed governor of Arabestan Province, defeated Shaykh Mane and his men, ousting them from the city. The Safavid government realized that Shaykh Mane and his men were keen to retake Basra and wanted to attack nearby [[Hoveyzeh]], the capital of Arabestan Province. This time the Safavids under Shah [[Sultan Husayn]] ({{reign|1694|1722}}) reacted by sending a force led by Ali Mardan Khan to Basra. On 26 March 1697 troops sent by the Safavid government took control of the city. However, the Safavids were concerned about the weakened state of [[Military of the Safavid dynasty|their military]] and did not want to disrupt the peace with the Ottomans. This, in combination with continued pressure by Shaykh Mane and his tribesmen on Basra, eventually led the Safavids to decide to return Basra to Ottoman control. On 9 March 1701, the Safavid forces withdrew from Basra, and on 10 March the Ottomans retook control of the city.\n\n==Background==\n===Geopolitical significance of Basra===\n[[Basra]] was of particular geopolitical importance in the 16th and 17th centuries, being on the border between the rival ([[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]) [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and ([[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]]) [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] empires, on the frontier of the [[Arabian Desert]], and having a pivotal role in the growth of the [[Indian Ocean trade]].{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}} As a result, possession of Basra was contested between the Ottomans and Safavids. Although the two empires claimed jurisdiction over the city at various times, their authority was nominal for the most part, with ''de facto'' control being in the hands of local governors who ruled under Safavid or Ottoman [[suzerainty]].{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} During this period, large parts of present-day [[Iraq]] were made unsafe by the depredations of the semi-nomadic and \"fiercely independent\" [[Arabs|Arab]] (in the south) and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribes (in the north), who attacked passing [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]]s.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} The weather in the south, in the [[Sawad]], was harmful to health with plagues and killer epidemics contributing to turbulent periods in Basra's history.{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} Nevertheless, Basra became an important traffic hub for the [[Persian Gulf]] area, both for merchants and for [[Hajj|pilgrim]]s en route to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}\n\n[[File:Shah Ismail I.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of Ismail I|[[Venetian school (art)|Venetian]] portrait of Ismail I, kept at the [[Uffizi]] Gallery in Florence]]\n\n===From the 16th to the 17th century===\nThe [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Arab tribe of Al-Mughamis, a branch of the [[Al-Muntafiq|Banu'l-Muntafiq]] inhabiting the area between [[Kufa]] and Basra, established their rule over Basra in the early fifteenth century.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}} From 1436 to 1508 ''de facto'' control was in the hands of the [[Musha'sha'iyyah|Moshasha]], a tribal confederation of radical Shi'ites found mainly on the edges of the marshes at the border of the Safavid province of Arabestan (present-day [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]).{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}\n\nIn 1508, during the reign of the first Safavid ruler, [[Shah]] [[Ismail I]] ({{reign|1501|1524}}), Basra and the Moshasha became part of the Safavid Empire.{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}{{efn|According to [[Willem Floor]] (2008), a certain Shaykh Afrasiyab (the local ruler of Basra, not to be mistaken with the later Afrasiyab of Basra) came to [[Shiraz]] in 1504 to pledge his allegiance to Ismail I.{{sfn|Floor|2008|page=165}} Ismail I in turn confirmed him in his possessions and position as governor (''[[Vali (governor)|vali]]'') of Basra.{{sfn|Floor|2008|page=165}}}} The Moshasha proved to be valuable allies to the Safavids, often acting as Safavid proxies in campaigns against the Arabs of southern Iraq and Basra, led by a Safavid-appointed governor. Although nominally Safavid subjects, they had broad autonomy, and their territory served as a [[buffer zone]] between the Safavids and the Ottomans.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=55}}\n\nIn 1524, following Ismail I's death, the Al-Mughamis resumed effective control.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}} Twelve years later, during the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1532\u201355)|Ottoman\u2013Safavid War of 1532\u20131555]], the ruler of Basra, Rashid ibn Mughamis, acknowledged the Ottoman sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] ({{reign|1520|1566}}) as his suzerain, who in turn confirmed him as governor of the city.{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}} Though Basra submitted to the Ottomans, the Ottoman hold over Basra was initially tenuous.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} This changed in 1546, when an Ottoman garrison was installed in the city after a Moshasha uprising.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|pages=53, 58}}\n\nDespite being [[Ottoman Iraq|supplanted by the Ottomans]] as rulers of Iraq, the Safavids never gave up their claim to it, at least in court rhetoric.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} In reality, most of Iraq was foreign territory to the Safavids, even though the south was inhabited by many Shi'ites. As the modern historian Rudi Matthee explains, {{quote|The area was difficult to defend, cut off as it was from the central [[Persian plateau]] by the [[Zagros Mountains|Zagros mountain range]].

It was the second time that the important [[Persian Gulf]] city had fallen to the Iranian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid Empire]].\n\n[[Basra]], located in present-day [[Iraq]], had already been under Safavid control from 1508 to 1524, when it was lost upon [[Shah]] (\"King\") [[Ismail I]]'s death. In the ensuing period, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], rivals of the Safavids, managed to establish nominal rule over the city. ''De facto'' rule of Basra remained in the hands of the local Arab Al-Mughamis tribe, a branch of the [[Al-Muntafiq|Banu'l-Muntafiq]]. In 1596, the Ottoman governor of Basra, Ali Pasha, sold his office to a local named Afrasiyab. Over the next {{circa|70}} years, Basra was considered a hereditary ''[[eyalet]]'' under Afrasiyab and his descendants.\n\nThe Safavid attempts to retake Basra in 1624, 1625, and 1628\u20131629 proved unsuccessful, through a combination of [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] interference, pressing concerns on other fronts and, finally, Shah [[Abbas the Great]]'s ({{reign|1588|1629}}) death. Basra continued to be pulled towards the Safavids due to geographical and economic reasons. Issues related to pilgrimage, uneasy Ottoman relations with the rulers of Basra, and unrest in the southern part of Ottoman-held Iraq continued to irk the Safavids and prompt Safavid involvement in southern Iraq. When the Safavids were given the opportunity to regain territory in Iraq under Shah [[Suleiman of Persia|Suleiman I]] ({{reign|1666|1694}}) however, they did not act. For instance, in 1667, when the Ottomans conducted a punitive expedition to Basra, its ruler Husayn Pasha of the Afrasiyab dynasty evacuated the city's population to Safavid territory and offered control of Basra to the Safavids. Shah Suleiman I dismissed Husayn Pasha's pleas as he did not want to antagonize the Ottomans.\n\nIn 1690, plague and famine led to tribal unrest among the Muntafiqs in southern Iraq. In 1695, the local Arab tribal leader Shaykh Mane ibn Mughamis led his tribesmen in a revolt against the Ottomans. Shaykh Mane and his men gained control of Basra with the support of 5,000 members of the [[Musha'sha'iyyah|Moshasha]], a Muslim [[Shia Islam|Shi'i sect]]. In 1697, members of the Moshasha loyal to Farajollah Khan, the Safavid-appointed governor of Arabestan Province, defeated Shaykh Mane and his men, ousting them from the city. The Safavid government realized that Shaykh Mane and his men were keen to retake Basra and wanted to attack nearby [[Hoveyzeh]], the capital of Arabestan Province. This time the Safavids under Shah [[Sultan Husayn]] ({{reign|1694|1722}}) reacted by sending a force led by Ali Mardan Khan to Basra. On 26 March 1697 troops sent by the Safavid government took control of the city. However, the Safavids were concerned about the weakened state of [[Military of the Safavid dynasty|their military]] and did not want to disrupt the peace with the Ottomans. This, in combination with continued pressure by Shaykh Mane and his tribesmen on Basra, eventually led the Safavids to decide to return Basra to Ottoman control. On 9 March 1701, the Safavid forces withdrew from Basra, and on 10 March the Ottomans retook control of the city.\n\n==Background==\n===Geopolitical significance of Basra===\n[[Basra]] was of particular geopolitical importance in the 16th and 17th centuries, being on the border between the rival ([[Sunni Islam|Sunni]]) [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and ([[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]]) [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] empires, on the frontier of the [[Arabian Desert]], and having a pivotal role in the growth of the [[Indian Ocean trade]].{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}} As a result, possession of Basra was contested between the Ottomans and Safavids. Although the two empires claimed jurisdiction over the city at various times, their authority was nominal for the most part, with ''de facto'' control being in the hands of local governors who ruled under Safavid or Ottoman [[suzerainty]].{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} During this period, large parts of present-day [[Iraq]] were made unsafe by the depredations of the semi-nomadic and \"fiercely independent\" [[Arabs|Arab]] (in the south) and [[Kurds|Kurdish]] tribes (in the north), who attacked passing [[Caravan (travellers)|caravan]]s.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} The weather in the south, in the [[Sawad]], was harmful to health with plagues and killer epidemics contributing to turbulent periods in Basra's history.{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} Nevertheless, Basra became an important traffic hub for the [[Persian Gulf]] area, both for merchants and for [[Hajj|pilgrim]]s en route to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]].{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}\n\n[[File:Shah Ismail I.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Painting of Ismail I|[[Venetian school (art)|Venetian]] portrait of Ismail I, kept at the [[Uffizi]] Gallery in Florence]]\n\n===From the 16th to the 17th century===\nThe [[Bedouins|Bedouin]] Arab tribe of Al-Mughamis, a branch of the [[Al-Muntafiq|Banu'l-Muntafiq]] inhabiting the area between [[Kufa]] and Basra, established their rule over Basra in the early fifteenth century.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}} From 1436 to 1508 ''de facto'' control was in the hands of the [[Musha'sha'iyyah|Moshasha]], a tribal confederation of radical Shi'ites found mainly on the edges of the marshes at the border of the Safavid province of Arabestan (present-day [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]]).{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=57}}\n\nIn 1508, during the reign of the first Safavid ruler, [[Shah]] [[Ismail I]] ({{reign|1501|1524}}), Basra and the Moshasha became part of the Safavid Empire.{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}{{efn|According to [[Willem Floor]] (2008), a certain Shaykh Afrasiyab (the local ruler of Basra, not to be mistaken with the later Afrasiyab of Basra) came to [[Shiraz]] in 1504 to pledge his allegiance to Ismail I.{{sfn|Floor|2008|page=165}} Ismail I in turn confirmed him in his possessions and position as governor (''[[Vali (governor)|vali]]'') of Basra.{{sfn|Floor|2008|page=165}}}} The Moshasha proved to be valuable allies to the Safavids, often acting as Safavid proxies in campaigns against the Arabs of southern Iraq and Basra, led by a Safavid-appointed governor.

Led by Shaykh Mane ibn Mughamis, the Muntafiq Arabs revolted against the Ottomans.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} The Ottoman government conducted a punitive campaign but was unable to put down Shaykh Mane's revolt. In 1695, Shaykh Mane captured Basra with the help of the local population and ousted the Ottoman governor and troops.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=74}} During his short-lived tenure as ruler of Basra, he was considered to be relatively benevolent.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} The Safavids were not especially pleased with this turn of events. Not only had the rebels seized control of an important city on the Safavid border\u2014they had also plundered a number of pilgrim caravans near Basra during their capture of the city. To the Safavids, this proved that Shaykh Mane held expansionist ambitions and might pose a danger to their interests.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=74}} The Safavid-appointed ''[[Vali (governor)|vali]]'' (\"viceroy\", \"governor\") of neighbouring Arabestan province, Farajollah Khan, was also concerned about the links between the Moshasha and Shaykh Mane. Some 5,000 dissatisfied members of the Moshasha, followers of his nephew Sayyed Mahmud, had assisted Shaykh Mane in the capture of Basra in 1695.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=74}} Just two years later, in 1697, Farajollah Khan and his loyal Moshasha clashed with Shaykh Mane and his Moshasha sympathisers.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=74}}\n\n==Safavid control: 1697\u20131701==\n[[File:Sultan_Husayn_by_Bruyn.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Artwork depicting Sultan Husayn|Portrait of [[Sultan Husayn]] by [[Cornelis de Bruijn]]]]\nFarajollah Khan and his loyal Moshasha emerged victorious and captured Basra in name of the Safavid Shah, prompting Shaykh Mane to flee.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=74}} When the Safavids realized that Shaykh Mane and his tribesmen were keen to retake Basra,{{efn|Indeed, Shaykh Mane had regrouped and gathered support from various Arab tribes, including the [[Bani Khalid|Banu Khalid]], the Fudul and the [[Rabi`ah|Rabi'a]].{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}}}} and even wanted to attack [[Hoveyzeh]], the provincial capital of Arabestan Province, Shah Sultan Husayn issued a ''[[Firman|farman]]'' (a decree), ordering an army from the Safavid province of Lorestan led by Ali Mardan Khan, chief of the [[Feyli Kurds|Fayli tribe]] and the governor of [[Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad Province|Kohgiluyeh]], to move on Basra.{{sfn|Longrigg|Lang|2015}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}} On 26 March 1697 regular Safavid troops took control of the city, and Ali Mardan Khan was appointed governor.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}} This marked the start of the second period of Safavid control of Basra.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} Later that year, Ali Mardan Khan was replaced by Ebrahim Khan, the governor of Dawraq (modern-day [[Shadegan]], Khuzestan).{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}}\n\nThough the Safavids had established control over Basra, they refrained from laying \"full and definitive claim\" to the city.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}} Sultan Husayn's government was still concerned not to disrupt the peace with the Ottomans. Furthermore, they were aware of Iran's military weakness at the time and realized it would be \"difficult to hold on to a city located in an extremely volatile region\".{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}} The activities of the Kurdish rebel Suleiman Baba, who had captured the town of Ardalan and the fortress of [[Urmia]] near the Ottoman border in the same year, reinforced their concerns.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}} In late 1697, Shaykh Mane, having made peace with his former enemy Farajollah Khan,{{efn|Farajollah Khan had been dismissed as ''vali'' of Arabestan around the same time by the central Safavid government for his role in the occupation of Basra.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}}}} and assisted by Moshasha defectors, defeated a large Safavid force near the fortress of Khurma (Khorma) and captured their general. This forced Sultan Husayn to offer the Basra to the Ottomans.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}} Sultan Husayn had keys made of pure gold and sent Rostam Khan Zanganeh as ambassador to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]], to hand them over to the Ottoman Sultan [[Mustafa II]] ({{reign|1695|1703}}), in a symbolic gesture offering the city to Ottoman control.{{sfn|Matthee|2006a|page=75}} However, although the Safavids continued showing a willingness to return Basra to the Ottomans and entertained an Ottoman embassy in Isfahan between December 1698 and April 1699, Basra would stay in Safavid hands until 1701.{{sfn|Matthee|2006b}}{{efn|In the letter given by Mustafa II to the Shah (carried by the embassy), the Ottoman sultan apparently \"had not responded to the question of whether or not he wished to recover Basra.

As a process, it may be understood as the opposite of personification, a figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are endowed with human qualities; dehumanization then is the disendowment of these same qualities or a reduction to abstraction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn almost all contexts, dehumanization is used pejoratively along with a disruption of social norms, with the former applying to the actor(s) of behavioral dehumanization and the latter applying to the action(s) or processes of dehumanization. For instance, there is the case of dehumanization for those who are perceived lacking in [[culture]] or [[civility]], which are concepts that are believed to distinguish humans from animals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dehumanizing Christians: Cultural Competition in a Multicultural World|last=Yancey|first=George|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2014|isbn=9781412852678|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=36}}</ref> As [[social norms]] define what humane behavior is, reflexively these same social norms define what human behavior is not, or what is inhumane.  Dehumanization differs from inhumane behaviors or processes in its breadth to include the emergence of new competing social norms.  This emergence then is the action of dehumanization until the old norms lose out to the competing new norms, which will then redefine the action of dehumanization.  If the new norms lose acceptance then the action remains one of dehumanization and its severity is comparative to past examples throughout history.  However, dehumanization's definition remains in a reflexive state of a [[Type\u2013token distinction|type-token ambiguity]] relative to both scales individual and societal.\n\n[[File:Contest To Cut Down 100 People.jpg|thumb|Two Japanese officers in [[Nanjing Massacre|occupied China]] competing to see who could kill (with a sword) [[Contest to kill 100 people using a sword|one hundred people first]].]]\nBiologically, dehumanization can be described as an [[introduced species]] marginalizing the human species or an introduced person/process that debases other persons inhumanely.\n\nIn [[political science]] and [[jurisprudence]], the act of dehumanization is the inferential alienation of [[human rights]] or [[denaturalization]] of [[natural rights]], a definition contingent upon presiding [[international law]] rather than [[social norms]] limited by [[human geography]].

Paul]] has researched written extensively of historic accounts of atrocious acts of violence against First Nations peoples in North America. His work states European colonialism in Canada and America was a subjugation of the indigenous peoples and is an unequivocal violent series of crimes against humanity which has been unparalleled historically. Tens of millions First Nations died at the hands of European invaders in an attempt to appropriate the entirety of the land. Those hundreds of diverse civilizations and communities who thrived across North America thousands of years before the exploits of Christopher Columbus were ultimately destroyed. Dehumanization occurred in the form of barbaric genocidal processes of murder, rape, starvation, enslavement, allocation, and germ warfare. Of the myriad of ways the English performed ethnic cleansing, one of the most frequent was the practice of bounty hunting and scalping\u2014where colonial conquerors would raid communities and remove the scalps of children and adults. This war crime of scalping was most prevalent when maritime colonialists repeatedly attempted to eradicate Daniel N. Paul's ancestors, the Mi'kmaq. Scalping was common practice in many United States areas all the way until the 1860s in attempt to completely wipe out the remaining First Nations.<ref>{{Cite web|title = AMERICAN INDIANS DEHUMANIZED BY DEMONIZING PROPAGANDA|url = http://www.danielnpaul.com/NativeAmericansDemonized.html|website = www.danielnpaul.com|accessdate = 2015-12-08}}</ref>\n\n== Causes and facilitating factors ==\nSeveral lines of psychological research relate to the concept of dehumanization.

Expatriate has been found to be a word to describe the privileged, often [[Light skin|light-skinned]] people newly residing in an area and has connotations which suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new area to reside and infers a much less desirable meaning. Further, \"immigrant\" is a word that can be paired with \"illegal\", which harbours a deeply negative connotation to those projecting social cognition towards the other. The misuse and perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. \"Most of the time when we hear [illegal immigrant] used, most of the time the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal.

In the 1990s reportedly California State Police classified incidents involving young men of African ancestry as no humans involved.

Such efforts often depend on preexisting racist, [[sectarianism|sectarian]], or otherwise biased beliefs, which governments play upon through various types of [[mass media|media]], presenting \"enemies\" as barbaric, as undeserving of rights, and as threats to the nation. Alternatively, states sometimes present an enemy government or way of life as barbaric and its citizens as childlike and incapable of managing their own affairs. Such arguments have been used as a pretext for [[colonialism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n[[The Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Rwandan genocide]] have both been cited as atrocities facilitated by a government sanctioned dehumanization of its citizens. In terms of the Holocaust, government proliferated propaganda created a culture of dehumanization of the Jewish population. Crimes like [[lynching]] (especially in the United States) are often thought of as the result of popular bigotry and government apathy.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n[[Anthropologist]]s [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Floyd Matson]] famously wrote that dehumanization might well be considered \"the fifth [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|horseman of the apocalypse]]\" because of the inestimable damage it has dealt to society.<ref>Montagu, Ashley and Matson, Floyd W.

They cannot, for example, in public wear \"gang clothes\", or carry \"marking substances\" like paint cans, pens, and other writing utensils that can be used for graffiti. Yuille argues that, although the state prevents suspected gang members from using certain property in public, this is only one small part of the taking. The more insidious yet invisible harm is the deprivation of identity property, which she defines as property that implicates how people understand themselves. Additionally, Yuille argues that the state treats young gang members like super predators instead of like the children they, in fact, are. Consequently, the City of Monrovia has subjected suspected gang members to a dignity taking because dehumanization occurs alongside property deprivation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Media-driven dehumanization ===\n\nThe [[propaganda model]] of [[Edward S.

The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] and the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on Jewish people are two such examples. In the former, Africans Americans with syphilis were recruited to participate in a study about the course of the disease. Even when treatment and a cure were eventually developed, they were withheld from the Black participants so that researchers could continue their study. Similarly, Nazi scientists conducted horrific experiments on Jewish people during the Holocaust. This was justified in the name of research and progress which is indicative of the far reaching affects that the culture of dehumanization had upon this society. When this research came to light, efforts were made to protect participants of future research, and currently [[institutional review board]]s exist to safeguard individuals from being taken advantage of by scientists.\n\nIn a medical context, the passage of time has served to make some dehumanizing practices more acceptable, not less. While dissections of human cadavers was seen as dehumanizing in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (see [[History of anatomy]]), the value of dissections as a training aid is such that they are now more widely accepted.

As a process, it may be understood as the opposite of personification, a figure of speech in which inanimate objects or abstractions are endowed with human qualities; dehumanization then is the disendowment of these same qualities or a reduction to abstraction.{{Citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn almost all contexts, dehumanization is used pejoratively along with a disruption of social norms, with the former applying to the actor(s) of behavioral dehumanization and the latter applying to the action(s) or processes of dehumanization. For instance, there is the case of dehumanization for those who are perceived lacking in [[culture]] or [[civility]], which are concepts that are believed to distinguish humans from animals.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dehumanizing Christians: Cultural Competition in a Multicultural World|last=Yancey|first=George|publisher=Transaction Publishers|year=2014|isbn=9781412852678|location=New Brunswick, NJ|pages=36}}</ref> As [[social norms]] define what humane behavior is, reflexively these same social norms define what human behavior is not, or what is inhumane.  Dehumanization differs from inhumane behaviors or processes in its breadth to include the emergence of new competing social norms.  This emergence then is the action of dehumanization until the old norms lose out to the competing new norms, which will then redefine the action of dehumanization.  If the new norms lose acceptance then the action remains one of dehumanization and its severity is comparative to past examples throughout history.  However, dehumanization's definition remains in a reflexive state of a [[Type\u2013token distinction|type-token ambiguity]] relative to both scales individual and societal.\n\n[[File:Contest To Cut Down 100 People.jpg|thumb|Two Japanese officers in [[Nanjing Massacre|occupied China]] competing to see who could kill (with a sword) [[Contest to kill 100 people using a sword|one hundred people first]].]]\nBiologically, dehumanization can be described as an [[introduced species]] marginalizing the human species or an introduced person/process that debases other persons inhumanely.\n\nIn [[political science]] and [[jurisprudence]], the act of dehumanization is the inferential alienation of [[human rights]] or [[denaturalization]] of [[natural rights]], a definition contingent upon presiding [[international law]] rather than [[social norms]] limited by [[human geography]].

Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, and political alignment. Expatriate has been found to be a word to describe the privileged, often [[Light skin|light-skinned]] people newly residing in an area and has connotations which suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new area to reside and infers a much less desirable meaning. Further, \"immigrant\" is a word that can be paired with \"illegal\", which harbours a deeply negative connotation to those projecting social cognition towards the other. The misuse and perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. \"Most of the time when we hear [illegal immigrant] used, most of the time the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal.

In both studies, subjects were shown a homophobic epithet, its labelled category, or unspecific insult. Subjects were later prompted to associate words of animal and human connotations to both heterosexuals and homosexuals. The results found that the malignant language, when compared to the unspecific insult and categorized labels, subjects would not connect the human connotative words with homosexuals. Further, the same assessment was done to measure effects the language may have on the physical distancing between the subject and homosexuals.Similarly to the prior associative language study, it was found that subjects became more physically distant to the homosexual, indicating the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language does not.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Not \"just words\": Exposure to homophobic epithets leads to dehumanizing and physical distancing from gay men|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|volume = 46|issue = 2|date = 2015-01-01|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 237\u2013248|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2148|first = Fabio|last = Fasoli|first2 = Maria Paola|last2 = Paladino|first3 = Andrea|last3 = Carnaghi|first4 = Jolanda|last4 = Jetten|first5 = Brock|last5 = Bastian|first6 = Paul G.|last6 = Bain|hdl = 10071/12705|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/90602/11/EJSP_dehumanization_uncorrected.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Human anatomy ===\nIn the United States of America, Americans of African ancestry were dehumanised via the classification of being deemed as a primate, not a human.  The United States of America Constitution that took place in 1787 stated when collecting census data \"all other persons\" in reference to enslaved Africans will be counted as three-fifths of a human being. In the 1990s reportedly California State Police classified incidents involving young men of African ancestry as no humans involved. A California police officer who was also involved in the [[Rodney King]] beating described a dispute between an American couple with African ancestry as \"something right out of gorillas in the mist\".

Governments sometimes represent \"enemy\" civilians or soldiers as less than human so that voters will be more likely to support a war they may otherwise consider mass murder.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Dictatorship]]s use the same process to prevent opposition by citizens. Such efforts often depend on preexisting racist, [[sectarianism|sectarian]], or otherwise biased beliefs, which governments play upon through various types of [[mass media|media]], presenting \"enemies\" as barbaric, as undeserving of rights, and as threats to the nation. Alternatively, states sometimes present an enemy government or way of life as barbaric and its citizens as childlike and incapable of managing their own affairs. Such arguments have been used as a pretext for [[colonialism]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n[[The Holocaust]] during [[World War II]] and the [[Rwandan genocide]] have both been cited as atrocities facilitated by a government sanctioned dehumanization of its citizens. In terms of the Holocaust, government proliferated propaganda created a culture of dehumanization of the Jewish population. Crimes like [[lynching]] (especially in the United States) are often thought of as the result of popular bigotry and government apathy.{{cn|date=September 2019}}\n\n[[Anthropologist]]s [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Floyd Matson]] famously wrote that dehumanization might well be considered \"the fifth [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|horseman of the apocalypse]]\" because of the inestimable damage it has dealt to society.<ref>Montagu, Ashley and Matson, Floyd W.

Such \"[[good versus evil]]\" claims help end substantive debate (see also [[thought-terminating clich\u00e9]]).\n\n=== Property actions ===\nSeveral scholars have written on how dehumanization also occurs in the property takings (where the government is involved in taking away individuals' property without just cause and recompense) realm.

People who live in trailer parks are often dehumanized and colloquially referred to as \"[[trailer trash]]\". The problem is that mobile park closings are increasingly common, and\u2014even though called \"mobile\" homes\u2014many of these homes cannot move or the expense of moving them outweighs their value.

They cannot, for example, in public wear \"gang clothes\", or carry \"marking substances\" like paint cans, pens, and other writing utensils that can be used for graffiti. Yuille argues that, although the state prevents suspected gang members from using certain property in public, this is only one small part of the taking. The more insidious yet invisible harm is the deprivation of identity property, which she defines as property that implicates how people understand themselves. Additionally, Yuille argues that the state treats young gang members like super predators instead of like the children they, in fact, are. Consequently, the City of Monrovia has subjected suspected gang members to a dignity taking because dehumanization occurs alongside property deprivation.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Media-driven dehumanization ===\n\nThe [[propaganda model]] of [[Edward S.

The [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment]] and the [[Nazi human experimentation]] on Jewish people are two such examples. In the former, Africans Americans with syphilis were recruited to participate in a study about the course of the disease. Even when treatment and a cure were eventually developed, they were withheld from the Black participants so that researchers could continue their study. Similarly, Nazi scientists conducted horrific experiments on Jewish people during the Holocaust. This was justified in the name of research and progress which is indicative of the far reaching affects that the culture of dehumanization had upon this society. When this research came to light, efforts were made to protect participants of future research, and currently [[institutional review board]]s exist to safeguard individuals from being taken advantage of by scientists.\n\nIn a medical context, the passage of time has served to make some dehumanizing practices more acceptable, not less. While dissections of human cadavers was seen as dehumanizing in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] (see [[History of anatomy]]), the value of dissections as a training aid is such that they are now more widely accepted.

During the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|St. Louis World's fair in 1904]] human zoos exhibited several natives from independent tribes around the globe, most notably a young Congolese man, [[Ota Benga]].  Benga's imprisonment was put on display as a public service showcasing \u201ca degraded and degenerate race\u201d. During this period religion was still the driving force behind much political and scientific action, and because of this, eugenics were widely supported among the most notable US scientific communities, political figures, and industrial elites. After allocating to New York in 1906, public outcry led to the permanent ban and closure of human zoos in the United States.<ref>{{Cite news|title = The man who was caged in a zoo {{!}} Pamela Newkirk|url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/the-man-who-was-caged-in-a-zoo|newspaper = the Guardian|accessdate = 2015-12-08|first = Pamela|last = Newkirk|date = 2015-06-03}}</ref>\n\n== In art  ==\n[[Francisco Goya]], famed Spanish painter and printmaker of the romantic period often depicted subjectivity involving the atrocities of war and brutal violence conveying the process of dehumanization.

He was the son of [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] and [[Alice of Champagne]]. When his father Hugh I died on January 10, 1218, the 8-month-old Henry became king. His mother was the official [[regent]], but handed off the actual governing to her uncle, Philip of Ibelin.  When Philip died, the effective regency passed to his brother, [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut]].\n\n==Biography==\nHenry was crowned at the age of 8 at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]], in 1225.<ref>Runciman, p. 180</ref> The reason for the early coronation was as a political maneuver by his uncle Philip, who sensed that [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], was going to attempt to seize power.  In 1228 this did occur, as Frederick forced John of Ibelin to hand over the regency, and the island of Cyprus.  However, when Frederick left the island in April, John counter-attacked and regained control, which began the [[War of the Lombards]]. Henry was able to assume control of the kingdom when he came of age at 15, in 1232, and maintained close ties with the [[Ibelin family]].\n\nHenry himself served as Regent of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] for [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] 1246\u20131253.\n\nHe was married three times; his third wife, whom he married in 1250, was [[Plaisance of Antioch]], daughter of [[Bohemund V of Antioch]]. They had a son, Hugh.\n\nOn his death, Henry was succeeded by his only child, his infant son [[Hugh II of Cyprus|Hugh II]] (b. 1253). If he had not had children, his heirs were his eldest sister's sons Jean de Brienne (b. 1234) and [[Hugh of Brienne]] (b. c. 1240), as well as his younger sister's son Hugh of Antioch, the future [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] (b. c. 1235). He was buried at the Church of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], at [[Nicosia]].\n\nConsorts:\n# [[Alix of Montferrat]] (1210/1215 \u2013 [[Kyrenia]], December, 1232-May, 1233, buried at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]]), daughter of Marquis [[William VI of Montferrat]], by Bertha da Clavesana, married at [[Limassol]] in May, 1229, without issue\n# [[Stephanie of Lampron]] (ca. 1220/1225 \u2013 soon after April 1, 1249, buried at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]]), daughter of Constantine of Lampron, Regent of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], by Stephanie of Barbaron, married at [[Nicosia]] in 1237/1238, without issue\n# [[Plaisance of Antioch]] (1235 \u2013 September 22/27, 1261), daughter of [[Bohemond V]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]] and [[County of Tripoli|Count of Tripoli]], by Lucienne de Segni, married at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]], in 1250, and had issue, an only son: [[Hugh II of Cyprus]].\n\n[[File:Armoiries Lusignan Chypre.svg|thumb|center|150px|coat-of-arms of Lusignan of Cyprus]]\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n| 1=  1.

He was the son of [[Hugh I of Cyprus]] and [[Alice of Champagne]]. When his father Hugh I died on January 10, 1218, the 8-month-old Henry became king. His mother was the official [[regent]], but handed off the actual governing to her uncle, Philip of Ibelin.  When Philip died, the effective regency passed to his brother, [[John of Ibelin, the Old Lord of Beirut]].\n\n==Biography==\nHenry was crowned at the age of 8 at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]], in 1225.<ref>Runciman, p. 180</ref> The reason for the early coronation was as a political maneuver by his uncle Philip, who sensed that [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]], was going to attempt to seize power.  In 1228 this did occur, as Frederick forced John of Ibelin to hand over the regency, and the island of Cyprus.  However, when Frederick left the island in April, John counter-attacked and regained control, which began the [[War of the Lombards]]. Henry was able to assume control of the kingdom when he came of age at 15, in 1232, and maintained close ties with the [[Ibelin family]].\n\nHenry himself served as Regent of [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] for [[Conrad IV of Germany|Conrad of Hohenstaufen]] 1246\u20131253.\n\nHe was married three times; his third wife, whom he married in 1250, was [[Plaisance of Antioch]], daughter of [[Bohemund V of Antioch]]. They had a son, Hugh.\n\nOn his death, Henry was succeeded by his only child, his infant son [[Hugh II of Cyprus|Hugh II]] (b. 1253). If he had not had children, his heirs were his eldest sister's sons Jean de Brienne (b. 1234) and [[Hugh of Brienne]] (b. c. 1240), as well as his younger sister's son Hugh of Antioch, the future [[Hugh III of Cyprus]] (b. c. 1235). He was buried at the Church of the [[Knights Templar|Templars]], at [[Nicosia]].\n\nConsorts:\n# [[Alix of Montferrat]] (1210/1215 \u2013 [[Kyrenia]], December, 1232-May, 1233, buried at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]]), daughter of Marquis [[William VI of Montferrat]], by Bertha da Clavesana, married at [[Limassol]] in May, 1229, without issue\n# [[Stephanie of Lampron]] (ca. 1220/1225 \u2013 soon after April 1, 1249, buried at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]]), daughter of Constantine of Lampron, Regent of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenia]], by Stephanie of Barbaron, married at [[Nicosia]] in 1237/1238, without issue\n# [[Plaisance of Antioch]] (1235 \u2013 September 22/27, 1261), daughter of [[Bohemond V]], [[Principality of Antioch|Prince of Antioch]] and [[County of Tripoli|Count of Tripoli]], by Lucienne de Segni, married at [[Selimiye Mosque (Nicosia)|Santa Sophia]], [[Nicosia]], in 1250, and had issue, an only son: [[Hugh II of Cyprus]].\n\n[[File:Armoiries Lusignan Chypre.svg|thumb|center|150px|coat-of-arms of Lusignan of Cyprus]]\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{unsourced section|date=April 2019}}\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes|align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n| 1=  1.
