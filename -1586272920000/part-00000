One way in which the treaty could be circumvented was to use a loophole in the treaty which permitted ships of between 600 and 2,000 tons, with no more than four guns over 76mm, no torpedoes, and with a maximum speed of no more than 20 knots. A new class of vessel was designed to use this loophole, and was given the obsolete designation of ''kaib\u014dkan'' (''Kai'' = sea, ocean, ''Bo'' = defence, ''Kan'' = ship), which had previously been used to designate obsolete battleships which had been reassigned to coastal defense duties. The first of these vessels were the {{sclass-|Shimushu |escort ship|4}} and {{sclass-|Etorofu|escort ship|5}}; however, after the start of the [[Pacific War]], it became apparent that a design more capable of [[anti-submarine warfare]] was needed.

Names are reported under the date of death, in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence:\n\n* Name, age, country of citizenship at birth, subsequent [[nationality]] (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference.\n\n<!--\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines below when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\nA typical entry reports information in the following sequence: Name, age, country of citizenship at birth or nationality if the subject is not eligible (for example, in the case of animals), subsequent nationality (if applicable), what subject was noted for, cause of death (if known), and reference. Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of reliable source, and [[WP:BLPSOURCE]] for living and recently deceased persons.\n[b] For information on using information from Ancestry.com, Find-a-grave, or IMDb, please see [[WP:ELPEREN]].\n* * * * * * * Please adhere to the guidelines above when adding a name to this article. * * * * * * *\n\n--->\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==April==\n===8===\n\n===7===\n*[[Robert Chaudenson]], 82, French linguist, COVID-19.<ref>[https://la1ere.francetvinfo.fr/reunion/robert-chaudenson-a-succombe-au-covid-19-820596.html Robert Chaudenson, le d\u00e9fenseur du Cr\u00e9ole R\u00e9unionnais, a succomb\u00e9 au Covid-19] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[Jean-Laurent Cochet]], 85, French stage director and actor (''[[A Thousand Billion Dollars]]'', ''[[Fort Saganne]]''), COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.lefigaro.fr/culture/mort-de-jean-laurent-cochet-le-maitre-de-theatre-de-depardieu-huppert-auteuil-beart-20200407 Mort de Jean-Laurent Cochet, le ma\u00eetre de th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Depardieu, Huppert, Auteuil, B\u00e9art...] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>\n*[[Fariborz Esmaeili]], 79, Iranian footballer ([[Taj SC|Taj]], [[Iran national football team|national team]]).<ref>[https://www.tehrantimes.com/news/446583/Ex-Iran-forward-Esmaeili-passes-away Ex-Iran forward Esmaeili passes away]</ref>\n*[[Sasi Kalinga]], 59, Indian actor (''[[Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha (film)|Paleri Manikyam: Oru Pathirakolapathakathinte Katha]]'', ''[[Pranchiyettan & the Saint]]'', ''[[Indian Rupee (film)|Indian Rupee]]''), liver disease.<ref>[https://english.manoramaonline.com/news/kerala/2020/04/07/sasi-kallinga-malayalam-actor-passes-away.html Actor Sasi Kalinga passes away]</ref>\n*[[Mishik Kazaryan]], 72, Soviet-born Russian physicist, [[USSR State Prize]] recipient (1980), COVID-19.<ref>[https://www.svoboda.org/a/30537605.html \u041f\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0435\u0441\u0441\u043e\u0440-\u0444\u0438\u0437\u0438\u043a \u041c\u0438\u0448\u0438\u043a \u041a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u0440\u044f\u043d \u0443\u043c\u0435\u0440 \u0432 \u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0435 \u043e\u0442 \u043e\u0441\u043b\u043e\u0436\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439 COVID-19] {{in lang|ru}}</ref>\n*[[Nipper Read]], 95, British police officer and boxing administrator.<ref>[https://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/latest-news/breaking-leonard-nipper-read-dead-21826825 Leonard 'Nipper' Read dead: Police officer who brought Krays to justice dies]</ref>\n\n===6===\n*[[Radomir Anti\u0107]], 71, Serbian football player ([[FK Partizan|Partizan]]) and manager ([[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]], [[Serbia national football team|national team]]), pancreatitis.<ref>[https://onefootball.com/en/news/legendary-laliga-boss-radomir-antic-passes-away-29642192 Legendary LaLiga boss Radomir Anti\u0107 passes away]</ref>\n*[[M.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death.

Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking.
