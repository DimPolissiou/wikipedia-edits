Many issues stem from the subjugation of Native Americans in society, including societal discrimination, racism, cultural appropriation through sports mascots, and depictions in art. Native Americans have also been subject to substantial historical and [[Transgenerational trauma|intergenerational trauma]] that have resulted in significant public health issues like [[alcoholism]] and risk of [[suicide]].\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Poldine carlo koyukon.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Poldine Carlo]], author of ''Nulato: An Indian life on the Yukon'', a [[Koyukon people|Koyukon]] writer from [[Alaska]]]]\nA little over one third of the 2,786,652&nbsp;Native Americans in the United States live in three states: [[California]] at 413,382, [[Arizona]] at 294,137 and [[Oklahoma]] at 279,559.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/tables/SC-EST2003-04.pdf |work=US Census.gov |title=Annual Estimates by Race Alone |accessdate=2006-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216013705/http://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/tables/SC-EST2003-04.pdf# |archive-date=2006-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 70% of Native Americans lived in urban areas in 2012, up from 45% in 1970 and 8% in 1940.<ref name=NYT41413>{{cite news|title=Quietly, Indians Reshape Cities and Reservations|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/us/as-american-indians-move-to-cities-old-and-new-challenges-follow.html|accessdate=April 14, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 13, 2013|author=Timothy Williams}}</ref> Many [[Urban Indian]]s live in cities due to forced relocation by the United States government with legislative pieces such as the [[Indian Relocation Act of 1956]] or due to the need for healthcare services not provided on or near reservations and tribe locations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walls|first=Melissa L.|last2=Whitbeck|first2=Les B.|date=2012-07-27|title=The Intergenerational Effects of Relocation Policies on Indigenous Families|journal=Journal of Family Issues|volume=33|issue=9|pages=1272\u20131293|doi=10.1177/0192513X12447178|issn=0192-513X|pmc=3457652|pmid=23024447}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ihs.gov/urban/history/|title=History|website=Office of Urban Indian Health Programs|language=en|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425854/|title=Native American Health: Historical and Legal Context|last=Weinstein|first=James N.|last2=Geller|first2=Amy|last3=Negussie|first3=Yamrot|last4=Baciu|first4=Alina|date=2017-01-11|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|others=Committee on Community-Based Solutions to Promote Health Equity in the United States; Board on Population Health and Public Health Practice; Health and Medicine Division; and National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 21st century, Native American communities have exhibited continual growth and revival, playing a larger role in the American economy and in the lives of Native Americans.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ncai.org/attachments/PolicyPaper_CUFUHjKqlcEhGLtpcwrDyiUgrDgqOFUWmxMiRzAFFaxJWsCZDSK_Securing%20Our%20Futures%20Final.pdf|title=Securing of Futures|last=|first=|date=February 2013|work=Nation Congress of American Indians|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> Communities have consistently formed governments that administer services such as [[firefighting]], [[natural resource]] management, social programs, health care, housing and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]]. Numerous tribes have founded [[Tribal colleges and universities|tribal colleges]].\n\nMost Native American communities have established [[court]] systems to adjudicate matters related to local ordinances. Most also look to various forms of moral and social authority, such as forms of [[restorative justice]], vested in the traditional culture of the tribal nation. Native American professionals have founded associations in [[journalism]], [[law]], [[medicine]] and other fields to encourage students in these fields, provide professional training and networking opportunities, and entry into mainstream institutions.\n\nTo address the housing needs of Native Americans, Congress passed the ''[[Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996|Native American Housing and Self Determination Act]]'' (NAHASDA) in 1996. This legislation replaced public housing built by the BIA and other 1937 Housing Act programs directed towards Indian Housing Authorities, with a block-grant program. It provides funds to be administered by the Tribes to develop their own housing.\n\n==Terminology differences==\n{{further|Native American name controversy}}\n\nNative Americans are also commonly known as ''Indians'' or ''American Indians''. A 1995 U.S. Census Bureau survey found that more Native Americans in the United States preferred ''American Indian'' to ''Native American''.<ref name=\"Census\" /> Most American Indians are comfortable with ''Indian'', ''American Indian'', and ''Native American'', and the terms are often used interchangeably.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/aihmterms.html|title=''American Indian'' versus ''Native American''|work=Infoplease|accessdate=2006-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThey have also been known as ''Aboriginal Americans, Amerindians, Amerinds, Colored,<ref name=\"clr\">{{cite web|url=http://oha.alexandriava.gov/fortward/special-sections/americans/|title=\"We are all Americans\", Native Americans in the Civil War|author=W.

Some American Indians{{Who|date=October 2009}} question the term ''Native American'' because, they argue, it serves to ease the conscience of \"white America\" with regard to past injustices done to American Indians by effectively eliminating \"Indians\" from the present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allthingscherokee.com/atc_sub_culture_feat_events_070101.html|title=What's in a Name?

Others point out that anyone born in the United States is technically native to America, so \"native\" is sometimes substituted for \"indigenous.\" The compound \"Native American\" is generally [[capitalization|capitalized]] to differentiate the reference to the indigenous peoples. Furthermore, [[Russell Means]], an American Indian activist, opposes the term ''Native American'' because he believes it was imposed by the government without the consent of American Indians. He has also argued that the use of the word ''Indian'' derives not from a confusion with [[India]] but from a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] expression {{lang|es|En Dio}}, meaning \"in God\".<ref>Russell Means \"I am an American Indian, not a native American!\" (Treaty Productions, 1996); citation given here [http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/5526] and here [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/roadshow/fts/bismarck_200504A16.html] and they cover the general subject and some Means' contribution, but have no reference to {{lang|es|En Dio}} and only those non-working links to text.</ref>\n\n==Societal discrimination and racism==\n{{Further|Stereotypes of Native Americans}}\n[[File:No beer sold to indians.jpg|thumb|A [[discrimination|discriminatory]] sign posted above a bar.

In 2007 the non-partisan [[Public Agenda]] organization conducted a focus group study. Most non-Native Americans admitted they rarely encountered Native Americans in their daily lives. While sympathetic toward Native Americans and expressing regret over the past, most people had only a vague understanding of the problems facing Native Americans today.

Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]] and [[John Mix Stanley]]. While many 19th-century images of Native Americans conveyed negative and unrepresentative messages, artists such as [[Charles Bird King]] portrayed Native American delegates with accuracy. His paintings are often used as records for Native American formal dress and customs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanart.si.edu/artist/charles-bird-king-2628|title=Charles Bird King|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> During the 16th century, the artist [[John White (surveyor)|John White]] made watercolors and engravings of the people native to the southeastern states. John White's images were, for the most part, faithful likenesses of the people he observed. However, some like artist [[Theodore de Bry]] used White's original watercolors to alter the poses and features of White's figures to make them appear more European. \n<nowiki/><nowiki/>[[File:IndianFigureCityHallTowerc.1892.jpg|thumb|upright|1892 sculpture by [[Alexander Milne Calder]], installed on the [[Philadelphia City Hall]].]]\n\nThere are also many depictions of Native Americans on federal buildings, statues, and memorials. During the construction of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in the early 19th century, the [[U.S. government]] commissioned a series of four relief panels to crown the doorway of the [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]]. The reliefs encapsulate a vision of European\u2014Native American relations that had assumed mythic historical proportions by the 19th&nbsp;century. The four panels depict: ''The Preservation of Captain Smith by Pocahontas'' (1825) by Antonio Capellano, ''The Landing of the Pilgrims'' (1825) and ''The Conflict of Daniel Boone and the Indians'' (1826\u201327) by Enrico Causici and ''William Penn\u2019s Treaty with the Indians'' (1827) by Nicholas Gevelot. The reliefs by European sculptors present versions of the Europeans and the Native Americans, in which the Europeans appear refined and the natives appear ferocious.\n\nIn the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965\u201367). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949\u201357) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. For years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles relative to the white protagonists as shown in notable works like ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1957\u20131963) and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959\u20131963).\n\nBy the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976) which depicted Native Americans in important lead and supporting roles.  Regardless, the European narrative perspective was prioritized in popular media. The \"sympathetic\" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' (1990) intentionally, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, related the Lakota story through a Euro-American voice for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref> Like the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages. Many film scholars and Native Americans still criticize films like ''Dances with Wolves'' for its 'white savior' narrative that asserts European-Americans are the necessary saviors of people of color like Native Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/02/21/oscar_loves_a_white_savior/|title=Oscar loves a white savior {{!}} Salon.com|website=www.salon.com|access-date=2018-12-06|date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nMany documentaries have been created partly in response to unbalanced coverage of Native American perspectives in history and partly to educate the public about the shared history of conflict between Native Americans and European colonizers. In 2004 producer Guy Perrotta presented the film ''Mystic Voices: The Story of the Pequot War'' (2004), a television documentary on the first major war between colonists and Native peoples in the Americas. The documentary portrayed the conflict as a struggle between different value systems, which included not only the Pequot, but a number of other Native American tribes, most of which allied with the English. Perrotta and Charles Clemmons, another producer, intended to increase public understanding of the significance of this early event.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pequotwar.com/project.html|title=The Pequot War: A Documentary ~ The Project|website=www.pequotwar.com|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> In 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the [[American Experience]] series, presented a five-episode series \"from a Native American perspective\".

[[Casino]]s operated by many Native American governments in the United States are creating a stream of gambling revenue that some communities are beginning to use as leverage to build diversified economies. Native American communities have waged and prevailed in legal battles to assure recognition of rights to self-determination and to use of natural resources. Some of those rights, known as treaty rights, are enumerated in early treaties signed with the young United States government.  These casinos have brought an influx of money to the tribes; according to tribal accounting firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve, CPAs]], the average net profit of Indian casinos is 38.85%.<ref name=\"Joseph Eve\">{{cite journal|author=Joseph Eve|title=The Cost of doing Business|year=2012|orig-year=2010|url=http://www.josepheve.com/knowledge-center/codb-report/}}</ref>{{clarify|The statement \"influx of money\" is not directly supported by the net percentage.

Outside of war and purposeful genocide, a senior lecturer on Native American literature and culture Dr. Carrie Sheffield maintains other causes are equally traumatic.

Four-fifths of American Indian land was lost due to the [[Dawes Allotment Act]] of 1887.  The U.S. government gave American Indian men sections of land and opened the \u201csurplus\u201d to white settlers and government interests. The psychological effects of the Dawes Allotment Act can be better appreciated when looking at American Indians relationship to the land, which is similar for all Indian tribes. Experts in Native American trauma and culture Braveheart-Jordan and DeBruyn propose the land is the origin of the people, who came out of the earth, and is the interdependent and spiritual link to all things.<ref name=Brave>Braveheart-Jordan, M., & DeBruyn, L.

O'Nell and Bell interviewed members of the Klamath tribes and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) and documented their experiences and stories to craft tribal genograms, a pictorial display of the tribe's psychology and history. At the end of their research, they were instructed by these tribes to draw the genogram in a circle as opposed to the traditional linear form. Additionally, they were instructed to start with creation and progress in the counterclockwise direction all to maintain the tribe's \"spiritual truth.\"<ref name=\":5\"/> This was in order to not only connect the tribe's experiences and their psychological effects, but to interconnect the tribe's other networks like families, cultures, and spiritual beings.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n=== Intergenerational Trauma ===\nAmerican Indian youth are confronted with the burden of [[intergenerational trauma]], trauma that is passed between generations by historical or cultural trauma.

Former students who survived the schools turned towards alcohol and drugs to cope with the trauma. These coping methods were then passed on to their children since they seemed like acceptable means of handling trauma. These former students also use similar parenting practices they received at boarding school on their own children. As explained by Menzies, the trauma suffered by these former students is continued into their children's generation through parental methods and modeled substance abuse.<ref name=\":2\" /> Menzies furthers that because the former students abused substances to cope with their trauma of boarding school, the children of these students cope with this trauma the same way.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn response to the psychological and intergenerational trauma caused, the National Boarding School Healing Project (NBSHP) was launched as a partnership to document these experiences and their effects on Native Americans.<ref name=\":3\" /> When some participants were asked about potential healing methods to their trauma, they suggested that communities in general should return to traditional Native American spiritual practices while former students of boarding schools specifically should attempt forgiveness in order to release internal turmoil and hatred.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Solutions ===\nMany researchers, psychologists, counselors, and social workers are calling for culturally competent practitioners as well as using culturally appropriate practices when working with American Indian clients. The Wellbriety Movement creates a space for American Indians to learn how to reconnect with their culture by using culturally specific principles to become and remain sober.<ref name=\"Paul\" />  Some examples are burning sage, cedar, and sweetgrass as a means to cleanse physical and spiritual spaces, verbally saying prayers and singing in one's own tribal language, and participating in tribal drum groups and ceremonies as part of meetings and gatherings.<ref name=\"Coyhis\">Coyhis, D., & Simonelli, R.

Garrett describes some possible degrees of acculturation: \"marginal\" where Native Americans may speak English with their native language and do not identify totally with neither mainstream American ideals or tribal customs or \"assimilated\" where Native American individuals have embraced mainstream American ideals and renounced their tribal familial connections.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAdditional solutions, as proposed by the Klamath tribe, are government restoration of land rights and the following of past treaty obligations. They propose that the restoration of tribal recognition by the federal government has partly healed their historical trauma.<ref name=\":5\"/> They maintain, however, that intergenerational trauma will not be healed until their traditional relationship to the land is restored in order to ground the tribe's \"immortal connections\" back to their place in the world.<ref name=\":5\" /> For the Klamath tribes, another solution is to constantly remember their history through their counter narrative rather than through the dominant narrative of non-Native oppressors in order to preserve the tribe's formerly oppressed spirit.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Education ==\nThe majority of Native American youth attend public schools that are not tribally controlled.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite journal|last=Deyhle|first=Donna|last2=Swisher|first2=Karen|date=1997|title=Research in American Indian and Alaska Native Education: From Assimilation to Self-Determination|journal=Review of Research in Education|volume=22|pages=113\u2013194|doi=10.2307/1167375|issn=0091-732X|jstor=1167375}}</ref> For those Native Americans who view education as a means of preserving their ancient knowledge, culture and language, this raises questions about tribal self-determination.<ref name=\":62\">{{Citation|last=Brayboy|first=Bryan McKinley Jones|chapter=American Indian Identity and Education|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9781412981521|last2=Villegas|first2=Malia|doi=10.4135/9781452218533.n36|title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\n{{Main|Cultural assimilation of Native Americans#Native American education and boarding schools}}\n\nThe first educational institutions for Native Americans were founded by missionaries.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite book|title=The tribally controlled Indian colleges : the beginnings of self determination in American Indian education|last=Oppelt, Norman T.|date=1990|publisher=Navajo Community College Press|isbn=978-0912586670|oclc=23768081}}</ref> The primary objectives of missionary education were to civilize, individualize and Christianize Native American youth.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 1997|title=David Wallace Adams. <italic>Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience, 1875\u20131928</italic>.

Among the most prominent of these were [[Elbridge Ayer Burbank]], [[George Catlin]], [[Seth and Mary Eastman|Seth Eastman]], [[Paul Kane]], [[W. Langdon Kihn]], [[Charles Bird King]], [[Joseph Henry Sharp]] and [[John Mix Stanley]]. While many 19th-century images of Native Americans conveyed negative and unrepresentative messages, artists such as [[Charles Bird King]] portrayed Native American delegates with accuracy. His paintings are often used as records for Native American formal dress and customs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanart.si.edu/artist/charles-bird-king-2628|title=Charles Bird King|website=Smithsonian American Art Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> During the 16th century, the artist [[John White (surveyor)|John White]] made watercolors and engravings of the people native to the southeastern states. John White's images were, for the most part, faithful likenesses of the people he observed. However, some like artist [[Theodore de Bry]] used White's original watercolors to alter the poses and features of White's figures to make them appear more European. \n<nowiki/><nowiki/>[[File:IndianFigureCityHallTowerc.1892.jpg|thumb|upright|1892 sculpture by [[Alexander Milne Calder]], installed on the [[Philadelphia City Hall]].]]\n\nThere are also many depictions of Native Americans on federal buildings, statues, and memorials. During the construction of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] in the early 19th century, the [[U.S. government]] commissioned a series of four relief panels to crown the doorway of the [[United States Capitol rotunda|Rotunda]]. The reliefs encapsulate a vision of European\u2014Native American relations that had assumed mythic historical proportions by the 19th&nbsp;century. The four panels depict: ''The Preservation of Captain Smith by Pocahontas'' (1825) by Antonio Capellano, ''The Landing of the Pilgrims'' (1825) and ''The Conflict of Daniel Boone and the Indians'' (1826\u201327) by Enrico Causici and ''William Penn\u2019s Treaty with the Indians'' (1827) by Nicholas Gevelot. The reliefs by European sculptors present versions of the Europeans and the Native Americans, in which the Europeans appear refined and the natives appear ferocious.\n\nIn the 20th century, early portrayals of Native Americans in [[movies]] and [[television]] roles were first performed by European Americans dressed in mock traditional attire. Examples included ''The Last of the Mohicans'' (1920), ''Hawkeye and the Last of the Mohicans'' (1957), and ''[[F Troop]]'' (1965\u201367). In later decades, Native American actors such as [[Jay Silverheels]] in ''[[The Lone Ranger#Television series|The Lone Ranger]]'' television series (1949\u201357) came to prominence. Roles of Native Americans were limited and not reflective of Native American culture. For years, Native people on U.S. television were relegated to secondary, subordinate roles relative to the white protagonists as shown in notable works like ''[[Cheyenne (TV series)|Cheyenne]]'' (1957\u20131963) and ''[[Law of the Plainsman]]'' (1959\u20131963).\n\nBy the 1970s some Native American film roles began to show more complexity, such as those in ''[[Little Big Man (film)|Little Big Man]]'' (1970), ''[[Billy Jack]]'' (1971), and ''[[The Outlaw Josey Wales]]'' (1976) which depicted Native Americans in important lead and supporting roles.  Regardless, the European narrative perspective was prioritized in popular media. The \"sympathetic\" yet contradictory film ''[[Dances With Wolves]]'' (1990) intentionally, according to Ella Shohat and Robert Stam, related the Lakota story through a Euro-American voice for wider impact among a general audience.<ref>Shohat, Ella, and Stam, Robert. ''Unthinking Eurocentrism: Multiculturalism and the Media''. New York: Routledge, 1994.</ref> Like the 1992 remake of ''[[The Last of the Mohicans (1992 film)|The Last of the Mohicans]]'' and ''[[Geronimo: An American Legend]]'' (1993), ''Dances with Wolves'' employed a number of Native American actors, and made an effort to portray Indigenous languages. Many film scholars and Native Americans still criticize films like ''Dances with Wolves'' for its 'white savior' narrative that asserts European-Americans are the necessary saviors of people of color like Native Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2013/02/21/oscar_loves_a_white_savior/|title=Oscar loves a white savior {{!}} Salon.com|website=www.salon.com|access-date=2018-12-06|date=February 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\nMany documentaries have been created partly in response to unbalanced coverage of Native American perspectives in history and partly to educate the public about the shared history of conflict between Native Americans and European colonizers. In 2004 producer Guy Perrotta presented the film ''Mystic Voices: The Story of the Pequot War'' (2004), a television documentary on the first major war between colonists and Native peoples in the Americas. The documentary portrayed the conflict as a struggle between different value systems, which included not only the Pequot, but a number of other Native American tribes, most of which allied with the English. Perrotta and Charles Clemmons, another producer, intended to increase public understanding of the significance of this early event.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pequotwar.com/project.html|title=The Pequot War: A Documentary ~ The Project|website=www.pequotwar.com|access-date=2018-12-06}}</ref> In 2009 ''[[We Shall Remain (documentary)|We Shall Remain]]'' (2009), a television documentary by [[Ric Burns]] and part of the [[American Experience]] series, presented a five-episode series \"from a Native American perspective\".

[[Casino]]s operated by many Native American governments in the United States are creating a stream of gambling revenue that some communities are beginning to use as leverage to build diversified economies. Native American communities have waged and prevailed in legal battles to assure recognition of rights to self-determination and to use of natural resources. Some of those rights, known as treaty rights, are enumerated in early treaties signed with the young United States government.  These casinos have brought an influx of money to the tribes; according to tribal accounting firm [[Joseph Eve, Certified Public Accountants|Joseph Eve, CPAs]], the average net profit of Indian casinos is 38.85%.<ref name=\"Joseph Eve\">{{cite journal|author=Joseph Eve|title=The Cost of doing Business|year=2012|orig-year=2010|url=http://www.josepheve.com/knowledge-center/codb-report/}}</ref>{{clarify|The statement \"influx of money\" is not directly supported by the net percentage.

Four-fifths of American Indian land was lost due to the [[Dawes Allotment Act]] of 1887.  The U.S. government gave American Indian men sections of land and opened the \u201csurplus\u201d to white settlers and government interests. The psychological effects of the Dawes Allotment Act can be better appreciated when looking at American Indians relationship to the land, which is similar for all Indian tribes. Experts in Native American trauma and culture Braveheart-Jordan and DeBruyn propose the land is the origin of the people, who came out of the earth, and is the interdependent and spiritual link to all things.<ref name=Brave>Braveheart-Jordan, M., & DeBruyn, L.

O'Nell and Bell interviewed members of the Klamath tribes and the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation (CTUIR) and documented their experiences and stories to craft tribal genograms, a pictorial display of the tribe's psychology and history. At the end of their research, they were instructed by these tribes to draw the genogram in a circle as opposed to the traditional linear form. Additionally, they were instructed to start with creation and progress in the counterclockwise direction all to maintain the tribe's \"spiritual truth.\"<ref name=\":5\"/> This was in order to not only connect the tribe's experiences and their psychological effects, but to interconnect the tribe's other networks like families, cultures, and spiritual beings.<ref name=\":5\"/>\n\n=== Intergenerational Trauma ===\nAmerican Indian youth are confronted with the burden of [[intergenerational trauma]], trauma that is passed between generations by historical or cultural trauma. A study looking at two generations of American Indians and their relationship to [[psychological trauma]] found that participants who experienced traumatic events early in their lives usually abused substances to cope.<ref name=\"Myhra2014\">Myhra, L.

Former students who survived the schools turned towards alcohol and drugs to cope with the trauma. These coping methods were then passed on to their children since they seemed like acceptable means of handling trauma. These former students also use similar parenting practices they received at boarding school on their own children. As explained by Menzies, the trauma suffered by these former students is continued into their children's generation through parental methods and modeled substance abuse.<ref name=\":2\" /> Menzies furthers that because the former students abused substances to cope with their trauma of boarding school, the children of these students cope with this trauma the same way.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn response to the psychological and intergenerational trauma caused, the National Boarding School Healing Project (NBSHP) was launched as a partnership to document these experiences and their effects on Native Americans.<ref name=\":3\" /> When some participants were asked about potential healing methods to their trauma, they suggested that communities in general should return to traditional Native American spiritual practices while former students of boarding schools specifically should attempt forgiveness in order to release internal turmoil and hatred.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Solutions ===\nMany researchers, psychologists, counselors, and social workers are calling for culturally competent practitioners as well as using culturally appropriate practices when working with American Indian clients. The Wellbriety Movement creates a space for American Indians to learn how to reconnect with their culture by using culturally specific principles to become and remain sober.<ref name=\"Paul\" />  Some examples are burning sage, cedar, and sweetgrass as a means to cleanse physical and spiritual spaces, verbally saying prayers and singing in one's own tribal language, and participating in tribal drum groups and ceremonies as part of meetings and gatherings.<ref name=\"Coyhis\">Coyhis, D., & Simonelli, R.

Garrett describes some possible degrees of acculturation: \"marginal\" where Native Americans may speak English with their native language and do not identify totally with neither mainstream American ideals or tribal customs or \"assimilated\" where Native American individuals have embraced mainstream American ideals and renounced their tribal familial connections.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nAdditional solutions, as proposed by the Klamath tribe, are government restoration of land rights and the following of past treaty obligations. They propose that the restoration of tribal recognition by the federal government has partly healed their historical trauma.<ref name=\":5\"/> They maintain, however, that intergenerational trauma will not be healed until their traditional relationship to the land is restored in order to ground the tribe's \"immortal connections\" back to their place in the world.<ref name=\":5\" /> For the Klamath tribes, another solution is to constantly remember their history through their counter narrative rather than through the dominant narrative of non-Native oppressors in order to preserve the tribe's formerly oppressed spirit.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Education ==\nThe majority of Native American youth attend public schools that are not tribally controlled.<ref name=\":102\">{{Cite journal|last=Deyhle|first=Donna|last2=Swisher|first2=Karen|date=1997|title=Research in American Indian and Alaska Native Education: From Assimilation to Self-Determination|journal=Review of Research in Education|volume=22|pages=113\u2013194|doi=10.2307/1167375|issn=0091-732X|jstor=1167375}}</ref> For those Native Americans who view education as a means of preserving their ancient knowledge, culture and language, this raises questions about tribal self-determination.<ref name=\":62\">{{Citation|last=Brayboy|first=Bryan McKinley Jones|chapter=American Indian Identity and Education|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9781412981521|last2=Villegas|first2=Malia|doi=10.4135/9781452218533.n36|title=Encyclopedia of Diversity in Education|year=2012}}</ref>\n\n=== History ===\n{{Main|Cultural assimilation of Native Americans#Native American education and boarding schools}}\n\nThe first educational institutions for Native Americans were founded by missionaries.<ref name=\":92\">{{Cite book|title=The tribally controlled Indian colleges : the beginnings of self determination in American Indian education|last=Oppelt, Norman T.|date=1990|publisher=Navajo Community College Press|isbn=978-0912586670|oclc=23768081}}</ref> The primary objectives of missionary education were to civilize, individualize and Christianize Native American youth.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=February 1997|title=David Wallace Adams. <italic>Education for Extinction: American Indians and the Boarding School Experience, 1875\u20131928</italic>.

In some communities, this is consistent with a high prevalence of risk factors such as smoking.\n\nOne research about the Pacific Northwest Native Americans found that there were many misidentified rates of cancer between 1996-1997. This misclassification was due to a low Native American blood quantum, resulting in an over-reported amount of Native Americans diagnosed with cancer. Because the research took data from the Oregon State Cancer Registry, the Washington State Cancer Registry, and the Cancer Data Registry of Idaho to research tribes in the respected states, their findings show that cancer rates among tribes in the US are heterogeneous.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Becker |first1=Thomas M. |date=2002 |title= Improving Cancer Incidence Estimates for American Indians and Alaska Natives in the Pacific Northwest|journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=92 |issue=9|pages=1469\u20131470 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.92.9.1469 |pmid= 12197975 |pmc=1447260 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, data collected from cancer cases are limited.

Originally the list created by the Canadian Home Economics Association only contained the first four. More recently several organizations around the world added the fifth A, agency. Agency is extremely important in CFS as it reflects community members\u2019 ability to influence policy directly related to food security as both individuals and as a collective.\n\n===Food environments===\nCFS is largely determined by the overall well-being of a community including multiple economic and social factors within the food environment.

For example, [[food deserts]] are socially-distressed neighbourhoods that contain an abundance of fast food and junk food choices and limited access to nutritious foods, making it difficult for residents in this area to purchase healthy foods.<ref name=Larsen />  \n*In addition ''sectors'' such as the agricultural sector, food industry, government policies and programs, and both the local and global economy can influence food consumption within a community.\n\n===Sustainability===\nIn order for a community to achieve CFS all citizens must be able to obtain food in a socially, economically, and environmentally sustainable way to maximize community self-reliance.<ref name=Hamm&Bellows />  Creating this situation involves growing food in an environmentally sustainable way and having fair liveable wages for local workers, producers, and processors so they can not only continue to produce food for the community but also participate in the system as members of the community.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hungercenter.org/publications/community-food-security-promoting-food-security-and-building-healthy-food-systems/|title=Community Food Security: Promoting Food Security and Building Healthy Food Systems|last=Winne|first=Mark|date=2004}}</ref> It also means that all members of the food system actively participate in the decision making processes that influence the \"availability, cost, price, quality, and attributes of their food.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Community Food Security Coalition]] recognizes six major principles to increase the sustainability of the food system.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hamm|first=MW|last2=Bellows|first2=AC|date=2003|title=Community food security: background and future directions|journal=National Center for Biotechnology Information|volume=35|issue=1|pages=37\u201343|pmid=12588679|doi=10.1016/s1499-4046(06)60325-4}}</ref>\n\n* Similar to the anti-hunger movement, CFS centers ''low-income food needs''. \n* Addressing a broad range of problems affecting the food system, such as community development, [[environmental racism]], etc., encourages an ''interdisciplinary approach''. \n* Rather than only meeting the needs of individuals, CFS strives to improve the conditions of ''entire communities''. \n* CFS seeks to utilize individual and community assets to build ''power'' from within. \n* An ''agricultural base'' provides a local food source for the community, while the community provides new markets for farmers. \n* Maintaining a ''systems-oriented'' approach encourages solutions that address the root of the problem.\n\n===Strength of local food system===\nAlthough no community is completely self-sufficient, maximizing a community's self-reliance is extremely important for ensuring CFS.

Resilience is an important component of CFS as unpredictable economic and environmental influences can greatly impact the food system.

These barriers relate to the complexity of the concept, the difficulty of data collection, and the lack of political will among those in power to make effective changes a reality.\n\n===Complexity===\nAs mentioned above CFS is a fairly recent term with limited articulation as a theoretical framework (see Anderson & Cook, 1999); it is difficult to measure; and can vary greatly across different community's needs, wants and values.<ref name=Anderson&Cook /><ref name=Jacobson />  CFS is also complex in that it considers such a wide range of influential factors including individual and household food security, food environments, sustainability and the strength of the local food system.

For example, smaller short-term approaches include ensuring community members are aware of existing food assistance programs, social services, and job training workshops in their community. However, it is important to note that evidence is limited that such programs effectively address barriers such as inadequate income.\n\nTo achieve more long-lasting solutions, changes in the food system of a community may be necessary.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" /> Connecting social services with the food system will strengthen partnerships across sectors and help to build capacity amongst community members. For example, connecting dietitians with farmers to create programs such as [[community supported agriculture]] (CSA) and place-based institutional procurement strategies can help both the health of the community and welfare of the farmers.  Also a shift in the use of temporary solutions, such as food banks to community gardens, builds capacity amongst community members by teaching skills in growing their own food and increases their self-reliance.\n\n===Advocacy===\nAdvocacy is another important strategy in achieving CFS.<ref name=\"Williams 2013\" /><ref name=\"Williams 2011\">{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Patricia L.|author2=MacAulay, Rita B. |author3=Anderson, Barbara J. |author4=Barro, Kimberlee |author5=Gillis, Doris E. |author6=Johnson, Christine P. |author7=Langille, Lynn L. |author8=Moran, Shelley |author9= Reimer, Debra E.  |title=\"I Would Have Never Thought That I Would Be in Such a Predicament\": Voices From Women Experiencing Food Insecurity in Nova Scotia, Canada|journal=Journal of Hunger & Environmental Nutrition|date=1 April 2012|volume=7|issue=2\u20133|pages=253\u2013270|doi=10.1080/19320248.2012.704740}}</ref><ref name=\"Williams 2012a\">{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Patricia|author2=Amero, Michelle |author3=Anderson, Barbara |author4=Gillis, Doris |author5=Green-Lapierre, Rebecca |author6=Johnson, Christine |author7= Reimer, Debra |title=A Participatory Food Costing Model in Nova Scotia|journal=Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice and Research|year=2012|volume=73|issue=4|pages=181\u2013188|doi=10.3148/73.4.2012.181|pmid=23217445}}</ref>    Promoting locally grown, seasonal, and organic foods in the community can help to support the local economy and protect the environment.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" />  Provision of opportunities and enabling conditions for more food to be produced and purchased locally can be done by promoting the benefits of local consumption to the public and by providing incentives and subsidies to farmers. Increasing food production in a community creates a more sustainable food system and lessens reliance on imports from other communities.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" />  Advocacy is also important for social equity to ensure that everyone in the community has access to nutritious foods and the ability to participate in decision-making.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" />  Conducting research in a community to determine the cost of a nutritious diet and the availability of healthy foods in low-income neighbourhoods can result in data that can be used to advocate for policy change.<ref name=\"Williams 2012a\" />  Advocating for increases in minimum wage to a living wage and more affordable housing is thought to allow community members to have more money available to purchase food.

McCullum suggests several approaches including: advocating for public policies to support a multi-sectoral approach to CFS; assessing policies that are currently in place to see how they can enable or hinder CFS; collaboration among stakeholders across sectors such as education, labour, economic development, agriculture and health; and involving all stakeholders, including community members, in the decision-making process to alter or create more effective policies that ensure availability of healthy foods to all community members.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" /><ref name=\"McCullum 2002\">{{cite journal|last=McCullum|first=C|author2=Pelletier, D. |author3=Barr, D. |author4=Wilkins, J. |title=Use of participatory planning process as a way to build community food security|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|year=2002|volume=102|issue=7|pages=962\u2013967|url=http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/yjada/article/S0002-8223(02)90220-8/abstract|doi=10.1016/s0002-8223(02)90220-8}}</ref>\n\n===Participatory action research===\n[[Participatory action research]] (PAR) is an approach to research that involves participation of the individuals who are most involved, affected, and impacted by the issue being studied.<ref name=Minkler>{{cite journal|last=Minkler|first=M|title=Using participatory action research to build healthy communities|journal=Public Health Reports|year=2000|volume=115|issue=2|pages=191\u2013197|pmc=1308710|doi=10.1093/phr/115.2.191|pmid=10968753}}</ref>  PAR allows issues recognized by those directly affected to be involved in the research designed to address these issues.

PAR is conducive to knowledge mobilization, increased awareness, capacity-building, evidenced-based research, direct action, and collaboration of efforts from various stakeholders, individuals and organizations working to improve CFS and CFS-related policy.\n\n==Related Terms==\n\n===Food sovereignty===\n[[Food sovereignty]] is a term popularized by [[La Via Campesina]], an international peasant movement composed of ordinary citizens, small and medium scale farmers, rural women and indigenous communities.<ref name=Desmarais>{{cite journal|last=Desmarais|first=Annette Aur\u00e9lie|title=The power of peasants: Reflections on the meanings of La V\u00eda Campesina|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|year=2008|volume=24|issue=2|pages=138\u2013149|doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.12.002|url=http://clgs.cn/uploadfiles/2008-5/200851293448923.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  In response to the globalization of agriculture this movement works to promote the importance of people and communities taking responsibility of our food systems. The term food sovereignty stresses that individuals have the right to a voice in food and agricultural policies as well as the right to produce their own food in their own territory. Food concerns such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), environmental degradation, trade negotiations, and food safety have inspired interest in alternative solutions to improve current food systems. Seeds are one of peasants\u2019 most precious resources and as a result La Via Campesina regularly exchanges seeds in the hopes of regaining control of seed supplies. La Via Campesina has inspired other social movements and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to engage in the promotion of food sovereignty and it is now a recognized term used by large global organizations such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Food security]]\n", "text_old": "'''Community food security (CFS)''' is a relatively new concept that captures emerging ideas about the central place of food in communities.

Originally the list created by the Canadian Home Economics Association only contained the first four. More recently several organizations around the world added the fifth A, agency. Agency is extremely important in CFS as it reflects community members\u2019 ability to influence policy directly related to food security as both individuals and as a collective.\n\n===Food environments===\nCFS is largely determined by the overall well-being of a community including multiple economic and social factors within the food environment.

For example, smaller short-term approaches include ensuring community members are aware of existing food assistance programs, social services, and job training workshops in their community. However, it is important to note that evidence is limited that such programs effectively address barriers such as inadequate income.\n\nTo achieve more long-lasting solutions, changes in the food system of a community may be necessary.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" /> Connecting social services with the food system will strengthen partnerships across sectors and help to build capacity amongst community members. For example, connecting dietitians with farmers to create programs such as [[community supported agriculture]] (CSA) and place-based institutional procurement strategies can help both the health of the community and welfare of the farmers.  Also a shift in the use of temporary solutions, such as food banks to community gardens, builds capacity amongst community members by teaching skills in growing their own food and increases their self-reliance.\n\n===Advocacy===\nAdvocacy is another important strategy in achieving CFS.<ref name=\"Williams 2013\" /><ref name=\"Williams 2011\">{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Patricia L.|author2=MacAulay, Rita B. |author3=Anderson, Barbara J. |author4=Barro, Kimberlee |author5=Gillis, Doris E. |author6=Johnson, Christine P. |author7=Langille, Lynn L. |author8=Moran, Shelley |author9= Reimer, Debra E.  |title=\"I Would Have Never Thought That I Would Be in Such a Predicament\": Voices From Women Experiencing Food Insecurity in Nova Scotia, Canada|journal=Journal of Hunger & Environmental Nutrition|date=1 April 2012|volume=7|issue=2\u20133|pages=253\u2013270|doi=10.1080/19320248.2012.704740}}</ref><ref name=\"Williams 2012a\">{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Patricia|author2=Amero, Michelle |author3=Anderson, Barbara |author4=Gillis, Doris |author5=Green-Lapierre, Rebecca |author6=Johnson, Christine |author7= Reimer, Debra |title=A Participatory Food Costing Model in Nova Scotia|journal=Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice and Research|year=2012|volume=73|issue=4|pages=181\u2013188|doi=10.3148/73.4.2012.181|pmid=23217445}}</ref>    Promoting locally grown, seasonal, and organic foods in the community can help to support the local economy and protect the environment.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" />  Provision of opportunities and enabling conditions for more food to be produced and purchased locally can be done by promoting the benefits of local consumption to the public and by providing incentives and subsidies to farmers. Increasing food production in a community creates a more sustainable food system and lessens reliance on imports from other communities.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" />  Advocacy is also important for social equity to ensure that everyone in the community has access to nutritious foods and the ability to participate in decision-making.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" />  Conducting research in a community to determine the cost of a nutritious diet and the availability of healthy foods in low-income neighbourhoods can result in data that can be used to advocate for policy change.<ref name=\"Williams 2012a\" />  Advocating for increases in minimum wage to a living wage and more affordable housing is thought to allow community members to have more money available to purchase food. For ethical concerns about where food comes from or if it was harvested in an environmentally sustainable way, one can advocate for stricter regulations on food labels.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" />\n\n===Policy===\n[[Policy]] development and change processes are critical to CFS. McCullum suggests several approaches including: advocating for public policies to support a multi-sectoral approach to CFS; assessing policies that are currently in place to see how they can enable or hinder CFS; collaboration among stakeholders across sectors such as education, labour, economic development, agriculture and health; and involving all stakeholders, including community members, in the decision-making process to alter or create more effective policies that ensure availability of healthy foods to all community members.<ref name=\"McCullum 2005\" /><ref name=\"McCullum 2002\">{{cite journal|last=McCullum|first=C|author2=Pelletier, D. |author3=Barr, D. |author4=Wilkins, J. |title=Use of participatory planning process as a way to build community food security|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|year=2002|volume=102|issue=7|pages=962\u2013967|url=http://www.journals.elsevierhealth.com/periodicals/yjada/article/S0002-8223(02)90220-8/abstract|doi=10.1016/s0002-8223(02)90220-8}}</ref>\n\n===Participatory action research===\n[[Participatory action research]] (PAR) is an approach to research that involves participation of the individuals who are most involved, affected, and impacted by the issue being studied.<ref name=Minkler>{{cite journal|last=Minkler|first=M|title=Using participatory action research to build healthy communities|journal=Public Health Reports|year=2000|volume=115|issue=2|pages=191\u2013197|pmc=1308710|doi=10.1093/phr/115.2.191|pmid=10968753}}</ref>  PAR allows issues recognized by those directly affected to be involved in the research designed to address these issues. PAR provides education and empowerment for both participants and researchers, as both are respected contributors to the research process.<ref name=\"Williams 2013\" /><ref name=\"Williams 2011\" /><ref name=\"Williams 2012a\" />  PAR can help to empower citizens to achieve social change and influence policy; reduce stigma and stereotypes; and ensure successful, sustainable outcomes are achieved. At the community level PAR is an excellent strategy to help achieve CFS as it involves those directly affected in the issue.<ref name=Minkler />  The evidence-based data collected from PAR can be used in decision making to support the need for policy change, as strong evidence is needed in order to receive support from government.<ref name=Power /><ref name=Minkler />  An example of a PAR that addresses CFS is the Activating Change Together for Community Food Security (ACT for CFS) project in Nova Scotia, Canada, which uses PAR to better understand and improve CFS in Nova Scotia (http://foodarc.ca/actforcfs). The final reports from ACT for CFS can be accessed at http://foodarc.ca/project-pages/results-publications/.   PAR is conducive to knowledge mobilization, increased awareness, capacity-building, evidenced-based research, direct action, and collaboration of efforts from various stakeholders, individuals and organizations working to improve CFS and CFS-related policy.\n\n==Related Terms==\n\n===Food sovereignty===\n[[Food sovereignty]] is a term popularized by [[La Via Campesina]], an international peasant movement composed of ordinary citizens, small and medium scale farmers, rural women and indigenous communities.<ref name=Desmarais>{{cite journal|last=Desmarais|first=Annette Aur\u00e9lie|title=The power of peasants: Reflections on the meanings of La V\u00eda Campesina|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|year=2008|volume=24|issue=2|pages=138\u2013149|doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.12.002|url=http://clgs.cn/uploadfiles/2008-5/200851293448923.pdf}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  In response to the globalization of agriculture this movement works to promote the importance of people and communities taking responsibility of our food systems. The term food sovereignty stresses that individuals have the right to a voice in food and agricultural policies as well as the right to produce their own food in their own territory. Food concerns such as genetically modified organisms (GMOs), environmental degradation, trade negotiations, and food safety have inspired interest in alternative solutions to improve current food systems. Seeds are one of peasants\u2019 most precious resources and as a result La Via Campesina regularly exchanges seeds in the hopes of regaining control of seed supplies. La Via Campesina has inspired other social movements and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to engage in the promotion of food sovereignty and it is now a recognized term used by large global organizations such as the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) and the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Food security]]\n", "name_user": "Daask", "label": "safe", "comment": "linkenvironmental racismusingFind link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_food_security"}

It follows a middle-aged literature lecturer who becomes sexually obsessed with a young adolescent girl. The film stars [[James Mason]] as Humbert Humbert, [[Sue Lyon]] as Dolores Haze (Lolita), and [[Shelley Winters]] as Charlotte Haze, with [[Peter Sellers]] as Clare Quilty.\n\nOwing to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s (MPAA) [[Motion Picture Production Code|restrictions at the time]], the film toned down the most provocative aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination. The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon, was 14 at the time of filming.\n\n''Lolita'' polarized contemporary critics, but is well-received today. Kubrick later commented, however, that if he had realized how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, he probably would never have made the film.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the 1950s, the film begins ''[[in medias res]]'' near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's [[Polonaises Op. 40 (Chopin)|Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1]] on the piano before being apparently shot to death behind a portrait painting of a young woman, with the shots fired from in front of the painting and passing through it. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged British professor of French literature.\n\nThe film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \"Lolita\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated.\n\nTo be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \"Hum's\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte.\n\nThings turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and Charlotte grows increasingly unfulfilled and upset. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing ''her'' as \"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless ''baba''\". She has an intense outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact.\n\nHumbert drives to Camp Climax to pick up Lolita, who does not yet know her mother is dead. They stay the night in a hotel that is handling an overflow influx of police officers attending a convention. One of the guests, a pushy, abrasive stranger, insinuates himself upon Humbert and keeps steering the conversation to his \"beautiful little daughter,\" who is asleep upstairs. The stranger implies that he too is a policeman and repeats, too often, that he thinks Humbert is \"normal.\" Humbert escapes the man's advances, and, the next morning, Humbert and Lolita enter into a sexual relationship. The two commence an odyssey across the United States, traveling from hotel to motel. In public, they act as father and daughter. After several days, Humbert tells Lolita that her mother is not sick in a hospital, as he had previously told her, but dead. Grief-stricken, she stays with Humbert.\n\nIn the fall, Humbert reports to his position at Beardsley College, and enrolls Lolita in high school there. Before long, people begin to wonder about the relationship between father and his over-protected daughter. Humbert worries about her involvement with the school play and with male classmates. One night he returns home to find Dr. Zempf, a pushy, abrasive stranger, sitting in his darkened living room. Zempf, speaking with a thick German accent, claims to be from Lolita's school and wants to discuss her knowledge of \"the facts of life.\" He convinces Humbert to allow Lolita to participate in the school play, for which she had been selected to play the leading role.\n\nWhile attending a performance of the play, Humbert learns that Lolita has been lying about how she was spending her Saturday afternoons when she claimed to be at piano practice. They get into a row and Humbert decides to leave Beardsley College and take Lolita on the road again. Lolita objects at first but then suddenly changes her mind and seems very enthusiastic. Once on the road, Humbert soon realizes they are being followed by a mysterious car that never drops away but never quite catches up. When Lolita becomes sick, he takes her to the hospital. However, when he returns to pick her up, she is gone. The nurse there tells him she left with another man claiming to be her uncle and Humbert, devastated, is left without a single clue as to her disappearance or whereabouts.\n\nSome years later, Humbert receives a letter from Mrs. Richard T. Schiller, Lolita's married name. She writes that she is now married to a man named Dick, and that she is pregnant and in desperate need of money. Humbert travels to their home and finds that she is now a roundly expectant woman in glasses leading a pleasant, humdrum life. Humbert demands that she tell him who kidnapped her three years earlier. She tells him it was Clare Quilty, the man that was following them, who is a famous playwright and with whom her mother had a fling in Ramsdale days. She states Quilty is also the one who disguised himself as Dr. Zempf, the pushy stranger who kept crossing their path. Lolita herself carried on an affair with him and left with him when he promised her glamour. However, he then demanded she join his depraved lifestyle, including acting in his \"art\" films, which she vehemently refused.\n\nHumbert begs Lolita to leave her husband and come away with him, but she declines. Humbert gives Lolita $13,000, explaining it as her money from the sale of her mother's house, and leaves to shoot Quilty in his mansion, where the film began. The epilogue explains that Humbert died of [[coronary thrombosis]] awaiting trial for Quilty's murder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of recurring cast members in Stanley Kubrick films}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Mason]] as Humbert \"Hum\" Humbert\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Charlotte Haze-Humbert\n* [[Sue Lyon]] as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Clare Quilty\n* Gary Cockrell as Richard \"Dick\" Schiller\n* Jerry Stovin as John Farlow, a Ramsdale lawyer\n* [[Diana Decker]] as Jean Farlow\n* [[Lois Maxwell]] as Nurse Mary Lore\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Dr. Keegee\n* Bill Greene as George Swine, the hotel night manager in Bryceton\n* [[Shirley Douglas]] as Mrs. Starch, the piano teacher in Ramsdale\n* [[Marianne Stone]] as Vivian Darkbloom, Quilty's companion\n* Marion Mathie as Miss Lebone\n* [[James Dyrenforth]] as Frederick Beale, Sr.\n* Maxine Holden as Miss Fromkiss, the hospital receptionist\n* John Harrison as Tom\n* [[Colin Maitland]] as Charlie Sedgewick\n* [[C.

Kubrick determined that while this sacrificed a great ending, it helped maintain interest, as he believed that interest in the novel sagged halfway through once Humbert was successful in seducing Lolita.<ref name=\"kubrick\">\"[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html An Interview with Stanley Kubrick (1969)]\" by Joseph Gelmis. Excerpted from ''The Film Director as Superstar'' (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday, 1970).</ref>\n\nThe second half contains an odyssey across the United States and though the novel was set in the 1940s, Kubrick gave it a contemporary setting, shooting many of the exterior scenes in England with some back-projected scenery shot in the United States, including upstate eastern New York, along [[New York State Route 9N|NY 9N]] in the eastern Adirondacks and a hilltop view of [[Albany, New York|Albany]] from [[Rensselaer, New York|Rensselaer]], on the east bank of the Hudson. Some of the minor parts were played by Canadian and American actors, such as [[Cec Linder]], [[Lois Maxwell]], Jerry Stovin and Diana Decker, who were based in England at the time. Kubrick had to film in England, as much of the money to finance the movie was not only raised there but also had to be spent there.<ref name=\"kubrick\" /> In addition, Kubrick was living in England at the time, and suffered from a deathly fear of flying.<ref>Rose, Lloyd.

Kubrick considered [[Peter Ustinov]] but decided against him. Harris then suggested [[David Niven]]; Niven accepted the part but then withdrew for fear the sponsors of his TV show, ''[[Four Star Playhouse]]'' (1952), would object. Mason then withdrew from his play and got the part.\n\nThe role of Clare Quilty was greatly expanded from that in the novel and Kubrick allowed Sellers to adopt a variety of disguises throughout the film. Early on in the film, Quilty appears as himself: a conceited, [[avant-garde]] playwright with a superior manner. Later he is an inquisitive policeman on the porch of the hotel, where Humbert and Lolita are staying. Next he is the intrusive Beardsley High School psychologist, Doctor Zempf, who lurks in Humbert's front room, to persuade him to give Lolita more freedom in her after-school activities.<ref name=\"land\">[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0106.html Kubrick in Nabokovland] by Thomas Allen Nelson.

His line in the scene is \"I take your Queen\" suggestive of his designs on her daughter. Chess is a recurring motif in the novels of Nabokov and a favorite pastime of director Stanley Kubrick.]]\nAt the time the film was released, the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|ratings system]] was not in effect and the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]], dating back to the 1930s, governed movie production. The censorship of the time inhibited Kubrick's direction; Kubrick later commented that, \"because of all the pressure over the Production Code and the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] at the time, I believe I didn't sufficiently dramatize the erotic aspect of Humbert's relationship with Lolita. If I could do the film over again, I would have stressed the erotic component of their relationship with the same weight Nabokov did.\"<ref name=\"kubrick\" /> Kubrick hinted at the nature of their relationship indirectly, through [[double entendre]] and visual cues such as Humbert painting Lolita's toes. In a 1972 ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview (after the ratings system had been introduced in late 1968), Kubrick said that he \"probably wouldn't have made the film\" had he realized in advance how difficult the censorship problems would be.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/books/1999/nabokov/lolita.sociological.essay/| title='Lolita': Complex, often tricky and 'a hard sell'| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103092340/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/books/1999/nabokov/lolita.sociological.essay/| archivedate=January 3, 2005| accessdate=March 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film is deliberately vague over Lolita's age. Kubrick commented, \"I think that some people had the mental picture of a nine-year-old, but Lolita was twelve and a half in the book; Sue Lyon was thirteen.\" Actually, Lyon was 14 by the time filming started and 15 when it finished.<ref name=\"Vickers2008\">{{cite book|author=Graham Vickers|title=Chasing Lolita: How Popular Culture Corrupted Nabokov's Little Girl All Over Again|url=https://archive.org/details/chasinglolitahow00vick|url-access=registration|date=1 August 2008|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-968-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chasinglolitahow00vick/page/127 127]\u2013}}</ref> Although passed without cuts, ''Lolita'' was rated \"X\" by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] when released in 1962, meaning no one under 16 years of age was permitted to watch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lolita (1962) at Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1012611-lolita/about.php|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Voice-over narration===\nHumbert uses the term \"nymphet\" to describe Lolita, which he explains and uses in the novel; it appears twice in the movie and its meaning is left undefined.<ref>\"[http://www.filmsite.org/loli.html Lolita (1962)]\" A Review by Tim Dirks\u2014A comprehensive review containing extensive dialogue quotes. These quotes include other details of Humbert's narration.</ref> In a [[voice-over]] on the morning after the Ramsdale High School dance, Humbert confides in his diary, \"What drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphet, of every nymphet perhaps, this mixture in my Lolita of tender, dreamy childishness and a kind of eerie vulgarity. I know it is madness to keep this journal, but it gives me a strange thrill to do so. And only a loving wife could decipher my microscopic script.\"\n\n===Screenplay adaptation===\n{{see also|Lolita}}\nThe adaptation of the screenplay is credited to Nabokov, although very little of what he provided (later published in a shortened version) was used in the film itself. Nabokov, following the success of the novel, moved out to Hollywood and penned a script for a film adaptation between March and September 1960. The first draft was extremely long\u2014over 400 pages, to which producer Harris remarked \"You couldn't make it. You couldn't ''lift'' it\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=73}} Nabokov remained polite about the film in public but in a 1962 interview before seeing the film, commented that it may turn out to be \"the swerves of a scenic drive as perceived by the horizontal passenger of an ambulance\".<ref>Nabokov, ''Strong Opinions'', Vintage International Edition, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Kubrick and Harris rewrote the script themselves, writing carefully to satisfy the needs of the censor.\n\nThere are many differences between the Kubrick-Harris film adaptation and Nabokov's novel, including some events that were entirely omitted. Most of the sexually explicit [[innuendo]]s, references and episodes in the book were taken out of the film because of the strict censorship of the 1960s; the sexual relationship between Lolita and Humbert is implied and never depicted graphically on the screen. In addition, some events in the film differ from the novel, and there are also changes in Lolita's character. Some of the differences are listed below:\n\n====Lolita's age, name, feelings and fate====\nLolita's age was raised from 12 to early teens in the film to meet [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] standards. Kubrick had been warned that censors felt strongly about using a more physically developed actress, who would be seen to be at least 14. As such, Sue Lyon was chosen for the title role, partly due to her more mature appearance.\n\nThe name \"Lolita\" is used only by Humbert as a private pet nickname in the novel, whereas in the film several of the characters refer to her by that name. In the book, she is referred to simply as \"Lo\" or \"Lola\" or \"Dolly\" by the other characters. Various critics, such as Susan Sweeney, have observed that since she never calls herself \"Lolita\", Humbert's pet name denies her subjectivity.<ref>[http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/sweeney1.htm] See footnote 6.</ref> Generally, the novel gives little information about her feelings.\n\nThe film is not especially focused on Lolita's feelings. In the medium of film, her character is inevitably fleshed out somewhat from the cipher that she remains in the novel. Nonetheless, Kubrick actually omits the few vignettes in the novel in which Humbert's solipsistic bubble is burst and one catches glimpses of Lolita's personal misery. [[Susan Bordo]] writes, \"Kubrick chose not to include any of the vignettes from the novel which bring Lolita's misery to the forefront, nudging Humbert's obsession temporarily off center-stage. ...Nabokov's wife, Vera, insisted\u2014rightly\u2014on 'the pathos of Lolita's utter loneliness.'... In Kubrick's film, one good sobfest and dead mommy is forgotten. Humbert, to calm her down, has promised her a brand-new hi-fi and all the latest records. The same scene in the novel ends with Lolita sobbing, ''despite'' Humbert having plied her with gifts all day.\"<ref>''The male body: a new look at men in public and in private'' by Susan Bordo p. 305</ref> Bordo goes on to say \"Emphasizing Lolita's sadness and loss would not have jibed, of course, with the film's dedication to inflecting the 'dark' with the comic; it would have altered the overwhelmingly ironic, anti-sentimental character of the movie.\" When the novel briefly gives us evidence of Lolita's sadness and misery, Humbert glosses over it but the film omits nearly all of these episodes.\n\n====Professor Humbert====\nCritic Greg Jenkins believes that Humbert is imbued with a fundamental likability in this film that he does not necessarily have in the novel.<ref>Jenkins pp. 34\u201364</ref> He has a debonair quality in the film, while in the novel he can be perceived as much more repulsive. Humbert's two mental breakdowns leading to sanatorium stays before meeting Lolita are entirely omitted in the film, as are his earlier unsuccessful relationships with women his own age (whom he refers to in the novel as \"terrestrial women\") through which he tried to stabilize himself. His lifelong complexes around young girls are largely concealed in the film, and Lolita appears older than her novelistic counterpart, both leading Jenkins to comment \"A story originally told from the edge of a moral abyss is fast moving toward safer ground.\"<ref>Jenkins, p. 40</ref> In short, the novel early flags Humbert as both mentally unsound and obsessively infatuated with young girls in a way the film never does.\n\nJenkins notes that Humbert even seems a bit more dignified and restrained than other residents of Ramsdale, particularly Lolita's aggressive mother, in a way that invites the audience to sympathize with Humbert. Humbert is portrayed as someone urbane and sophisticated trapped in a provincial small town populated by slightly lecherous people, a refugee from Old World Europe in an especially crass part of the New World. For example, Lolita's piano teacher comes across in the film as aggressive and predatory compared to which Humbert seems fairly restrained.<ref name=\"auto\">Jenkins p. 58</ref> The film character of John Farlow talks suggestively of \"swapping partners\" at a dance in a way that repels Humbert. Jenkins believes that in the film it is Quilty, not Humbert, who acts as the embodiment of evil.<ref>Jenkins p. 42</ref> The expansion of Quilty's character and the way Quilty torments Humbert also invites the audience to sympathize with Humbert.\n\nBecause Humbert narrates the novel, his increased mental deterioration due to anxiety in the entire second half of the story is more obvious from the increasingly desperate tone of his narrative. While the film shows Humbert's increasingly severe attempts to control Lolita, the novel shows more of Humbert's loss of self-control and stability.\n\nJenkins also notes that some of Humbert's more brutal actions are omitted or changed from the film. For example, in the novel he threatens to send Lolita to a reformatory, while in the film he promises to never send her there.<ref>Jenkins, p. 54</ref> He also notes that Humbert's narrative style in the novel, although elegant, is wordy, rambling, and roundabout, whereas in the film it is \"subdued and measured\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=====Humbert's infatuation with \"nymphets\" in the novel=====\nThe film entirely omits the critical episode in Humbert's life in which at age 14 he was interrupted making love to young Annabel Leigh who shortly thereafter died, and consequently omits all indications that Humbert had a preoccupation with prepubescent girls prior to meeting Dolores Haze. In the novel, Humbert gives his youthful amorous relationship with Annabel Leigh, thwarted by both adult intervention and her death, as the key to his obsession with nymphets. The film's only mention of \"nymphets\" is an entry in Humbert's diary specifically revolving around Lolita.\n\nHumbert explains that the smell and taste of youth filled his desires throughout adulthood: \"that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted [him] ever since\".<ref name=\"Annotated Lolita p. 15\">''Annotated Lolita'' p. 15</ref> He thus claims that \"Lolita began with Annabel\"<ref>''Annotated Lolita'' p. 14</ref> and that Annabel's spell was broken by \"incarnating her in another\".<ref name=\"Annotated Lolita p. 15\"/>\n\nThe idea that anything connected with young girls motivated Humbert to accept the job as professor of French Literature at Beardsley College and move to Ramsdale at all is entirely omitted from the film. In the novel he first finds accommodations with the McCoo family because the McCoos have a twelve-year-old daughter, a potential \"enigmatic nymphet whom [he] would coach in French and fondle in Humbertish.\"<ref>''Annotated Lolita'' p. 35</ref> However, the McCoo house happens to burn down in the few days prior to his arrival, and this is when Mrs. Haze offers to accommodate Humbert.\n\n=====Humbert's attitudes to Charlotte=====\nSusan Bordo has noticed that in order to show the callous and cruel side of Humbert's personality early in the film, Nabokov and Kubrick have shown additional ways in which Humbert behaves monstrously towards her mother, Charlotte Haze. He mocks her declaration of love towards him, and takes a pleasant bath after her accidental death. This effectively replaces the voice-overs in which he discusses his plans to seduce and molest Lolita as a means of establishing Humbert as manipulative, scheming, and selfish.<ref>{{cite book | title=The male body: a new look at men in public and in private | last=Bordo | first=Susan |authorlink= | year=2000 | publisher=Macmillan |location= | isbn=0-374-52732-6 | page=303 |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> However, Greg Jenkins has noted that Humbert's response to Charlotte's love note in the film is still much kinder than that in the novel, and that the film goes to significant lengths to make Charlotte unlikable.\n\n====Expansion of Clare Quilty====\nQuilty's role is greatly magnified in the film and brought into the foreground of the narrative. In the novel Humbert catches only brief uncomprehending glimpses of his nemesis before their final confrontation at Quilty's home, and the reader finds out about Quilty late in the narrative along with Humbert. Quilty's role in the story is made fully explicit from the beginning of the film, rather than being a concealed surprise twist near the end of the tale. In a 1962 interview with [[Terry Southern]], Kubrick describes his decision to expand Quilty's role, saying \"just beneath the surface of the story was this strong secondary narrative thread possible\u2014because after Humbert seduces her in the motel, or rather after she seduces him, the big question has been answered\u2014so it was good to have this narrative of mystery continuing after the seduction.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrysouthern.com/archive/SKint.htm|title=Terry Southern's Interview with Kubrick, 1962|work=terrysouthern.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108215717/http://www.terrysouthern.com/archive/SKint.htm|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This magnifies the book's theme of Quilty as a dark double of Humbert, mirroring all of Humbert's worst qualities, a theme which preoccupied Kubrick.<ref>Michel Ciment ''Kubrick': The Definitive Edition'' p. 92</ref>\n\nThe film opens with a scene near the end of the story, Humbert's murder of Quilty. This means that the film shows Humbert as a murderer ''before'' showing us Humbert as a seducer of minors, and the film sets up the viewer to frame the following [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] as an explanation for the murder. The film then goes back to Humbert's first meeting with Charlotte Haze and continues [[chronological]]ly until the final murder scene is presented once again. The book, narrated by Humbert, presents events in chronological order from the very beginning, opening with Humbert's life as a child. While Humbert hints throughout the novel that he has committed murder, its actual circumstances are not described until near the very end. NPR's Bret Anthony Johnston notes that the novel is sort of an inverted murder mystery: the reader knows someone has been killed, but the reader has to wait to find out who the victim is.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5536855|title=Why 'Lolita' Remains Shocking, And A Favorite|date=July 7, 2006|work=NPR.org}}</ref> \nSimilarly, the online Doubleday publisher's reading guide to ''Lolita'' notes \"the mystery of Quilty's identity turns this novel into a kind of detective story (in which the protagonist is both detective and criminal).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reading-group-center.knopfdoubleday.com/2010/01/07/lolita-reading-group-guide/|title=Lolita - Knopf Doubleday|work=Knopf Doubleday}}</ref> This effect is, of course, lost in the Kubrick film.\n\nIn the novel, Miss Pratt, the school principal at Beardsley, discusses with Humbert Dolores's behavioral issues and among other things persuades Humbert to allow her to participate in the dramatics group, especially one upcoming play. In the film, this role is replaced by Quilty disguised as a school psychologist named \"Dr. Zempf\". This disguise does not appear in the novel at all. In both versions, a claim is made that Lolita appears to be \"sexually repressed\", as she mysteriously has no interest in boys. Both Dr. Zempf and Miss Pratt express the opinion that this aspect of her youth should be developed and stimulated by dating and participating in the school's social activities. While Pratt mostly wants Humbert to let Dolores generally into the dramatic group, Quilty (as Zempf) is specifically focused on the high school play (written by Quilty and produced with some supervision from him) which Lolita had secretly rehearsed for (in both the film and novel). In the novel Miss Pratt na\u00efvely believes this talk about Dolores' \"sexual repression\", while Quilty in his disguise knows the truth. Although Peter Sellers is playing only one character in this film, Quilty's disguise as Dr. Zempf allows him to employ a mock German accent that is quintessentially in the style of Sellers's acting.<ref>An interesting discussion of this scene is in ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nWith regard to this scene, playwright [[Edward Albee]]'s 1981 stage adaptation of the novel follows Kubrick's film rather than the novel.\n\nThe movie retains the novel's theme of Quilty (anonymously) goading Humbert's conscience on many occasions, though the details of how this theme is played out are quite different in the film. He has been described as \"an emanation of Humbert's guilty conscience\",<ref>Justin Wintle in ''The concise new makers of modern culture'' p. 556</ref> and Humbert describes Quilty in the novel as his \"shadow\".<ref>Annotated Lolita p. lxi</ref>\n\nThe first and last word of the novel is \"Lolita\".<ref>This is discussed in a footnote in ''Annotated Lolita'' p. 328</ref> As film critic Greg Jenkins has noted, in contrast to the novel, the first and last word of the screenplay is \"Quilty\".<ref>''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins p. 67</ref>\n\n====Contemplating murder of Charlotte Haze====\nIn the novel, Humbert and Charlotte go swimming in Hourglass Lake, where Charlotte announces she will ship Lo off to a good boarding school; that part takes place in bed in the film. Humbert's contemplation of possibly killing Charlotte similarly takes place at Hourglass Lake in the book, but at home in the film. This difference affects Humbert's contemplated method of killing Charlotte. In the book he is tempted to drown her in the lake, whereas in the film he considers the possibility of shooting her with a pistol while in the house, in both scenarios concluding that he could never bring himself to do it. In his biography of Kubrick, Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick tried to recreate Hourglass Lake in a studio, but became uncomfortable shooting such a pivotally important exterior scene in the studio, so he refashioned the scene to take place at home.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location= |isbn=0-306-80906-0 |page=208 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Susan Bordo notes that after Charlotte's actual death in the film, two neighbors see Humbert's gun and falsely conclude Humbert is contemplating suicide, while in fact he had been contemplating killing Charlotte with it.<ref>{{cite book | title=The male body: a new look at men in public and in private | last=Bordo | first=Susan | authorlink= | year=2000 | publisher=Macmillan |location= | isbn=0-374-52732-6 | page=304 |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe same attempted killing of Charlotte appears in the \"Deleted Scenes\" section of the DVD of the [[Lolita (1997 film)|1997 film]] (now put back at Hourglass Lake). In the novel Humbert really considers killing Charlotte and later Lolita accuses Humbert of having deliberately killed her. Only the first scene is in the 1962 film and only the latter scene appears in the 1997 film.\n\n====Lolita's friends at school====\nLolita's friend, Mona Dahl, is a friend in Ramsdale (the first half of the story) in the film and disappears quite early in the story. In the film, Mona is simply the host of a party which Lolita abandons early in the story. Mona is a friend of Lolita's in Beardsley (the second half of the story) in the novel. In the novel Mona is active in the school play, Lolita tells Humbert stories about Mona's love life, and Humbert notes Mona had \"long since ceased\" to be (if ever she was) a \"nymphet.\" Mona has already had an affair with a Marine and appears to be flirting with Humbert. She keeps Lolita's secrets and helps Lolita lie to Humbert when Humbert discovers that Lolita has been missing her piano lessons. In the film, Mona in the second half seems to have been replaced by a \"Michele\" who is also in the play and having an affair with a Marine and backs up Lolita's fibs to Humbert. Film critic Greg Jenkins claims that Mona has simply been entirely eliminated from the film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick and the art of adaptation: three novels, three films |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0-7864-0281-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/151 151] |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/151 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nHumbert is suspicious that Lolita is developing an interest in boys at various times throughout the story. He suspects no one in particular in the novel. In the film, he is twice suspicious of a pair of boys, Rex and Roy, who hang out with Lolita and her friend Michele. In the novel, Mona has a friend named Roy.\n\n====Other differences====\nIn the novel, the first mutual attraction between Humbert and Lolita begins because Humbert resembles a celebrity she likes. In the film, it occurs at a drive-in horror film when she grabs his hand. The scene is from Christopher Lee's ''The Curse of Frankenstein'' when the monster removes his mask. Christine Lee Gengaro proposes that this suggests that Humbert is a monster in a mask,<ref>{{cite book |last= Gengaro |first=Christine Lee |authorlink= |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |location= |isbn=0571211089 |page=52 |pages=}}</ref> and the same theory is developed at greater length by Jason Lee.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lee |first=Jason |authorlink= |title=Celebrity, Pedophilia, and Ideology in American Culture |url= |accessdate= |year= 2009 |publisher= Cambria Press |location= |isbn=1604975997 |page= |pages=109\u2013111}}</ref> As in the novel, Lolita shows affection for Humbert before she departs for summer camp.\n\nIn the novel, both the hotel at which Humbert and Dolores first have relations and the stage-play by Quilty for which Dolores prepares to perform in at her high school is called ''The Enchanted Hunter''. However, in the novel school headmistress Pratt erroneously refers to the play as ''The Hunted Enchanter''. In Kubrick's film, the hotel bears the same name as in the novel, but now the play really is called ''The Hunted Enchanter''. Both names are established only through signage \u2013 the banner for the police convention at the hotel and the marquee for the play \u2013 the names are never mentioned in dialogue.\n \nThe relationships between Humbert and other women before and after Lolita is omitted from the film. Greg Jenkins sees this as part of Kubrick's general tendency to simplify his narratives, also noting that the novel therefore gives us a more \"seasoned\" view of Humbert's taste in women.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/156 |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0786430974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/156 156] |pages= }}</ref>\n\nOnly the film has a police convention at the hotel where Humbert allows Lolita to seduce him. Kubrick scholar Michel Ciment sees this as typical of Kubrick's general tendency to assail authority figures.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ciment |first=Michel |authorlink= |title=Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher= Macmillan |location= |isbn=0571211089 |page=92 |pages=}}</ref>\n\nLolita completes the school play (written by Clare Quilty) in the film, but drops out prior to finishing it in the novel. In the film, we see that Quilty's play has suggestive symbolism, and Humbert's confrontation with Lolita over her missing her piano lessons occurs after her triumphal debut in the play's premiere.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/57 |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0786430974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/57 57] |pages= }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe [[Film score|music for the film]] was composed by [[Nelson Riddle]] (the main theme was by Bob Harris). The recurring dance number first heard on the radio when Humbert meets Lolita in the garden later became a hit single under the name \"Lolita Ya Ya\" with Sue Lyon credited with the singing on the single version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endlessgroove.com/issue1/kubrick.htm |title=SOUNDTRACKS TO THE FILMS OF STANLEY KUBRICK |author=Tony Maygarden |work= |publisher=The Endless Groove |accessdate=December 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109194133/http://www.endlessgroove.com/issue1/kubrick.htm |archive-date=January 9, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The flip side was a 60s-style light rock song called \"Turn off the Moon\" also sung by Sue Lyon. \"Lolita Ya Ya\" was later recorded by other bands; it was also a hit single for [[The Ventures]], reaching 61 on ''Billboard'' and then being included on many of their compilation albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theventures.com/index.php?pg=charts|title=The Ventures :: Discography Charts|work=theventures.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Walk-Don't Run\u2014The Story of the Ventures |last=Halterman |first=Del |authorlink= |year=2009 |publisher=Lulu.com |location= |isbn= |page=80 |url= |accessdate=}}{{self-published source}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} In his biography of The Ventures, Del Halterman quotes an unnamed reviewer of the CD re-release of the original ''Lolita'' soundtrack as saying \"The highlight is the most frivolous track, 'Lolita Ya Ya', a maddeningly vapid and catchy instrumental with nonsense vocals that comes across as a simultaneously vicious and good-humored parody of the kitschiest elements of early-sixties rock and roll.\"\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Lolita Trailer (1962).webm|thumb|Original trailer for ''Lolita''.]]\n''Lolita'' premiered on June 13, 1962, in New York City (the copyright date onscreen is 1961).

In the UK/Australian print, the shot continues as Humbert mumbles that he's not familiar with the game. She then bends down again to whisper more details. Kubrick then cuts to a closer shot of Lolita's face as she says \"Well, alrighty then\" and then fades as she begins to descend onto Humbert on the cot.

It follows a middle-aged literature lecturer who becomes sexually obsessed with a young adolescent girl. The film stars [[James Mason]] as Humbert Humbert, [[Sue Lyon]] as Dolores Haze (Lolita), and [[Shelley Winters]] as Charlotte Haze, with [[Peter Sellers]] as Clare Quilty.\n\nOwing to the [[Motion Picture Association of America]]'s (MPAA) [[Motion Picture Production Code|restrictions at the time]], the film toned down the most provocative aspects of the novel, sometimes leaving much to the audience's imagination. The actress who played Lolita, Sue Lyon, was 14 at the time of filming.\n\n''Lolita'' polarized contemporary critics, but is well-received today. Kubrick later commented, however, that if he had realized how severe the censorship limitations were going to be, he probably would never have made the film.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in the 1950s, the film begins ''[[in medias res]]'' near the end of the story, with a confrontation between two men: one of them, Clare Quilty, drunk and incoherent, plays Chopin's [[Polonaises Op. 40 (Chopin)|Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1]] on the piano before being apparently shot to death behind a portrait painting of a young woman, with the shots fired from in front of the painting and passing through it. The shooter is Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged British professor of French literature.\n\nThe film then flashes back to events four years earlier. Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to rent, and Charlotte Haze, a cloying, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores, affectionately called \"Lolita\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert becomes infatuated.\n\nTo be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte's offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household. But Charlotte wants all of \"Hum's\" time for herself and soon announces she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte.\n\nThings turn sour for the couple in the absence of the child: glum Humbert becomes more withdrawn, and Charlotte grows increasingly unfulfilled and upset. Charlotte discovers Humbert's diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing ''her'' as \"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless ''baba''\". She has an intense outburst, runs outside, and is hit by a car, dying on impact.\n\nHumbert drives to Camp Climax to pick up Lolita, who does not yet know her mother is dead. They stay the night in a hotel that is handling an overflow influx of police officers attending a convention. One of the guests, a pushy, abrasive stranger, insinuates himself upon Humbert and keeps steering the conversation to his \"beautiful little daughter,\" who is asleep upstairs. The stranger implies that he too is a policeman and repeats, too often, that he thinks Humbert is \"normal.\" Humbert escapes the man's advances, and, the next morning, Humbert and Lolita enter into a sexual relationship. The two commence an odyssey across the United States, traveling from hotel to motel. In public, they act as father and daughter. After several days, Humbert tells Lolita that her mother is not sick in a hospital, as he had previously told her, but dead. Grief-stricken, she stays with Humbert.\n\nIn the fall, Humbert reports to his position at Beardsley College, and enrolls Lolita in high school there. Before long, people begin to wonder about the relationship between father and his over-protected daughter. Humbert worries about her involvement with the school play and with male classmates. One night he returns home to find Dr. Zempf, a pushy, abrasive stranger, sitting in his darkened living room. Zempf, speaking with a thick German accent, claims to be from Lolita's school and wants to discuss her knowledge of \"the facts of life.\" He convinces Humbert to allow Lolita to participate in the school play, for which she had been selected to play the leading role.\n\nWhile attending a performance of the play, Humbert learns that Lolita has been lying about how she was spending her Saturday afternoons when she claimed to be at piano practice. They get into a row and Humbert decides to leave Beardsley College and take Lolita on the road again. Lolita objects at first but then suddenly changes her mind and seems very enthusiastic. Once on the road, Humbert soon realizes they are being followed by a mysterious car that never drops away but never quite catches up. When Lolita becomes sick, he takes her to the hospital. However, when he returns to pick her up, she is gone. The nurse there tells him she left with another man claiming to be her uncle and Humbert, devastated, is left without a single clue as to her disappearance or whereabouts.\n\nSome years later, Humbert receives a letter from Mrs. Richard T. Schiller, Lolita's married name. She writes that she is now married to a man named Dick, and that she is pregnant and in desperate need of money. Humbert travels to their home and finds that she is now a roundly expectant woman in glasses leading a pleasant, humdrum life. Humbert demands that she tell him who kidnapped her three years earlier. She tells him it was Clare Quilty, the man that was following them, who is a famous playwright and with whom her mother had a fling in Ramsdale days. She states Quilty is also the one who disguised himself as Dr. Zempf, the pushy stranger who kept crossing their path. Lolita herself carried on an affair with him and left with him when he promised her glamour. However, he then demanded she join his depraved lifestyle, including acting in his \"art\" films, which she vehemently refused.\n\nHumbert begs Lolita to leave her husband and come away with him, but she declines. Humbert gives Lolita $13,000, explaining it as her money from the sale of her mother's house, and leaves to shoot Quilty in his mansion, where the film began. The epilogue explains that Humbert died of [[coronary thrombosis]] awaiting trial for Quilty's murder.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of recurring cast members in Stanley Kubrick films}}\n{{castlist|\n* [[James Mason]] as Humbert \"Hum\" Humbert\n* [[Shelley Winters]] as Charlotte Haze-Humbert\n* [[Sue Lyon]] as Dolores \"Lolita\" Haze\n* [[Peter Sellers]] as Clare Quilty\n* Gary Cockrell as Richard \"Dick\" Schiller\n* Jerry Stovin as John Farlow, a Ramsdale lawyer\n* [[Diana Decker]] as Jean Farlow\n* [[Lois Maxwell]] as Nurse Mary Lore\n* [[Cec Linder]] as Dr. Keegee\n* Bill Greene as George Swine, the hotel night manager in Bryceton\n* [[Shirley Douglas]] as Mrs. Starch, the piano teacher in Ramsdale\n* [[Marianne Stone]] as Vivian Darkbloom, Quilty's companion\n* Marion Mathie as Miss Lebone\n* [[James Dyrenforth]] as Frederick Beale, Sr.\n* Maxine Holden as Miss Fromkiss, the hospital receptionist\n* John Harrison as Tom\n* [[Colin Maitland]] as Charlie Sedgewick\n* [[C.

Kubrick determined that while this sacrificed a great ending, it helped maintain interest, as he believed that interest in the novel sagged halfway through once Humbert was successful in seducing Lolita.<ref name=\"kubrick\">\"[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0069.html An Interview with Stanley Kubrick (1969)]\" by Joseph Gelmis.

Some of the minor parts were played by Canadian and American actors, such as [[Cec Linder]], [[Lois Maxwell]], Jerry Stovin and Diana Decker, who were based in England at the time. Kubrick had to film in England, as much of the money to finance the movie was not only raised there but also had to be spent there.<ref name=\"kubrick\" /> In addition, Kubrick was living in England at the time, and suffered from a deathly fear of flying.<ref>Rose, Lloyd.

Mason then withdrew from his play and got the part.\n\nThe role of Clare Quilty was greatly expanded from that in the novel and Kubrick allowed Sellers to adopt a variety of disguises throughout the film. Early on in the film, Quilty appears as himself: a conceited, [[avant-garde]] playwright with a superior manner. Later he is an inquisitive policeman on the porch of the hotel, where Humbert and Lolita are staying. Next he is the intrusive Beardsley High School psychologist, Doctor Zempf, who lurks in Humbert's front room, to persuade him to give Lolita more freedom in her after-school activities.<ref name=\"land\">[http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0106.html Kubrick in Nabokovland] by Thomas Allen Nelson.

His line in the scene is \"I take your Queen\" suggestive of his designs on her daughter. Chess is a recurring motif in the novels of Nabokov and a favorite pastime of director Stanley Kubrick.]]\nAt the time the film was released, the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|ratings system]] was not in effect and the [[Motion Picture Production Code|Hays Code]], dating back to the 1930s, governed movie production. The censorship of the time inhibited Kubrick's direction; Kubrick later commented that, \"because of all the pressure over the Production Code and the [[Catholic Legion of Decency]] at the time, I believe I didn't sufficiently dramatize the erotic aspect of Humbert's relationship with Lolita. If I could do the film over again, I would have stressed the erotic component of their relationship with the same weight Nabokov did.\"<ref name=\"kubrick\" /> Kubrick hinted at the nature of their relationship indirectly, through [[double entendre]] and visual cues such as Humbert painting Lolita's toes. In a 1972 ''[[Newsweek]]'' interview (after the ratings system had been introduced in late 1968), Kubrick said that he \"probably wouldn't have made the film\" had he realized in advance how difficult the censorship problems would be.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/books/1999/nabokov/lolita.sociological.essay/| title='Lolita': Complex, often tricky and 'a hard sell'| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103092340/http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/books/1999/nabokov/lolita.sociological.essay/| archivedate=January 3, 2005| accessdate=March 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film is deliberately vague over Lolita's age. Kubrick commented, \"I think that some people had the mental picture of a nine-year-old, but Lolita was twelve and a half in the book; Sue Lyon was thirteen.\" Actually, Lyon was 14 by the time filming started and 15 when it finished.<ref name=\"Vickers2008\">{{cite book|author=Graham Vickers|title=Chasing Lolita: How Popular Culture Corrupted Nabokov's Little Girl All Over Again|url=https://archive.org/details/chasinglolitahow00vick|url-access=registration|date=1 August 2008|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=978-1-55652-968-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chasinglolitahow00vick/page/127 127]\u2013}}</ref> Although passed without cuts, ''Lolita'' was rated \"X\" by the [[British Board of Film Censors]] when released in 1962, meaning no one under 16 years of age was permitted to watch.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lolita (1962) at Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1012611-lolita/about.php|work=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=November 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Voice-over narration===\nHumbert uses the term \"nymphet\" to describe Lolita, which he explains and uses in the novel; it appears twice in the movie and its meaning is left undefined.<ref>\"[http://www.filmsite.org/loli.html Lolita (1962)]\" A Review by Tim Dirks\u2014A comprehensive review containing extensive dialogue quotes. These quotes include other details of Humbert's narration.</ref> In a [[voice-over]] on the morning after the Ramsdale High School dance, Humbert confides in his diary, \"What drives me insane is the twofold nature of this nymphet, of every nymphet perhaps, this mixture in my Lolita of tender, dreamy childishness and a kind of eerie vulgarity. I know it is madness to keep this journal, but it gives me a strange thrill to do so. And only a loving wife could decipher my microscopic script.\"\n\n===Screenplay adaptation===\n{{see also|Lolita}}\nThe adaptation of the screenplay is credited to Nabokov, although very little of what he provided (later published in a shortened version) was used in the film itself. Nabokov, following the success of the novel, moved out to Hollywood and penned a script for a film adaptation between March and September 1960. The first draft was extremely long\u2014over 400 pages, to which producer Harris remarked \"You couldn't make it. You couldn't ''lift'' it\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=73}} Nabokov remained polite about the film in public but in a 1962 interview before seeing the film, commented that it may turn out to be \"the swerves of a scenic drive as perceived by the horizontal passenger of an ambulance\".<ref>Nabokov, ''Strong Opinions'', Vintage International Edition, pp. 6\u20137</ref> Kubrick and Harris rewrote the script themselves, writing carefully to satisfy the needs of the censor.\n\nThere are many differences between the Kubrick-Harris film adaptation and Nabokov's novel, including some events that were entirely omitted. Most of the sexually explicit [[innuendo]]s, references and episodes in the book were taken out of the film because of the strict censorship of the 1960s; the sexual relationship between Lolita and Humbert is implied and never depicted graphically on the screen. In addition, some events in the film differ from the novel, and there are also changes in Lolita's character. Some of the differences are listed below:\n\n====Lolita's age, name, feelings and fate====\nLolita's age was raised from 12 to early teens in the film to meet [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] standards. Kubrick had been warned that censors felt strongly about using a more physically developed actress, who would be seen to be at least 14. As such, Sue Lyon was chosen for the title role, partly due to her more mature appearance.\n\nThe name \"Lolita\" is used only by Humbert as a private pet nickname in the novel, whereas in the film several of the characters refer to her by that name. In the book, she is referred to simply as \"Lo\" or \"Lola\" or \"Dolly\" by the other characters. Various critics, such as Susan Sweeney, have observed that since she never calls herself \"Lolita\", Humbert's pet name denies her subjectivity.<ref>[http://www.libraries.psu.edu/nabokov/sweeney1.htm] See footnote 6.</ref> Generally, the novel gives little information about her feelings.\n\nThe film is not especially focused on Lolita's feelings. In the medium of film, her character is inevitably fleshed out somewhat from the cipher that she remains in the novel. Nonetheless, Kubrick actually omits the few vignettes in the novel in which Humbert's solipsistic bubble is burst and one catches glimpses of Lolita's personal misery. [[Susan Bordo]] writes, \"Kubrick chose not to include any of the vignettes from the novel which bring Lolita's misery to the forefront, nudging Humbert's obsession temporarily off center-stage. ...Nabokov's wife, Vera, insisted\u2014rightly\u2014on 'the pathos of Lolita's utter loneliness.'... In Kubrick's film, one good sobfest and dead mommy is forgotten. Humbert, to calm her down, has promised her a brand-new hi-fi and all the latest records. The same scene in the novel ends with Lolita sobbing, ''despite'' Humbert having plied her with gifts all day.\"<ref>''The male body: a new look at men in public and in private'' by Susan Bordo p. 305</ref> Bordo goes on to say \"Emphasizing Lolita's sadness and loss would not have jibed, of course, with the film's dedication to inflecting the 'dark' with the comic; it would have altered the overwhelmingly ironic, anti-sentimental character of the movie.\" When the novel briefly gives us evidence of Lolita's sadness and misery, Humbert glosses over it but the film omits nearly all of these episodes.\n\n====Professor Humbert====\nCritic Greg Jenkins believes that Humbert is imbued with a fundamental likability in this film that he does not necessarily have in the novel.<ref>Jenkins pp. 34\u201364</ref> He has a debonair quality in the film, while in the novel he can be perceived as much more repulsive. Humbert's two mental breakdowns leading to sanatorium stays before meeting Lolita are entirely omitted in the film, as are his earlier unsuccessful relationships with women his own age (whom he refers to in the novel as \"terrestrial women\") through which he tried to stabilize himself. His lifelong complexes around young girls are largely concealed in the film, and Lolita appears older than her novelistic counterpart, both leading Jenkins to comment \"A story originally told from the edge of a moral abyss is fast moving toward safer ground.\"<ref>Jenkins, p. 40</ref> In short, the novel early flags Humbert as both mentally unsound and obsessively infatuated with young girls in a way the film never does.\n\nJenkins notes that Humbert even seems a bit more dignified and restrained than other residents of Ramsdale, particularly Lolita's aggressive mother, in a way that invites the audience to sympathize with Humbert. Humbert is portrayed as someone urbane and sophisticated trapped in a provincial small town populated by slightly lecherous people, a refugee from Old World Europe in an especially crass part of the New World. For example, Lolita's piano teacher comes across in the film as aggressive and predatory compared to which Humbert seems fairly restrained.<ref name=\"auto\">Jenkins p. 58</ref> The film character of John Farlow talks suggestively of \"swapping partners\" at a dance in a way that repels Humbert. Jenkins believes that in the film it is Quilty, not Humbert, who acts as the embodiment of evil.<ref>Jenkins p. 42</ref> The expansion of Quilty's character and the way Quilty torments Humbert also invites the audience to sympathize with Humbert.\n\nBecause Humbert narrates the novel, his increased mental deterioration due to anxiety in the entire second half of the story is more obvious from the increasingly desperate tone of his narrative. While the film shows Humbert's increasingly severe attempts to control Lolita, the novel shows more of Humbert's loss of self-control and stability.\n\nJenkins also notes that some of Humbert's more brutal actions are omitted or changed from the film. For example, in the novel he threatens to send Lolita to a reformatory, while in the film he promises to never send her there.<ref>Jenkins, p. 54</ref> He also notes that Humbert's narrative style in the novel, although elegant, is wordy, rambling, and roundabout, whereas in the film it is \"subdued and measured\".<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n=====Humbert's infatuation with \"nymphets\" in the novel=====\nThe film entirely omits the critical episode in Humbert's life in which at age 14 he was interrupted making love to young Annabel Leigh who shortly thereafter died, and consequently omits all indications that Humbert had a preoccupation with prepubescent girls prior to meeting Dolores Haze. In the novel, Humbert gives his youthful amorous relationship with Annabel Leigh, thwarted by both adult intervention and her death, as the key to his obsession with nymphets. The film's only mention of \"nymphets\" is an entry in Humbert's diary specifically revolving around Lolita.\n\nHumbert explains that the smell and taste of youth filled his desires throughout adulthood: \"that little girl with her seaside limbs and ardent tongue haunted [him] ever since\".<ref name=\"Annotated Lolita p. 15\">''Annotated Lolita'' p. 15</ref> He thus claims that \"Lolita began with Annabel\"<ref>''Annotated Lolita'' p. 14</ref> and that Annabel's spell was broken by \"incarnating her in another\".<ref name=\"Annotated Lolita p. 15\"/>\n\nThe idea that anything connected with young girls motivated Humbert to accept the job as professor of French Literature at Beardsley College and move to Ramsdale at all is entirely omitted from the film. In the novel he first finds accommodations with the McCoo family because the McCoos have a twelve-year-old daughter, a potential \"enigmatic nymphet whom [he] would coach in French and fondle in Humbertish.\"<ref>''Annotated Lolita'' p. 35</ref> However, the McCoo house happens to burn down in the few days prior to his arrival, and this is when Mrs. Haze offers to accommodate Humbert.\n\n=====Humbert's attitudes to Charlotte=====\nSusan Bordo has noticed that in order to show the callous and cruel side of Humbert's personality early in the film, Nabokov and Kubrick have shown additional ways in which Humbert behaves monstrously towards her mother, Charlotte Haze. He mocks her declaration of love towards him, and takes a pleasant bath after her accidental death. This effectively replaces the voice-overs in which he discusses his plans to seduce and molest Lolita as a means of establishing Humbert as manipulative, scheming, and selfish.<ref>{{cite book | title=The male body: a new look at men in public and in private | last=Bordo | first=Susan |authorlink= | year=2000 | publisher=Macmillan |location= | isbn=0-374-52732-6 | page=303 |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref> However, Greg Jenkins has noted that Humbert's response to Charlotte's love note in the film is still much kinder than that in the novel, and that the film goes to significant lengths to make Charlotte unlikable.\n\n====Expansion of Clare Quilty====\nQuilty's role is greatly magnified in the film and brought into the foreground of the narrative. In the novel Humbert catches only brief uncomprehending glimpses of his nemesis before their final confrontation at Quilty's home, and the reader finds out about Quilty late in the narrative along with Humbert. Quilty's role in the story is made fully explicit from the beginning of the film, rather than being a concealed surprise twist near the end of the tale. In a 1962 interview with [[Terry Southern]], Kubrick describes his decision to expand Quilty's role, saying \"just beneath the surface of the story was this strong secondary narrative thread possible\u2014because after Humbert seduces her in the motel, or rather after she seduces him, the big question has been answered\u2014so it was good to have this narrative of mystery continuing after the seduction.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.terrysouthern.com/archive/SKint.htm|title=Terry Southern's Interview with Kubrick, 1962|work=terrysouthern.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108215717/http://www.terrysouthern.com/archive/SKint.htm|archivedate=November 8, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This magnifies the book's theme of Quilty as a dark double of Humbert, mirroring all of Humbert's worst qualities, a theme which preoccupied Kubrick.<ref>Michel Ciment ''Kubrick': The Definitive Edition'' p. 92</ref>\n\nThe film opens with a scene near the end of the story, Humbert's murder of Quilty. This means that the film shows Humbert as a murderer ''before'' showing us Humbert as a seducer of minors, and the film sets up the viewer to frame the following [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] as an explanation for the murder. The film then goes back to Humbert's first meeting with Charlotte Haze and continues [[chronological]]ly until the final murder scene is presented once again. The book, narrated by Humbert, presents events in chronological order from the very beginning, opening with Humbert's life as a child. While Humbert hints throughout the novel that he has committed murder, its actual circumstances are not described until near the very end. NPR's Bret Anthony Johnston notes that the novel is sort of an inverted murder mystery: the reader knows someone has been killed, but the reader has to wait to find out who the victim is.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5536855|title=Why 'Lolita' Remains Shocking, And A Favorite|date=July 7, 2006|work=NPR.org}}</ref> \nSimilarly, the online Doubleday publisher's reading guide to ''Lolita'' notes \"the mystery of Quilty's identity turns this novel into a kind of detective story (in which the protagonist is both detective and criminal).\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reading-group-center.knopfdoubleday.com/2010/01/07/lolita-reading-group-guide/|title=Lolita - Knopf Doubleday|work=Knopf Doubleday}}</ref> This effect is, of course, lost in the Kubrick film.\n\nIn the novel, Miss Pratt, the school principal at Beardsley, discusses with Humbert Dolores's behavioral issues and among other things persuades Humbert to allow her to participate in the dramatics group, especially one upcoming play. In the film, this role is replaced by Quilty disguised as a school psychologist named \"Dr. Zempf\". This disguise does not appear in the novel at all. In both versions, a claim is made that Lolita appears to be \"sexually repressed\", as she mysteriously has no interest in boys. Both Dr. Zempf and Miss Pratt express the opinion that this aspect of her youth should be developed and stimulated by dating and participating in the school's social activities. While Pratt mostly wants Humbert to let Dolores generally into the dramatic group, Quilty (as Zempf) is specifically focused on the high school play (written by Quilty and produced with some supervision from him) which Lolita had secretly rehearsed for (in both the film and novel). In the novel Miss Pratt na\u00efvely believes this talk about Dolores' \"sexual repression\", while Quilty in his disguise knows the truth. Although Peter Sellers is playing only one character in this film, Quilty's disguise as Dr. Zempf allows him to employ a mock German accent that is quintessentially in the style of Sellers's acting.<ref>An interesting discussion of this scene is in ''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins pp. 56\u201357</ref>\n\nWith regard to this scene, playwright [[Edward Albee]]'s 1981 stage adaptation of the novel follows Kubrick's film rather than the novel.\n\nThe movie retains the novel's theme of Quilty (anonymously) goading Humbert's conscience on many occasions, though the details of how this theme is played out are quite different in the film. He has been described as \"an emanation of Humbert's guilty conscience\",<ref>Justin Wintle in ''The concise new makers of modern culture'' p. 556</ref> and Humbert describes Quilty in the novel as his \"shadow\".<ref>Annotated Lolita p. lxi</ref>\n\nThe first and last word of the novel is \"Lolita\".<ref>This is discussed in a footnote in ''Annotated Lolita'' p. 328</ref> As film critic Greg Jenkins has noted, in contrast to the novel, the first and last word of the screenplay is \"Quilty\".<ref>''Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films'' by Greg Jenkins p. 67</ref>\n\n====Contemplating murder of Charlotte Haze====\nIn the novel, Humbert and Charlotte go swimming in Hourglass Lake, where Charlotte announces she will ship Lo off to a good boarding school; that part takes place in bed in the film. Humbert's contemplation of possibly killing Charlotte similarly takes place at Hourglass Lake in the book, but at home in the film. This difference affects Humbert's contemplated method of killing Charlotte. In the book he is tempted to drown her in the lake, whereas in the film he considers the possibility of shooting her with a pistol while in the house, in both scenarios concluding that he could never bring himself to do it. In his biography of Kubrick, Vincent LoBrutto notes that Kubrick tried to recreate Hourglass Lake in a studio, but became uncomfortable shooting such a pivotally important exterior scene in the studio, so he refashioned the scene to take place at home.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick: A Biography |last=LoBrutto |first=Vincent |authorlink= |year=1999 |publisher=Da Capo Press |location= |isbn=0-306-80906-0 |page=208 |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> Susan Bordo notes that after Charlotte's actual death in the film, two neighbors see Humbert's gun and falsely conclude Humbert is contemplating suicide, while in fact he had been contemplating killing Charlotte with it.<ref>{{cite book | title=The male body: a new look at men in public and in private | last=Bordo | first=Susan | authorlink= | year=2000 | publisher=Macmillan |location= | isbn=0-374-52732-6 | page=304 |pages= |url= |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nThe same attempted killing of Charlotte appears in the \"Deleted Scenes\" section of the DVD of the [[Lolita (1997 film)|1997 film]] (now put back at Hourglass Lake). In the novel Humbert really considers killing Charlotte and later Lolita accuses Humbert of having deliberately killed her. Only the first scene is in the 1962 film and only the latter scene appears in the 1997 film.\n\n====Lolita's friends at school====\nLolita's friend, Mona Dahl, is a friend in Ramsdale (the first half of the story) in the film and disappears quite early in the story. In the film, Mona is simply the host of a party which Lolita abandons early in the story. Mona is a friend of Lolita's in Beardsley (the second half of the story) in the novel. In the novel Mona is active in the school play, Lolita tells Humbert stories about Mona's love life, and Humbert notes Mona had \"long since ceased\" to be (if ever she was) a \"nymphet.\" Mona has already had an affair with a Marine and appears to be flirting with Humbert. She keeps Lolita's secrets and helps Lolita lie to Humbert when Humbert discovers that Lolita has been missing her piano lessons. In the film, Mona in the second half seems to have been replaced by a \"Michele\" who is also in the play and having an affair with a Marine and backs up Lolita's fibs to Humbert. Film critic Greg Jenkins claims that Mona has simply been entirely eliminated from the film.<ref>{{cite book |title=Stanley Kubrick and the art of adaptation: three novels, three films |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |authorlink= |year=1997 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0-7864-0281-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/151 151] |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/151 |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\nHumbert is suspicious that Lolita is developing an interest in boys at various times throughout the story. He suspects no one in particular in the novel. In the film, he is twice suspicious of a pair of boys, Rex and Roy, who hang out with Lolita and her friend Michele. In the novel, Mona has a friend named Roy.\n\n====Other differences====\nIn the novel, the first mutual attraction between Humbert and Lolita begins because Humbert resembles a celebrity she likes. In the film, it occurs at a drive-in horror film when she grabs his hand. The scene is from Christopher Lee's ''The Curse of Frankenstein'' when the monster removes his mask. Christine Lee Gengaro proposes that this suggests that Humbert is a monster in a mask,<ref>{{cite book |last= Gengaro |first=Christine Lee |authorlink= |title=Listening to Stanley Kubrick: The Music in His Films |url= |accessdate= |year=2012 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield |location= |isbn=0571211089 |page=52 |pages=}}</ref> and the same theory is developed at greater length by Jason Lee.<ref>{{cite book |last= Lee |first=Jason |authorlink= |title=Celebrity, Pedophilia, and Ideology in American Culture |url= |accessdate= |year= 2009 |publisher= Cambria Press |location= |isbn=1604975997 |page= |pages=109\u2013111}}</ref> As in the novel, Lolita shows affection for Humbert before she departs for summer camp.\n\nIn the novel, both the hotel at which Humbert and Dolores first have relations and the stage-play by Quilty for which Dolores prepares to perform in at her high school is called ''The Enchanted Hunter''. However, in the novel school headmistress Pratt erroneously refers to the play as ''The Hunted Enchanter''. In Kubrick's film, the hotel bears the same name as in the novel, but now the play really is called ''The Hunted Enchanter''. Both names are established only through signage \u2013 the banner for the police convention at the hotel and the marquee for the play \u2013 the names are never mentioned in dialogue.\n \nThe relationships between Humbert and other women before and after Lolita is omitted from the film. Greg Jenkins sees this as part of Kubrick's general tendency to simplify his narratives, also noting that the novel therefore gives us a more \"seasoned\" view of Humbert's taste in women.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/156 |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0786430974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/156 156] |pages= }}</ref>\n\nOnly the film has a police convention at the hotel where Humbert allows Lolita to seduce him. Kubrick scholar Michel Ciment sees this as typical of Kubrick's general tendency to assail authority figures.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ciment |first=Michel |authorlink= |title=Kubrick: The Definitive Edition, |url= |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher= Macmillan |location= |isbn=0571211089 |page=92 |pages=}}</ref>\n\nLolita completes the school play (written by Clare Quilty) in the film, but drops out prior to finishing it in the novel. In the film, we see that Quilty's play has suggestive symbolism, and Humbert's confrontation with Lolita over her missing her piano lessons occurs after her triumphal debut in the play's premiere.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first=Greg |authorlink= |title=Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation: Three Novels, Three Films |url=https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/57 |accessdate= |year=2003 |publisher=McFarland |location= |isbn=0786430974 |page=[https://archive.org/details/stanleykubrickar0000jenk/page/57 57] |pages= }}</ref>\n\n==Music==\nThe [[Film score|music for the film]] was composed by [[Nelson Riddle]] (the main theme was by Bob Harris).

In the U.S. edition, the shot fades as she whispers the details of the \"game\" she played with Charlie at camp. In the UK/Australian print, the shot continues as Humbert mumbles that he's not familiar with the game. She then bends down again to whisper more details. Kubrick then cuts to a closer shot of Lolita's face as she says \"Well, alrighty then\" and then fades as she begins to descend onto Humbert on the cot. The latter cut of the film was used for the Region 1 DVD release. It is also the version aired on [[Turner Classic Movies]] in the U.S.\n* The [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion]] [[LaserDisc]] release is the only one to use a transfer approved by Stanley Kubrick. This transfer alternates between a 1.33 and a 1.66 aspect ratio (as does the Kubrick-approved ''Strangelove'' transfer).

A new site was found some {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Helsinki city centre, in an area that today belongs to the city of Vantaa (until 1971 Vantaa was called ''Helsingin maalaiskunta''). It opened temporarily in July 1952 for [[1952 Summer Olympics|that year's Summer Olympics]], held in Helsinki.<ref name=\"finavia_history\" />\n\nThe first two [[Finnair#History|Aero Oy]] [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]] aircraft, OH-LCC and OH-LCD, landed in Vantaa on 26 June 1952. While Aero (now Finnair) used [[Helsinki-Malmi Airport]], charter flights were directed to the new airport on 26 October 1952. The airport originally had a single runway, the second runway being built four years later in 1956. Regular jet flight operations began in 1959.\n\nA new passenger terminal opened in 1969, while the first transatlantic service to [[New York City|New York]] was inaugurated on 15 May 1969.\n\nDuring this time period, the airport was also called Seutula Airport after the nearby village [[Seutula]].<ref>{{Cite web|first=Jussi|last=Latvala|title=Helsinki-Vantaa airport to get railway after 60 years|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/2671-helsinki-vantaa-airport-to-get-railway-after-60-years-2.html|website=[[Helsinki Times]]|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Helsinki airport inaugurates southern wing expansion|url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2017-08/25/content_41471140.htm|website=[[China.org.cn]]|date=25 August 2017|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== New terminal and first Asian flights (1970s\u20131990s) ===\n\nThe year 1973 saw the first security checks being carried out for international flights. The name Helsinki-Vantaa Airport was used from 1977.\n\nIn 1983, the airport began offering the first non-stop service from Western Europe to Japan as [[Finnair]] commenced regular service between Helsinki and [[Tokyo]] with a single [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30ER]]. In the 1970s, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] operated flights from Helsinki to the US. The passenger terminal was expanded for the first time in 1983 and five years later, in 1988, the airport handled over six million passengers annually.\n\nIn 1991, [[Delta Air Lines]] began its operations at the airport. A new terminal was constructed for domestic flights in 1993. In 1996 the international terminal was expanded and merged with the domestic terminal. At the same time, the new control tower was completed. In November 1999, the international terminal was further expanded and the lobby for arriving and departing passengers was built.\n\n=== New millennium and expansion of non-Schengen area (2000\u20132009) ===\n\nIn 2000, the airport handled over 10 million passengers for the first time in its history. The third runway was inaugurated on 28 November 2002 and the first user was [[Finnair]]'s [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] en route to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York]]. In 2004, the international terminal was again expanded and a new shopping area was opened for long-haul passengers. In 2009, the latest expansion of Terminal 2 was completed. The total floor area was {{convert|43908|m2}}. The same year witnessed the opening of a new shopping area and spa for passengers on long-haul flights, the removal of a terminal-specific division between domestic and international flights, and the renovation of Terminal 1 for international flights. In the same year, [[TAP Air Portugal]] commenced service between Helsinki and Lisbon.\n\n=== Significant growth and expansion (2010\u2013present) ===\n\nDuring the 2010s, Helsinki Airport has experienced large increases in the number of annual passengers. In 2010, the airport handled 12,883,399 passengers, an increase of 2.2 percent compared to 2009. Air freight increased by 29.4 percent.\n\nIn April 2010, [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] opened its first routes to [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo]] and [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]] using [[Boeing 737]] jets. Now the airline is one of the largest operators at the airport with almost 40 destinations in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In 2011, Helsinki Airport saw its biggest growth in a single year in the number of passengers. The number of annual passengers was increased by 2 million passengers and the airport reached the milestone of 14 million passengers. However, [[easyJet]] canceled three routes, from Helsinki to Manchester, London\u2013Gatwick, and Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle, citing weak demand at Helsinki.<ref name=\"anna.aero_20110323\" />\n\nIn November 2011, [[Austrian Airlines]] canceled its Vienna\u2013Helsinki operations. In the same year, [[Czech Airlines]] ceased its Helsinki operations due to low demand. A year after, [[LOT Polish Airlines]] canceled its service to Helsinki. In 2014, a number of airlines such as [[Aer Lingus]], [[Germanwings]], [[S7 Airlines]], and [[Wizz Air]] canceled services to Helsinki.\n\nIn the 2010s, the airport has seen a huge growth of long-haul flights in terms of weekly flights (see [[#Long-haul traffic|Long-haul traffic]] below).\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, the renovation and construction work related to the development of Helsinki Airport started. For example, the Baggage Claim Hall 2B and Arrival Hall 2A were renovated and in July 2015, train operation on the [[Ring Rail Line]] and connection to Helsinki Central Railway Station were opened. In March 2015, [[Swiss International Air Lines]] started operations to Helsinki but canceled it a year later. In late 2015, [[Blue1]] ceased all operations from Helsinki which was the airline's only base. The airline flew to 28 destinations in Europe. [[Scandinavian Airlines]] sold Blue1 to [[CityJet]], which continues to operate the company on behalf of SAS as part of a larger relationship.<ref name=\"businesswire_20151001\" /> In 2015, the airport handled up to 16 million passengers for the first time. In March 2016, Czech Airlines resumed flights from Prague to Helsinki using [[Airbus A319]] aircraft. On 10 October 2016, the first Gulf carrier [[Qatar Airways]] began operations at the airport and now operates to Helsinki by [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The carrier was initially planning to launch the service as early as in 2012. Finavia expects that the airport will handle over 18,5 million passengers in 2017 and around 20 million in 2018, in 2019 at the latest. Also in 2017, the airport has experienced huge growth in numbers of passengers flying intercontinental.\n\nAs of 2013, [[Finavia]] has been expanding the airport (see [[#Future expansion and plans|Future expansion]] below).\n\nLife in HEL (#lifeinhel) was a Finavia marketing campaign which took place from 10 October to 9 November 2017 at Helsinki Airport. The campaign mixed TV, game shows, and social media. Ryan Zhu, a Chinese actor and TV personality, lived in a little cabin inside Helsinki Airport for 30 days. Helsinki Airport was awarded the title of best airport in the world by Travellink; by the campaign, Finavia wanted to prove this claim.<ref>[https://lifeinhel.tv/files/LIFEINHEL_PR-ENG.pdf Press release (English)], lifeinhel.tv, Retrieved 21 October 2017</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n\n[[File:EFHK openstreetmap 20170205.svg|thumb|Map of Helsinki Airport.]]\n\nThe airport is nominally divided into two terminals, located {{convert|250|m}} apart and linked by an internal pedestrian connection both airside and landside. In practice, however, the airside parts of the terminal buildings are not divided into Terminal 1 (the former domestic terminal) and Terminal 2 (the former international terminal) but to [[Schengen agreement|Schengen]] and non-Schengen areas. The terminal capacity of the airport is approximately 16\u201317 million passengers per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helsinki-vantaa.fi/enemman-tietoa/helsinki-vantaa-lyhyesti/kehityshankkeet/terminaalilaajennus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608063833/http://www.helsinki-vantaa.fi/enemman-tietoa/helsinki-vantaa-lyhyesti/kehityshankkeet/terminaalilaajennus |archivedate=8 June 2012  }}</ref>\n\nDomestic flights, as well as flights to European Schengen countries, are operated from gates 11\u201331.

The terminal opened in 1952{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} and is the first terminal at the airport. Now the old terminal building is removed and replaced by the current terminal building. The terminal was used for domestic flights but as of 2009, it is also used for international flights. Terminal 1 is used by [[Star Alliance]] carriers, such as [[Aegean Airlines]], [[Croatia Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines]], and [[TAP Air Portugal]]. In addition to Star Alliance members, [[airBaltic]], [[easyJet]], [[Icelandair]], [[Transavia]] and [[Vueling]] also operate flights from this terminal. Currently, no carriers operate long-haul flights from Terminal 1. The terminal has a train connection to Helsinki Central railway station.\n\nTerminal 1 passenger facilities include tax-free shops, free wireless [[Internet]] access, power sockets, and lockers. There are also several restaurants, caf\u00e9s and the SAS Business Lounge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.finavia.fi/en/helsinki-airport/services/|title=Services}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:EFHK terminal 1 20090930 01.jpg|{{nowrap|The exterior of Terminal 1}}\nFile:Vantaa Cafe.JPG|Caf\u00e9 in Terminal 1\nFile:EFHK Terminal 1 interior 20090930.jpg|The interior of Terminal 1\nFile:HEL SK Business Lounge general overview.jpg|SAS Business Lounge\n</gallery>\n\n=== Terminal 2 ===\nTerminal 2 (gates 16\u201355) opened in 1969 for international operations and, at present, also serves domestic flights. It is the larger of the two passenger terminals at the airport. All intercontinental flights operate from Terminal 2. The non-Schengen area of Terminal 2 has been enlarged in 2009 enabling the airport to accommodate eight wide-body aircraft at gates simultaneously while a new shopping area and a spa were opened for passengers on long-distance flights and the division between domestic and international flights was removed. Terminal 2 has many restaurants, bars and shopping areas. The terminal is equipped with 26 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges. The terminal has a train connection to [[Helsinki Central railway station]].\n\nTerminal 2 passenger facilities include: numerous tax-free shops, [[Avis Rent a Car System|Avis]], [[Europcar]] and [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]]-car rentals, free wireless [[Internet]] access, power sockets, lockers, sleeping pods and transfer service desks. Currency exchange, cash machines ([[Automated teller machine|ATM]]), tourist information, an [[Alepa]] grocery store and pharmacy are also available. For children, there are also several playrooms. Dining facilities include [[Burger King]] and O'Learys Sports Bar as well as numerous other restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Terminal 2 also includes two [[Finnair]] lounges: Finnair Lounge in the Schengen-area and Finnair Premium Lounge in the non-Schengen area.\n\nAs a part of Helsinki Airport's expansion plan, the new South Pier was inaugurated in June 2017 and Aukio in February 2019. The new pier features moving walkways and dual boarding jet bridges to enable handling larger aircraft more efficiently. In November 2019, the West Pier is scheduled to open and it will be able to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo. Five of the gates will be able to accommodate two regional jets, such as Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, simultaneously at a single gate.<ref name=\"lentoposti_20160812\" /> Passengers arriving and departing are divided into two floors: one for arriving passengers, the other for departures. In June 2016, the new bus terminal for remote aircraft stand operations was opened to increase the airport's capacity with gates 50A-M.\n\nTerminal 2 is used by member airlines of [[Oneworld]] and [[Skyteam]] airline alliances and most of the non-aligned airlines. [[Turkish Airlines]] makes an exception among [[Star Alliance]] airlines by using Terminal 2. Almost all charter flights are handled at Terminal 2 (which also handles scheduled services). The current airlines using Terminal 2 are [[Aeroflot]], [[Belavia]], [[Blue Air]], [[British Airways]], [[Corendon Airlines]], [[Czech Airlines]], Finnair, [[Nordic Regional Airlines]], [[Freebird Airlines]], [[Jet Time]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[KLM]], [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]], [[Nouvelair Tunisie]], [[Qatar Airways]], [[Royal Jordanian]], [[Sunclass Scandinavia]], [[Tibet Airlines]], [[TUI fly Nordic]], [[TUI Airways]], [[Turkish Airlines]] and [[Ukraine International Airlines]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Helsinki-Vantaa T2 n\u00e4k\u00f6alaterassilta 2015-07-01.JPG|The exterior of Terminal 2\nFile:HEL Terminal 2 1.jpg|The interior of Terminal 2\nFile:HEL Terminal 2 3.jpg|The restaurant area in Terminal 2\nFile:15-12-20-Helsinki-Vantaan-Lentoasema-N3S 3117.jpg|[[Finnair]]'s check-in area\nFile:HEL T2 gate 53 2018-05-06.jpg|The gate area of the new South Pier of Terminal 2 non-Schengen area\nFile:HEL T2 gate 54 2018-05-06.jpg|The new South Pier of Terminal 2 non-Schengen area\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\n[[File:Finnair head office 05JUN2015.JPG|thumb|Finnair head office, House of Travel and Transportation]]\nThere are several airport hotels and office buildings on the grounds of the airport. The [[Aviapolis]] is a new international [[business park]] adjacent to the Helsinki airport area, already hosting the operations of numerous companies around the airport. In 2013, [[Finnair]] opened its new head office, known as House of Travel and Transportation, or \"HOTT\". The construction of HOTT began in July 2011 and finished on time in June 2013.\n\n=== Ground handling ===\nAirpro, Aviator, and [[Swissport]] provide ground handling services for airlines.\n\n== Runways ==\n\n[[File:Helsinki-Vantaan kiitotie 33.jpg|thumb|Runway 33 at Helsinki Airport]]\n\nHelsinki Airport has three runways. The runways can handle take-offs and landings of the heaviest aircraft in use today such as the [[Airbus A380]]. The use of three runways allows two runways to be kept in operation when clearing of snow and ice is needed (if one runway is being cleared at a time).<ref name=\"bbc_20101220\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12042213 |title=How Helsinki airport deals with snow and ice |work=BBC News |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.finavia.fi/en/newsroom/2017/four-facts-about-runways-helsinki-airport |title=Four facts about the runways at Helsinki Airport |publisher=Finavia |date=19 October 2017 |accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

The primary runway for landings is Runway 2 (15) from the northwest, i.e. from the direction of [[Nurmij\u00e4rvi]], or Runway 1 (22L) from the northeast, i.e. from the direction of [[Kerava]], while the primary runway for take-offs is Runway 3 (22R) towards the southwest, in the direction of Western Vantaa and Espoo. Aircraft with low noise can take off from Runway 1 (22L) towards the south at the same time. When the wind is from the north or east, Runway 3 (04L) or Runway 1 (04R) are usually used for landings, i.e. for approaches from the southwest, the direction of Western Vantaa and Espoo, while take-offs are made from Runway 1 (04R) towards the northeast in the direction of Kerava.\n\nDuring the night time, landings are primarily made using Runway 2 (15) from the northwest, i.e. from the direction of Nurmij\u00e4rvi, and take-offs using Runway 3 (22R) towards the southwest, in the direction of Espoo. Jet plane landings to Runway 2 (33) from the southeast and take-offs from Runway 2 (15) towards the southeast are avoided due to dense population in the affected areas. During night time, propeller plane operations towards the southeast are also prohibited unless otherwise dictated by air traffic safety. Air traffic safety is the main reason for not always being able to choose the optimal runway for noise control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vuosikertomus.finavia.fi/en/2013/responsibility/responsibility-information/environmental-information/runway-use-helsinki-airport/|title=Runway use, Helsinki Airport|access-date=16 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018212206/http://vuosikertomus.finavia.fi/en/2013/responsibility/responsibility-information/environmental-information/runway-use-helsinki-airport/|archive-date=18 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n\n=== Airport-CDM ===\n\nIn October 2012, Finavia implemented Airport CDM (Collaborative Decision Making) at Helsinki Airport. It is a procedure by [[Eurocontrol]], the European Organization for Safety of Air Navigation, that develops airport operation by increasing co-operation between partners at the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/news/helsinki-vantaa-goes-cdm|title=Eurocontrol: Helsinki-Vantaa goes A-CDM|website=Eurocontrol|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref> Airport CDM aims to reduce costs, achieve lower emissions, improve punctuality of operations and increase customer satisfaction at the airport.

Helsinki Airport has around 50 airlines operating regularly. In addition, there are numerous charter airlines operating at the airport. The airport is the main hub for Finnair, that operates over 1100 flights weekly to Europe, Asia, and North America. The airport is also used as an operating base for Norwegian Air Shuttle and the low-cost airline operates over 230 flight weekly to elsewhere in Europe as well as the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Morocco]].\n\n==== Main airlines ====\n\nThe following airlines maintain hub or base operations at Helsinki Airport:\n\n* '''Finnair''' is the largest airline operating at the airport, with an all-Airbus fleet of 48 aircraft (excluding [[Nordic Regional Airlines|Norra]]) based at Helsinki, providing scheduled services to the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and North-America. Finnair operates flights from Helsinki to over 100 destinations, including around 20 intercontinental routes. All flights are operated from Terminal 2.\n* '''Jet Time''' is a charter airline that operates several flights from Helsinki to Europe.\n* '''Nordic Regional Airlines (Norra)''', a subsidiary of Finnair that operates to around 30 destinations in Europe. Norra has a fleet of 23 ATR and Embraer aircraft, all operated for Finnair. This airline operates from Terminal 2.\n* '''Norwegian Air Shuttle''', a [[low-cost airline]] which operates to over 30 destinations from Helsinki to Europe and the Middle East, operating from Terminal 2. The airline is the biggest operator at the airport after Finnair (including Norra) and has served over 10 million passengers since 2010.\n* '''SunClass Airlines''' uses Helsinki Airport as a focus city with many charter flights to Southeast Asia and Europe. The airline operates from Terminal 2.\n* '''TUI fly Nordic''', a charter airline that operates to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the [[Caribbean]] in North America. The airline operates from Terminal 2. On 10 September 2018, TUI announced plans to close its Helsinki base in the near future with [[Jet Time]] taking over the company's short-haul operations at the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mynewsdesk.com/fi/tuifinland/pressreleases/tui-jaerjestaeae-uudelleen-pohjoismaiden-lentoja-2684833|title=TUI j\u00e4rjest\u00e4\u00e4 uudelleen Pohjoismaiden lentoja|website=mynewsdesk.com|date=10 September 2018|access-date=10 September 2018|language=fi}}</ref>\n\nThe passenger number has been growing fastly since 2010, but especially since 2014. In 2017, Helsinki Airport has experienced the third highest growth rate and the second biggest increase in passenger numbers in the last 20 years. On 13 December 2017, the airport reached the milestone of 18 million passengers for the first time ever.\n\n=== Cargo operations ===\n[[File:TNT OE-IBZ pushback at Helsinki-Vantaa (15004018150).jpg|thumb|right|[[TNT Airways]] Boeing 737-400F aircraft at its cargo terminal and [[DHL Aviation]] A300-600F in the background.]]\nHelsinki Airport has been one of the largest airports among the Nordic countries by freight handled. In 2012, the airport handled 192,204 tonnes cargo making the airport the largest one in the Nordics in tonnes of cargo handled that year.\n\nHelsinki Airport has extensive cargo flight activity. There is a cargo area with cargo terminals and cargo transit facilities in the Southeastern part of the airport area. [[ASL Airlines Belgium]] (formerly [[TNT Airways]]) and [[DHL Aviation|DHL]] have their own cargo terminals at the airport. Currently scheduled cargo operating airlines are [[AirBridgeCargo Airlines]] operated with Boeing 747 cargo aircraft, ASL Airlines Belgium, DHL Aviation (operated by EAT Leipzig and DHL Air UK), [[FedEx Airlines|FedEx]], [[UPS Airlines]], and [[Turkish Airlines]] that operates cargo services to HEL from Istanbul, Oslo, and Stockholm with Airbus A310F and A330F aircraft. In addition to scheduled cargo operations, many other cargo airlines have random operations at Helsinki Airport.\n\nThe construction of a new freight terminal ({{convert|35000|m2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) began in March 2015 and was inaugurated on 8 January 2018. The capacity of the terminal is 350,000 tonnes but the theoretical capacity is up to 450,000 tonnes. The freight capacity of the airport is being expanded to accommodate the growing freight capacity that will be provided by [[Finnair]]'s [[Airbus A350|Airbus A350 XWB]] fleet. Finnair's freight operations continued in the previous location until relocation to the new freight terminal in December 2017.<ref name=\"finavia_20150326\" /> The name of the new terminal is Cool Nordic Cargo Hub, but is branded COOL for its modern technology and capacity to handle high volumes of temperature-controlled cargo. A new operations monitoring and tracking platform, \"Cargo Eye\", is used in the new freight terminal. That gives the new Cargo Control Center a live view of what is happening across the cargo network and where everything is located.<ref>[https://www.aircargoweek.com/finnair-finds-cool-hot/ Finnair finds COOL is the new hot] aircargoweek.com 26 December 2017.

Finavia decided to expand the current terminal building to respond to the expected passenger growth within the following years.\n\nPart of the plan was to build a [[satellite terminal]] next to Terminal 2, but the plan was cancelled in favour of expansion under a single terminal building.<ref name=\"finavia_20131016\" /> In September 2014, Finavia revealed more detailed plans for the future expansion that will take place between 2014 and 2020. According to the plan Terminals 1 and 2 will be combined and expanded under one roof. This expansion work is one of Finland's largest construction projects. The expansion was designed by the Finnish architects' office PES-Architects. The same office designed the previous Helsinki Airport expansions completed in 1996 and 1999, as well as the circular parking buildings in front of the terminal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.finavia.fi/en/development-at-airports/article/2016/helsinki-airports-expansion-is-taking-a-big-leap-toward-2020-eyes-on-services-rich-in-experiences/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817124326/https://www.finavia.fi/en/development-at-airports/article/2016/helsinki-airports-expansion-is-taking-a-big-leap-toward-2020-eyes-on-services-rich-in-experiences/|url-status=dead|title=Helsinki Airport\u2019s expansion is taking a big leap toward 2020: eyes on services rich in experiences - ''Finavia''|archivedate=17 August 2017}}</ref> The surface area will increase by 45%, luggage handling capacity will increase by 50%.

The construction is scheduled to be started in November 2017. Terminal 1 will be expanded by four separate departure gate buildings which will be connected by walking corridors. Each building will have one departure gate excluding one, which will have three gates. Gates (5\u201311) will not be equipped with jet bridges. Buildings will have two floors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taloforum.fi/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1197&start=150|title=Helsinki-Vantaan laajennus - Sivu 11 - Taloforum.fi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hankintailmoitukset.fi/fi/notice/view/2017-007575|title=HILMA: Helsinki-Vantaan lentoaseman terminaalin T1 laajennus, KVR-urakka (Finavia Oyj)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414164031/https://www.hankintailmoitukset.fi/fi/notice/view/2017-007575|archivedate=14 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===== Expansion of Terminal 2 =====\n\nTerminal 2 will have new gates (8 additional gates to Terminal 2) and aircraft stands on the apron.<ref name=\"finavia_20140918\" /> All gates for long-haul flights will have double jet bridges (such as the ones at [[Incheon International Airport]]) to enable handling larger aircraft more efficiently. Finavia has signed a contract with [[Thyssen Krupp]] Airport Systems for 16 widebody aircraft stands with up to 33 new jet bridges. New jet bridges were installed to gates 38 and 39 (now 53 and 54). Gate 48 can accommodate the [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo and there are new aircraft stands on the apron accommodating the A380. Five of the gates will be able to accommodate two regional jets, such as Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, simultaneously at a single gate.<ref name=\"lentoposti_20160812\" /> Two of these gates are located at West Pier.\n\nIn June 2016, the new bus terminal for remote aircraft stand operations was opened to increase the airport's capacity with gates 50A-M.\n\nThe new '''South Pier''' of Terminal 2 was inaugurated on 10 July 2017. The first scheduled flight from the new pier, AY006 departed from Gate 54 to New York City. The new pier covers {{convert|8300|m2}}. In addition to the new terminal building, new dual boarding gates S54 and S55 as well as aircraft stands 171 and 172 were opened. Construction of the southern wing of Terminal 2 started on 4 January 2016.<ref name=\"finavia_growth_and_expansion\" /> The construction took around 18 months. There are two floors: one for arriving passengers, the other for departures and gates 52 to 55. All the gates have dual boarding jet bridges. The new wing also features the first moving walkway at any airport in Finland.\n\nOn 20 September 2016, the construction on the '''West Pier''' began, even though it was expected to start in summer 2017. The first part of the west wing is expected to be finished in April 2019 while the entire pier was completed in October 2019.<ref name=\"HELdevelopment\" /> The west wing represents some \u20ac300,000,000 of Finavia's substantial total investment of \u20ac900,000,000. The first part of the west wing built is the large central plaza, \"Aukio\", which was opened in February 2019. It brings {{convert|25000|m2}} of new passenger and baggage facilities to the airport.<ref name=\"finavia_20160920\" /> The pier is equipped with nine gates for widebody jets. Gate 48 is able to accommodate the Airbus A380.\n\nThe area of the apron to be renovated covers a total of {{convert|157000|m2}}.\n\nThe Helsinki Airport development program also includes plans to expand Terminal 2 to the area currently used for parking and public transport. This would provide more space for check-in, security control and baggage operations, allowing the airport to concentrate all departure and arrival services in a single terminal.<ref name=\"finavia_20160920\" />\n\n==== New cargo terminal ====\n\nThe construction of a new freight terminal ({{convert|35000|m2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) began in March 2015. The capacity of the terminal is being expanded to accommodate the growing freight capacity that will be provided by [[Finnair]]'s [[Airbus A350|Airbus A350 XWB]] fleet. Finnair's freight operations will continue in the current location until relocation to the new freight terminal in Spring 2017.<ref name=\"finavia_20150326\" />\n\n'''Contextual engine'''\n\nPart of the rehaul of Helsinki Airport has included the development of a contextual engine that uses artificial intelligence to digest passenger data in ways that make passing through the airport a more pleasant experience. The benefits come from an array of small improvements; for example, digital signs change language according to the nationalities of those getting off a flight. Passengers are also continuously kept abreast of how long it will take them to reach their gates or pass through security control. [[Monocle (UK magazine)|Monocle]] named the contextual engine built by technology firm [[Reaktor (company)|Reaktor]] as one of the top transportation innovations of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/114/the-direct-approach/|title=The direct approach - Issue 114 - Magazine|website=Monocle|language=en|access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Planned third terminal ===\n\nIn addition to the terminal expansion, Finavia has also contemplated building a third terminal at Helsinki Airport. According to Finavia's tentative plan, the new terminal would be located between runways 04R/22L and 04L/22R, while runway 15/33 would be removed. The terminal would be the principal terminal at the airport but the check-in area would stay in the current terminal building. The decision to build the third terminal has not yet been taken.<ref name=\"hs_20130804\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of the busiest airports in the Nordic countries]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References

The airport is operated by state-owned [[Finavia]].<ref name=\"finavia_airlines\" />\n\nThe airport is the largest in Finland and the [[List of the busiest airports in the Nordic countries|fourth busiest]] in the [[Nordic countries]] in terms of passenger numbers. About 90% of Finland's international air traffic passes through Helsinki Airport.<ref name=\"finavia_brief\" /> The airport handled 21.8 million passengers in 2019, including 18.9 million international passengers and 2.9 million domestic passengers. On average, the airport handles around 350 departures a day.<ref name=\"finavia_brief\" />\n\nThe airport is the main hub for [[Finnair]], the flag carrier of Finland, and its subsidiary [[Nordic Regional Airlines]]. It is also a hub for [[CityJet]] (on behalf of [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS]]) and an operating base for [[Jet Time]], [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]], [[SunClass Airlines]] and [[TUI fly Nordic]]. Helsinki Airport has around 50 regularly-operating airlines. The airport has around 80 scheduled destinations to other parts of Europe and 21 direct long-haul routes to Asia, the Middle East, and North America.

A new site was found some {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} from Helsinki city centre, in an area that today belongs to the city of Vantaa (until 1971 Vantaa was called ''Helsingin maalaiskunta''). It opened temporarily in July 1952 for [[1952 Summer Olympics|that year's Summer Olympics]], held in Helsinki.<ref name=\"finavia_history\" />\n\nThe first two [[Finnair#History|Aero Oy]] [[Douglas DC-3|DC-3]] aircraft, OH-LCC and OH-LCD, landed in Vantaa on 26 June 1952. While Aero (now Finnair) used [[Helsinki-Malmi Airport]], charter flights were directed to the new airport on 26 October 1952. The airport originally had a single runway, the second runway being built four years later in 1956. Regular jet flight operations began in 1959.\n\nA new passenger terminal opened in 1969, while the first transatlantic service to [[New York City|New York]] was inaugurated on 15 May 1969.\n\nDuring this time period, the airport was also called Seutula Airport after the nearby village [[Seutula]].<ref>{{Cite web|first=Jussi|last=Latvala|title=Helsinki-Vantaa airport to get railway after 60 years|url=http://www.helsinkitimes.fi/finland/finland-news/domestic/2671-helsinki-vantaa-airport-to-get-railway-after-60-years-2.html|website=[[Helsinki Times]]|date=21 June 2012|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Helsinki airport inaugurates southern wing expansion|url=http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2017-08/25/content_41471140.htm|website=[[China.org.cn]]|date=25 August 2017|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== New terminal and first Asian flights (1970s\u20131990s) ===\n\nThe year 1973 saw the first security checks being carried out for international flights. The name Helsinki-Vantaa Airport was used from 1977.\n\nIn 1983, the airport began offering the first non-stop service from Western Europe to Japan as [[Finnair]] commenced regular service between Helsinki and [[Tokyo]] with a single [[McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30ER]]. In the 1970s, [[Pan American World Airways|Pan Am]] operated flights from Helsinki to the US. The passenger terminal was expanded for the first time in 1983 and five years later, in 1988, the airport handled over six million passengers annually.\n\nIn 1991, [[Delta Air Lines]] began its operations at the airport. A new terminal was constructed for domestic flights in 1993. In 1996 the international terminal was expanded and merged with the domestic terminal. At the same time, the new control tower was completed. In November 1999, the international terminal was further expanded and the lobby for arriving and departing passengers was built.\n\n=== New millennium and expansion of non-Schengen area (2000\u20132009) ===\n\nIn 2000, the airport handled over 10 million passengers for the first time in its history. The third runway was inaugurated on 28 November 2002 and the first user was [[Finnair]]'s [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] en route to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York]]. In 2004, the international terminal was again expanded and a new shopping area was opened for long-haul passengers. In 2009, the latest expansion of Terminal 2 was completed. The total floor area was {{convert|43908|m2}}. The same year witnessed the opening of a new shopping area and spa for passengers on long-haul flights, the removal of a terminal-specific division between domestic and international flights, and the renovation of Terminal 1 for international flights. In the same year, [[TAP Air Portugal]] commenced service between Helsinki and Lisbon.\n\n=== Significant growth and expansion (2010\u2013present) ===\n\nDuring the 2010s, Helsinki Airport has experienced large increases in the number of annual passengers. In 2010, the airport handled 12,883,399 passengers, an increase of 2.2 percent compared to 2009. Air freight increased by 29.4 percent.\n\nIn April 2010, [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]] opened its first routes to [[Oslo Airport, Gardermoen|Oslo]] and [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]] using [[Boeing 737]] jets. Now the airline is one of the largest operators at the airport with almost 40 destinations in Europe, Asia, and Africa. In 2011, Helsinki Airport saw its biggest growth in a single year in the number of passengers. The number of annual passengers was increased by 2 million passengers and the airport reached the milestone of 14 million passengers. However, [[easyJet]] canceled three routes, from Helsinki to Manchester, London\u2013Gatwick, and Paris\u2013Charles de Gaulle, citing weak demand at Helsinki.<ref name=\"anna.aero_20110323\" />\n\nIn November 2011, [[Austrian Airlines]] canceled its Vienna\u2013Helsinki operations. In the same year, [[Czech Airlines]] ceased its Helsinki operations due to low demand. A year after, [[LOT Polish Airlines]] canceled its service to Helsinki. In 2014, a number of airlines such as [[Aer Lingus]], [[Germanwings]], [[S7 Airlines]], and [[Wizz Air]] canceled services to Helsinki.\n\nIn the 2010s, the airport has seen a huge growth of long-haul flights in terms of weekly flights (see [[#Long-haul traffic|Long-haul traffic]] below).\n\nIn the beginning of 2015, the renovation and construction work related to the development of Helsinki Airport started. For example, the Baggage Claim Hall 2B and Arrival Hall 2A were renovated and in July 2015, train operation on the [[Ring Rail Line]] and connection to Helsinki Central Railway Station were opened. In March 2015, [[Swiss International Air Lines]] started operations to Helsinki but canceled it a year later. In late 2015, [[Blue1]] ceased all operations from Helsinki which was the airline's only base. The airline flew to 28 destinations in Europe. [[Scandinavian Airlines]] sold Blue1 to [[CityJet]], which continues to operate the company on behalf of SAS as part of a larger relationship.<ref name=\"businesswire_20151001\" /> In 2015, the airport handled up to 16 million passengers for the first time. In March 2016, Czech Airlines resumed flights from Prague to Helsinki using [[Airbus A319]] aircraft. On 10 October 2016, the first Gulf carrier [[Qatar Airways]] began operations at the airport and now operates to Helsinki by [[Boeing 787 Dreamliner]]. The carrier was initially planning to launch the service as early as in 2012. Finavia expects that the airport will handle over 18,5 million passengers in 2017 and around 20 million in 2018, in 2019 at the latest. Also in 2017, the airport has experienced huge growth in numbers of passengers flying intercontinental.\n\nAs of 2013, [[Finavia]] has been expanding the airport (see [[#Future expansion and plans|Future expansion]] below).\n\nLife in HEL (#lifeinhel) was a Finavia marketing campaign which took place from 10 October to 9 November 2017 at Helsinki Airport. The campaign mixed TV, game shows, and social media. Ryan Zhu, a Chinese actor and TV personality, lived in a little cabin inside Helsinki Airport for 30 days. Helsinki Airport was awarded the title of best airport in the world by Travellink; by the campaign, Finavia wanted to prove this claim.<ref>[https://lifeinhel.tv/files/LIFEINHEL_PR-ENG.pdf Press release (English)], lifeinhel.tv, Retrieved 21 October 2017</ref>\n\n== Composition ==\n\n[[File:EFHK openstreetmap 20170205.svg|thumb|Map of Helsinki Airport.]]\n\nThe airport is nominally divided into two terminals, located {{convert|250|m}} apart and linked by an internal pedestrian connection both airside and landside. In practice, however, the airside parts of the terminal buildings are not divided into Terminal 1 (the former domestic terminal) and Terminal 2 (the former international terminal) but to [[Schengen agreement|Schengen]] and non-Schengen areas. The terminal capacity of the airport is approximately 16\u201317 million passengers per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.helsinki-vantaa.fi/enemman-tietoa/helsinki-vantaa-lyhyesti/kehityshankkeet/terminaalilaajennus |title=Archived copy |accessdate=12 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608063833/http://www.helsinki-vantaa.fi/enemman-tietoa/helsinki-vantaa-lyhyesti/kehityshankkeet/terminaalilaajennus |archivedate=8 June 2012  }}</ref>\n\nDomestic flights, as well as flights to European Schengen countries, are operated from gates 11\u201331.

The terminal opened in 1952{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} and is the first terminal at the airport. Now the old terminal building is removed and replaced by the current terminal building. The terminal was used for domestic flights but as of 2009, it is also used for international flights. Terminal 1 is used by [[Star Alliance]] carriers, such as [[Aegean Airlines]], [[Croatia Airlines]], [[Lufthansa]], [[Scandinavian Airlines]], and [[TAP Air Portugal]]. In addition to Star Alliance members, [[airBaltic]], [[easyJet]], [[Icelandair]], [[Transavia]] and [[Vueling]] also operate flights from this terminal. Currently, no carriers operate long-haul flights from Terminal 1. The terminal has a train connection to Helsinki Central railway station.\n\nTerminal 1 passenger facilities include tax-free shops, free wireless [[Internet]] access, power sockets, and lockers. There are also several restaurants, caf\u00e9s and the SAS Business Lounge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.finavia.fi/en/helsinki-airport/services/|title=Services}}</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:EFHK terminal 1 20090930 01.jpg|{{nowrap|The exterior of Terminal 1}}\nFile:Vantaa Cafe.JPG|Caf\u00e9 in Terminal 1\nFile:EFHK Terminal 1 interior 20090930.jpg|The interior of Terminal 1\nFile:HEL SK Business Lounge general overview.jpg|SAS Business Lounge\n</gallery>\n\n=== Terminal 2 ===\nTerminal 2 (gates 16\u201355) opened in 1969 for international operations and, at present, also serves domestic flights. It is the larger of the two passenger terminals at the airport. All intercontinental flights operate from Terminal 2. The non-Schengen area of Terminal 2 has been enlarged in 2009 enabling the airport to accommodate eight wide-body aircraft at gates simultaneously while a new shopping area and a spa were opened for passengers on long-distance flights and the division between domestic and international flights was removed. Terminal 2 has many restaurants, bars and shopping areas. The terminal is equipped with 26 aircraft parking stands with passenger bridges. The terminal has a train connection to [[Helsinki Central railway station]].\n\nTerminal 2 passenger facilities include: numerous tax-free shops, [[Avis Rent a Car System|Avis]], [[Europcar]] and [[The Hertz Corporation|Hertz]]-car rentals, free wireless [[Internet]] access, power sockets, lockers, sleeping pods and transfer service desks. Currency exchange, cash machines ([[Automated teller machine|ATM]]), tourist information, an [[Alepa]] grocery store and pharmacy are also available. For children, there are also several playrooms. Dining facilities include [[Burger King]] and O'Learys Sports Bar as well as numerous other restaurants and caf\u00e9s. Terminal 2 also includes two [[Finnair]] lounges: Finnair Lounge in the Schengen-area and Finnair Premium Lounge in the non-Schengen area.\n\nAs a part of Helsinki Airport's expansion plan, the new South Pier was inaugurated in June 2017 and Aukio in February 2019. The new pier features moving walkways and dual boarding jet bridges to enable handling larger aircraft more efficiently. In November 2019, the West Pier is scheduled to open and it will be able to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo. Five of the gates will be able to accommodate two regional jets, such as Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, simultaneously at a single gate.<ref name=\"lentoposti_20160812\" /> Passengers arriving and departing are divided into two floors: one for arriving passengers, the other for departures. In June 2016, the new bus terminal for remote aircraft stand operations was opened to increase the airport's capacity with gates 50A-M.\n\nTerminal 2 is used by member airlines of [[Oneworld]] and [[Skyteam]] airline alliances and most of the non-aligned airlines. [[Turkish Airlines]] makes an exception among [[Star Alliance]] airlines by using Terminal 2. Almost all charter flights are handled at Terminal 2 (which also handles scheduled services). The current airlines using Terminal 2 are [[Aeroflot]], [[Belavia]], [[Blue Air]], [[British Airways]], [[Corendon Airlines]], [[Czech Airlines]], Finnair, [[Nordic Regional Airlines]], [[Freebird Airlines]], [[Jet Time]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[KLM]], [[Norwegian Air Shuttle]], [[Nouvelair Tunisie]], [[Qatar Airways]], [[Royal Jordanian]], [[Sunclass Scandinavia]], [[Tibet Airlines]], [[TUI fly Nordic]], [[TUI Airways]], [[Turkish Airlines]] and [[Ukraine International Airlines]].\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Helsinki-Vantaa T2 n\u00e4k\u00f6alaterassilta 2015-07-01.JPG|The exterior of Terminal 2\nFile:HEL Terminal 2 1.jpg|The interior of Terminal 2\nFile:HEL Terminal 2 3.jpg|The restaurant area in Terminal 2\nFile:15-12-20-Helsinki-Vantaan-Lentoasema-N3S 3117.jpg|[[Finnair]]'s check-in area\nFile:HEL T2 gate 53 2018-05-06.jpg|The gate area of the new South Pier of Terminal 2 non-Schengen area\nFile:HEL T2 gate 54 2018-05-06.jpg|The new South Pier of Terminal 2 non-Schengen area\n</gallery>\n\n=== Other buildings ===\n[[File:Finnair head office 05JUN2015.JPG|thumb|Finnair head office, House of Travel and Transportation]]\nThere are several airport hotels and office buildings on the grounds of the airport. The [[Aviapolis]] is a new international [[business park]] adjacent to the Helsinki airport area, already hosting the operations of numerous companies around the airport. In 2013, [[Finnair]] opened its new head office, known as House of Travel and Transportation, or \"HOTT\". The construction of HOTT began in July 2011 and finished on time in June 2013.\n\n=== Ground handling ===\nAirpro, Aviator, and [[Swissport]] provide ground handling services for airlines.\n\n== Runways ==\n\n[[File:Helsinki-Vantaan kiitotie 33.jpg|thumb|Runway 33 at Helsinki Airport]]\n\nHelsinki Airport has three runways. The runways can handle take-offs and landings of the heaviest aircraft in use today such as the [[Airbus A380]]. The use of three runways allows two runways to be kept in operation when clearing of snow and ice is needed (if one runway is being cleared at a time).<ref name=\"bbc_20101220\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12042213 |title=How Helsinki airport deals with snow and ice |work=BBC News |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=16 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.finavia.fi/en/newsroom/2017/four-facts-about-runways-helsinki-airport |title=Four facts about the runways at Helsinki Airport |publisher=Finavia |date=19 October 2017 |accessdate=8 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%\"\n|-\n!

The primary runway for landings is Runway 2 (15) from the northwest, i.e. from the direction of [[Nurmij\u00e4rvi]], or Runway 1 (22L) from the northeast, i.e. from the direction of [[Kerava]], while the primary runway for take-offs is Runway 3 (22R) towards the southwest, in the direction of Western Vantaa and Espoo. Aircraft with low noise can take off from Runway 1 (22L) towards the south at the same time. When the wind is from the north or east, Runway 3 (04L) or Runway 1 (04R) are usually used for landings, i.e. for approaches from the southwest, the direction of Western Vantaa and Espoo, while take-offs are made from Runway 1 (04R) towards the northeast in the direction of Kerava.\n\nDuring the night time, landings are primarily made using Runway 2 (15) from the northwest, i.e. from the direction of Nurmij\u00e4rvi, and take-offs using Runway 3 (22R) towards the southwest, in the direction of Espoo. Jet plane landings to Runway 2 (33) from the southeast and take-offs from Runway 2 (15) towards the southeast are avoided due to dense population in the affected areas. During night time, propeller plane operations towards the southeast are also prohibited unless otherwise dictated by air traffic safety. Air traffic safety is the main reason for not always being able to choose the optimal runway for noise control.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vuosikertomus.finavia.fi/en/2013/responsibility/responsibility-information/environmental-information/runway-use-helsinki-airport/|title=Runway use, Helsinki Airport|access-date=16 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018212206/http://vuosikertomus.finavia.fi/en/2013/responsibility/responsibility-information/environmental-information/runway-use-helsinki-airport/|archive-date=18 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Technology ==\n\n=== Airport-CDM ===\n\nIn October 2012, Finavia implemented Airport CDM (Collaborative Decision Making) at Helsinki Airport. It is a procedure by [[Eurocontrol]], the European Organization for Safety of Air Navigation, that develops airport operation by increasing co-operation between partners at the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurocontrol.int/news/helsinki-vantaa-goes-cdm|title=Eurocontrol: Helsinki-Vantaa goes A-CDM|website=Eurocontrol|access-date=16 August 2017}}</ref> Airport CDM aims to reduce costs, achieve lower emissions, improve punctuality of operations and increase customer satisfaction at the airport.

Helsinki Airport has around 50 airlines operating regularly. In addition, there are numerous charter airlines operating at the airport. The airport is the main hub for Finnair, that operates over 1100 flights weekly to Europe, Asia, and North America. The airport is also used as an operating base for Norwegian Air Shuttle and the low-cost airline operates over 230 flight weekly to elsewhere in Europe as well as the [[United Arab Emirates]] and [[Morocco]].\n\n==== Main airlines ====\n\nThe following airlines maintain hub or base operations at Helsinki Airport:\n\n* '''Finnair''' is the largest airline operating at the airport, with an all-Airbus fleet of 48 aircraft (excluding [[Nordic Regional Airlines|Norra]]) based at Helsinki, providing scheduled services to the Middle East, Asia, Europe, and North-America. Finnair operates flights from Helsinki to over 100 destinations, including around 20 intercontinental routes. All flights are operated from Terminal 2.\n* '''Jet Time''' is a charter airline that operates several flights from Helsinki to Europe.\n* '''Nordic Regional Airlines (Norra)''', a subsidiary of Finnair that operates to around 30 destinations in Europe. Norra has a fleet of 23 ATR and Embraer aircraft, all operated for Finnair. This airline operates from Terminal 2.\n* '''Norwegian Air Shuttle''', a [[low-cost airline]] which operates to over 30 destinations from Helsinki to Europe and the Middle East, operating from Terminal 2. The airline is the biggest operator at the airport after Finnair (including Norra) and has served over 10 million passengers since 2010.\n* '''SunClass Airlines''' uses Helsinki Airport as a focus city with many charter flights to Southeast Asia and Europe. The airline operates from Terminal 2.\n* '''TUI fly Nordic''', a charter airline that operates to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the [[Caribbean]] in North America. The airline operates from Terminal 2.

In 2017, Helsinki Airport has experienced the third highest growth rate and the second biggest increase in passenger numbers in the last 20 years. On 13 December 2017, the airport reached the milestone of 18 million passengers for the first time ever.\n\n=== Cargo operations ===\n[[File:TNT OE-IBZ pushback at Helsinki-Vantaa (15004018150).jpg|thumb|right|[[TNT Airways]] Boeing 737-400F aircraft at its cargo terminal and [[DHL Aviation]] A300-600F in the background.]]\nHelsinki Airport has been one of the largest airports among the Nordic countries by freight handled. In 2012, the airport handled 192,204 tonnes cargo making the airport the largest one in the Nordics in tonnes of cargo handled that year.\n\nHelsinki Airport has extensive cargo flight activity. There is a cargo area with cargo terminals and cargo transit facilities in the Southeastern part of the airport area. [[ASL Airlines Belgium]] (formerly [[TNT Airways]]) and [[DHL Aviation|DHL]] have their own cargo terminals at the airport. Currently scheduled cargo operating airlines are [[AirBridgeCargo Airlines]] operated with Boeing 747 cargo aircraft, ASL Airlines Belgium, DHL Aviation (operated by EAT Leipzig and DHL Air UK), [[FedEx Airlines|FedEx]], [[UPS Airlines]], and [[Turkish Airlines]] that operates cargo services to HEL from Istanbul, Oslo, and Stockholm with Airbus A310F and A330F aircraft. In addition to scheduled cargo operations, many other cargo airlines have random operations at Helsinki Airport.\n\nThe construction of a new freight terminal ({{convert|35000|m2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) began in March 2015 and was inaugurated on 8 January 2018. The capacity of the terminal is 350,000 tonnes but the theoretical capacity is up to 450,000 tonnes. The freight capacity of the airport is being expanded to accommodate the growing freight capacity that will be provided by [[Finnair]]'s [[Airbus A350|Airbus A350 XWB]] fleet. Finnair's freight operations continued in the previous location until relocation to the new freight terminal in December 2017.<ref name=\"finavia_20150326\" /> The name of the new terminal is Cool Nordic Cargo Hub, but is branded COOL for its modern technology and capacity to handle high volumes of temperature-controlled cargo. A new operations monitoring and tracking platform, \"Cargo Eye\", is used in the new freight terminal. That gives the new Cargo Control Center a live view of what is happening across the cargo network and where everything is located.<ref>[https://www.aircargoweek.com/finnair-finds-cool-hot/ Finnair finds COOL is the new hot] aircargoweek.com 26 December 2017.

Finavia decided to expand the current terminal building to respond to the expected passenger growth within the following years.\n\nPart of the plan was to build a [[satellite terminal]] next to Terminal 2, but the plan was cancelled in favour of expansion under a single terminal building.<ref name=\"finavia_20131016\" /> In September 2014, Finavia revealed more detailed plans for the future expansion that will take place between 2014 and 2020. According to the plan Terminals 1 and 2 will be combined and expanded under one roof. This expansion work is one of Finland's largest construction projects. The expansion was designed by the Finnish architects' office PES-Architects. The same office designed the previous Helsinki Airport expansions completed in 1996 and 1999, as well as the circular parking buildings in front of the terminal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.finavia.fi/en/development-at-airports/article/2016/helsinki-airports-expansion-is-taking-a-big-leap-toward-2020-eyes-on-services-rich-in-experiences/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817124326/https://www.finavia.fi/en/development-at-airports/article/2016/helsinki-airports-expansion-is-taking-a-big-leap-toward-2020-eyes-on-services-rich-in-experiences/|url-status=dead|title=Helsinki Airport\u2019s expansion is taking a big leap toward 2020: eyes on services rich in experiences - ''Finavia''|archivedate=17 August 2017}}</ref> The surface area will increase by 45%, luggage handling capacity will increase by 50%.

The construction is scheduled to be started in November 2017. Terminal 1 will be expanded by four separate departure gate buildings which will be connected by walking corridors. Each building will have one departure gate excluding one, which will have three gates. Gates (5\u201311) will not be equipped with jet bridges. Buildings will have two floors.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taloforum.fi/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=1197&start=150|title=Helsinki-Vantaan laajennus - Sivu 11 - Taloforum.fi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hankintailmoitukset.fi/fi/notice/view/2017-007575|title=HILMA: Helsinki-Vantaan lentoaseman terminaalin T1 laajennus, KVR-urakka (Finavia Oyj)|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414164031/https://www.hankintailmoitukset.fi/fi/notice/view/2017-007575|archivedate=14 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n===== Expansion of Terminal 2 =====\n\nTerminal 2 will have new gates (8 additional gates to Terminal 2) and aircraft stands on the apron.<ref name=\"finavia_20140918\" /> All gates for long-haul flights will have double jet bridges (such as the ones at [[Incheon International Airport]]) to enable handling larger aircraft more efficiently. Finavia has signed a contract with [[Thyssen Krupp]] Airport Systems for 16 widebody aircraft stands with up to 33 new jet bridges. New jet bridges were installed to gates 38 and 39 (now 53 and 54). Gate 48 can accommodate the [[Airbus A380]] superjumbo and there are new aircraft stands on the apron accommodating the A380. Five of the gates will be able to accommodate two regional jets, such as Boeing 737s or Airbus A320s, simultaneously at a single gate.<ref name=\"lentoposti_20160812\" /> Two of these gates are located at West Pier.\n\nIn June 2016, the new bus terminal for remote aircraft stand operations was opened to increase the airport's capacity with gates 50A-M.\n\nThe new '''South Pier''' of Terminal 2 was inaugurated on 10 July 2017. The first scheduled flight from the new pier, AY006 departed from Gate 54 to New York City. The new pier covers {{convert|8300|m2}}. In addition to the new terminal building, new dual boarding gates S54 and S55 as well as aircraft stands 171 and 172 were opened. Construction of the southern wing of Terminal 2 started on 4 January 2016.<ref name=\"finavia_growth_and_expansion\" /> The construction took around 18 months. There are two floors: one for arriving passengers, the other for departures and gates 52 to 55. All the gates have dual boarding jet bridges. The new wing also features the first moving walkway at any airport in Finland.\n\nOn 20 September 2016, the construction on the '''West Pier''' began, even though it was expected to start in summer 2017. The first part of the west wing is expected to be finished in April 2019 while the entire pier was completed in October 2019.<ref name=\"HELdevelopment\" /> The west wing represents some \u20ac300,000,000 of Finavia's substantial total investment of \u20ac900,000,000. The first part of the west wing built is the large central plaza, \"Aukio\", which was opened in February 2019. It brings {{convert|25000|m2}} of new passenger and baggage facilities to the airport.<ref name=\"finavia_20160920\" /> The pier is equipped with nine gates for widebody jets. Gate 48 is able to accommodate the Airbus A380.\n\nThe area of the apron to be renovated covers a total of {{convert|157000|m2}}.\n\nThe Helsinki Airport development program also includes plans to expand Terminal 2 to the area currently used for parking and public transport. This would provide more space for check-in, security control and baggage operations, allowing the airport to concentrate all departure and arrival services in a single terminal.<ref name=\"finavia_20160920\" />\n\n==== New cargo terminal ====\n\nThe construction of a new freight terminal ({{convert|35000|m2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) began in March 2015. The capacity of the terminal is being expanded to accommodate the growing freight capacity that will be provided by [[Finnair]]'s [[Airbus A350|Airbus A350 XWB]] fleet. Finnair's freight operations will continue in the current location until relocation to the new freight terminal in Spring 2017.<ref name=\"finavia_20150326\" />\n\n'''Contextual engine'''\n\nPart of the rehaul of Helsinki Airport has included the development of a contextual engine that uses artificial intelligence to digest passenger data in ways that make passing through the airport a more pleasant experience. The benefits come from an array of small improvements; for example, digital signs change language according to the nationalities of those getting off a flight. Passengers are also continuously kept abreast of how long it will take them to reach their gates or pass through security control. [[Monocle (UK magazine)|Monocle]] named the contextual engine built by technology firm [[Reaktor (company)|Reaktor]] as one of the top transportation innovations of 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://monocle.com/magazine/issues/114/the-direct-approach/|title=The direct approach - Issue 114 - Magazine|website=Monocle|language=en|access-date=5 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Planned third terminal ===\n\nIn addition to the terminal expansion, Finavia has also contemplated building a third terminal at Helsinki Airport. According to Finavia's tentative plan, the new terminal would be located between runways 04R/22L and 04L/22R, while runway 15/33 would be removed. The terminal would be the principal terminal at the airport but the check-in area would stay in the current terminal building. The decision to build the third terminal has not yet been taken.<ref name=\"hs_20130804\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[List of the busiest airports in the Nordic countries]]\n{{clear}}\n\n== References

His father served in the [[6th Indiana Infantry Regiment|6th Indiana Infantry]] during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and was wounded three times during battle. He died due to complications from these injuries.<ref>{{Find a Grave}}</ref>\n\nDaringer made his Major League debut on April 20, 1914 vs. the [[Newark Peppers|Indianapolis Hoosiers]], getting two hits in two at-bats, as well as his first Major League RBI against [[George Kaiserling]]. After a sub-par season in which he received only 186 plate appearances, Daringer was released by the Packers.\n\nDaringer was also in the starting lineup against the Chicago Whales in the first game in Weegham Park, now known as [[Wrigley Field]].
