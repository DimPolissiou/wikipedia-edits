The Roman name of the fort Navio was later changed to the [[Old English language|Old English]] word for fort, ''[[Borough|brough]]''. Navio fort was originally about {{convert|3|acre}} in size and built of timber and earthworks around 100 BC. It was rebuilt in stone in a rectangular form (about {{convert|90|by|105|m}}) around 150 BC from when it was occupied for over 200 years. It was subsequently rebuilt and altered and in use until around 350 AD. The site of the fort now consists of earthwork banks and ditches around an earthen platform, buried remains and a few exposed stone slabs.

A series of [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] images reveal a mansion on top of [[Devil's Tower]]. Other images featured the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] followed by the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] and a [[pyramid]] featuring the [[all-seeing eye]], [[tarot cards]] and [[Stonehenge]]. The title sequence would form over the mansion with a figure in the window. The figure would turn and reveal himself to be host Edward Mulhare. \"It's time for our journey to begin.\" He would look into an old-fashioned [[zoetrope]] machine, which would feature preview images of the episode topic.

A series of [[Three-dimensional space|3D]] images reveal a mansion on top of [[Devil's Tower]]. Other images featured the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] followed by the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|''Titanic'']] and a [[pyramid]] featuring the [[all-seeing eye]], [[tarot cards]] and [[Stonehenge]].
