It is found on the seaward side of mangrove swamps, often in the company of ''[[Rhizophora]]''.\n\n==Description==\nA tree that can grow up to 25m, though usually smaller, around 7-10m, it has a glabrous, smoothish, trunk with reddish brown bark (the bark is sometimes fibrous, sometimes lightish brown or grey). The tree develops short prop-roots rather than long stilt-roots. The green elliptic leaves are 5-15cm long.  Flowers are solitary, with white or cream petals, that soon turn brown up to 1.5cm long, pinkish-green to reddish brown calyx. The fruit are turbinate (spinning-top shaped), 2cm long, when mature, the spindle-shaped fruits drop and become embedded in the mud in an upright position, where they rapidly develop roots. The seeds, when still on tree, have a hypocotyl up to 11cm long.<ref name=\"powo\" />\n\n[[File:\u0d2a\u0d47\u0d28\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d Bruguiera gymnorhiza.jpg|thumb|Bruguiera gymnorhiza]]\n\n==Distribution==\nThe tree is found as a native on the coasts of places bordering the [[Indian Ocean]], the [[South China Sea]], and parts of the western [[Pacific Ocean]].<ref name=\"powo\" /> Regions that it is native to include: [[Caroline Island]], [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], [[Wallis and Futuna]], [[Fiji]], [[Marshall Islands]], [[Gilbert Islands]], [[Nauru]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Queensland]], [[New Guinea]], [[Northern Territory]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Sulawesi]], [[Ryukyu Islands|Nansei-shoto]], [[Borneo]], [[Java|Jawa]], [[Hainan]], [[Christmas Island]], [[Southeast China]], [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Sumatera]], [[Malaya]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nicobar Islands]], [[Andaman Islands]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Maldives]], [[Mauritius]], [[Madagascar]], [[Aldabra]], [[Seychelles]], [[Somalia]], [[Djibouti]], [[Kenya]], [[Scattered Islands in the Indian Ocean|Mozambique Channel Islands]], [[Tanzania]], [[Mozambique]], [[KwaZulu-Natal]], [[Cape Provinces]].\n\nIt has become extinct in [[Taiwan]], and is naturalized in [[Florida]]\n\n==Habitat==\nThe tree grows on intertidal mud-flats and estuaries, on the less exposed parts of the coast, at elevation of sea level.<ref name=\"powo\" /> Salt water habitats on an alluvial sediment allows the tree to spread with its adventitious roots.<ref name=\"dyphon\" />\nThe black mangrove is a protected tree in South Africa.<ref name=dwaf/>\n\n==Names==\nAs well as its botanical name, the tree is known by many common, or vernacular names.

His father, a local politician, was forced to relocate to the nation's capital, [[Montevideo]], following a political dispute. The young man graduated from the [[Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica]], started as a poetry contributor to writer [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3]], and became a journalist for ''El Nacional'' and, in 1901, founded his first periodical, ''Alborada'' (\"Dawn\"). He was named Editor-in-chief of ''La Prensa'', a newspaper aligned with the ''[[National Party (Uruguay)|Partido Blanco]]'' (\"White Party\"). Political intrigue once again intruded in the young man's life, however, when the newspaper was forcibly shuttered in 1903, leading Vigil to relocate to neighboring [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].<ref name=bontempo>[http://historiadoresdelaprensa.com.mx/hdp/files/247.doc Bontempo, Mar\u00eda Paula.

Much as ''Pulgarcito'' had been before competition led to its 1907 closure, ''Mundo Argentino'' was a heavily illustrated magazine packed with advertisements and coupons and centered on a particular genre without being limited to it.  The magazine, by 1912, boasted a weekly circulation of over 36,000, though the versatile businessman sold it at its peak to ''[[Editorial Haynes]]'' in 1917; by then, ''Mundo Argentino'' sold 118,000 copies a week (in a country with fewer than 5 million adults).<ref name=bontempo/>\n\nVigil parlayed the sale into the establishment of a new publishing house: ''[[Editorial Atl\u00e1ntida]]''. The company would publish his new titles: a news and commentary magazine, ''Atl\u00e1ntida'' (1918), the sports weekly ''[[El Gr\u00e1fico]]'', the children's magazine ''[[Billiken (magazine)|Billiken]]'' (both in 1919), and for women, ''Para T\u00ed'' (\"For You,\" 1922); the latter three remain the oldest Argentine magazines still in publication, became circulation leaders in the Spanish-speaking world.<ref name=monitor>[http://www.me.gov.ar/monitor/nro10/medios.htm ''El Monitor'': El largo camino de Billiken] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526142634/http://www.me.gov.ar/monitor/nro10/medios.htm |date=2009-05-26 }} {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nThe noted publisher published a series of best-selling children's books through ''Atl\u00e1ntida'', as well.

His father, a local politician, was forced to relocate to the nation's capital, [[Montevideo]], following a political dispute. The young man graduated from the [[Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica]], started as a poetry contributor to writer [[Jos\u00e9 Enrique Rod\u00f3]], and became a journalist for ''El Nacional'' and, in 1901, founded his first periodical, ''Alborada'' (\"Dawn\"). He was named Editor-in-chief of ''La Prensa'', a newspaper aligned with the ''[[National Party (Uruguay)|Partido Blanco]]'' (\"White Party\"). Political intrigue once again intruded in the young man's life, however, when the newspaper was forcibly shuttered in 1903, leading Vigil to relocate to neighboring [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].<ref name=bontempo>[http://historiadoresdelaprensa.com.mx/hdp/files/247.doc Bontempo, Mar\u00eda Paula.

Much as ''Pulgarcito'' had been before competition led to its 1907 closure, ''Mundo Argentino'' was a heavily illustrated magazine packed with advertisements and coupons and centered on a particular genre without being limited to it.  The magazine, by 1912, boasted a weekly circulation of over 36,000, though the versatile businessman sold it at its peak to ''[[Editorial Haynes]]'' in 1917; by then, ''Mundo Argentino'' sold 118,000 copies a week (in a country with fewer than 5 million adults).<ref name=bontempo/>\n\nVigil parlayed the sale into the establishment of a new publishing house: ''[[Editorial Atl\u00e1ntida]]''.
