The band members include, from eldest, Toriano Adryall Jackson, Jr. (also known as Taj), Taryll Adren Jackson and [[T. J. Jackson (singer)|Tito Joe Jackson]] (also known as T. J.). Their uncle, [[Michael Jackson]], mentored the trio and signed them to his label, MJJ Entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Brotherhood'' (1995\u20131997)===\n3T released their debut album ''[[Brotherhood (3T album)|Brotherhood]]'' in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international [[chart-topper|hit]] with their debut [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Anything (3T song)|Anything]]\". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including \"24/7\", \"Why\" (a [[duet (music)|duet]] with their uncle [[Michael Jackson]]), \"[[I Need You (3T song)|I Need You]]\" (with a brief appearance by Michael), \"Tease Me\" and \"Gotta Be You\". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the [[Spice Girls]], as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for [[soundtrack]]s to [[motion pictures|films]] such as ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home]]'', ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[Trippin' (film)|Trippin']]''. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album ''Brotherhood'', which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T') and a surprise performance of the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] hit, \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\".\n\n3T completed an album after the release of ''Brotherhood'', with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final track list. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with [[Michael Jackson]] (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be ''The Lost Album''.\nAlso they are of Dominican ancestry on their moms side.<ref>[http://www.3t.com/music/albums/76-the-lost-album \"The Lost Album\"]. 3T.com. Retrieved: 2014-08-12</ref>\n\n===''Identity'' (2003\u20132005)===\nTaryll and T. J. have written/produced tracks for their aunt [[Janet Jackson]] as well as for [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Bruno Mars]]. After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in [[2003 in music|2003]], 3T continued to perform in [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances and performances. The album titled ''[[Identity (3T album)|Identity]]'' was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: \"[[Stuck on You (Lionel Richie song)#3T version|Stuck On You]]\" (a cover of the [[Lionel Richie]] song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium and in 2004 in the Netherlands, and \"Sex Appeal\" in 2004. Neither single was released outside of Europe. In 2008, 3T made ''Identity'' available on both [[iTunes]] and [[amazon.com]] worldwide.\n\n===On-and-off appearances (2007\u20132011)===\nThe brothers appeared on the show ''This Is David Gest'' in 2007, including recording the theme tune \"Crazy Kinda Guy\". The show began on April 22, 2007.

The band members include, from eldest, Toriano Adryall Jackson, Jr. (also known as Taj), Taryll Adren Jackson and [[T. J. Jackson (singer)|Tito Joe Jackson]] (also known as T. J.). Their uncle, [[Michael Jackson]], mentored the trio and signed them to his label, MJJ Entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===''Brotherhood'' (1995\u20131997)===\n3T released their debut album ''[[Brotherhood (3T album)|Brotherhood]]'' in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international [[chart-topper|hit]] with their debut [[single (music)|single]] \"[[Anything (3T song)|Anything]]\". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including \"24/7\", \"Why\" (a [[duet (music)|duet]] with their uncle [[Michael Jackson]]), \"[[I Need You (3T song)|I Need You]]\" (with a brief appearance by Michael), \"Tease Me\" and \"Gotta Be You\". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the [[Spice Girls]], as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for [[soundtrack]]s to [[motion pictures|films]] such as ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home]]'', ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[Trippin' (film)|Trippin']]''. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album ''Brotherhood'', which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T') and a surprise performance of the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] hit, \"[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]\".\n\n3T completed an album after the release of ''Brotherhood'', with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final track list. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with [[Michael Jackson]] (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be ''The Lost Album''.\nAlso they are of Dominican ancestry on their moms side.<ref>[http://www.3t.com/music/albums/76-the-lost-album \"The Lost Album\"]. 3T.com. Retrieved: 2014-08-12</ref>\n\n===''Identity'' (2003\u20132005)===\nTaryll and T. J. have written/produced tracks for their aunt [[Janet Jackson]] as well as for [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Bruno Mars]]. After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in [[2003 in music|2003]], 3T continued to perform in [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances and performances. The album titled ''[[Identity (3T album)|Identity]]'' was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: \"[[Stuck on You (Lionel Richie song)#3T version|Stuck On You]]\" (a cover of the [[Lionel Richie]] song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium and in 2004 in the Netherlands, and \"Sex Appeal\" in 2004. Neither single was released outside of Europe. In 2008, 3T made ''Identity'' available on both [[iTunes]] and [[amazon.com]] worldwide.\n\n===On-and-off appearances (2007\u20132011)===\nThe brothers appeared on the show ''This Is David Gest'' in 2007, including recording the theme tune \"Crazy Kinda Guy\". The show began on April 22, 2007. They appeared in an episode where Gest took cameras for a rare glimpse of the Jackson family house in Encino, California, where he met Tito and 3T as well as matriarch [[Katherine Jackson]], as well as a later episode showing them recording the theme tune.\n\nDuring the summer of 2008, the Jackson family (including Tito) stayed at a holiday let (rental) for six weeks in [[Appledore, Torridge, Devon|Appledore]], [[Devon]], [[England]] while searching for a house to buy in the area. The project was filmed for a [[Channel 4]] documentary called ''The Jacksons are Coming'', which was aired in 2008. Taj and T. J. appear with their father, but Taryll did not join them on the trip. The 3 family members also attended a Michael Jackson fan event in Devon as part of their stay, ringing him up during the event which led to Michael talking to the fans over a loudspeaker on the phone.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583492/The-Jacksons-to-hit-reality-TV---in-Devon.html | title=The Jacksons to hit reality TV - in Devon | work=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] | publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] | date=2008-04-02 | accessdate=2009-03-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5247250.ece?openComment=true | title=Last Night's TV: The Jacksons Are Coming | first=Mick | last=Hume | work=[[The Times]] | publisher=[[Times Newspapers]] | date=2008-11-28 | accessdate=2009-03-20 | location=London}}</ref>\n\nAll three of them appeared on the [[A&E (TV channel)|A&E]] TV show entitled ''[[The Jacksons: A Family Dynasty]]''.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2009/12/12/little_reality_in_jacksons_family_dynasty/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Jacksons + reality doesn't compute | first=Matthew | last=Gilbert | date=December 12, 2009}}</ref> They appear with their father Tito, who is trying to convince them to relaunch their career.<ref name=\"Gilbert\"/>\n\nOn January 31, 2010, the three brothers appeared on stage at the 52nd Grammy Awards to support their cousins Prince Michael, Jr. and Paris Michael Katherine Jackson as they accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award on behalf of their father, Michael Jackson.

Initially, the bridge was repaired through a $30.9 million contract with Boh Brothers Construction Company.  However, Louisiana has since replaced the bridge with two higher elevation spans in 2009 and 2010.\n\n==Route description==\nFrom [[Texas]] to [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], I-10 parallels the older [[U.S. Route 90]] corridor. From Lafayette, the highway heads east-northeast toward Baton Rouge via the [[Atchafalaya Basin Bridge|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway]], an 18.2-mile (nearly 30&nbsp;km) bridge across the [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya River and its accompanying swamp]]. Between the two cities, I-10 parallels [[U.S. Route 190]], from [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] to Baton Rouge. This route has signs and is designated as an alternate I-10 by-pass that runs from I-10/I-49 north to U.S. 190 (exit 19B at Opelousas) then east across to Baton Rouge and back down to I-10 via I-110 south. Traffic can be diverted both ways along this route should there be the necessity to close I-10 across the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway and is also used as a hurricane evacuation route.\n\n[[File:The I-10, running west of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|left|I-10 running west of New Orleans, spans the [[Bonnet Carre Spillway]] at [[Lake Pontchartrain]]]]\nIn the capital of Baton Rouge, U.S. 190 continues east alongside [[Interstate 12]] to [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] and [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] while I-10 turns southeastward and parallels [[U.S. Route 61]] ([[Airline Highway]]) to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In the Crescent City, I-10 rejoins U.S. 90 (and later [[U.S. Route 11 in Louisiana|U.S. Route 11]]) as it heads toward [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]]. In Slidell, U.S. 11 continues northeastward toward [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]] while I-10 and U.S. 90 turn eastward toward coastal [[Mississippi]].\n\nMajor bridges on I-10 in Louisiana include the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Sabine River)|Sabine River Bridge]] (c. 1952, replaced 2003), the [[Lake Charles I-10 Bridge]] (1952), the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway (1973), the [[Horace Wilkinson Bridge]] over the [[Mississippi River]] (1968), the [[I-10 Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge|Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge]] (c. 1972), the [[I-10 High Rise Bridge|Industrial Canal Bridge]] (c. 1960), [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Frank Davis \"Naturally N'Awlins\" Memorial Bridge]] (1965, replaced 2010), and the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Pearl River)|Pearl River Bridge]] (c. 1970).\n\n[[File:Interstate 10 eastbound over Lake Charles (LA).jpg|thumb|400px|right|Interstate 10 eastbound passing over [[Lake Charles (Louisiana)|Lake Charles]]/[[Calcasieu River]] near Lake Charles]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:New Orleans, Louisiana 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|200px|Until around 1960, Interstates 10 and [[Interstate 59 (Louisiana)|59]] would have split near the present [[I-510 (LA)|I-510]] interchange in eastern [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]]]\nBy the beginning of planning for the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1939 (then called the Interregional Highway System), the [[Houston (TX)|Houston]]-New Orleans-[[Mobile (AL)|Mobile]] corridor was part of the system.

This would have provided a shorter route than I-10, bypassing Baton Rouge to the south.  The [[Gramercy Bridge]] was later built along its planned alignment, with [[Louisiana Highway 3125|LA 3125]] connecting to Gramercy, but no road extends west from the bridge across the Atchafalaya Swamp to Lafayette.\n\n[[File:I-10 LA 127.5mi.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway in Iberville Parish]]\nInterstate 12, serving as a bypass of New Orleans around the north side of Lake Pontchartrain, was not added until October 17, 1957.  At the time, I-10 and [[Interstate 59 (Louisiana)|Interstate 59]] split in eastern New Orleans, with I-59 following present I-10 and I-10 following the U.S. 90 corridor into Mississippi, and so I-12 only ran to I-59 north of Slidell.<ref name=\"October 1957 Interstates\">{{cite map |publisher= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_plan_October_17,_1957_reverse_colors.jpg |title= Routes To Be Added to the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |date= October 17, 1957 |accessdate= August 15, 2012}}</ref>  By the mid-1960s, the routes had been realigned to their current configuration, with I-12 and I-59 both ending at I-10 near Slidell.<ref>{{cite map |publisher= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_status_unknown_date.jpg |title= The National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |year= c. 1963 |accessdate= August 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the Interstate Highway System in Louisiana began in 1957.<ref name=\"S-T 8-7-57\">{{cite news |title=Federal funds for roads |newspaper=State-Times |location=Baton Rouge |date=August 7, 1957 |page=8A}}</ref>  Early I-10 contracts were done under the route designation [[Louisiana Highway 3027|LA 3027]].  Much of the early construction on the I-10 corridor was concentrated on relieving traffic problems in urban centers.  Several such projects were already underway and were incorporated into the route of I-10 during construction, such as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] in New Orleans.  In addition, the two major bridges on the route in [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu Parish]] between the Texas state line and Lake Charles were built for U.S. 90 in the early 1950s and retrofitted for I-10 traffic.  Sections of I-10 through rural areas and/or those sections already served adequately by existing highways, such as Airline Highway (US&nbsp;61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, were constructed later in the program.  By the spring of 1975, the entire route of I-10 had been opened across Louisiana except for a problem 5.5 mile section between [[Gonzales, Louisiana|Gonzales]] and [[Sorrento, Louisiana|Sorrento]] that was not completed for another three years.\n\n{{prose|date=January 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the I-10 Twin Span Bridge, a portion of I-10 between New Orleans and Slidell, spanning the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, was severely damaged, causing a break in I-10 at that point.  Unlike the [[Escambia Bay Bridge]] (east of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]] and damaged by Hurricane Ivan) which is a major artery, I-12 is available to bypass New Orleans.  Taking I-12 to the [[Lake Ponchartrain Causeway]] allowed entry and exit to and from the [[Greater New Orleans]] area from the East.  On October 14, 2005 at 3:00 PM, the eastbound span was reopened to two way traffic.  On January 6, 2006 at 6:00 AM, both lanes of the westbound span were reopened to traffic using temporary metal trusses and road panels to replace damaged sections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public.fotki.com/apjung/roadgeeking/hurricane_katrina/6/ |title=6 album &#124; Andy's Category 6 (& more) Photo Gallery &#124; Fotki.com, photo and video sharing made easy |publisher=Public.fotki.com |date= July 13, 2005 |accessdate= September 19, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2012}}</ref>  This restored all four lanes of the I-10 Twin Span for normal traffic with a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) speed limit for the westbound lanes and 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) for the eastbound lanes.

Initially, the bridge was repaired through a $30.9 million contract with Boh Brothers Construction Company.  However, Louisiana has since replaced the bridge with two higher elevation spans in 2009 and 2010.\n\n==Route description==\nFrom [[Texas]] to [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], I-10 parallels the older [[U.S. Route 90]] corridor. From Lafayette, the highway heads east-northeast toward Baton Rouge via the [[Atchafalaya Basin Bridge|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway]], an 18.2-mile (nearly 30&nbsp;km) bridge across the [[Atchafalaya Basin|Atchafalaya River and its accompanying swamp]]. Between the two cities, I-10 parallels [[U.S. Route 190]], from [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] to Baton Rouge. This route has signs and is designated as an alternate I-10 by-pass that runs from I-10/I-49 north to U.S. 190 (exit 19B at Opelousas) then east across to Baton Rouge and back down to I-10 via I-110 south. Traffic can be diverted both ways along this route should there be the necessity to close I-10 across the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway and is also used as a hurricane evacuation route.\n\n[[File:The I-10, running west of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|left|I-10 running west of New Orleans, spans the [[Bonnet Carre Spillway]] at [[Lake Pontchartrain]]]]\nIn the capital of Baton Rouge, U.S. 190 continues east alongside [[Interstate 12]] to [[Hammond, Louisiana|Hammond]] and [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] while I-10 turns southeastward and parallels [[U.S. Route 61]] ([[Airline Highway]]) to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. In the Crescent City, I-10 rejoins U.S. 90 (and later [[U.S. Route 11 in Louisiana|U.S. Route 11]]) as it heads toward [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]]. In Slidell, U.S. 11 continues northeastward toward [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]] while I-10 and U.S. 90 turn eastward toward coastal [[Mississippi]].\n\nMajor bridges on I-10 in Louisiana include the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Sabine River)|Sabine River Bridge]] (c. 1952, replaced 2003), the [[Lake Charles I-10 Bridge]] (1952), the Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway (1973), the [[Horace Wilkinson Bridge]] over the [[Mississippi River]] (1968), the [[I-10 Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge|Bonnet Carr\u00e9 Spillway Bridge]] (c. 1972), the [[I-10 High Rise Bridge|Industrial Canal Bridge]] (c. 1960), [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Frank Davis \"Naturally N'Awlins\" Memorial Bridge]] (1965, replaced 2010), and the [[Interstate 10 bridge (Pearl River)|Pearl River Bridge]] (c. 1970).\n\n[[File:Interstate 10 eastbound over Lake Charles (LA).jpg|thumb|400px|right|Interstate 10 eastbound passing over [[Lake Charles (Louisiana)|Lake Charles]]/[[Calcasieu River]] near Lake Charles]]\n\n==History==\n[[File:New Orleans, Louisiana 1955 Yellow Book.jpg|thumb|200px|Until around 1960, Interstates 10 and [[Interstate 59 (Louisiana)|59]] would have split near the present [[I-510 (LA)|I-510]] interchange in eastern [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]]]\nBy the beginning of planning for the [[Interstate Highway System]] in 1939 (then called the Interregional Highway System), the [[Houston (TX)|Houston]]-New Orleans-[[Mobile (AL)|Mobile]] corridor was part of the system.

This would have provided a shorter route than I-10, bypassing Baton Rouge to the south.  The [[Gramercy Bridge]] was later built along its planned alignment, with [[Louisiana Highway 3125|LA 3125]] connecting to Gramercy, but no road extends west from the bridge across the Atchafalaya Swamp to Lafayette.\n\n[[File:I-10 LA 127.5mi.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Atchafalaya Swamp Freeway in Iberville Parish]]\nInterstate 12, serving as a bypass of New Orleans around the north side of Lake Pontchartrain, was not added until October 17, 1957.  At the time, I-10 and [[Interstate 59 (Louisiana)|Interstate 59]] split in eastern New Orleans, with I-59 following present I-10 and I-10 following the U.S. 90 corridor into Mississippi, and so I-12 only ran to I-59 north of Slidell.<ref name=\"October 1957 Interstates\">{{cite map |publisher= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_plan_October_17,_1957_reverse_colors.jpg |title= Routes To Be Added to the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |date= October 17, 1957 |accessdate= August 15, 2012}}</ref>  By the mid-1960s, the routes had been realigned to their current configuration, with I-12 and I-59 both ending at I-10 near Slidell.<ref>{{cite map |publisher= Public Roads Administration |url= //commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Interstate_Highway_status_unknown_date.jpg |title= The National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |year= c. 1963 |accessdate= August 15, 2012}}</ref>\n\nConstruction of the Interstate Highway System in Louisiana began in 1957.<ref name=\"S-T 8-7-57\">{{cite news |title=Federal funds for roads |newspaper=State-Times |location=Baton Rouge |date=August 7, 1957 |page=8A}}</ref>  Early I-10 contracts were done under the route designation [[Louisiana Highway 3027|LA 3027]].  Much of the early construction on the I-10 corridor was concentrated on relieving traffic problems in urban centers.  Several such projects were already underway and were incorporated into the route of I-10 during construction, such as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]] in New Orleans.  In addition, the two major bridges on the route in [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu Parish]] between the Texas state line and Lake Charles were built for U.S. 90 in the early 1950s and retrofitted for I-10 traffic.  Sections of I-10 through rural areas and/or those sections already served adequately by existing highways, such as Airline Highway (US&nbsp;61) between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, were constructed later in the program.  By the spring of 1975, the entire route of I-10 had been opened across Louisiana except for a problem 5.5 mile section between [[Gonzales, Louisiana|Gonzales]] and [[Sorrento, Louisiana|Sorrento]] that was not completed for another three years.\n\n{{prose|date=January 2017}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the I-10 Twin Span Bridge, a portion of I-10 between New Orleans and Slidell, spanning the eastern end of Lake Pontchartrain, was severely damaged, causing a break in I-10 at that point.  Unlike the [[Escambia Bay Bridge]] (east of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], [[Florida]] and damaged by Hurricane Ivan) which is a major artery, I-12 is available to bypass New Orleans.  Taking I-12 to the [[Lake Ponchartrain Causeway]] allowed entry and exit to and from the [[Greater New Orleans]] area from the East.  On October 14, 2005 at 3:00 PM, the eastbound span was reopened to two way traffic.  On January 6, 2006 at 6:00 AM, both lanes of the westbound span were reopened to traffic using temporary metal trusses and road panels to replace damaged sections.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://public.fotki.com/apjung/roadgeeking/hurricane_katrina/6/ |title=6 album &#124; Andy's Category 6 (& more) Photo Gallery &#124; Fotki.com, photo and video sharing made easy |publisher=Public.fotki.com |date= July 13, 2005 |accessdate= September 19, 2011}}{{unreliable source?|failed=y|date= August 2012}}</ref>  This restored all four lanes of the I-10 Twin Span for normal traffic with a 45&nbsp;mph (70&nbsp;km/h) speed limit for the westbound lanes and 60&nbsp;mph (100&nbsp;km/h) for the eastbound lanes.

His name may be short for Pignatius.<ref>{{cite episode |series=Pig Goat Banana Bricket |title=Let's Get Tiny |minutes=4}}<br>Pig \"I'm going to follow my dream and be the best blowhole in the history of blowholes, or my name isn't '''Pignatius Abalonea Plutonius''' the fourteenth.\"<br>Banana: (pauses after Pig screams and runs off) \"..That's not his name.\"</ref> Pig is resistant to what would normally be life-threatening injuries.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Zombie Broheims |series=PGBC |quote=Stomach spears, fun!}} (pulling spears out through his stomach after eating pickles stuffed full of spear-wielding munchkin warriors who impaled him afterward)</ref>\n* Goat (voiced by [[Candi Milo]]) \u2013 a sweet and cheerful anthropomorphic [[goat]] woman<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |minutes=11}} Goat: \"I'm a one-woman band.\"</ref> who has been Pig's roommate for the past 29 years.<ref name=TwentyNine>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |minutes=18}} (Pig's segment) Pig: Who?<br>Goat: Goat. You know, your roommate for the past twenty nine years?<br>Pig: Oh, that Goat.</ref> She is the \"artist\" of the group being able to play the guitar and having a penchant for acting. Goat can be very easily irritated by others' antics and often displays anger, causing her to babble, speak [[gibberish]], and occasionally puff up her chest when angry (e.g. \"Flib flabbin' flibble flubbin!\"). Her catchphrase is \"Totally goatally\", which she says when she agrees with something. Goat has normal human-shaped ears (not goat-shaped) normally obscured underneath the locks of hair on the sides of her head. The horns on top of her head have holes in them.\n* Banana (voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]) \u2013 a lazy, selfish anthropomorphic [[banana]] who enjoys playing video games. He has [[boy scouts]] for [[henchmen]]. Banana is the \"wise-guy\" of the group who loves to have fun and pull pranks. Banana is afraid of [[primates]] of all species, because they eat his kind. Banana tends to cry when put into pressure but quickly stops. He says his catchphrase \"Sweet mama's monkeys\" when he is surprised or shocked, and \"simpledy doo\" after finishing a task.\n* Cricket (voiced by [[Paul Rugg]]) \u2013 an anthropomorphic [[cricket (insect)|cricket]] who is a genius inventor and speaks with a [[lisp]]. Cricket is the \"brains\" of the group. He is also the most responsible of the four and usually is forced to clean up their messes. Cricket has a [[Puppy love|crush]] on Goat, and while she has hugged him (and Banana/Pig simultaneously) and said she loves him, this can simply be behavior towards a [[friend zone|pal]]. He sometimes says \"Holy laser farts\", when he is surprised or shocked.\n\n===Recurring===\n* Burgerstein, Cricket's lab assistant (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]). He has a burger for a head and is made up of machines and other things. As his name implies, he is based on [[Frankenstein's Monster]]. He is called a \"burgerbrain\" by Cricket often, and Burgerstein grunts or babbles to express his intentions. In some episodes, Burgerstein temporarily becomes smart due to Cricket's inventions.\n* Goat's reflection (voiced by Milo) is see in many episodes as Goat looks in the mirror often for self-admiration or grooming. She is eventually revealed to be a distinct entity, and she and Goat get into an argument when TJ gives the reflection the 'Customer of the Day' award even though it was Goat who got him a souffl\u00e9.\n* [[Thomas Jefferson]] (later nicknamed TJ) debuts in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\" where he emerges from a nickel to battle Goat, and later saves the day by battling Lady Primavera. He later runs a smoothie caf\u00e9 in \"Zombie Broheims\" where he prevents Goat from being Customer of the Day because he swore to hate her forever. While discussing cookies she made, he calls [[Betsy Ross]] a [[hag]].\n* Sleazy Beave (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 a male [[beaver]] who debuted in \"Fudge-pocalypse\". Sleazy Beave is open to pretty much anything as he is nearly [[homeless]]. He was willingly about to marry Delooney Hamshank (by the force of Ma Hamshank) but was then pranked by Pig who was wearing the wedding outfit. He appears to have a secondary [[superhero]] personality named The Masked Maniac as well.\n* Rasta Rat (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 Rasta Rat is a very laid-back [[rat]] who has [[dreadlocks]] and speaks in a [[Jamaican accent]]. He wears a green, red, and yellow [[beanie hat]]. A running gag is he constantly gets slammed onto the [[fourth wall]].\n* President of the Planet (voiced by [[James Adomian]]) \u2013 the [[dog]] who rules the entire planet. He can be a noble person when he wants to be, but can also be quite brute and honest in his [[opinions]], like when he told Goat that her superpower was complete garbage without a second thought in \"Super Space Meatball\".\n* Junior Rangers (voiced by [[Candi Milo]], [[Yuri Lowenthal]] and [[Maile Flanagan]]) \u2013 the Junior Rangers are the \"boy scout\" division of the Boopelite [[park rangers]]. They are a group of children varying in [[species]] who do various activities like real life Boy Scouts. They are watched over by Banana, who often lazes on the job. Some of the rangers do work for Banana that differs from normal activities, such as pranking the Hamshanks<ref>{{cite episode |title=Prank Thy Neighbor |series=PGBC}}</ref> or rescuing Banana from Big Ballah Koala.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Most Beautiful Roach in the World |series=PGBC}}</ref>\n**Barton<ref name=LGT>{{cite episode |title=Let's Get Tiny |series=PGBC |minutes=18}} \"I'm Barton\" .. \"I'm Tom\".</ref> is a rat.\n**Tom<ref name=LGT/> and Tabitha<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |quote=Walk it off, Tabitha}}</ref> are [[alligator]]s or [[crocodile]]s.\n**an [[elephant]].\n* Ranger Rhino (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 a [[rhinoceros]] who is in charge of the Junior Rangers. He often tells off Banana for not doing his duty but still has a soft spot for him, such as in \"Wheelbarrow Full of Nachos\" he asks Banana to hang out with him.\n* Breakfast Burrito (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 a very lazy [[burrito]]. For example, in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\", Banana simply asked him to put away a jar of [[peanut butter]], only for him to immediately sit on his couch and fall asleep.\n* Armpit Willy (voiced by DiMaggio) \u2013 an alligator who wears a [[beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] and has thick, long armpit hairs. His catchphrase is \"bushy bushy\".\n* Lady Primavera Van de Snuggles (voiced by [[Dyana Liu]]) debuts in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\" and returns in \"Gauntlet of Humiliation\", where she makes a cameo appearance by visiting Armpit Willy at his pool when Pig makes a fast food delivery to him.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Matt L.

He later runs a smoothie caf\u00e9 in \"Zombie Broheims\" where he prevents Goat from being Customer of the Day because he swore to hate her forever. While discussing cookies she made, he calls [[Betsy Ross]] a [[hag]].\n* Sleazy Beave (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2013 a male [[beaver]] who debuted in \"Fudge-pocalypse\". Sleazy Beave is open to pretty much anything as he is nearly [[homeless]]. He was willingly about to marry Delooney Hamshank (by the force of Ma Hamshank) but was then pranked by Pig who was wearing the wedding outfit. He appears to have a secondary [[superhero]] personality named The Masked Maniac as well.\n* Rasta Rat (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 Rasta Rat is a very laid-back [[rat]] who has [[dreadlocks]] and speaks in a [[Jamaican accent]]. He wears a green, red, and yellow [[beanie hat]]. A running gag is he constantly gets slammed onto the [[fourth wall]].\n* President of the Planet (voiced by [[James Adomian]]) \u2013 the [[dog]] who rules the entire planet. He can be a noble person when he wants to be, but can also be quite brute and honest in his [[opinions]], like when he told Goat that her superpower was complete garbage without a second thought in \"Super Space Meatball\".\n* Junior Rangers (voiced by [[Candi Milo]], [[Yuri Lowenthal]] and [[Maile Flanagan]]) \u2013 the Junior Rangers are the \"boy scout\" division of the Boopelite [[park rangers]]. They are a group of children varying in [[species]] who do various activities like real life Boy Scouts. They are watched over by Banana, who often lazes on the job. Some of the rangers do work for Banana that differs from normal activities, such as pranking the Hamshanks<ref>{{cite episode |title=Prank Thy Neighbor |series=PGBC}}</ref> or rescuing Banana from Big Ballah Koala.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Most Beautiful Roach in the World |series=PGBC}}</ref>\n**Barton<ref name=LGT>{{cite episode |title=Let's Get Tiny |series=PGBC |minutes=18}} \"I'm Barton\" .. \"I'm Tom\".</ref> is a rat.\n**Tom<ref name=LGT/> and Tabitha<ref>{{cite episode |title=Bananaland |series=PGBC |quote=Walk it off, Tabitha}}</ref> are [[alligator]]s or [[crocodile]]s.\n**an [[elephant]].\n* Ranger Rhino (voiced by Bennett) \u2013 a [[rhinoceros]] who is in charge of the Junior Rangers. He often tells off Banana for not doing his duty but still has a soft spot for him, such as in \"Wheelbarrow Full of Nachos\" he asks Banana to hang out with him.\n* Breakfast Burrito (voiced by [[John DiMaggio]]) \u2013 a very lazy [[burrito]]. For example, in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\", Banana simply asked him to put away a jar of [[peanut butter]], only for him to immediately sit on his couch and fall asleep.\n* Armpit Willy (voiced by DiMaggio) \u2013 an alligator who wears a [[beanie (seamed cap)|beanie]] and has thick, long armpit hairs. His catchphrase is \"bushy bushy\".\n* Lady Primavera Van de Snuggles (voiced by [[Dyana Liu]]) debuts in \"The Chronicles of Cutesachusetts\" and returns in \"Gauntlet of Humiliation\", where she makes a cameo appearance by visiting Armpit Willy at his pool when Pig makes a fast food delivery to him.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Matt L.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n== Powerball begins ==\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n== 2009: Florida became host to drawings ==\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion.

Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n== 2012 format change ==\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, but PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.)

Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n== Prizes and odds ==\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Claiming prizes ==\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n== Secondary prizes ==\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n== Notable wins ==\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n=== Powerball begins ===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n=== 2009: Florida became host to drawings ===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion.

Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n=== 2012 format change ===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n=== Power Play ===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n=== Prizes and odds ===\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n=== Secondary prizes ===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n=== Notable wins ===\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.
