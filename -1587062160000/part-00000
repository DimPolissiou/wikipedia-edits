The slaves came from different African tribes and through this music, they could communicate. It is Puerto Rican because it has elements of the ta\u00ednos (Arawaks) like the Maraca and Cu\u00e1s (2 wooden sticks previously played at the side of the Bomba Barrel), the Spanish like the footsteps in the dancing and the greatest influence of is the African native. This represents the Puerto Rican cultural mix. In Bomba, there are only 3 instruments: Cu\u00e1, Maraca (only the singer plays it) and the Bomba Barrel. In the Batey or Sobera'o (circle or dance area), the Primo or Uploader Barrel will score sounds the steps that the dancer makes, and the other Barrel is called Buleador or Follower, who follows the rhythm that is constantly playing without stopping until the \u201cCantador/a\u201d (singer) says so. The dancer enters the Batey to stroll around, showing off, mark their territory and space. Then, greets the Primo Barrel and begins its \u201cPiquetes\u201d (improvised Bomba steps). The dancer, with his/her \u201cPiquetes\u201d would be creating his/her own music and history, inspired by the song. Also, the dancer challenges the Primo Barrel Player (\u201cTocador/a\u201d) by doing a rhythmic dialogue and making it difficult to follow him/her. Finally, when the dancer finishes providing the \u201cPiquetes\u201d, bows again to the Primo Barrel and the next dancer do exactly the same protocol. The \u201cPiquetes\u201d must have \"elegance, firmness and shape.\" The \"figures\" are the \u201cPiquetes\u201d that must be executed with \"elegance\" and \"firmness\". During the dance, sometimes the audience shouts \"Speak!\". This is because the dancer is having a musical conversation or communication with the Bomba Drum (Primo) through his/her \u201cPiquetes\u201d. Traditionally, \u201cBailadores\u201d (male dancers) perform their \u201cPiquetes\u201d with their body and the \u201cBailadoras\u201d (female dancers) perform with the body and / or skirt with the petticoat. The Bomba traditional dress for men is white hat, white shirt and black or white pants. The women used to wear turbans, white shirt and skirt with petticoat. Petticoats were handmade to show them off in a flirtatious way for men and to create envy among other female dancers. How to hold and use skirt in the Bomba dancing is unique. This is because the dancer is having a musical conversation or communication with Dresser through their pickets.\n\nIn the beginning, it was called the barrel was called Bomba and that is where the name of this old traditional music comes from. They created the barrel of the barrels that the Spaniards brought the slaves to fill the rum made in the Puerto Rican plantations in times of slavery. The leather that is used is goat. The female goat leather is used for the Primo Barrels for its sound is sharper and the masculine is used for the Buleador Barrels so that the sound is more grave. The Primo Barrel is smaller and less wide so that it has a high-pitched sound and allows the Dancer's Pickets to stand out. On the other hand, the Buleador Barrel is made larger and wider so that the sound is grave.  Landowners allowed the slaves to play Bomba when they wanted and those few times, they led them because that was how they could \"forget\" that they were enslaved and heal their pains. With the Bomba, they healed their pains, did weddings and rebellion, fighting against the landowners and labor exploitation, they used it to their religions (Explanation Note: The Bomba is cultural and not religious, if they used it for their religions, that was their decision but this was not originally made for religion causes), in short, everything. There are also French, Dutch and English elements. The \"Seises de Bomba\" (\"Bomba Sixes\") (songs) is divided into verses and choruses alternated, and the verses are improvised according to the story or theme song. In these songs, there were the events of everyday life are recounted. The public must always repeat the chorus after each verse.\n\nImportant families of Bomba in Puerto Rico are the Cepeda of Santurce, Ayala Lo\u00edza, the Aldu\u00e9n of Mayag\u00fcez, among others. Brothers Emmanuelli N\u00e1ter (Jos\u00e9, Jorge and Victor, students and friends of the Cepeda) with their Center for Cultural Research of Eternal Roots (Centro de Investigaci\u00f3n Cultural Ra\u00edces Eternas) (CICRE in Spanish) created in Puerto Rico during the 90 so-called \"Bombazos\". They were devoted to \u201cget down\u201d the Bomba from the high stage, so that the Puerto Ricans and everybody else had more participation and learning in this folklore music. Thanks to this, today there are \u201cBombazos\u201d in many parts of Puerto Rico and the United States. These are the modern and evolved version of the ancient dances of Bomba. Today it is emerging \u201cBombazo Generation\u201d thanks to this.\n\nThere are many rhythms of Bomba, but 6 primary, and these derive others are Sic\u00e1 (\"walking\"), Yub\u00e1 (slow pace of feeling, sadness and courage and played mostly for the elderly, regional of Cata\u00f1o and Santurce), Cuemb\u00e9 (flirtatious and sensual rhythm, mostly danced in pairs, regionally of Santurce and Cata\u00f1o), Seis Corrido (formerly called Rul\u00e9, the rapid pace and only regional of Lo\u00edza), Corv\u00e9 (only regional of Lo\u00edza) and \u201cHoland\u00e9s\u201d (fast rhythm and regional of Mayaguez and Cata\u00f1o). Sic\u00e1 derivatives are Bambula\u00e9, Danu\u00e9, Calind\u00e1, Paule, Gracim\u00e1, Balanc\u00e9, Cocobal\u00e9, Cuny\u00e1 and Bel\u00e9n (this last rhythm was mostly played when the Bomba dance was performing his last song of the night). Yub\u00e1 derivatives are Ler\u00f3 (rhythm mostly played in southern Puerto Rico) and Mariand\u00e1. The derivative of Cuemb\u00e9 is the G\u00fcemb\u00e9 (rhythm mostly played in southern Puerto Rico). So, there are others like the \u201cHoyo \u2018e Mula\u201d, \u201cAlim\u00e1\u201d, among others. We must defend, respect and share our culture, so that it can remain alive forever and we never lose our identity.\n\n==Characteristics of the Bomba==\n\n''Bomba'' is described to be a challenge/connection between the drummer and the dancer. The dancer produces a series of gestures to which the primo o subidor drummer provides a synchronized beat.  Thus, it is the drummer who attempts to follow the dancer, and not the more traditional form of the dancer following the drummer. The dancer must be in great physical shape, and the challenge usually continues until either the dancer or the drummer discontinues.\n\n''Bomba'' also is composed by three or more singers and a solo singer, the singing has a dynamic similar to those of \"Son\" where the lead singer sings a chorus and the other respond, and in between choruses the lead singer will improvise a verse. The theme of most ''bomba'' songs is everyday life and activity. In the case of a certain song called \"Palo e Bandera\", the lyrics discuss a love triangle between a female dancer, a female singer and the singer's husband, the ''primo'' player. The wife realizes her husband is cheating on her with the dancer and decides to teach her a lesson on the dance floor.\n\n== History==\n''Bomba'' was developed in Puerto Rico some time after the trans-Atlantic African Slave trade in 1501. Although it is unclear when exactly  ''Bomba'' was developed in Puerto, the first documentation of ''Bomba'' dates back to 1797. During the 1800s there were several documented accounts of the use of ''Bomba'' as a rebellion tool against the slave owners, and organizational methods for initiating slave rebellions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alamo-Pastrana|first1=Carlos|title=Con el eco de los barriles:Race, Gender and the Bomba Imaginary in Puerto Rico|journal=Identities: Global Studies in Cultural and Power|date=September 22, 2009|volume=5|issue=16|pages=573\u2013600}}</ref>  This particular style of music originated in [[Mayag\u00fcez]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Puerto Rico amongst the slaves who worked the sugar cane fields. These slaves came from different regions of Africa so they could not easily communicate with each other but they found common ground in music. With the migration of these slaves to different regions of the island ''bomba'' was practiced in different regions of the island each giving their personal twist to ''bomba'' music, for example in the region of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] they play with larger drums than other regions that are played by placing the drum completely horizontal. After a few years songwriter Rafael Cortijo introduced ''bomba'' to the Concert Halls by arranging it with brass instruments and more simple rhythm patterns, today ''bomba'' can be found anywhere on the island and in fusion with different styles like Jazz or Salsa music.\n\nUp until the 1940s and 1950s, ''Bomba'' was heavily racialized and associated as premodern and Black. ''Bomba'' had been a marginalized music genre until musical artists like Rafael Cortijo and Ismael Rivera from the group ''Cortijo y su Combo'', popularized ''bomba'' by taking it to various parts of the Americas and the world.<ref name=\"Alamos-Pastrana\">Alamos-Pastrana</ref> On an international level bomba was fused with various national and regional musical genres creating a hybridization of ''bomba''. On the Island of Puerto Rico however, ''bomba'' did not unfold in the same manner, it remained true to its folk tradition and geographically confined to parts of the island where there was a majority of Black Puerto Ricans in towns such as, Loiza, Ponce, Mayag\u00fcez, and Guayama.<ref name=\"Alamos-Pastrana\"/>\n\n== Instruments ==\n\nIt consists of drums called ''barriles'' or ''bombas'' (made from barrels of rum, one named ''buleador'' and another ''primo'' or ''subidor''), cu\u00e1 (two sticks that were originally banged on the side of the barril) and a maraca.<ref name=\"afro\"/> [[Dance]] is an integral part of the music: The drum called \"Primo\" replicates every single move of the dancer, this is called \"Repique\". Although the origins are a little scarce it's easy to spot the elegance and poise of the Spanish Flamenco and the energy and soul of African dances.<ref name=\"afro\"/>\n\nThe traditional drums used in bomba are called [[barriles de bomba|barriles]], since they have long been built from the wood of barrels. The high pitch drum is called \"subidor\" (riser) or \"primo\" (first), and the low pitch drums are called \"buleador\" and \"segundo\" (second). Not less important are the \"Cu\u00e1s\" that are two wooden sticks banged on a wooden surface and a large Maraca that keeps time.\n\n== Rhythmic Styles ==\n\nThere are several styles of bomba, and the popularity of these styles varies by region.\nThere are three basic rhythms and many others that are mainly variations of these three, they are: \"sica\", \"yuba\", and \"holand\u00e9s\".\n\n'''duple metre'''\n\n*sic\u00e1\n**bel\u00e9n Santurce\n**calinda\n**cunya\n**danu\u00e9\n**gracim\u00e1\n**paul\u00e9\n*cuemb\u00e9\n**alim\u00e1\n**balanc\u00e9\n**bel\u00e9n Sur\n**cuemb\u00e9 Cata\u00f1o\n**cuemb\u00e9 Santurce\n**g\u00fcemb\u00e9\n**g\u00fcemb\u00e9 corrido\n*holand\u00e9 \n**franc\u00e9s\n**holand\u00e9 Cata\u00f1o\n**mariand\u00e1\n**mariangola\n*b\u00e1mbula\n**b\u00e1mbula\n**rul\u00e9\n**seis corrido\n*cocobal\u00e9\n*hoyomula\n\n'''triple metre'''\n\n*yub\u00e1\n**corv\u00e9 Loiza\n**yub\u00e1 mas\u00f3n\n**yub\u00e1 cuartiao\n**yub\u00e1 Cata\u00f1o\n**ler\u00f3 Sur\n**ler\u00f3 Santurce\n\n==Performers==\n\nToday there are many groups playing Bomba both as a traditional style and as a fusion with some other style. The most well-known traditional players are the Cepeda Family who have been playing Bomba for generations and the Ayala family, who are a family with a tradition of arts and crafts as well as Bomba music.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Rafael Cortijo]] took Bomba to the mainstream with his Combo in the 1950s and 1960s. Puerto Rican composer Roberto Angler\u00f3 wrote and sang ''\"Si Dios fuera negro\"'' (''\"If God Was Black\"''), a huge hit in Puerto Rico, [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] during the early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] made a cover version of it once; the song was even translated to French and became a minor hit in [[Martinique]]. Some of the local musicians who also play this style are Yuba Ir\u00e9, Paracumb\u00e9, Bomba Siglo XXI, among others.\n\n[[Willie Col\u00f3n]] adds occasional bomba breaks to his songs, most particularly in sections of his biggest solo hit, ''\"[[El gran var\u00f3n]]\"''. [[Ricky Martin]] also mixes a bit of authentic bomba rhythm with other Latino influences in his aptly named song ''La Bomba''\n\nIn California it has been popularized at by Maestros de Bomba en la Bah\u00eda at [[La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Center]].<ref name=\"afro\"/>\n\nIn 1998, ''Son del Batey'' was founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico, by a group of college students at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayag\u00fcez. 1998 marked the 100-year anniversary of the United States invasion of Puerto Rico, and a time when popular discourse focused around national identity and colonialism throughout the island.<ref>\"''Con el eco de los barrilles'': Race, Gender and the Bomba Imaginary in Purto Rico,\" 2009.Alamos-Pastrana, Carlos</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Aparicio, Frances R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ogZgZ6h84eQC&printsec=frontcover \"Listening to salsa: gender, Latin popular music, and Puerto Rican cultures\"], [[Wesleyan University Press]], 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-8195-6308-8}}.

During the 1800s there were several documented accounts of the use of ''Bomba'' as a rebellion tool against the slave owners, and organizational methods for initiating slave rebellions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alamo-Pastrana|first1=Carlos|title=Con el eco de los barriles:Race, Gender and the Bomba Imaginary in Puerto Rico|journal=Identities: Global Studies in Cultural and Power|date=September 22, 2009|volume=5|issue=16|pages=573\u2013600}}</ref>  This particular style of music originated in [[Mayag\u00fcez]],{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Puerto Rico amongst the slaves who worked the sugar cane fields. These slaves came from different regions of Africa so they could not easily communicate with each other but they found common ground in music. With the migration of these slaves to different regions of the island ''bomba'' was practiced in different regions of the island each giving their personal twist to ''bomba'' music, for example in the region of [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] they play with larger drums than other regions that are played by placing the drum completely horizontal. After a few years songwriter Rafael Cortijo introduced ''bomba'' to the Concert Halls by arranging it with brass instruments and more simple rhythm patterns, today ''bomba'' can be found anywhere on the island and in fusion with different styles like Jazz or Salsa music.\n\nUp until the 1940s and 1950s, ''Bomba'' was heavily racialized and associated as premodern and Black. ''Bomba'' had been a marginalized music genre until musical artists like Rafael Cortijo and Ismael Rivera from the group ''Cortijo y su Combo'', popularized ''bomba'' by taking it to various parts of the Americas and the world.<ref name=\"Alamos-Pastrana\">Alamos-Pastrana</ref> On an international level bomba was fused with various national and regional musical genres creating a hybridization of ''bomba''. On the Island of Puerto Rico however, ''bomba'' did not unfold in the same manner, it remained true to its folk tradition and geographically confined to parts of the island where there was a majority of Black Puerto Ricans in towns such as, Loiza, Ponce, Mayag\u00fcez, and Guayama.<ref name=\"Alamos-Pastrana\"/>\n\n== Instruments ==\n\nIt consists of drums called ''barriles'' or ''bombas'' (made from barrels of rum, one named ''buleador'' and another ''primo'' or ''subidor''), cu\u00e1 (two sticks that were originally banged on the side of the barril) and a maraca.<ref name=\"afro\"/> [[Dance]] is an integral part of the music: The drum called \"Primo\" replicates every single move of the dancer, this is called \"Repique\". Although the origins are a little scarce it's easy to spot the elegance and poise of the Spanish Flamenco and the energy and soul of African dances.<ref name=\"afro\"/>\n\nThe traditional drums used in bomba are called [[barriles de bomba|barriles]], since they have long been built from the wood of barrels. The high pitch drum is called \"subidor\" (riser) or \"primo\" (first), and the low pitch drums are called \"buleador\" and \"segundo\" (second). Not less important are the \"Cu\u00e1s\" that are two wooden sticks banged on a wooden surface and a large Maraca that keeps time.\n\n== Rhythmic Styles ==\n\nThere are several styles of bomba, and the popularity of these styles varies by region.\nThere are three basic rhythms and many others that are mainly variations of these three, they are: \"sica\", \"yuba\", and \"holand\u00e9s\".\n\n'''duple metre'''\n\n*sic\u00e1\n**bel\u00e9n Santurce\n**calinda\n**cunya\n**danu\u00e9\n**gracim\u00e1\n**paul\u00e9\n*cuemb\u00e9\n**alim\u00e1\n**balanc\u00e9\n**bel\u00e9n Sur\n**cuemb\u00e9 Cata\u00f1o\n**cuemb\u00e9 Santurce\n**g\u00fcemb\u00e9\n**g\u00fcemb\u00e9 corrido\n*holand\u00e9 \n**franc\u00e9s\n**holand\u00e9 Cata\u00f1o\n**mariand\u00e1\n**mariangola\n*b\u00e1mbula\n**b\u00e1mbula\n**rul\u00e9\n**seis corrido\n*cocobal\u00e9\n*hoyomula\n\n'''triple metre'''\n\n*yub\u00e1\n**corv\u00e9 Loiza\n**yub\u00e1 mas\u00f3n\n**yub\u00e1 cuartiao\n**yub\u00e1 Cata\u00f1o\n**ler\u00f3 Sur\n**ler\u00f3 Santurce\n\n==Performers==\n\nToday there are many groups playing Bomba both as a traditional style and as a fusion with some other style. The most well-known traditional players are the Cepeda Family who have been playing Bomba for generations and the Ayala family, who are a family with a tradition of arts and crafts as well as Bomba music.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Rafael Cortijo]] took Bomba to the mainstream with his Combo in the 1950s and 1960s. Puerto Rican composer Roberto Angler\u00f3 wrote and sang ''\"Si Dios fuera negro\"'' (''\"If God Was Black\"''), a huge hit in Puerto Rico, [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]] during the early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} [[Rub\u00e9n Blades]] made a cover version of it once; the song was even translated to French and became a minor hit in [[Martinique]]. Some of the local musicians who also play this style are Yuba Ir\u00e9, Paracumb\u00e9, Bomba Siglo XXI, among others.\n\n[[Willie Col\u00f3n]] adds occasional bomba breaks to his songs, most particularly in sections of his biggest solo hit, ''\"[[El gran var\u00f3n]]\"''. [[Ricky Martin]] also mixes a bit of authentic bomba rhythm with other Latino influences in his aptly named song ''La Bomba''\n\nIn California it has been popularized at by Maestros de Bomba en la Bah\u00eda at [[La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Center]].<ref name=\"afro\"/>\n\nIn 1998, ''Son del Batey'' was founded in San Juan, Puerto Rico, by a group of college students at the University of Puerto Rico in Mayag\u00fcez. 1998 marked the 100-year anniversary of the United States invasion of Puerto Rico, and a time when popular discourse focused around national identity and colonialism throughout the island.<ref>\"''Con el eco de los barrilles'': Race, Gender and the Bomba Imaginary in Purto Rico,\" 2009.Alamos-Pastrana, Carlos</ref>\n\n== Further reading ==\n* Aparicio, Frances R., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ogZgZ6h84eQC&printsec=frontcover \"Listening to salsa: gender, Latin popular music, and Puerto Rican cultures\"], [[Wesleyan University Press]], 1998. {{ISBN|978-0-8195-6308-8}}.
