A collection of Union forces under the overall command of Major General [[Henry Halleck]] engaged in a month-long siege of the city, whose Confederate occupants were commanded by General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]]. The siege resulted in the capture of the town by Federal forces.\n\nThe town was a strategic point at the junction of two vital railroad lines, the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] and the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]]. Former Confederate Secretary of War [[LeRoy Pope Walker]] called this intersection \"the vertebrae of the Confederacy\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Darkest Days of the War The Battles of Iuka & Corinth|last=Cozzens|first=Peter|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8078-5783-0|location=North Carolina|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> General Halleck argued: \"Richmond and Corinth are now the great strategic points of the war, and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Another reason for the town's importance was that, if captured by Union forces, it would threaten the security of Chattanooga and render Southern control of the track west of that East Tennessee bastion meaningless.\n\nThe siege ended when the outnumbered Confederates withdrew on May 29. This effectively cut off the prospect of further Confederate attempts to regain western Tennessee. The Union forces under [[Ulysses S. Grant]] took control and made it the base for Grant's operations to seize control of the [[Mississippi River Valley]], and especially the Confederate stronghold of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. Grant later within his memoirs would recall the importance Corinth held in the cause to a Union victory in the region: \"Corinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold, and consequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves of\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant|last=Ulysses|first=Grant|publisher=|year=1885\u201386|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> General C. S. Hamilton would later recount that the importance of Corinth was summed up as such: \"The Confederate armies had been driven from the Ohio River, almost out of the States of Tennessee and Kentucky a steadying back for a distance of 200 miles Federal occupation reaching the Gulf States where chivalrous foes had been sure Yankee would never set foot\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/correspondencein00hami|title=Correspondence in regard to the battle of Corinth, Miss., October 3d and 4th, 1862|last=Hamilton|first=Charles Smith|date=1882}}</ref> Sherman too would later write of the importance that Corinth held after the Second Battle of Corinth was concluded: \"In Memphis I could see its effects upon the citizens, and they openly admitted that their cause had sustained a death-blow\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the siege of Corinth completed, Federal troops had the opportunity to strike towards Vicksburg or Chattanooga, but it would be after the [[Second Battle of Corinth]] that October that Grant could strike for Vicksburg. The Siege of Corinth was described by General Sherman as a change in the tactics in West Tennessee: \"The effect of the battle of Corinth was very great. It was, indeed, a decisive blow to the Confederate cause in our quarter, and changed the whole aspect of affairs in West Tennessee. From the timid defensive we were at once enabled to assume the bold offensive\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Background==\n\n===Military situation===\n{{Main|Battle of Fort Henry|Battle of Fort Donelson|Battle of Shiloh}}\n{{further|Western Theater of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}\n\n[[File:Halleck's army on the march.jpg|thumb|left|Halleck's army marches towards Corinth]]\nFollowing the [[Union Army]] victory at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on April 6\u20137, [[Major general (United States)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Henry Halleck]] amassed three Union armies &mdash;the [[Army of the Tennessee]], the [[Army of the Ohio]], and the [[Army of the Mississippi]]&mdash; for an advance on the vital rail center of [[Corinth, Mississippi]]. Made cautious by the staggering losses at Shiloh, Halleck embarked on a tedious campaign of offensive entrenchment, fortifying after each advance. By May 25, 1862, after moving five miles in three weeks, Halleck was in position to lay siege to the town.  Confederate morale was low and Beauregard was outnumbered two to one. The water was bad. Typhoid and dysentery had felled thousands of his men. At a council of war, the Confederate officers concluded that they could not hold the railroad crossover. Sickness had claimed the lives of almost as many men as the Confederacy had lost at Shiloh.<ref>[http://ahec.armywarcollege.edu/exhibits/CivilWarImagery/cheney_corinth.cfm  \"The First Battle of Corinth: May 30, 1862]</ref><ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/113corinth/113facts1.htm  \"Determining the facts: The Siege of Corinth\", National Park Service]</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Opposing forces==\n\n===Union===\n{{further|Siege of Corinth Union order of battle|l1=Union order of battle}}\n\n{| style=\"align:left; margin-left:1em\"\n!bgcolor=\"#99ccff\"|Key Union Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Henry Halleck by Scholten, c1865.jpg|<center>Maj.

[[Old Abe]] the Screaming Eagle accompanied the Wisconsin 8th Infantry.\n\n===Russell's House===\nAs the wings of Halleck's army group began to align themselves in front of Corinth, Maj. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] proposed a plan of attack against the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. [[James R. Chalmers]], which had created a strong defensive position at the Russell house along the Confederate front lines.  Sherman met with generals Halleck and [[George Henry Thomas]] on May 16 to discuss his plan.  Sherman planned for the brigades of Colonel [[Morgan L. Smith]] and Brig. Gen. [[James W. Denver]] to lead the attack with Maj. Gen. [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]]'s division lending support.<ref name=\"Smith p. 164\">Smith p. 164</ref>  On May 17 the attack commenced with Denver on the right, Smith in the center and Hurlbut's reserve to the right.  Chalmers offered a stubborn resistance while some of his men fired from within the Russell house.  The Confederates almost succeeded with a flank attack against Smith's right but were repulsed by Colonel [[Thomas Kilby Smith]] and the 54th Ohio Infantry.  As soon as a battery from the 1st Illinois Artillery deployed the advantage was in favor of the Union forces.  Chalmers retreated beyond Philips Creek near the Russell house property and Morgan Smith's brigade occupied high ground on which the house stood.<ref>Smith p. 165</ref>  Sherman's losses were 10 killed and 31 wounded all of which were from Smith's brigade.  Confederate losses were unknown but Sherman reported 12 dead left on the field.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=zpojUprtDKasigL6uYHwAg&id=1bB2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Battle+of+Russell+House+Mississippi&q=russell%27s+house#v=snippet&q=russell%27s%20house&f=false Sherman's report]</ref>  That same day a division under Brig. Gen. [[Thomas W. Sherman]] drove off a Confederate force covering a crossing along Bridge Creek.<ref name=\"Smith p. 164\"/>\n\n===Widow Surratt Farm===\nOn May 21 Maj. Gen. [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]] ordered Colonel Thomas D. Sedgwick to conduct a [[reconnaissance-in-force]] against the Confederate trenches along Bridge Creek near Widow Surratt's farm<ref>Clark p.113</ref> Sedgwick moved forward from the Union trenches occupied by Brig. Gen. [[Thomas J. Wood]]'s division and deployed the 20th Kentucky infantry at the edge of a clearing and the 1st Kentucky infantry to the left facing a densely wooded area.  Shortly after deployment the Kentuckians came under fire.  The Confederate resistance was so severe Sedgwick was forced to fall back. Sedgwick brought forward artillery and the 2nd Kentucky infantry while General Wood lent cavalry support from his division.  The Confederates attempted a flank attack against the 1st Kentucky but the Union artillery (personally supervised by Captain [[Alvan C. Gillem]] of Buell's staff) and the 31st Indiana infantry in reserve stabilized the line.<ref name=\"Sedgwick's official report\">[http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/sources/recordView.cfm?Content=010/0844 Sedgwick's official report]</ref> The Confederates made three more attempts to turn the Union flank  until retiring to a creek beyond the Surratt farm.  General Nelson ordered Sedgwick to hold his position until nightfall, then return to the Union camp.<ref name=\"Sedgwick's official report\"/> A week later General Buell would mount an attack to gain the high ground surrounding the Surratt farm.\n\n===Double Log House===\nOn May 27 Halleck ordered Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman to drive the Confederates from a log house along the Corinth Road and make a strong demonstration against Corinth itself if possible.  At the edge of a cotton field along Sherman's front was a double [[log house]] which the Confederates had converted into a [[block house]] by removing the [[chinking]] between the logs.  Sherman formed an attacking column with Morgan L. Smith's brigade on the left and James W. Denver's brigade on the right.  [[John A. Logan]]'s brigade (from [[John A. McClernand]]'s reserve corps) and [[James C. Veatch]]'s brigade (from Stephen A. Hurlbut's division) were also brought up for support.  Colonel Ezra Taylor fired several artillery rounds to signal the infantry attack.  Denver and Smith quickly overtook the log house by storm and secured the hilltop position.  The Confederates rallied and drove in Sherman's skirmishers but the counterattack was repulsed by the main line of infantry with artillery support.  The following day the rest of Sherman's division and artillery moved forward to the new position which offered a good vantage point into Corinth itself.  Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and George H. Thomas were both present on the field during this engagement, giving approval for the behavior of operation.<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4361/4361-h/4361-h.htm Memoirs of William T.

With all his wings in line Halleck ordered Buell to clear the Confederates off the Surratt farm hill.  Buell chose Maj. Gen. [[Alexander M. McCook]]'s reserve division to seize the hill to be used as a staging point for a further attack against Corinth.<ref name=\"Fanebust page 106\">Fanebust page 106</ref> On May 27 McCook organized his brigades into line of attack intending to overwhelm the Confederates by surprise and overwhelming force.<ref>Fanebust page 107</ref>  The brigades of Brig. Gen. [[Lovell H. Rousseau]] and Brig. Gen. [[Richard W. Johnson]] would lead the advance, side by side.  Colonel Frederick S. Stumbaugh's brigade followed in support of Johnson and Colonel [[Robert L. McCook]]'s brigade (from [[Thomas W. Sherman]]'s division) in support of Rousseau.  Johnson's brigade encountered some heavy skirmishing but the hill was taken in short time.  McCook's division entrenched and brought heavy artillery to the new position and immediately began to shell the Confederates.  Beauregard's artillery responded with minimal effort.  The engagement at the Surratt farm hill allowed Halleck to bring forward siege guns for the bombardment of Corinth.<ref name=\"Fanebust page 106\"/>\n\n===Bridge Creek===\nOn May 28 Maj. Gen. Nelson ordered Colonel Sedgwick to seize a Confederate-held crossing of Bridge Creek, a small tributary of the [[Tuscumbia River]].  Sedgwick moved his brigade out from the main Union trenches with the 2nd and 20th Kentucky infantry regiments in the lead.  Sedgwick drove in the Confederate pickets then encountered a larger force guarding the bridge.<ref name=\"Bridge Creek 28 May 1862\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=0HkVAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA165 Bridge Creek 28 May 1862]</ref> The Kentucky infantry managed to gain hold of the eastern end of the bridge while Sedgwick ordered forward the 31st Indiana infantry and Captain [[John Mendenhall (colonel)|John Mendenhall]]'s artillery battery.

[[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] commander General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] saved his army by a hoax. Some of the men were given three days' rations and ordered to prepare for an attack. As expected, one or two went over to the Union with that news. The preliminary bombardment began, and Union forces maneuvered for position. During the night of May 29, the Confederate army moved out. They used the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] to carry the sick and wounded, the heavy artillery, and tons of supplies. When a train arrived, the troops cheered as though reinforcements were arriving. They set up dummy [[Quaker Gun]]s along the defensive earthworks. Camp fires were kept burning, and buglers and drummers played. The rest of the men slipped away undetected, withdrawing to [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]. When Union patrols entered Corinth on the morning of May 30, they found the Confederate troops gone. The Union forces took control and made it the base for their operations to seize control of the [[Mississippi River Valley]], and especially the Confederate stronghold of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].<ref>Smith, 2012</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Corinth_I_Battlefield_Mississippi.jpg|308px|thumb|right|Map of the siege of Corinth battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\n[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], whose aggressiveness exceeded his strategic capabilities, remarked in his memoirs that Halleck's cautious campaign failed to take full advantage of a glittering array of talented Union officers, including \"[[Ulysses S.

A collection of Union forces under the overall command of Major General [[Henry Halleck]] engaged in a month-long siege of the city, whose Confederate occupants were commanded by General [[P.G.T. Beauregard]]. The siege resulted in the capture of the town by Federal forces.\n\nThe town was a strategic point at the junction of two vital railroad lines, the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] and the [[Memphis and Charleston Railroad]]. Former Confederate Secretary of War [[LeRoy Pope Walker]] called this intersection \"the vertebrae of the Confederacy\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Darkest Days of the War The Battles of Iuka & Corinth|last=Cozzens|first=Peter|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8078-5783-0|location=North Carolina|pages=18\u201319}}</ref> General Halleck argued: \"Richmond and Corinth are now the great strategic points of the war, and our success at these points should be insured at all hazards\".<ref name=\":0\" /> Another reason for the town's importance was that, if captured by Union forces, it would threaten the security of Chattanooga and render Southern control of the track west of that East Tennessee bastion meaningless.\n\nThe siege ended when the outnumbered Confederates withdrew on May 29. This effectively cut off the prospect of further Confederate attempts to regain western Tennessee. The Union forces under [[Ulysses S. Grant]] took control and made it the base for Grant's operations to seize control of the [[Mississippi River Valley]], and especially the Confederate stronghold of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. Grant later within his memoirs would recall the importance Corinth held in the cause to a Union victory in the region: \"Corinth was a valuable strategic point for the enemy to hold, and consequently a valuable one for us to possess ourselves of\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Personal Memoirs of U.S. Grant|last=Ulysses|first=Grant|publisher=|year=1885\u201386|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}</ref> General C. S. Hamilton would later recount that the importance of Corinth was summed up as such: \"The Confederate armies had been driven from the Ohio River, almost out of the States of Tennessee and Kentucky a steadying back for a distance of 200 miles Federal occupation reaching the Gulf States where chivalrous foes had been sure Yankee would never set foot\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/correspondencein00hami|title=Correspondence in regard to the battle of Corinth, Miss., October 3d and 4th, 1862|last=Hamilton|first=Charles Smith|date=1882}}</ref> Sherman too would later write of the importance that Corinth held after the Second Battle of Corinth was concluded: \"In Memphis I could see its effects upon the citizens, and they openly admitted that their cause had sustained a death-blow\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the siege of Corinth completed, Federal troops had the opportunity to strike towards Vicksburg or Chattanooga, but it would be after the [[Second Battle of Corinth]] that October that Grant could strike for Vicksburg. The Siege of Corinth was described by General Sherman as a change in the tactics in West Tennessee: \"The effect of the battle of Corinth was very great. It was, indeed, a decisive blow to the Confederate cause in our quarter, and changed the whole aspect of affairs in West Tennessee. From the timid defensive we were at once enabled to assume the bold offensive\".<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Background==\n\n===Military situation===\n{{Main|Battle of Fort Henry|Battle of Fort Donelson|Battle of Shiloh}}\n{{further|Western Theater of the American Civil War|American Civil War}}\n\n[[File:Halleck's army on the march.jpg|thumb|left|Halleck's army marches towards Corinth]]\nFollowing the [[Union Army]] victory at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on April 6\u20137, [[Major general (United States)|Maj.

Made cautious by the staggering losses at Shiloh, Halleck embarked on a tedious campaign of offensive entrenchment, fortifying after each advance. By May 25, 1862, after moving five miles in three weeks, Halleck was in position to lay siege to the town.  Confederate morale was low and Beauregard was outnumbered two to one. The water was bad. Typhoid and dysentery had felled thousands of his men. At a council of war, the Confederate officers concluded that they could not hold the railroad crossover.

[[William Tecumseh Sherman]] proposed a plan of attack against the Confederate brigade of Brig. Gen. [[James R. Chalmers]], which had created a strong defensive position at the Russell house along the Confederate front lines.  Sherman met with generals Halleck and [[George Henry Thomas]] on May 16 to discuss his plan.  Sherman planned for the brigades of Colonel [[Morgan L. Smith]] and Brig. Gen. [[James W. Denver]] to lead the attack with Maj. Gen. [[Stephen A. Hurlbut]]'s division lending support.<ref name=\"Smith p. 164\">Smith p. 164</ref>  On May 17 the attack commenced with Denver on the right, Smith in the center and Hurlbut's reserve to the right.  Chalmers offered a stubborn resistance while some of his men fired from within the Russell house.  The Confederates almost succeeded with a flank attack against Smith's right but were repulsed by Colonel [[Thomas Kilby Smith]] and the 54th Ohio Infantry.  As soon as a battery from the 1st Illinois Artillery deployed the advantage was in favor of the Union forces.  Chalmers retreated beyond Philips Creek near the Russell house property and Morgan Smith's brigade occupied high ground on which the house stood.<ref>Smith p. 165</ref>  Sherman's losses were 10 killed and 31 wounded all of which were from Smith's brigade.  Confederate losses were unknown but Sherman reported 12 dead left on the field.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?ei=zpojUprtDKasigL6uYHwAg&id=1bB2AAAAMAAJ&dq=Battle+of+Russell+House+Mississippi&q=russell%27s+house#v=snippet&q=russell%27s%20house&f=false Sherman's report]</ref>  That same day a division under Brig.

[[William \"Bull\" Nelson]] ordered Colonel Thomas D. Sedgwick to conduct a [[reconnaissance-in-force]] against the Confederate trenches along Bridge Creek near Widow Surratt's farm<ref>Clark p.113</ref> Sedgwick moved forward from the Union trenches occupied by Brig. Gen. [[Thomas J. Wood]]'s division and deployed the 20th Kentucky infantry at the edge of a clearing and the 1st Kentucky infantry to the left facing a densely wooded area.  Shortly after deployment the Kentuckians came under fire.  The Confederate resistance was so severe Sedgwick was forced to fall back. Sedgwick brought forward artillery and the 2nd Kentucky infantry while General Wood lent cavalry support from his division.  The Confederates attempted a flank attack against the 1st Kentucky but the Union artillery (personally supervised by Captain [[Alvan C. Gillem]] of Buell's staff) and the 31st Indiana infantry in reserve stabilized the line.<ref name=\"Sedgwick's official report\">[http://ehistory.osu.edu/osu/sources/recordView.cfm?Content=010/0844 Sedgwick's official report]</ref> The Confederates made three more attempts to turn the Union flank  until retiring to a creek beyond the Surratt farm.  General Nelson ordered Sedgwick to hold his position until nightfall, then return to the Union camp.<ref name=\"Sedgwick's official report\"/> A week later General Buell would mount an attack to gain the high ground surrounding the Surratt farm.\n\n===Double Log House===\nOn May 27 Halleck ordered Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman to drive the Confederates from a log house along the Corinth Road and make a strong demonstration against Corinth itself if possible.  At the edge of a cotton field along Sherman's front was a double [[log house]] which the Confederates had converted into a [[block house]] by removing the [[chinking]] between the logs.  Sherman formed an attacking column with Morgan L. Smith's brigade on the left and James W. Denver's brigade on the right.  [[John A. Logan]]'s brigade (from [[John A. McClernand]]'s reserve corps) and [[James C. Veatch]]'s brigade (from Stephen A. Hurlbut's division) were also brought up for support.  Colonel Ezra Taylor fired several artillery rounds to signal the infantry attack.  Denver and Smith quickly overtook the log house by storm and secured the hilltop position.  The Confederates rallied and drove in Sherman's skirmishers but the counterattack was repulsed by the main line of infantry with artillery support.  The following day the rest of Sherman's division and artillery moved forward to the new position which offered a good vantage point into Corinth itself.  Generals [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and George H. Thomas were both present on the field during this engagement, giving approval for the behavior of operation.<ref name=\":1\">[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/4361/4361-h/4361-h.htm Memoirs of William T.

With all his wings in line Halleck ordered Buell to clear the Confederates off the Surratt farm hill.  Buell chose Maj. Gen. [[Alexander M. McCook]]'s reserve division to seize the hill to be used as a staging point for a further attack against Corinth.<ref name=\"Fanebust page 106\">Fanebust page 106</ref> On May 27 McCook organized his brigades into line of attack intending to overwhelm the Confederates by surprise and overwhelming force.<ref>Fanebust page 107</ref>  The brigades of Brig.

Stumbaugh's brigade followed in support of Johnson and Colonel [[Robert L. McCook]]'s brigade (from [[Thomas W. Sherman]]'s division) in support of Rousseau.  Johnson's brigade encountered some heavy skirmishing but the hill was taken in short time.  McCook's division entrenched and brought heavy artillery to the new position and immediately began to shell the Confederates.  Beauregard's artillery responded with minimal effort.  The engagement at the Surratt farm hill allowed Halleck to bring forward siege guns for the bombardment of Corinth.<ref name=\"Fanebust page 106\"/>\n\n===Bridge Creek===\nOn May 28 Maj. Gen. Nelson ordered Colonel Sedgwick to seize a Confederate-held crossing of Bridge Creek, a small tributary of the [[Tuscumbia River]].  Sedgwick moved his brigade out from the main Union trenches with the 2nd and 20th Kentucky infantry regiments in the lead.  Sedgwick drove in the Confederate pickets then encountered a larger force guarding the bridge.<ref name=\"Bridge Creek 28 May 1862\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=0HkVAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA165 Bridge Creek 28 May 1862]</ref> The Kentucky infantry managed to gain hold of the eastern end of the bridge while Sedgwick ordered forward the 31st Indiana infantry and Captain [[John Mendenhall (colonel)|John Mendenhall]]'s artillery battery.  These reinforcements and artillery forced the Confederates to abandon the bridge completely.<ref name=\"Bridge Creek 28 May 1862\"/>\n\n==Retreat==\nWith the Federal army preparing to lay siege to the town, a Confederate council of war decided to retreat. [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] commander General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] saved his army by a hoax. Some of the men were given three days' rations and ordered to prepare for an attack. As expected, one or two went over to the Union with that news. The preliminary bombardment began, and Union forces maneuvered for position. During the night of May 29, the Confederate army moved out. They used the [[Mobile and Ohio Railroad]] to carry the sick and wounded, the heavy artillery, and tons of supplies. When a train arrived, the troops cheered as though reinforcements were arriving. They set up dummy [[Quaker Gun]]s along the defensive earthworks. Camp fires were kept burning, and buglers and drummers played. The rest of the men slipped away undetected, withdrawing to [[Tupelo, Mississippi]]. When Union patrols entered Corinth on the morning of May 30, they found the Confederate troops gone. The Union forces took control and made it the base for their operations to seize control of the [[Mississippi River Valley]], and especially the Confederate stronghold of [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]].<ref>Smith, 2012</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Corinth_I_Battlefield_Mississippi.jpg|308px|thumb|right|Map of the siege of Corinth battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\n[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]], whose aggressiveness exceeded his strategic capabilities, remarked in his memoirs that Halleck's cautious campaign failed to take full advantage of a glittering array of talented Union officers, including \"[[Ulysses S.

At times during the second battle, Confederate forces seemed to have the upper hand but would fail to follow up their successes leading to a devastating defeat for Confederate forces in that region. Rosecrans had the opportunity to crush rebel forces during the battle but failed to follow up his victory, allowing Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn to escape from destruction.

Saki is a muscular Japanese man, most frequently seen in \"the Shredder\" persona, wearing a suit of armor vaguely based on that of a [[samurai]], sometimes with a cape. The armor consists of blade-covered metal plaques on his shoulders, forearms, hands (sometimes just his left hand, because he is left-handed), and shins; he wears a purple, gray, blue, or red robe that variously appears to be simple fabric or a form of [[chain mail]]. He also tends to wear a metal [[kabuto|helmet]] with a trident-shaped ornament on top, and a metal ninja style mask which covers his face, leaving only his eyes visible. In the 2003 TMNT series, the Shredder is a red alien Utrom named Ch'rell, who utilized an indestructible exo-suit to disguise himself as a human named Oroku Saki.\n\n[[Kevin Eastman]] got the idea for Shredder's armor from large trapezoidal cheese [[grater]]s which he envisioned on a villainous character's<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2014/08/16/10-strangest-facts-about-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/|title=10 Strangest Facts About The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|publisher=Listverse|language=English|author=Chris Jenkins|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=21 January 2017}}</ref> (originally named \"The Grater\" or \"Grate Man\") arms.

He quickly became one of their deadliest warriors and rose up the ranks and was chosen to lead the Foot's American branch. Operating in New York under the name of The Shredder, Saki used the opportunity to avenge his brother by killing Yoshi and Shen. Under Saki's leadership, the Foot participated in variety of criminal activities, including [[drug smuggling]], [[Arms trafficking|arms running]], and assassination.\n\nThirteen years later Saki was challenged by the Ninja Turtles, who were the result of an accident exposing four ordinary turtles to radioactive waste. They were trained by Yoshi's pet rat Splinter, who had also been mutated by the same substance, to avenge his former master. After a lengthy rooftop battle where Saki seemed to be winning, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] managed to plunge his sword through Saki's torso. Defeated, he was offered the opportunity to commit [[seppuku]] (ritual suicide), but Shredder refused and detonated a [[thermite]] grenade, in an attempt to take their lives as well along his. But at the last second, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] used his [[B\u014d|bo]] to knock Shredder off the building to his death.\n\nHowever, it was not yet the end of the Shredder. He returned on Christmas Eve seemingly resurrected with an army of Foot Ninjas severely beating Leonardo and burning down the apartment of the turtles' ally [[April O'Neil]], forcing them to go into hiding outside the city. A year later, in the story \"Return to New York\", the Turtles returned to settle the score with the Shredder. Leonardo faced off against Oroku Saki alone, during which Saki revealed he was brought back to life by a technique using worms feeding on his body and recreating his cells to reform his body. In the battle, Leonardo [[decapitate]]s the villain, finally killing him, and the four turtles burn his body at the [[Hudson River]]. In the Zulli's trilogy in issues 31, 35, and 36, Shredder attacks the turtles and Splinter before being defeated. Shredder also appears in the dream of Donatello in Volume 4 where he is shown fighting him.\n\nOroku Saki appears briefly in the image comics issue 3 of TMNT and the female ninja Pimiko from the comic book series' Volume 3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/pimiko/29-49933/ |title=Pimiko (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> claims to be Shredder's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miragelicensing.com/comics/image/05/05.html |title=Image Comics' TMNT \"Volume 3\" #5 |publisher=Miragelicensing.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Tales of the TMNT'' ====\nIn the second volume of the anthology series ''[[Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' story \"Worms of Madness\" it is shown that a few weeks after the events of their final battle the Shredder had yet another resurrection of sorts when a Foot mystic reactivated the worms; however, the mystic did not resurrect Saki himself but the worm colony which had gained sentience and retained Saki's memories and believing itself to be Saki. The worms then went out to find a new body and chose that of a shark. After the Foot Kidnapped Splinter, the turtles managed to engage the \"Shredder-Shark\" in battle and defeating it by severing its connection to the mystic and the creature realizing that it was not the real Saki.\n\nThe \"Shredder-Shark\" returned once more kidnapping Casey's adopted daughter Shadow to lure the Turtles into a trap. With the Turtles away, it was up to Casey and Splinter to defeat it and rescue Shadow, finally killing the creature.\n\n====Other versions of the Shredder====\nThroughout a considerable part of the Image comic series, [[Raphael (TMNT)|Raphael]] tries to impersonate Shredder by wearing his armor. Following this, he is accepted as the leader of the Foot Clan. In later issues of the series, a mysterious '''Lady Shredder''' appears to challenge Raphael. Although the book was canceled before her identity could be revealed, writer [[Gary Carlson]] confirmed after the fact that she was meant to be [[Karai (character)|Karai]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn Volume Four series, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] encounters '''Oroku Yoshi''', a Battle Nexus contestant wearing armor almost identical to that of the second animated series' Shredder. His connection to Oroku Saki and the Foot is not known, since the bi-monthly comic was ultimately cancelled in 2010. In issue 32 he was called to meet a mysterious individual who asks to bring Leo with him as well.\n\nAnother Version called Doctor Shreddarius also appears in a reality where the turtles are superheroes.\n\n===Archie Comics===\nThe [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Archie Comics)|Archie Comics' series]] use the same background as the 1987 cartoon, as the first issues are identical. Later in the Archie comics, Shredder travels to the future and works with Armaggon and Verminator X to offset the skill and experience of the future versions of the Turtles.\n\nThis version of the character was more in line with the early episodes' depiction of the character as a cunning adversary and in many issues nearly proves to be a lethal enemy, coming close to defeating the turtles on a number of occasions, and even aids Armaggon and Verminator X in the defeat and capture of two of the turtles in the future. His final fate within the Archie comics series remains unknown, though a three-part mini-series put out by Archie comics after the end of their regular comic series seems to indicate he remains a consistent foe to the turtles for many years, briefly restoring Splinter to the form of Hamato Yoshi and also undoing Michaelangelo's mutation, though both later revert to mutant status by the end of the story, while Shredder was left in a vegetative state in the aftermath of his final battle with the Turtles.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nIn feudal Japan, Oroku Saki was a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan along with Hamato Yoshi.

A short battle results in retreat on both sides and the revelation that Shredder had stolen some Utrom resources from Krang's compound to begin creating a mutant army (in the form of Bebop, Rocksteady, Koya and Bludgeon).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn Issue #50, Shredder faced Splinter and the turtles in a final battle which he lost and briefly admitted his faults and also making Karai the new head of the Foot Clan. He was then killed by Splinter by having his sword slashed into the back of his head, killing him instantly.\nAfter his death Shredder's body is kept in a crypt that is guarded by Jennika who was assigned by Hamato Yoshi in order to learn humility. Shredder's tomb is eventually desecrated by the witch Kitsune who plans to revive Oroku Saki in order to restore order to the Foot Clan but Splinter knew this and keeps the skull to foil her attempts. \n\nShredder will appear in the upcoming miniseries ''Shredder in Hell''. In the mini series Shredder is in the afterlife and descends into the underworld trying to find the truth of his own soul meanwhile Kitsune uses his corpse to summon her father as his host. Shredder also fought his past life Takeshi Tasuo in his inner conflict until Splinter/Hamato Yoshi later shows up to help him against the forces of Hell.\n\n==Television==\n===1987 animated series===\n[[File:TMNT1987 Shredder.png|thumb|Shredder in the 1987 animated series]]\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated series]], Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were both members of the Foot Clan in Japan. After Saki framed him for the attempted murder of a visiting [[sensei]], Yoshi was forced to [[exile]] himself to [[New York City]], where he lived in the sewers with four pet turtles that were accidentally dropped down a storm drain.\n\nIn the following years, Saki took leadership of the Foot Clan, and took on his Shredder persona. He also met a trans-dimensional alien called [[Krang]], and used the advanced technology at his disposal to replace the Foot Ninja with robots called the Foot Soldiers. He secretly moved to New York, where he found Yoshi still alive. In an attempt to kill his old foe, Shredder dumped mutagen in the sewers. This mutates Yoshi into Splinter, and he starts training the also mutated Turtles in [[ninjutsu]].\n\nShredder was voiced by [[James Avery]] for seasons one to seven and [[William E. Martin]] for seasons eight and ten, with the alternates being [[Dorian Harewood]] and [[Pat Fraley]] in 1989, [[Jim Cummings]] in 1991\u20131993 and [[Townsend Coleman]] in 1993. In the 2009 crossover movie ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', this incarnation of the Shredder was voiced by Load Williams. In the 2012 series, the 1987 version of the Shredder is voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\n====Depiction====\nIn his early appearances, Shredder was presented as extremely cunning and was described by Splinter himself as the most dangerous adversary he ever faced. Shredder's intelligence persevered throughout his various portrayals, and in several instances it is claimed that Shredder has an IQ of 300. As the 1987 cartoon series was more light-hearted than the comics, Shredder was later depicted as an evil but a villain that always fails rather than the dire and lethal ninja he was originally shown to be. He and Krang are constantly bickering about tactics and often take pleasure in the other's failings (and sometimes intentionally sabotage each other). His two henchmen [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] are especially incompetent and fail miserably at everything they do. They were mostly used for [[comic relief]] in the show; however, the Turtles certainly consider them to be formidable (despite their inane stupidity) in combat due to their great strength and endurance, and as such, often use their intelligence to outwit them.\n\nDespite Shredder's failings, he is still shown to have considerable skills. In martial arts, he is often shown to surpass the Turtles and to be equaled only by Splinter. Nevertheless, he usually runs away from a fight when outnumbered, incapacitating the Turtles to defeat them in combat; as the series progressed, however, the Turtles were able to battle him on more equal grounds and even defeat him in combat on several occasions. He trained the Punk Frogs in a very short period of time to be a match for the Turtles, but the Punk Frogs soon switch sides. His technical skills are also quite impressive: he designed and built a robotic body for Krang, prepared the mutagen mixture, knew how Krang's teleportation engine worked, and built numerous other advanced devices. Ironically in one episode \"Shredderville\" the Turtles dream they find themselves in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|mirror universe]] where the TMNT ''never existed'' and Shredder rules New York City, yet finds the task of ruling so burdensome that he has a nervous breakdown.\n\nFrom mid season seven onwards, Shredder was depicted as a more serious threat, full of anger and bloodlust, though he was still easily defeated by the Turtles. His friendship with Krang also appeared to have grown. There were many times that Shredder could have just left Krang at the mercy of the Turtles or Lord Dregg, but he always rescued him, and went as far as to donate his life energy to save him.\n\n====Family====\nShredder's family is presented in three episodes. In the episode \"Shredder's Mom\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 70! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605021820/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |archivedate=2011-06-05 }}</ref> Shredder's mother Miyoko helps Shredder and Krang in an attempt to destroy the world's climate. In this episode, Miyoko first learns of her son's criminal activities, and proves herself to be as villainous. However, she constantly treats Shredder like a baby, until he gets fed up with it and transports her back to her retirement home. In the episode \"My Brother, the Bad Guy\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 108! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210071625/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 }}</ref> it is revealed that Oroku Saki has a younger brother, Kazuo who works as a police lieutenant in [[Tokyo]]. Kazuo and the Turtles try to join forces to stop one of Shredder's plans, but his fervent respect of the law clashes with the Turtles' \"whatever it takes\" attitude. Finally, the episode \"The Legend of Koji\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 159! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035507/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 }}</ref> features Saki's distant ancestor Oroku Sancho, who lived in Japan in 1583. He is the leader of a small clan, and every bit as wicked as his descendant. When Shredder offers to help him find magical relics that would provide him with power and wealth, Sancho takes Shredder's information, then betrays him and orders his men to kill him. However, Sancho is also a coward, and when he breaks down in the face of danger, his men abandon him.\n\nThis family tree leads to a bit of confusion regarding whether Shredder's given name is Oroku and his last name Saki (as indicated by the fact his brother shares the name Saki), or the other way around (as indicated by the fact his ancestor's last name is Oroku). This question is never resolved on the show, although Mirage comics adds more evidence for Oroku being the family name; Saki's brother is \"Oroku Nagi\". This follows Japanese naming conventions, which place the family name before an individual's given name.\n\n====Timeline====\nCounting from the first meeting with the Turtles, Shredder spent eight seasons plotting ways to defeat them. In the season 8 episode \"Turtle Trek\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart178.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 178! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210071629/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart178.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 }}</ref> the Turtles destroy the engines of the [[Technodrome]], trapping it and its inhabitants in [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]] for good and putting an end to Shredder's plans. He spent the next two seasons in Dimension X, until he was contacted by Dregg (\"The Power of Three\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart189.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 189! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608222405/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart189.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 }}</ref> Dregg arranged for him and Krang to come back to Earth, to help him fight the Turtles. Together, they capture the Turtles, but Dregg then betrays them and tries to drain the life energy of the Turtles, Krang, and Shredder all at once, making them weaker while Dregg becomes stronger. Shredder alone escapes the trap and restores Krang (\"A Turtle in Time\"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart190.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 190! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320162134/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart190.htm |archivedate=2007-03-20 }}</ref> but Dregg captures them again.

Shredder is nowhere to be seen, but it is assumed that he is still somewhere in Dimension X.\n\nHe and Krang also appear in ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', with the Technodrome still under New York City before being sent into the 2003 universe. However, Shredder and Krang's incompetence (as well as their relative sanity) is fully shown when the Utrom Shredder of the 2003 universe seizes command of the Technodrome and adds Utrom technology to the powerful war machine, and turns it against the world. In the climax, Shredder temporarily overcomes his hatred for the Turtles as both he and Krang decide to help the Turtles defeat the Utrom Shredder who they realise is totally insane, will kill everyone and has effectively stolen the Technodrome from them. Shredder also takes extreme offense at being considered inferior by his other dimensional counterpart, doesn't see the point of destroying the entire universe and doesn't understand why the Utrom Shredder won't just kill the Turtles when he had the chance. So, with Krang, he chooses to fight alongside the Turtles against their common foe.\n\n===''The Next Mutation''===\nIn ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', Shredder (portrayed by Patrick Pon, voiced by [[Doug Parker (voice actor)|Doug Parker]]) is still the Turtles' sworn enemy. This time, however, Venus uses her powers to make the Oroku Saki from within take control of Shredder's mind. After the Foot Clan disbands, he ends up living on the streets. Later, the Dragon Lord's rank warriors attack him to get a medallion that was in his possession. Splinter saves him and takes him to the Turtles' lair to protect him. It was hinted that Shredder might possibly go back to his old ways, but the show was canceled soon after that episode.\n\nIn the show, Shredder wore a general attire similar to the one he wore in the second film, but with a heavily altered helmet/mask due to the lesser budget for the TV series as compared to the movies, which had allowed for more detailed props and costume pieces. Shredder appeared only a few times in the show, due to the primary villain of the series being a draconic being from another dimension and thus supplanted Shredder as the Turtles' nemesis.\n\n===2003 animated series===\nNumerous individuals have assumed the \"'''Shredder'''\" mantle in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 animated series]], all of whom, except for Karai, are voiced by [[Scott Rayow|Scottie Ray]]. In the episode \"Tempus Fugit\", a possible future is shown in which the Utrom Shredder, Tengu Shredder, and Cyber Shredder are engaged in a war for control of New York City.\n\n====Utrom Shredder====\n[[File:TMNTCh'rell.png|thumb|The Shredder's armor is penetrated, revealing his true Utrom form]]\nThe Utrom Shredder is the main antagonist and primary Shredder of the series. He is the archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter, and indirectly had a hand in their creation. Utrom Shredder serves as the main antagonist of the first three seasons of the show as well as the finale film Turtles Forever. His digital copy also serves as the antagonist of the seventh and final season.\n\nAfter causing the deaths of millions across the universe, the psychopathic alien warlord Ch'rell (whose aliases include Torrinon, Kako Naso, and Duke Acureds) was captured by his fellow Utrom and being transported back to his home world to answer for his crimes. However, Ch'rell managed to escape captivity and sabotaged the Utrom ship, causing it to crash-land on Earth during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. Stranded on the then-primitive planet, the Utrom were forced to wait for centuries until human technology advanced enough for them to develop a teleportation device and return home. They thus developed humanoid exo-suits to hide amongst the humans, and Ch'rell stole the first working prototype and used the Japanese legend of a Demon Tengu to craft a dual identity, becoming a wealthy Japanese philanthropist named Oroku Saki while secretly operating as the crime lord known as the Shredder. Saki soon founded the Foot Clan, which grew into a massive underground criminal empire by the 20th century. He eventually adopts an abandoned girl named [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]], whom he personally trained in the arts of ninjutsu to lead the Foot Clan in Japan while he operated in New York City. In New York, the Shredder captures Hamato Yoshi, one of the Utroms' foremost guardians, and kills him after he refuses to reveal their location. Yoshi's pet rat [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] witnesses his murder and escapes, winding up in the city's sewers where he and four baby turtles are accidentally exposed to a mutagenic ooze created by the Utroms, transforming them into sentient humanoid lifeforms.\n\nIn the first season set over a decade later, the Turtles begin encountering the Foot Clan and unknowingly foiling several of the Shredder's operations. Oroku Saki becomes intrigued with the Turtles, wanting to meet them and hoping to bring them to his side. One day, he invites [[Leonardo]] to his home and offers him to join the Foot. The Turtles consult their master Splinter, who reveals his true nature by telling them of Master Yoshi's murder. The Shredder eventually becomes the greatest enemy of the Turtles when they decline his offer. During their first engagement, the Shredder proves himself to be more skilled than the Turtles, compelling them to flee and hide. While Shredder and his Foot Ninja search for the Turtles, Splinter finds and regroups them, and plans a counterattack. In a subsequent battle on the rooftops, the Shredder outmatches the Turtles again, but Splinter tricks him into cutting the support for a water tower, which is kicked onto him. The water sweeps Shredder off the building, and the tower collapses to the ground, crushing him. But a few scenes later, Shredder's hand is shown to emerge from the wreckage of the water tower.\n\nSplinter and the Turtles were unaware of the Shredder's survival until months later, on one day when Leonardo goes on an outdoor morning training exercise, only to be ambushed by the Foot Clan. The Shredder's four Elite Guard beat Leonardo close to death and send him flying into a window of [[April O'Neil]]'s antique shop apartment, where the Turtles were staying after Foot Ninjas had marauded their sewer home while they were away. Soon afterwards, the Shredder leads an assault on April's shop. Overpowered and outnumbered, the Turtles, Splinter, April and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] are forced to run off into retreat in a walk-in cooler. The Shredder then bars the door, drops a firebomb and punctures a gas pipe with his gauntlets. Fortunately, April remembers that the motor used to power the cooler was removed, leaving a hole in the exterior wall that leads outside. As a result, the Turtles and their allies are able to evacuate the building before it burns down. They retreat to Casey's grandmother's farmhouse in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], where they would spend the next three months recuperating.\n\nDuring this time, they are presumed dead by the Foot, but Oroku Saki sends the clan's mad scientist [[Baxter Stockman]] the task of confirming their deaths. Although Stockman finds no proof that the Turtles died, he creates false evidence to convince the Shredder and succeeds in doing so. When Leonardo is completely healed from his injuries, the Turtles and Splinter return to New York to face the Shredder once more. They launch a surprise assault on the Foot headquarters, fighting their way through Shredder's minions and eventually reaching his throne. By the end of the battle, an epic standoff between Leonardo and the Shredder occurs. Armed with the Sword of Tengu, the former decapitates the latter when they strike each other in one final clash. Not knowing that the Shredder is an Utrom, the Turtles believe him to be finally killed for good. After they leave, the Shredder is seen to be getting up and walking away carrying his severed head.\n\nIn the second season, Ch'rell seeks to exact revenge on his species. He and his henchmen infiltrate the TCRI facility, where the Utroms' base is located, and coincidentally encounter the Turtles and Master Splinter. When the Shredder is zapped into unconsciousness, a time bomb slips out of his hands, set to detonate in ten minutes. The Turtles help the Utroms escape using the Transmat, a teleportation device, which [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] activates. After the Utroms teleport back to their homeworld, the Shredder awakens and attacks the Turtles. In the ensuing fight, the Turtles use their weapons to penetrate his armor, which is then electrocuted by Donatello, disabling it. Afterwards, the Shredder reveals his Utrom form to the Turtles, intent on taking down his enemies with him. But at the last few seconds, Donatello manages to power up the Transmat, through which he, his brothers and Splinter escape before the TCRI building implodes with Ch'rell inside of it.\n\nWith his supposed demise, the Foot Clan (led by the Elite Guard), the Purple Dragons and the New York Mafia clash with each other for control of New York City. Unknown to them, the Shredder had survived once more and was retrieved by his daughter Karai, now being placed in a stasis tube and healed by worms inside a secret medical facility of the Foot headquarters. During his recuperation, Karai assumes leadership of the Foot Clan and makes peace with the Turtles after they help her end the turf war. But once the Shredder is fully recovered, he vows vengeance and breaks off the truce, leaving Karai to question her loyalty. By this point, Baxter Stockman had created the Foot Mechs, mainly in the form of armed ninja robots, but also versions of the U.S. President, the English Prime Minister and Splinter. His plans were again thwarted by the Turtles, when his barge hideout is located by them, Splinter, and their unlikely ally, the delusional Triceraton Zog, leading to another confrontation with the Foot. Aboard the freighter, Donatello programs a bomb set to go off in 30 minutes. The Shredder is defeated again when Zog sacrifices his life by keeping him on his ship when it sinks due to the explosion, but Karai rescues him on a helicopter.\n\nIn the third season, the Triceratons launch an invasion on Earth. In the aftermath of the invasion, New York City is in ruins. In his persona as Oroku Saki, the Shredder uses his fortune to repair the damage and gains favor of its citizens. Secretly, his real purpose of reconstruction was to salvage the remnants of Triceraton technology in order to construct a large starship to return to the stars, and thereby retaliating against the Utrom. He even enlists a young scientist named Dr. Chaplin to help out. The craft is eventually completed, but Ch'rell's plan suffers several complications, courtesy of the Turtles and the Earth Protection Force (led by Agent Bishop). Despite sustaining heavy damage, the ship is launched into orbit, albeit with the Turtles and Splinter on board. When Karai notes that they left their forces on Earth, Ch'rell states that he has allies on other worlds that can help him. Entering a four-armed Shredder exo-suit, Ch'rell easily defeats them all, prompting the Turtles and Splinter to attempt to sacrifice themselves and blow the ship up in a final attempt to stop the Shredder. Luckily, as the starship explodes, Mortu and the Utrom arrive, having placed a stasis field around the entire ship, freezing time, and teleport all its inhabitants to safety. While the Turtles and Splinter are teleported to sick bay and Professor Honeycutt is taken to one of their labs to be placed in a new robot body, Ch'rell, Karai, and Dr. Chaplin are teleported to the brig. On the Utrom homeworld, Ch'rell is placed on trial before the Utrom High Council that is watched by the Turtles, Splinter, and Professor Honeycutt. The Utrom High Council start by mentioning a testimony from Dolphette that Ch'rell willingly launched an attack on the planet Enethone where over 1 million innocent inhabitants perished. Then they bring up Wan-ran Otho's testimony where Ch'rell incited and funded a civil war on the planet Eno II in an effort to mine their raw minerals without restriction. 3,200,000 lives perished. The Utrom High Council then concludes that Ch'rell tried various attempts to take over the Utrom government through an illegal and violent coup. The Utrom High Council found Ch'rell guilty for the chaos and destruction he brought across the universe, and ultimately sentence him to eternal exile on the desolate ice asteroid Mor Gal Tal. Mortu states to everyone present that Karai and Dr. Chaplin will be returned to Earth and handed over to the authorities.\n\nIn the finale film ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', Ch'rell is freed from his exile by his Shredder counterpart from the 1987 series after his frozen body was teleported off of Mor Gal Tal by 1980s Shredder and Krang. Once Karai showed up upon finding out about Ch'rell's return, Ch'rell then takes over the Technodrome and gains a new, more powerful exo-suit. After realigning with a now-mutated Hun, Ch'rell reverse-engineers the mutagen that Hun got to turn a select number of Cyber Foot into Mutant Foot Soldiers and create new Foot Robots that are stronger than the '80s versions. The Ch'rell later uses the Technodrome to view alternate dimensions, realizing that there is an entire multiverse of Ninja Turtles. Locating the Turtles' source planet, Turtle Prime, Ch'rell vows to eliminate every Ninja Turtle in existence by destroying this dimension. The Mirage Turtles, the 1987 Turtles, and the 2003 Turtles team up to defeat Ch'rell, though Karai and Splinter agree that the Shredder will return again as he always does.\n\nIn \"Same As It Never Was\", Donatello is transported to an alternate future in which the Shredder has succeeded in subjugating Earth. By then, Splinter had died protecting his sons and Casey Jones died fighting the Foot Clan. Ch'rell also severed [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]]'s left arm and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]]'s left eye. When Donatello leads a final rebellion against the Shredder's fortress, his Foot forces kill Michelangelo while Karai kills Leonardo and Raphael. April avenges Leonardo and Raphael by using a rocket launcher on Karai, and the Shredder is killed by Donatello with the Tuneller.\n\nIn \"Timing is Everything\", Leonardo and Cody Jones are accidentally sent back in time to the aftermath of the Turtles' first battle with the Shredder. Later, the Shredder and several Foot ninjas are transported to 2105 but are easily defeated by the Turtles' futuristic technology.\n\n====Tengu Shredder====\nThe '''Tengu Shredder''' or the '''Demon Shredder''' serves as the main antagonist of the fifth season. The first Shredder was a Demon Tengu that rose from a hellish pit and terrorized ancient Japan. When on the verge of death, it entered and possessed a human named Oroku Saki, one of Japan's most skilled warriors, but he was eventually defeated by the power of the Ninja Tribunal. His body, helmet, and gauntlet were separated and sealed away to prevent his return. In the 21st century, the Tengu Shredder's five Foot Mystic heralds attempt to resurrect him, forcing the Ninja Tribunal to recruit the Turtles and four human warriors as their Acolytes to defeat. After the Tengu Shredder rises from the dead and conquers New York City, the Turtles recruit Karai's Foot Clan, the Justice Force, the Earth Protection Force, and the Purple Dragons to defeat him. The Tengu Shredder is weakened when Karai drains his power via a mystic link (which connects all who take the mantle of the Shredder), and he is finally destroyed when the Turtles combine their Dragon avatars to summon the spirit of Hamato Yoshi to deliver the final blow.\n\n====Cyber Shredder====\nThe '''Cyber Shredder''' appears as the main antagonist of the seventh and final season, ''Back to the Sewer''. It is revealed that prior to Ch'rell's exile, he created a digital copy of himself in the event that anything happened to his corporeal form and stored this double in a Foot data vault deep within the Internet. This vault's consciousness is later released when the futuristic Viral attempts to access it, giving rise to the Cyber Shredder. While he is initially confined to cyberspace, the Cyber Shredder ultimately manages to escape and become a physical being. During the final episode, the Cyber Shredder leads the Foot Clan to attack April O'Neil and Casey Jones's wedding, and is finally defeated when the Turtles erased him with a de-compiler previously used against Viral.\n\n====Karai====\n'''Karai''' is the adopted daughter of Oroku Saki (Ch'rell), who takes the mantle of the Shredder after her father's exile. After some lesser battles, she doffs the mantle and begins a non-hostile relationship with the Turtles, particularly towards Leonardo.\n\n===2012 animated series===\nThe Shredder appears as the main antagonist of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 animated series]], voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\nHis Japanese origins as Oroku Saki and brotherly relationship with Hamato Yoshi is mostly intact, with the Foot Clan and the Hamato Clan being later revealed as having a long-term rivalry before the Hamato family killed the Oroku family, wiped out their entire clan (starting with the destruction of the Foot Clan monastery) and took in the orphaned Saki as their own. Despite being raised as brothers, both Saki and Yoshi eventually became rivals due to the love of Tang Shen, whose decision to marry Yoshi drove Saki to discover his true heritage and turn on his former brother, eventually destroying everything Yoshi held dear, including the lovely Tang Shen (whom he had killed by accident) and the entire Hamato Clan (starting with the destruction of the Hamato Clan monastery, which resulted with Saki's head getting burned scarred and hairless). Blaming Tang Shen's untimely death on Yoshi, Saki returned to his biological family and became the new leader of the newly restored Foot Clan, tutoring ninjutsu students such as world-famous martial artist [[Tokka and Rahzar|Chris Bradford]] and Brazilian street thug Xever Montes, sharing criminal business with business partners such as Russian arms dealer [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Ivan Steranko]], Sicilian mob boss Don Visiozo, and Purple Dragons leader Hun. In addition, he also a pet [[Akita (dog)|akita]] named Hachiko (named after the [[Hachiko|akita of the same name]]) who played a part in Bradford's mutation into Dogpound after Hachiko bit him.\n\nShredder first appeared in the end of \"Rise of the Turtles, Part 2\" where he traveled to New York when he learned that Hamato Yoshi is training his own ninjas after seeing a shuriken with his clan symbol on a [[shuriken]] left behind by the Turtles during a recent fight on a TV news report. Determined to finally end his age-old rival's life, he sent the Foot Clan after the Turtles until he made his first confrontation with the Turtles in person in \"The Gauntlet\", where victory was seemingly in his grasp before he was distracted by the mutating Bradford and Montes. Although Shredder planned to kill former TCRI inventor [[Baxter Stockman]] for interfering with his plans to kill the Turtles in \"MOUSERS Attack\", he changed his mind by commenting on how Stockman's scientific knowledge could be useful to him. Shredder is also Karai's father, as seen in \"New Girl in Town\". However, in \"Showdown\", during Shredder's battle with Splinter, he reveals that in the aftermath of the fight that caused Tang Shen's death, he took Splinter's daughter, Miwa, and raised her as Karai. He has told her that he is her biological father and it was Splinter who killed her mother, as she has sworn revenge ever since. Shredder initially dismissed the Kraang's presence in New York, but after capturing one, decided to ally with them to destroy the Turtles. The partnership seems stable, though it would seem the Shredder still did not fully trust his new allies.\n\nEarly in the second season, in \"Follow the Leader\", he left for Japan to deal with a situation, leaving Karai as the interim leader of his Foot Clan. He ordered her not to attack the Turtles nor make any dealings with the Kraang behind his back, and was livid when his adoptive daughter disobeyed him. He returned in \"The Manhattan Project\", with Tiger Claw, a Japanese circus performer who was mutated into Shredder's deadly assassin and new first lieutenant. Tiger Claw was able to bring Splinter before him, but complication from a Kraang operation in the city and the Turtles' own efforts rob Shredder of his chance to kill his old foe once again. In \"The Wrath of Tiger Claw\", Shredder and Tiger Claw attempted to use Karai to set a trap for the Turtles, but when she saw a photograph of Hamato Yoshi, Tang Shen, and herself as an infant, she realized that the Turtles were telling the truth and sided with them, resulting in her being captured while buying them time to escape Tiger Claw. Shredder still cared about his adoptive daughter, though, as seen in \"The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto\", where he visited her in her cell and explained why he kept everything a secret and hoped that she will one day understand. After his helmet, the titular Kuro Kabuto, was stolen by professional thief [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Anton Zeck]] on behalf of Steranko, Shredder found Zeck's calling card on a glued-down Rahzar and ordered the entire clan before him. Explaining the helmet's history as a special Foot Clan relic, he had the clan hunt for Zeck, sending Fishface with Stockman-Fly and Rahzar with Tiger Claw. Leonardo later confronted Shredder with the Kabuto for a trade and kept him busy long enough for the other Turtles to get to Karai. However, the \"Karai\" Shredder traded them with turned out to be a dummy rigged with a bomb as the Turtles evaded it. In \"Vengeance is Mine\", Shredder attempted to use the real Karai as bait for a trap that would mutate the Turtles into snakes that would kill Splinter, but the plan backfired when Karai was exposed to the mutagen, turning into a snake and almost attacking Splinter before she fled after regaining control of herself.\n\nIn the two-part second-season finale \"The Invasion\", Shredder and Kraang Prime formed a full alliance in which Shredder and the Foot Clan will help the Kraang take over New York and then the world and in turn the Kraang would return Karai to normal, and deliver Splinter and the Turtles to him. Later, he watched as Leonardo fought and eventually defeated his army of Foot Bots, after which he sent Rahzar, Fishface, and Tiger Claw to take care of him. Leonardo managed to subdue them for a short period of time before Shredder got involved and badly injured Leonardo. Later, Splinter confronted him and the two battled until Splinter got trapped under large metal pipes. Shredder was prepared to kill his rival once and for all; however, [[Leatherhead (TMNT)|Leatherhead]] intervened, and was defeated when Shredder sliced the front of his torso and kicked him of the edge of the dock. Splinter became furious as he broke out from under the pipes and tackled Shredder to the sewers. Later, the Turtles (minus Leonardo) and April watched helplessly from behind metal bars as Shredder defeated Splinter and seemingly killed him by throwing him down a large draining bay.\n\nIn the middle of the third season in \"Return to New York\", tensions began to grow high within the Foot of their alliance with the Kraang, but Shredder convinced everyone that he will keep his promise to take the city back from them. After a feral Splinter was found by the Foot-Bots and taken before him, Shredder had Stockman-Fly work on restoring his memory, which is what April did instead with her Kraang powers when she, the Turtles and Casey Jones returned to the city to rescue their sensei. In \"The Pig and the Rhino\", Shredder sent a now mutated Steranko and Zeck (who are later renamed Bebop and Rocksteady by Michelangelo) to find Karai again, like they did recently before the Turtles helped her escape, or else they'll be given something even more painful than mutation. After the Turtles unknowingly led them to her, the two succeeded in re-capturing Karai (while the Turtles weren't looking) and delivering her back to Shredder, who promised to fix everything he's done to her. The Kraang invasion eventually came to a stop made by the Turtles and the [[Mighty Mutanimals]], but its effects had eventually gave Shredder a gift for his cooperation with the Kraang, which shifted the balance of power within the city's criminal underworld over to the Foot. For him, this was achieved by gaining control of the [[Purple Dragons]] and other Asian gangs through Hun, several South American gangs through Fishface, the [[Russian mafia|Russian mob]] through Rocksteady, and the [[Sicilian mafia|Sicilian mob]] through Vizioso. By using this power, Shredder had these crime groups aid him with collecting various chemicals from a chemical company called Aumen Chemicals, an abandoned Kraang lab and Vizioso for a mind-control serum that he planned to create and use on the Turtles, the Mutanimals, and Karai.\n\nIn the two-part season 3 finale, ''Annihilation: Earth!'' he briefly teams up with Splinter to stop a black hole machine that was to destroy the Earth. He briefly fought the Triceratons until he followed Splinter, double crossing and stabbing him in the back, killing him instantly in front of the turtles. They rushed to Splinter while April blew Shredder away with a blast from her mind. Proclaiming that his victory over Splinter is more important to him than even saving the world, Shredder is sucked into the black hole along with his followers and Splinter while the turtles, April and Casey escape Earth's destruction and then in \"Beyond the Known Universe\", they travel back in time to six months earlier in an effort to prevent this event from happening. In \"Earth's Last Stand\" these events were revisited, but the arrival of the Turtles from the future resulted in Shredder's attempt to murder Splinter being thwarted. The two engaged briefly in battle with Splinter proving victorious, and the unconscious Shredder was carried away by Tiger Claw.\n\nIn \"City at War\" due to the injuries he sustained from Splinter, Shredder has been confined to a hospital bed under the care of Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take Shredder down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, Shredder decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to Shredder, and as the mutagen is injected into Shredder, his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In \"The Insecta Trifecta\", Shredder is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, Shredder is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as Shredder deploys a pair of blades from the back of his hand, right out of the skin itself. In \"The Super Shredder\", Shredder forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super Shredder form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. This form left him with blades coming out of his body, a muscular build, and bandaged feet and ankles. Shredder then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the Shredder along with Shinigami, but Shredder easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him (The Shell Raiser), and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. Shredder then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. Shredder then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach Shredder, Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. Shredder forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter leads Shredder to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. Shredder eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. Shredder then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as Shredder was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and Shredder fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, \"Darkest Plight\", Shredder and Splinter are separated during the fall, and Shredder returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, Shredder goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, Shredder tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at Shredder. However, before Shredder can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures Shredder in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, Shredder is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where Shredder demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, Shredder overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In \"Tale of Tiger Claw\", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter.\n\nIn \"Requiem\", he returns to New York City, far stronger and more vengeful than ever before. He shows up at the hideout where Karai is planning her next move with Shnigami and the Mighty Mutanimals. He defeats the Mutanimals effortlessly and badly injures Karai in the process. On the WOLF building, he faces off against Splinter, Slash, Raphael, April and Casey. He ultimately manages to murder Splinter and hurls him from the building to his death. He is then blasted by a tremendously powerful psychic wave from an enraged April, and is crushed by a garbage truck, though he again survives the onslaught.\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series, season 4)|season four]] finale \"Owari\" he has his lackeys prepare for the inevitable arrival of the Turtles, April and Casey. He burns down his new lair and confronts the Turtles in a final showdown on the roof. His unique mutation makes him immune to Donatello's retro-mutagen, which allows him to beat Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo all at once, leaving only Leonardo left standing. After a heated one-on-one duel, Shredder is finally killed by Leonardo.\n\nMany months later, the Kabuto and his own heart were separated by unknown means and hidden in secret locations throughout New York. His heart was contained within a glass vial that came into the possession of Don Vzioso, which Tiger Claw and Kavaxas seek, as it is essential to revive him and then came back in a zombie-like form that wanted to die. Zombie Shredder was able to drag Kavaxas back to the Netherworld as they \"belong dead.\"\n\n===2018 animated series===\nIn the [[Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|2018 animated series]], Shredder appears as the demonic leader of the Foot Clan. His backstory is that he was a man who was consumed by the Kuroi Yoroi armor. Shredder terrorized Japan until he was defeated by Splinter's ancestors 500 years ago and the Kuroi Yoroi was scattered across the world to prevent his return.\n\nThe Foot Clan, allied with Baron Draxum, are collecting the armor pieces to resurrect him starting in \"Shadow of Evil.\"\n\nIn \"Warren and Hypno, Sitting in a Tree\", Baron Draxum claims the gauntlet that turned out to be part of the Kuroi Yoroi.\n\nIn \"Operation: Normal\", the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute target the slime Y\u014dkai Sunita because the boots she was wearing are part of the Kuroi Yoroi. They managed to claim them.\n\nIn \"How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will\", Baron Draxum and the Foot Recruit find Kuroi Yoroi fragment is at the botanical gardens. They claim it after setting up events where the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute would fail.\n\nIn \"One Man's Junk\", the next piece of the Kuroi Yuroi was in the possession of Repo Mantis who claimed from a Y\u014dkai and held in his salvage yard. After trapping the cat/mantis mutant Mrs. Nubbins who was owned by Repo Mantis, the Turtles learn from him that two fire-headed guys working as shoe salesmen bought them metal from him. This causes the Turtles to learn that the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute claimed the metal.\n\nAfter the Kuroi Y\u014droi was completed in \"End Game\", Baron Draxum dons the armor and the Foot Brute and Lieutenant address him as Shredder, but he rejects the title. Furthermore, due to a flaw in the armor (the Turtles' Jupiter Jim figure shoved in to cover a hole when the faceplate was used as a tea kettle), the transformation failed to complete. After Draxum was defeated and cast out of the armor, it reassembled itself, having drained Draxum of his life force.\n\nIn \"Many Happy Returns\", Shredder acted like a feral beast. The Foot Lieutenant, Foot Brute, and Foot Recruit retreat to find out what went wrong. After discovering a flux in Shredder, Big Mama was able to provide a baubel for the Turtles and Splinter to trap Shredder with her doing a secret last-minute alteration to this plan.\n\n==Films==\nThe Shredder was played by [[James Saito]] in the first movie and by [[Fran\u00e7ois Chau]] in the second, while his immense Super Shredder form was played by professional wrestler [[Kevin Nash]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0621760/ Kevin Nash (I)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In all cases, the character was voiced by David McCharen. The Shredder's costume was, in the first movie, originally the same as in the original comic, with a red color. However, this was changed in the sequel to a violet color, reflecting the more cartoonish nature of the second film. In both movies, he also had a silver and black cape. In both films, he is served by his second-in-command Tatsu. In the Japanese versions, the Shredder is voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]] (1st movie in VHS version), [[Hidekatsu Shibata]] (first movie in TV version), and [[Takeshi Watabe]] (second movie).\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (1990)===\n[[File:Shredder (James Saito).jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Saito]] as The Shredder in the film ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (1990)]]\n\nIn the first movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were rival martial artists in Japan and both loved a woman named Tang Shen. Shen, who loved only Yoshi, persuaded him not to fight Saki honorably; instead, they fled for the United States. Saki followed them to New York City; when Yoshi returned home from his construction job he found his beloved Shen lying on the floor. And then, he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words and during the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken. Splinter leaped up into Saki's face, biting and clawing. But Saki threw him to the floor and took one swipe with his [[katana]], slicing Splinter's ear. After this incident, it was said that Saki is never heard from again. The comic book adaptation of the film retains the original comic book origin story, with Oroku Nagi being slain and Saki coming to America to seek vengeance.\n\nSaki, in the \"Shredder\" persona, establishes an American branch of the Foot Clan. With the aid of his second-in-command Tatsu, he manipulates and recruits troubled teens as a brutal yet Machiavellian leader and father figure, teaching them ninjitsu to make them into skilled thieves and [[Assassination|assassins]]. Shredder sends the Foot Clan to \"silence\" [[April O'Neil]] when she reports on the Foot Clan's connection to the recent crime wave, inadvertently leading them to the Turtles' hideout when Raphael saves April. Shredder had Splinter kidnapped and imprisoned him in his warehouse hideout, and has the Foot Clan hunt the Turtles. He beats Splinter while interrogating him about how the Turtles learned their fighting techniques.\n\nAfter the Turtles successfully defeat the Foot Clan in a final assault, Shredder confronts them on a rooftop. He defeats all of the Turtles with his superior skills and threatens Leonardo with his [[yari]] to force the others to toss away their weapons. Splinter, freed by Turtles' allies, Danny Pennington and [[Casey Jones (TMNT)|Casey Jones]], intervenes and reveals to Shredder that they met years ago, as he was Hamato Yoshi's pet. Shredder unmasks himself, revealing the scars that Splinter gave him, and charges towards Splinter to impale him. Splinter counters with Michelangelo's [[nunchaku]] to send him over the side of the roof. Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter. Splinter caught the knife, but had to let go of the nunchaku that was holding onto the spear, making Shredder fall into a parked [[garbage truck]] far below. Casey Jones then activates the crushing mechanism; the viewers are then shown a closeup of the Shredder's helmet being crushed, implying his death.\n\n===''TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze'' (1991)===\nIn the second movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', the Turtles believe that since Casey had crushed him in the garbage truck, the Shredder was dead. It is soon revealed that Shredder had survived the crushing and revitalized his Foot Clan to get vengeance on the Turtles. After finding the Foot \"fallback\" headquarters in a junkyard, Tatsu was asking who would challenge him to cover for Shredder until Shredder appeared. Tatsu allowed Shredder to lead the Foot Clan. Shredder sent a member of the Foot to follow April, hoping to find the Turtles through her. When April's team was doing a report on T.G.R.I. in [[New Jersey]], April's camera operator/Foot Clan member Freddy found some mutated [[dandelion]]s and sent one to the Shredder. He then orders Tatsu to obtain a sample of the T.G.R.I. mutagen that mutated the Turtles, as well as kidnap researcher Jordan Perry. Using the last mutagen and Perry's research, the Shredder creates his own mutants, [[Tokka and Rahzar]], from a stolen [[Alligator snapping turtle|snapping turtle]] and a brown [[wolf]] respectively. Though initially enraged at their infant-like intelligence, he soon plays it to his advantage by manipulating the mutants as they imprinted him as their surrogate parent.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to kill the Turtles in the junkyard using a captured Raphael, Shredder unleashed Tokka and Rahzar onto a city street to \"have fun\" and destroy it. The Foot spy then gave April a message for the Turtles: that the Shredder would turn the mutants loose on [[Central Park]] next if they did not accede to a rematch at the construction site. After the Turtles de-mutate the two mutants (with help from Perry) and defeat Tatsu in a nightclub, the Shredder appears and threatens to mutate an innocent woman with a small reserve mutagen vial (the canister was knocked away by the Turtles' new human ally, Keno). Before he can mutate her, he is stopped when the Turtles play a keytar at full volume, sending the Shredder flying through a window from the force of a blown speaker. When the Turtles follow him outside on a pier, they discover that the Shredder has used the mutagen vial on himself. He is transformed into a massive \"Super Shredder\", an almost mindless giant-mutant being with immense [[superhuman strength]]. During his fight with the Turtles, Super Shredder knocks down the pier's pilings in a mindless rage, which then collapses onto him with the Turtles falling into the water below. Though the Turtles survive, the Shredder meets his demise from getting crushed by the destroyed pieces of the pier.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III'' (1993) and ''TMNT'' (2007)===\nThe Shredder did not appear in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III|third film]] but is shown briefly at the beginning of the [[TMNT (film)|fourth film]] to help give the backstory of the Turtles, and his helmet that he wore in the 1990 film is visible on Splinter's shelf of mementos at the end of the movie. The possibility of his return is also strongly hinted at in the end of the film by Karai. However, the established storyline was abandoned in favor of the 2014 reboot.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (2014)===\n[[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] actor [[Tohoru Masamune]] portrayed the Shredder in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'|website=variety.com|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1201274733/|quote= Several years later, a crime wave is in full force in the city, led by a walking Cutco display called the Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) and his massive Foot Clan, though they've started to get their asses whupped by a stealthy troupe of martial-arts-savvy vigilantes.|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> Initially, [[William Fichtner]] was intended to portray a Caucasian version of the Shredder, with the anglicized real name of [[Eric Sacks]], instead of Oroku Saki.<ref>{{cite web|title='Crossing Lines': William Fichtner Reveals 'Sons Of Anarchy' Star Joining Show|url=http://huffpost.com/ca/entry/3478979|quote=What are you doing in \"Ninja Turtles\"?

After a [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|vigilante]] stops the Foot Clan, Shredder orders the Foot to take hostages down the subway in order to lure the vigilante out. Later in the film, Shredder's adopted son, Eric Sacks, informs Shredder that the vigilante is in fact four mutated Turtles who are test subjects of Project Renaissance, a science experiment of April O'Neil's late father. Sacks gives Shredder an armed suit and a helmet, the latter and the Foot Clan attack the Turtles' lair, where he defeats [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] and kidnaps three Turtles after Raphael was presumed dead. Sacks drains the Turtles' blood in order to create mutagen so that he can complete his and Shredder's plan: the latter will release a virus across the city and Sacks will sell the mutagen as a cure for the disease, making him even richer. As Shredder prepares to release the virus, the Turtles escape and confront him. Although he nearly defeats them, the Turtles were able to conquer Shredder with the help of April, which causes him to fall from the building on which he stood, but he survives and is shown to have a sample of the mutagen.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows'' (2016)===\n[[Brian Tee]] portrayed Shredder in the 2016 film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]''. In the beginning of the movie, the Foot Clan, led by a scientist named [[Baxter Stockman]], attempt to help Shredder escape from prison. Although the turtles try to prevent the escape, Stockman was able to help Shredder escape using a teleportation device. But Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and ends up in a place called [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]]. There, he meets [[Krang]], who gives Shredder a mutagen canister in exchange for a promise to find the three components of a machine that Krang sent to [[Earth]] long ago, which when united will open a portal to his dimension. Shredder returns to New York City and recruits two criminals named Bebop and Rocksteady and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them to powerful animal mutants- a warthog and rhinoceros. Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady find the components in a museum in New York and in a jungle in [[Brazil]]. Shredder and Stockman unite the components, creating a portal to Krang's dimension. Shredder betrays Stockman and has his men take him away, but upon entering the [[Technodrome]], Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.\n\n===''Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''===\nAndrew Kishino voices Shredder in the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] animated film, ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. In the film, Shredder allies his forces with [[Ra's al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]] to build a machine designed to transform [[Gotham City|Gotham]]'s citizens into unhinged mutants. In exchange for his assistance, Ra's promises Shredder access to one of his Lazarus Pits, which would grant him eternal life. When he and the Foot Clan try to steal a cloud seeder from [[Wayne Enterprises]], he ends up fighting Batman and barely comes out victorious after using an ancient technique. \n\nLater, he fights [[Batman]] once more when the Turtles and the Bat Family arrive at Ace Chemicals to stop him and Ra's from activating the machine. Though he gains the upper hand on the Dark Knight once again, he is thrown off when Batman says \"Cowabunga\" and gains assistance from Raphael. After Michaelangelo and Donatello destroy the machine, the debris sends him into a vat of chemicals as the plant explodes. In the post-credits scene, he is revealed to have survived the explosion and now strongly resembles [[the Joker]].\n\n==Video games==\nAs the original [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games|''TMNT'' video games]] are mostly based on the 1987 cartoon, Shredder is often based on his first cartoon incarnation. He usually executes some plan to provoke the Turtles into retaliating and defeat them; these include kidnapping April O'Neil and stealing the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Shredder is usually the last boss in the games.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[NES]], 1989): Shredder is the final boss. He is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He causes the Turtles to lose roughly half their energy if he touches them, and has a gun that can de-mutate them, which instantly kills them. He wears a red costume like in the Mirage comics.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[Arcade game|arcade]], 1989): Once again, Shredder is the final boss and is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He is armed with a sword, and has the ability to clone himself (the exact number of clones is one more than the number of Turtles attacking him in the arcade version). Shredder and his clones also have the ability to shoot lightning bolts from a device on the helmet, which de-mutate the Turtles they hit, killing them. When Shredder or one of his clones is close to death, his helmet falls off, a unique occurrence in the game series.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan]]'' (1990): This game was the first one not to feature Shredder as the final boss. Instead, Shredder is the boss of the penultimate stage, which is set in a river. It is also the first game in which Shredder does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles. His only attack is a sword swipe, but he can teleport if hit. The final boss is Krang.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Manhattan Missions]]'' (1991): In this [[PC game]], Shredder fights the turtles in his Manhattan hideout, decorated in a Japanese style. His appearance is based on the Mirage comic version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project]]'' (1992): This game is the first to feature both a battle against Shredder and a second one against a mutated Super Shredder. The first battle takes place at the end of the Technodrome level, which is the sixth of the eight levels of the game. In this battle, Shredder uses a sword to attack the Turtles. Shredder later returns as the final boss of the game, on the stage set in Krang's spacecraft. This time, he mutates himself into Super Shredder, much as he did in the second movie which had been released earlier the same year (1991). Super Shredder has two superpowers, the ability to call down lightning, and the ability to shoot fireballs. These fireballs can de-mutate the Turtles, but unlike other games, this is not an instant kill.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers]]'' (1991): A sequel to ''Fall of the Foot Clan'', this game also features Shredder as a regular level boss and Krang as the final boss. He does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles, but he does have a wider variety of attacks than in the previous [[Game Boy]] game. Shredder returns later in his mutated Super Shredder form, as a sub-level boss of the final Technodrome level. However, in this incarnation, his only super-power is the ability to teleport elsewhere on the screen. He attacks the Turtles using a sword.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]'' (1991): Shredder is again the final boss of the game, and found in the Technodrome. However, this time, he is not preceded by a Technodrome level. Instead, the Turtles fight through a Starbase level in the future (2100 AD) with Krang as boss, then teleport to the Technodrome in the present (1991 in the arcade game and 1992 in the [[SNES]] version) for the final confrontation. Shredder attacks with a sword, and can fire energy attacks. In the SNES port of the game, Shredder begins the battle by mutating himself into Super Shredder, and has the added superpowers of super-speed movement, fire ground attacks, ice air attacks, and a de-mutating fire ball which costs a turtle a life. The SNES port also added a Technodrome level earlier in the game, which leads to a battle with a regular Shredder. In this battle, Shredder is in a kind of battletank, armed with a machine gun and claws. The player views the action over Shredder's shoulder inside the tank, and the only way to cause damage is to hurl the never-ending waves of Foot Soldiers toward the screen and into the tank.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist]]'' (1992): This game uses a Super Shredder similar to the one in ''Turtles in Time''. His attacks are roughly the same.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue]]'' (1993): Unlike its two predecessors, ''Fall of the Foot Clan'' and ''Back from the Sewers'', this game does feature Shredder as the final boss. However, this time Shredder has become Cyber Shredder, half-man and half-machine. This form of Shredder possessed deadly kick moves and energy ball attacks, as well as being the only boss in the game with two life meters, as the meter instantly refills after it is drained the first time.\n\n[[File:Shredder villain SNES.gif|thumb|Shredder in the SNES version of ''Tournament Fighters'']]\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters]]'' (1993): This is the first game in which Shredder is not a boss but instead a regular playable character. Furthermore, his costume is based on the Mirage comics version. Finally, in the SNES incarnation of this game, he appears under the name Cyber-Shredder, but there is no indication that he has become a cybernetic being as in ''Radical Rescue''.\n\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, a new series of ''TMNT'' games was initiated. These new games are based on the 2003 cartoon series, and likewise, Shredder in the games is the same as in the cartoon.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2003): Shredder appears as the final boss. The Turtles face him on the helicarrier at the top of the Foot Helicarriers; he wields the Sword of Tengu in this fight. Shredder's combo attacks are quick and nearly continuous. When half of his health bar has been depleted, his attacks become much faster. There is also a secret final boss in which the player faces Shredder as Oroku Saki. His combos are much quicker and deadlier, and he also has a temporary powered-up state.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus]]'' (2004): The game begins a short while before the end of the previous game, and Shredder is encountered by the Turtles in the second stage of the game; however, he is not fought by the player, only in a cutscene. As in the cartoon, Shredder is defeated, but he survives the assault on his headquarters. Shredder resurfaces in the TCRI building later on, but once again, the player does not directly fight him; the main goal of the mission being to evacuate the Utroms back to their home planet. He is seemingly killed in the destruction of the TCRI building, but he once again survives. In a sub-plot exclusive to the game, he is detailed as being a mass murderer of Utroms on their homeworld, and he gave Utrom mercenary Slashurr a permanent scar. He later wiped Slashurr's memory, and employed him to kill the Turtles. However, Slashurr eventually remembers his past, and with the Turtles, battles Shredder and the Foot on his ship. The Turtles eventually defeat Shredder once again. In the Battle Nexus fighting tournament mode, Shredder appears as the final boss of the Foot Fight tournament, though the nature of these tournaments when it comes to the game's canon is questionable.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee]]'' (2005): Shredder appeared as a playable character and opponent in three forms\u2014his standard armor, without the armor (as Oroku Saki), and a golden \"Mega\" Shredder.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare]]'' (2005) The third chapter of the game, \"Exodus\", deals directly with the Turtles thwarting the Foot's efforts. As in the third-season finale, the Turtles and Splinter battle the Foot at their headquarters, and follow the Shredder aboard his starship. They nearly sacrifice themselves to kill Shredder as well, but the Utroms rescue them, and exile Shredder to a distant ice asteroid forever. Shredder is also encountered in the dark future as one of the final bosses of the Nightmare chapter of the game.\n*''[[TMNT (video game)|TMNT]]'' (2007): In the console versions of the 2007 movie-based game, Shredder appears as a boss in a flashback-within-a-flashback (as the events of the game are told to Splinter after their occurrence). The armor of Shredder in this game is based on the 2003 cartoon series version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up|TMNT: Smash Up]]'' (2009): Shredder is a playable character in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Wii]] fighting game. He appears in both his Utrom Shredder and Cyber Shredder forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/dor/objects/14305526/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up-20090819101955472.html |title=IGN: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up Screenshots (Wii) 2966717 |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'' (2013): Shredder appears as both the penultimate and final boss of the game. He recruits Baxter Stockman to build a new helmet for him using stolen Krang technology, which gives him [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers, including the ability to fly. Shredder is first fought in his lair when the Turtles come to save April and learn about his scheme. After escaping, he is fought again in the Krangs's secret undergroung facility, this time donning his new helmet built by Stockman. He is ultimately defeated by the Turtles, who destroy his helmet, leaving him to swear revenge.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2014): The [[Nintendo 3DS]] game based on the 2014 film, Shredder, who is actually Eric Sacks, appears as the final boss. However, after defeating him, it is revealed that it was all an illusion created by Baxter Stockman, to allow the real Shredder to escape.\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn the anime adaptation ''[[Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen]]'', the backstory from the original cartoon was preserved. Unlike the rest of the main cast, Shredder's appearance was changed to match the ''Supermutants'' Shredder toy that was being sold at that time. The manga explained this by saying his original outfit was destroyed in a battle with the Turtles and Krang created the new armor for him. Shredder also gains the ability to transform into the dragon Devil Shredder using the Mutanite crystals he stole from the Neutrinos. With the energy from the evil [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] Dark Mu, he was later able to transform into the gigantic Dark Devil Shredder. In the second volume of the anime he gets his Tiger Spirit ''Metal Mutant'' armor. He was voiced by [[Kiyoyuki Yanada]].\n\nShredder also made a guest appearance in an episode of the hit YouTube show ''[[Death Battle]]''. In the episode, his weapons and abilities were analyzed against ''[[X-Men]]'' villain [[Silver Samurai]]. In the end, Shredder proved himself the better fighter and beat his opponent.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051018042755/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/html/profile7.htm The Shredder profile on the official ''TMNT'' website]\n\n{{Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional code names]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional dictators]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional Ninjutsu practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional warlords]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Television supervillains]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts trainers]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassinated people]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional kidnappers]]\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional terrorists]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people]]\n[[Category:Psychopathy in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional villain in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise}}\n{{italic title|noerror|string=Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|all=yes}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProjectComics-->\n|image= TMNTShredderComic.jpg\n|caption= Shredder in the first TMNT comic\n|character_name= Shredder\n|publisher= [[Mirage Studios]]<ref name=\"nytimes\">{{cite news|title= Just How Powerful Are Those Turtles?|work= The New York Times|date=15 April 1990|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/15/movies/just-how-powerful-are-those-turtles.html|accessdate=7 August 2010 | first1=Harvey R. | last1=Greenberg}}</ref> [[Image Comics]]<br> [[Archie Comics]]<br>[[IDW Publishing]]\n|debut= ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios) |Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' #1<br/>(May 1984)\n|creators= [[Kevin Eastman]]<br/>[[Peter Laird]]\n|voiced_by = [[James Avery]]<br>[[William E.

This shogun appears in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]] [[Comic book|comics]] and all of its related media.<ref name=\"nytimes\"/> In every incarnation of the ''TMNT'' franchise, he is depicted as the leader of the criminal organization known as the [[Foot Clan]], and serves as the [[main antagonist]] and [[archenemy]] of the Turtles and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]].\n\nIn 2009, The Shredder was ranked as [[IGN]]'s 39th-greatest comic book villain of all time.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Design==\nShredder's physical appearance remains fairly consistent in most incarnations of the character. Saki is a muscular Japanese man, most frequently seen in \"the Shredder\" persona, wearing a suit of armor vaguely based on that of a [[samurai]], sometimes with a cape. The armor consists of blade-covered metal plaques on his shoulders, forearms, hands (sometimes just his left hand, because he is left-handed), and shins; he wears a purple, gray, blue, or red robe that variously appears to be simple fabric or a form of [[chain mail]]. He also tends to wear a metal [[kabuto|helmet]] with a trident-shaped ornament on top, and a metal ninja style mask which covers his face, leaving only his eyes visible. In the 2003 TMNT series, the Shredder is a red alien Utrom named Ch'rell, who utilized an indestructible exo-suit to disguise himself as a human named Oroku Saki.\n\n[[Kevin Eastman]] got the idea for Shredder's armor from large trapezoidal cheese [[grater]]s which he envisioned on a villainous character's<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listverse.com/2014/08/16/10-strangest-facts-about-the-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/|title=10 Strangest Facts About The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|publisher=Listverse|language=English|author=Chris Jenkins|date=16 August 2014|accessdate=21 January 2017}}</ref> (originally named \"The Grater\" or \"Grate Man\") arms.

Yes, he was an important part of their history, and they probably would not have come into existence without his involvement in their world (or more accurately Splinter's world)... but that's about it.

He quickly became one of their deadliest warriors and rose up the ranks and was chosen to lead the Foot's American branch. Operating in New York under the name of The Shredder, Saki used the opportunity to avenge his brother by killing Yoshi and Shen. Under Saki's leadership, the Foot participated in variety of criminal activities, including [[drug smuggling]], [[Arms trafficking|arms running]], and assassination.\n\nThirteen years later Saki was challenged by the Ninja Turtles, who were the result of an accident exposing four ordinary turtles to radioactive waste. They were trained by Yoshi's pet rat Splinter, who had also been mutated by the same substance, to avenge his former master. After a lengthy rooftop battle where Saki seemed to be winning, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] managed to plunge his sword through Saki's torso. Defeated, he was offered the opportunity to commit [[seppuku]] (ritual suicide), but Shredder refused and detonated a [[thermite]] grenade, in an attempt to take their lives as well along his. But at the last second, [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] used his [[B\u014d|bo]] to knock Shredder off the building to his death.\n\nHowever, it was not yet the end of the Shredder. He returned on Christmas Eve seemingly resurrected with an army of Foot Ninjas severely beating Leonardo and burning down the apartment of the turtles' ally [[April O'Neil]], forcing them to go into hiding outside the city. A year later, in the story \"Return to New York\", the Turtles returned to settle the score with the Shredder. Leonardo faced off against Oroku Saki alone, during which Saki revealed he was brought back to life by a technique using worms feeding on his body and recreating his cells to reform his body. In the battle, Leonardo [[decapitate]]s the villain, finally killing him, and the four turtles burn his body at the [[Hudson River]]. In the Zulli's trilogy in issues 31, 35, and 36, Shredder attacks the turtles and Splinter before being defeated. Shredder also appears in the dream of Donatello in Volume 4 where he is shown fighting him.\n\nOroku Saki appears briefly in the image comics issue 3 of TMNT and the female ninja Pimiko from the comic book series' Volume 3<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicvine.com/pimiko/29-49933/ |title=Pimiko (comic book character) |publisher=Comicvine.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref> claims to be Shredder's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miragelicensing.com/comics/image/05/05.html |title=Image Comics' TMNT \"Volume 3\" #5 |publisher=Miragelicensing.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Tales of the TMNT'' ====\nIn the second volume of the anthology series ''[[Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' story \"Worms of Madness\" it is shown that a few weeks after the events of their final battle the Shredder had yet another resurrection of sorts when a Foot mystic reactivated the worms; however, the mystic did not resurrect Saki himself but the worm colony which had gained sentience and retained Saki's memories and believing itself to be Saki. The worms then went out to find a new body and chose that of a shark. After the Foot Kidnapped Splinter, the turtles managed to engage the \"Shredder-Shark\" in battle and defeating it by severing its connection to the mystic and the creature realizing that it was not the real Saki.\n\nThe \"Shredder-Shark\" returned once more kidnapping Casey's adopted daughter Shadow to lure the Turtles into a trap. With the Turtles away, it was up to Casey and Splinter to defeat it and rescue Shadow, finally killing the creature.\n\n====Other versions of the Shredder====\nThroughout a considerable part of the Image comic series, [[Raphael (TMNT)|Raphael]] tries to impersonate Shredder by wearing his armor. Following this, he is accepted as the leader of the Foot Clan. In later issues of the series, a mysterious '''Lady Shredder''' appears to challenge Raphael. Although the book was canceled before her identity could be revealed, writer [[Gary Carlson]] confirmed after the fact that she was meant to be [[Karai (character)|Karai]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\nIn Volume Four series, [[Leonardo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Leonardo]] encounters '''Oroku Yoshi''', a Battle Nexus contestant wearing armor almost identical to that of the second animated series' Shredder. His connection to Oroku Saki and the Foot is not known, since the bi-monthly comic was ultimately cancelled in 2010. In issue 32 he was called to meet a mysterious individual who asks to bring Leo with him as well.\n\nAnother Version called Doctor Shreddarius also appears in a reality where the turtles are superheroes.\n\n===Archie Comics===\nThe [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Archie Comics)|Archie Comics' series]] use the same background as the 1987 cartoon, as the first issues are identical. Later in the Archie comics, Shredder travels to the future and works with Armaggon and Verminator X to offset the skill and experience of the future versions of the Turtles.\n\nThis version of the character was more in line with the early episodes' depiction of the character as a cunning adversary and in many issues nearly proves to be a lethal enemy, coming close to defeating the turtles on a number of occasions, and even aids Armaggon and Verminator X in the defeat and capture of two of the turtles in the future. His final fate within the Archie comics series remains unknown, though a three-part mini-series put out by Archie comics after the end of their regular comic series seems to indicate he remains a consistent foe to the turtles for many years, briefly restoring Splinter to the form of Hamato Yoshi and also undoing Michaelangelo's mutation, though both later revert to mutant status by the end of the story, while Shredder was left in a vegetative state in the aftermath of his final battle with the Turtles.\n\n===IDW Publishing===\nIn feudal Japan, Oroku Saki was a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan along with Hamato Yoshi.

After the Turtles rescue Leonardo, Shredder calls a meeting with Krang and proposes an alliance in exchange for Utrom technologies, which Krang rejects. A short battle results in retreat on both sides and the revelation that Shredder had stolen some Utrom resources from Krang's compound to begin creating a mutant army (in the form of Bebop, Rocksteady, Koya and Bludgeon).<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nIn Issue #50, Shredder faced Splinter and the turtles in a final battle which he lost and briefly admitted his faults and also making Karai the new head of the Foot Clan. He was then killed by Splinter by having his sword slashed into the back of his head, killing him instantly.\nAfter his death Shredder's body is kept in a crypt that is guarded by Jennika who was assigned by Hamato Yoshi in order to learn humility. Shredder's tomb is eventually desecrated by the witch Kitsune who plans to revive Oroku Saki in order to restore order to the Foot Clan but Splinter knew this and keeps the skull to foil her attempts. \n\nShredder will appear in the upcoming miniseries ''Shredder in Hell''. In the mini series Shredder is in the afterlife and descends into the underworld trying to find the truth of his own soul meanwhile Kitsune uses his corpse to summon her father as his host. Shredder also fought his past life Takeshi Tasuo in his inner conflict until Splinter/Hamato Yoshi later shows up to help him against the forces of Hell.\n\n==Television==\n===1987 animated series===\n[[File:TMNT1987 Shredder.png|thumb|Shredder in the 1987 animated series]]\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated series]], Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were both members of the Foot Clan in Japan. After Saki framed him for the attempted murder of a visiting [[sensei]], Yoshi was forced to [[exile]] himself to [[New York City]], where he lived in the sewers with four pet turtles that were accidentally dropped down a storm drain.\n\nIn the following years, Saki took leadership of the Foot Clan, and took on his Shredder persona. He also met a trans-dimensional alien called [[Krang]], and used the advanced technology at his disposal to replace the Foot Ninja with robots called the Foot Soldiers. He secretly moved to New York, where he found Yoshi still alive. In an attempt to kill his old foe, Shredder dumped mutagen in the sewers. This mutates Yoshi into Splinter, and he starts training the also mutated Turtles in [[ninjutsu]].\n\nShredder was voiced by [[James Avery]] for seasons one to seven and [[William E. Martin]] for seasons eight and ten, with the alternates being [[Dorian Harewood]] and [[Pat Fraley]] in 1989, [[Jim Cummings]] in 1991\u20131993 and [[Townsend Coleman]] in 1993. In the 2009 crossover movie ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', this incarnation of the Shredder was voiced by Load Williams. In the 2012 series, the 1987 version of the Shredder is voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\n====Depiction====\nIn his early appearances, Shredder was presented as extremely cunning and was described by Splinter himself as the most dangerous adversary he ever faced. Shredder's intelligence persevered throughout his various portrayals, and in several instances it is claimed that Shredder has an IQ of 300. As the 1987 cartoon series was more light-hearted than the comics, Shredder was later depicted as an evil but a villain that always fails rather than the dire and lethal ninja he was originally shown to be. He and Krang are constantly bickering about tactics and often take pleasure in the other's failings (and sometimes intentionally sabotage each other). His two henchmen [[Bebop and Rocksteady]] are especially incompetent and fail miserably at everything they do. They were mostly used for [[comic relief]] in the show; however, the Turtles certainly consider them to be formidable (despite their inane stupidity) in combat due to their great strength and endurance, and as such, often use their intelligence to outwit them.\n\nDespite Shredder's failings, he is still shown to have considerable skills. In martial arts, he is often shown to surpass the Turtles and to be equaled only by Splinter. Nevertheless, he usually runs away from a fight when outnumbered, incapacitating the Turtles to defeat them in combat; as the series progressed, however, the Turtles were able to battle him on more equal grounds and even defeat him in combat on several occasions. He trained the Punk Frogs in a very short period of time to be a match for the Turtles, but the Punk Frogs soon switch sides. His technical skills are also quite impressive: he designed and built a robotic body for Krang, prepared the mutagen mixture, knew how Krang's teleportation engine worked, and built numerous other advanced devices. Ironically in one episode \"Shredderville\" the Turtles dream they find themselves in a [[parallel universe (fiction)|mirror universe]] where the TMNT ''never existed'' and Shredder rules New York City, yet finds the task of ruling so burdensome that he has a nervous breakdown.\n\nFrom mid season seven onwards, Shredder was depicted as a more serious threat, full of anger and bloodlust, though he was still easily defeated by the Turtles. His friendship with Krang also appeared to have grown. There were many times that Shredder could have just left Krang at the mercy of the Turtles or Lord Dregg, but he always rescued him, and went as far as to donate his life energy to save him.\n\n====Family====\nShredder's family is presented in three episodes. In the episode \"Shredder's Mom\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 70! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605021820/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart070.htm |archivedate=2011-06-05 }}</ref> Shredder's mother Miyoko helps Shredder and Krang in an attempt to destroy the world's climate. In this episode, Miyoko first learns of her son's criminal activities, and proves herself to be as villainous. However, she constantly treats Shredder like a baby, until he gets fed up with it and transports her back to her retirement home. In the episode \"My Brother, the Bad Guy\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 108! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210071625/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart108.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 }}</ref> it is revealed that Oroku Saki has a younger brother, Kazuo who works as a police lieutenant in [[Tokyo]]. Kazuo and the Turtles try to join forces to stop one of Shredder's plans, but his fervent respect of the law clashes with the Turtles' \"whatever it takes\" attitude. Finally, the episode \"The Legend of Koji\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 159! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204035507/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart159.htm |archivedate=2012-02-04 }}</ref> features Saki's distant ancestor Oroku Sancho, who lived in Japan in 1583. He is the leader of a small clan, and every bit as wicked as his descendant. When Shredder offers to help him find magical relics that would provide him with power and wealth, Sancho takes Shredder's information, then betrays him and orders his men to kill him. However, Sancho is also a coward, and when he breaks down in the face of danger, his men abandon him.\n\nThis family tree leads to a bit of confusion regarding whether Shredder's given name is Oroku and his last name Saki (as indicated by the fact his brother shares the name Saki), or the other way around (as indicated by the fact his ancestor's last name is Oroku). This question is never resolved on the show, although Mirage comics adds more evidence for Oroku being the family name; Saki's brother is \"Oroku Nagi\". This follows Japanese naming conventions, which place the family name before an individual's given name.\n\n====Timeline====\nCounting from the first meeting with the Turtles, Shredder spent eight seasons plotting ways to defeat them. In the season 8 episode \"Turtle Trek\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart178.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 178! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210071629/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart178.htm |archivedate=2012-02-10 }}</ref> the Turtles destroy the engines of the [[Technodrome]], trapping it and its inhabitants in [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]] for good and putting an end to Shredder's plans. He spent the next two seasons in Dimension X, until he was contacted by Dregg (\"The Power of Three\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart189.htm |title=TMNT Cartoon Episode 189! |publisher=Ninjaturtles.com |accessdate=2014-05-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120608222405/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/cartoon/guide/cart189.htm |archivedate=2012-06-08 }}</ref> Dregg arranged for him and Krang to come back to Earth, to help him fight the Turtles. Together, they capture the Turtles, but Dregg then betrays them and tries to drain the life energy of the Turtles, Krang, and Shredder all at once, making them weaker while Dregg becomes stronger.

Shredder is nowhere to be seen, but it is assumed that he is still somewhere in Dimension X.\n\nHe and Krang also appear in ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', with the Technodrome still under New York City before being sent into the 2003 universe. However, Shredder and Krang's incompetence (as well as their relative sanity) is fully shown when the Utrom Shredder of the 2003 universe seizes command of the Technodrome and adds Utrom technology to the powerful war machine, and turns it against the world. In the climax, Shredder temporarily overcomes his hatred for the Turtles as both he and Krang decide to help the Turtles defeat the Utrom Shredder who they realise is totally insane, will kill everyone and has effectively stolen the Technodrome from them. Shredder also takes extreme offense at being considered inferior by his other dimensional counterpart, doesn't see the point of destroying the entire universe and doesn't understand why the Utrom Shredder won't just kill the Turtles when he had the chance. So, with Krang, he chooses to fight alongside the Turtles against their common foe.\n\n===''The Next Mutation''===\nIn ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', Shredder (portrayed by Patrick Pon, voiced by [[Doug Parker (voice actor)|Doug Parker]]) is still the Turtles' sworn enemy. This time, however, Venus uses her powers to make the Oroku Saki from within take control of Shredder's mind. After the Foot Clan disbands, he ends up living on the streets. Later, the Dragon Lord's rank warriors attack him to get a medallion that was in his possession. Splinter saves him and takes him to the Turtles' lair to protect him. It was hinted that Shredder might possibly go back to his old ways, but the show was canceled soon after that episode.\n\nIn the show, Shredder wore a general attire similar to the one he wore in the second film, but with a heavily altered helmet/mask due to the lesser budget for the TV series as compared to the movies, which had allowed for more detailed props and costume pieces. Shredder appeared only a few times in the show, due to the primary villain of the series being a draconic being from another dimension and thus supplanted Shredder as the Turtles' nemesis.\n\n===2003 animated series===\nNumerous individuals have assumed the \"'''Shredder'''\" mantle in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series)|2003 animated series]], all of whom, except for Karai, are voiced by [[Scott Rayow|Scottie Ray]]. In the episode \"Tempus Fugit\", a possible future is shown in which the Utrom Shredder, Tengu Shredder, and Cyber Shredder are engaged in a war for control of New York City.\n\n====Utrom Shredder====\n[[File:TMNTCh'rell.png|thumb|The Shredder's armor is penetrated, revealing his true Utrom form]]\nThe Utrom Shredder is the main antagonist and primary Shredder of the series. He is the archenemy of the Turtles and Splinter, and indirectly had a hand in their creation. Utrom Shredder serves as the main antagonist of the first three seasons of the show as well as the finale film Turtles Forever. His digital copy also serves as the antagonist of the seventh and final season.\n\nAfter causing the deaths of millions across the universe, the psychopathic alien warlord Ch'rell (whose aliases include Torrinon, Kako Naso, and Duke Acureds) was captured by his fellow Utrom and being transported back to his home world to answer for his crimes. However, Ch'rell managed to escape captivity and sabotaged the Utrom ship, causing it to crash-land on Earth during the Sengoku period of feudal Japan. Stranded on the then-primitive planet, the Utrom were forced to wait for centuries until human technology advanced enough for them to develop a teleportation device and return home. They thus developed humanoid exo-suits to hide amongst the humans, and Ch'rell stole the first working prototype and used the Japanese legend of a Demon Tengu to craft a dual identity, becoming a wealthy Japanese philanthropist named Oroku Saki while secretly operating as the crime lord known as the Shredder. Saki soon founded the Foot Clan, which grew into a massive underground criminal empire by the 20th century. He eventually adopts an abandoned girl named [[Karai (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Karai]], whom he personally trained in the arts of ninjutsu to lead the Foot Clan in Japan while he operated in New York City. In New York, the Shredder captures Hamato Yoshi, one of the Utroms' foremost guardians, and kills him after he refuses to reveal their location. Yoshi's pet rat [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] witnesses his murder and escapes, winding up in the city's sewers where he and four baby turtles are accidentally exposed to a mutagenic ooze created by the Utroms, transforming them into sentient humanoid lifeforms.\n\nIn the first season set over a decade later, the Turtles begin encountering the Foot Clan and unknowingly foiling several of the Shredder's operations. Oroku Saki becomes intrigued with the Turtles, wanting to meet them and hoping to bring them to his side. One day, he invites [[Leonardo]] to his home and offers him to join the Foot. The Turtles consult their master Splinter, who reveals his true nature by telling them of Master Yoshi's murder. The Shredder eventually becomes the greatest enemy of the Turtles when they decline his offer. During their first engagement, the Shredder proves himself to be more skilled than the Turtles, compelling them to flee and hide. While Shredder and his Foot Ninja search for the Turtles, Splinter finds and regroups them, and plans a counterattack. In a subsequent battle on the rooftops, the Shredder outmatches the Turtles again, but Splinter tricks him into cutting the support for a water tower, which is kicked onto him. The water sweeps Shredder off the building, and the tower collapses to the ground, crushing him. But a few scenes later, Shredder's hand is shown to emerge from the wreckage of the water tower.\n\nSplinter and the Turtles were unaware of the Shredder's survival until months later, on one day when Leonardo goes on an outdoor morning training exercise, only to be ambushed by the Foot Clan. The Shredder's four Elite Guard beat Leonardo close to death and send him flying into a window of [[April O'Neil]]'s antique shop apartment, where the Turtles were staying after Foot Ninjas had marauded their sewer home while they were away. Soon afterwards, the Shredder leads an assault on April's shop. Overpowered and outnumbered, the Turtles, Splinter, April and [[Casey Jones (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Casey Jones]] are forced to run off into retreat in a walk-in cooler. The Shredder then bars the door, drops a firebomb and punctures a gas pipe with his gauntlets. Fortunately, April remembers that the motor used to power the cooler was removed, leaving a hole in the exterior wall that leads outside. As a result, the Turtles and their allies are able to evacuate the building before it burns down. They retreat to Casey's grandmother's farmhouse in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], where they would spend the next three months recuperating.\n\nDuring this time, they are presumed dead by the Foot, but Oroku Saki sends the clan's mad scientist [[Baxter Stockman]] the task of confirming their deaths. Although Stockman finds no proof that the Turtles died, he creates false evidence to convince the Shredder and succeeds in doing so. When Leonardo is completely healed from his injuries, the Turtles and Splinter return to New York to face the Shredder once more. They launch a surprise assault on the Foot headquarters, fighting their way through Shredder's minions and eventually reaching his throne. By the end of the battle, an epic standoff between Leonardo and the Shredder occurs. Armed with the Sword of Tengu, the former decapitates the latter when they strike each other in one final clash. Not knowing that the Shredder is an Utrom, the Turtles believe him to be finally killed for good. After they leave, the Shredder is seen to be getting up and walking away carrying his severed head.\n\nIn the second season, Ch'rell seeks to exact revenge on his species. He and his henchmen infiltrate the TCRI facility, where the Utroms' base is located, and coincidentally encounter the Turtles and Master Splinter. When the Shredder is zapped into unconsciousness, a time bomb slips out of his hands, set to detonate in ten minutes. The Turtles help the Utroms escape using the Transmat, a teleportation device, which [[Donatello (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Donatello]] activates. After the Utroms teleport back to their homeworld, the Shredder awakens and attacks the Turtles. In the ensuing fight, the Turtles use their weapons to penetrate his armor, which is then electrocuted by Donatello, disabling it. Afterwards, the Shredder reveals his Utrom form to the Turtles, intent on taking down his enemies with him. But at the last few seconds, Donatello manages to power up the Transmat, through which he, his brothers and Splinter escape before the TCRI building implodes with Ch'rell inside of it.\n\nWith his supposed demise, the Foot Clan (led by the Elite Guard), the Purple Dragons and the New York Mafia clash with each other for control of New York City. Unknown to them, the Shredder had survived once more and was retrieved by his daughter Karai, now being placed in a stasis tube and healed by worms inside a secret medical facility of the Foot headquarters. During his recuperation, Karai assumes leadership of the Foot Clan and makes peace with the Turtles after they help her end the turf war. But once the Shredder is fully recovered, he vows vengeance and breaks off the truce, leaving Karai to question her loyalty. By this point, Baxter Stockman had created the Foot Mechs, mainly in the form of armed ninja robots, but also versions of the U.S. President, the English Prime Minister and Splinter. His plans were again thwarted by the Turtles, when his barge hideout is located by them, Splinter, and their unlikely ally, the delusional Triceraton Zog, leading to another confrontation with the Foot. Aboard the freighter, Donatello programs a bomb set to go off in 30 minutes. The Shredder is defeated again when Zog sacrifices his life by keeping him on his ship when it sinks due to the explosion, but Karai rescues him on a helicopter.\n\nIn the third season, the Triceratons launch an invasion on Earth. In the aftermath of the invasion, New York City is in ruins. In his persona as Oroku Saki, the Shredder uses his fortune to repair the damage and gains favor of its citizens. Secretly, his real purpose of reconstruction was to salvage the remnants of Triceraton technology in order to construct a large starship to return to the stars, and thereby retaliating against the Utrom. He even enlists a young scientist named Dr. Chaplin to help out. The craft is eventually completed, but Ch'rell's plan suffers several complications, courtesy of the Turtles and the Earth Protection Force (led by Agent Bishop). Despite sustaining heavy damage, the ship is launched into orbit, albeit with the Turtles and Splinter on board. When Karai notes that they left their forces on Earth, Ch'rell states that he has allies on other worlds that can help him. Entering a four-armed Shredder exo-suit, Ch'rell easily defeats them all, prompting the Turtles and Splinter to attempt to sacrifice themselves and blow the ship up in a final attempt to stop the Shredder. Luckily, as the starship explodes, Mortu and the Utrom arrive, having placed a stasis field around the entire ship, freezing time, and teleport all its inhabitants to safety. While the Turtles and Splinter are teleported to sick bay and Professor Honeycutt is taken to one of their labs to be placed in a new robot body, Ch'rell, Karai, and Dr. Chaplin are teleported to the brig. On the Utrom homeworld, Ch'rell is placed on trial before the Utrom High Council that is watched by the Turtles, Splinter, and Professor Honeycutt. The Utrom High Council start by mentioning a testimony from Dolphette that Ch'rell willingly launched an attack on the planet Enethone where over 1 million innocent inhabitants perished. Then they bring up Wan-ran Otho's testimony where Ch'rell incited and funded a civil war on the planet Eno II in an effort to mine their raw minerals without restriction. 3,200,000 lives perished. The Utrom High Council then concludes that Ch'rell tried various attempts to take over the Utrom government through an illegal and violent coup. The Utrom High Council found Ch'rell guilty for the chaos and destruction he brought across the universe, and ultimately sentence him to eternal exile on the desolate ice asteroid Mor Gal Tal. Mortu states to everyone present that Karai and Dr. Chaplin will be returned to Earth and handed over to the authorities.\n\nIn the finale film ''[[Turtles Forever]]'', Ch'rell is freed from his exile by his Shredder counterpart from the 1987 series after his frozen body was teleported off of Mor Gal Tal by 1980s Shredder and Krang. Once Karai showed up upon finding out about Ch'rell's return, Ch'rell then takes over the Technodrome and gains a new, more powerful exo-suit. After realigning with a now-mutated Hun, Ch'rell reverse-engineers the mutagen that Hun got to turn a select number of Cyber Foot into Mutant Foot Soldiers and create new Foot Robots that are stronger than the '80s versions. The Ch'rell later uses the Technodrome to view alternate dimensions, realizing that there is an entire multiverse of Ninja Turtles. Locating the Turtles' source planet, Turtle Prime, Ch'rell vows to eliminate every Ninja Turtle in existence by destroying this dimension. The Mirage Turtles, the 1987 Turtles, and the 2003 Turtles team up to defeat Ch'rell, though Karai and Splinter agree that the Shredder will return again as he always does.\n\nIn \"Same As It Never Was\", Donatello is transported to an alternate future in which the Shredder has succeeded in subjugating Earth. By then, Splinter had died protecting his sons and Casey Jones died fighting the Foot Clan. Ch'rell also severed [[Michelangelo (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Michelangelo]]'s left arm and [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Raphael]]'s left eye. When Donatello leads a final rebellion against the Shredder's fortress, his Foot forces kill Michelangelo while Karai kills Leonardo and Raphael. April avenges Leonardo and Raphael by using a rocket launcher on Karai, and the Shredder is killed by Donatello with the Tuneller.\n\nIn \"Timing is Everything\", Leonardo and Cody Jones are accidentally sent back in time to the aftermath of the Turtles' first battle with the Shredder. Later, the Shredder and several Foot ninjas are transported to 2105 but are easily defeated by the Turtles' futuristic technology.\n\n====Tengu Shredder====\nThe '''Tengu Shredder''' or the '''Demon Shredder''' serves as the main antagonist of the fifth season. The first Shredder was a Demon Tengu that rose from a hellish pit and terrorized ancient Japan. When on the verge of death, it entered and possessed a human named Oroku Saki, one of Japan's most skilled warriors, but he was eventually defeated by the power of the Ninja Tribunal. His body, helmet, and gauntlet were separated and sealed away to prevent his return. In the 21st century, the Tengu Shredder's five Foot Mystic heralds attempt to resurrect him, forcing the Ninja Tribunal to recruit the Turtles and four human warriors as their Acolytes to defeat. After the Tengu Shredder rises from the dead and conquers New York City, the Turtles recruit Karai's Foot Clan, the Justice Force, the Earth Protection Force, and the Purple Dragons to defeat him. The Tengu Shredder is weakened when Karai drains his power via a mystic link (which connects all who take the mantle of the Shredder), and he is finally destroyed when the Turtles combine their Dragon avatars to summon the spirit of Hamato Yoshi to deliver the final blow.\n\n====Cyber Shredder====\nThe '''Cyber Shredder''' appears as the main antagonist of the seventh and final season, ''Back to the Sewer''. It is revealed that prior to Ch'rell's exile, he created a digital copy of himself in the event that anything happened to his corporeal form and stored this double in a Foot data vault deep within the Internet. This vault's consciousness is later released when the futuristic Viral attempts to access it, giving rise to the Cyber Shredder. While he is initially confined to cyberspace, the Cyber Shredder ultimately manages to escape and become a physical being. During the final episode, the Cyber Shredder leads the Foot Clan to attack April O'Neil and Casey Jones's wedding, and is finally defeated when the Turtles erased him with a de-compiler previously used against Viral.\n\n====Karai====\n'''Karai''' is the adopted daughter of Oroku Saki (Ch'rell), who takes the mantle of the Shredder after her father's exile. After some lesser battles, she doffs the mantle and begins a non-hostile relationship with the Turtles, particularly towards Leonardo.\n\n===2012 animated series===\nThe Shredder appears as the main antagonist of the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series)|2012 animated series]], voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]].\n\nHis Japanese origins as Oroku Saki and brotherly relationship with Hamato Yoshi is mostly intact, with the Foot Clan and the Hamato Clan being later revealed as having a long-term rivalry before the Hamato family killed the Oroku family, wiped out their entire clan (starting with the destruction of the Foot Clan monastery) and took in the orphaned Saki as their own. Despite being raised as brothers, both Saki and Yoshi eventually became rivals due to the love of Tang Shen, whose decision to marry Yoshi drove Saki to discover his true heritage and turn on his former brother, eventually destroying everything Yoshi held dear, including the lovely Tang Shen (whom he had killed by accident) and the entire Hamato Clan (starting with the destruction of the Hamato Clan monastery, which resulted with Saki's head getting burned scarred and hairless). Blaming Tang Shen's untimely death on Yoshi, Saki returned to his biological family and became the new leader of the newly restored Foot Clan, tutoring ninjutsu students such as world-famous martial artist [[Tokka and Rahzar|Chris Bradford]] and Brazilian street thug Xever Montes, sharing criminal business with business partners such as Russian arms dealer [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Ivan Steranko]], Sicilian mob boss Don Visiozo, and Purple Dragons leader Hun. In addition, he also a pet [[Akita (dog)|akita]] named Hachiko (named after the [[Hachiko|akita of the same name]]) who played a part in Bradford's mutation into Dogpound after Hachiko bit him.\n\nShredder first appeared in the end of \"Rise of the Turtles, Part 2\" where he traveled to New York when he learned that Hamato Yoshi is training his own ninjas after seeing a shuriken with his clan symbol on a [[shuriken]] left behind by the Turtles during a recent fight on a TV news report. Determined to finally end his age-old rival's life, he sent the Foot Clan after the Turtles until he made his first confrontation with the Turtles in person in \"The Gauntlet\", where victory was seemingly in his grasp before he was distracted by the mutating Bradford and Montes. Although Shredder planned to kill former TCRI inventor [[Baxter Stockman]] for interfering with his plans to kill the Turtles in \"MOUSERS Attack\", he changed his mind by commenting on how Stockman's scientific knowledge could be useful to him. Shredder is also Karai's father, as seen in \"New Girl in Town\". However, in \"Showdown\", during Shredder's battle with Splinter, he reveals that in the aftermath of the fight that caused Tang Shen's death, he took Splinter's daughter, Miwa, and raised her as Karai. He has told her that he is her biological father and it was Splinter who killed her mother, as she has sworn revenge ever since. Shredder initially dismissed the Kraang's presence in New York, but after capturing one, decided to ally with them to destroy the Turtles. The partnership seems stable, though it would seem the Shredder still did not fully trust his new allies.\n\nEarly in the second season, in \"Follow the Leader\", he left for Japan to deal with a situation, leaving Karai as the interim leader of his Foot Clan. He ordered her not to attack the Turtles nor make any dealings with the Kraang behind his back, and was livid when his adoptive daughter disobeyed him. He returned in \"The Manhattan Project\", with Tiger Claw, a Japanese circus performer who was mutated into Shredder's deadly assassin and new first lieutenant. Tiger Claw was able to bring Splinter before him, but complication from a Kraang operation in the city and the Turtles' own efforts rob Shredder of his chance to kill his old foe once again. In \"The Wrath of Tiger Claw\", Shredder and Tiger Claw attempted to use Karai to set a trap for the Turtles, but when she saw a photograph of Hamato Yoshi, Tang Shen, and herself as an infant, she realized that the Turtles were telling the truth and sided with them, resulting in her being captured while buying them time to escape Tiger Claw. Shredder still cared about his adoptive daughter, though, as seen in \"The Legend of the Kuro Kabuto\", where he visited her in her cell and explained why he kept everything a secret and hoped that she will one day understand. After his helmet, the titular Kuro Kabuto, was stolen by professional thief [[Bebop and Rocksteady|Anton Zeck]] on behalf of Steranko, Shredder found Zeck's calling card on a glued-down Rahzar and ordered the entire clan before him. Explaining the helmet's history as a special Foot Clan relic, he had the clan hunt for Zeck, sending Fishface with Stockman-Fly and Rahzar with Tiger Claw. Leonardo later confronted Shredder with the Kabuto for a trade and kept him busy long enough for the other Turtles to get to Karai. However, the \"Karai\" Shredder traded them with turned out to be a dummy rigged with a bomb as the Turtles evaded it. In \"Vengeance is Mine\", Shredder attempted to use the real Karai as bait for a trap that would mutate the Turtles into snakes that would kill Splinter, but the plan backfired when Karai was exposed to the mutagen, turning into a snake and almost attacking Splinter before she fled after regaining control of herself.\n\nIn the two-part second-season finale \"The Invasion\", Shredder and Kraang Prime formed a full alliance in which Shredder and the Foot Clan will help the Kraang take over New York and then the world and in turn the Kraang would return Karai to normal, and deliver Splinter and the Turtles to him. Later, he watched as Leonardo fought and eventually defeated his army of Foot Bots, after which he sent Rahzar, Fishface, and Tiger Claw to take care of him. Leonardo managed to subdue them for a short period of time before Shredder got involved and badly injured Leonardo. Later, Splinter confronted him and the two battled until Splinter got trapped under large metal pipes. Shredder was prepared to kill his rival once and for all; however, [[Leatherhead (TMNT)|Leatherhead]] intervened, and was defeated when Shredder sliced the front of his torso and kicked him of the edge of the dock. Splinter became furious as he broke out from under the pipes and tackled Shredder to the sewers. Later, the Turtles (minus Leonardo) and April watched helplessly from behind metal bars as Shredder defeated Splinter and seemingly killed him by throwing him down a large draining bay.\n\nIn the middle of the third season in \"Return to New York\", tensions began to grow high within the Foot of their alliance with the Kraang, but Shredder convinced everyone that he will keep his promise to take the city back from them. After a feral Splinter was found by the Foot-Bots and taken before him, Shredder had Stockman-Fly work on restoring his memory, which is what April did instead with her Kraang powers when she, the Turtles and Casey Jones returned to the city to rescue their sensei. In \"The Pig and the Rhino\", Shredder sent a now mutated Steranko and Zeck (who are later renamed Bebop and Rocksteady by Michelangelo) to find Karai again, like they did recently before the Turtles helped her escape, or else they'll be given something even more painful than mutation. After the Turtles unknowingly led them to her, the two succeeded in re-capturing Karai (while the Turtles weren't looking) and delivering her back to Shredder, who promised to fix everything he's done to her. The Kraang invasion eventually came to a stop made by the Turtles and the [[Mighty Mutanimals]], but its effects had eventually gave Shredder a gift for his cooperation with the Kraang, which shifted the balance of power within the city's criminal underworld over to the Foot. For him, this was achieved by gaining control of the [[Purple Dragons]] and other Asian gangs through Hun, several South American gangs through Fishface, the [[Russian mafia|Russian mob]] through Rocksteady, and the [[Sicilian mafia|Sicilian mob]] through Vizioso. By using this power, Shredder had these crime groups aid him with collecting various chemicals from a chemical company called Aumen Chemicals, an abandoned Kraang lab and Vizioso for a mind-control serum that he planned to create and use on the Turtles, the Mutanimals, and Karai.\n\nIn the two-part season 3 finale, ''Annihilation: Earth!'' he briefly teams up with Splinter to stop a black hole machine that was to destroy the Earth. He briefly fought the Triceratons until he followed Splinter, double crossing and stabbing him in the back, killing him instantly in front of the turtles. They rushed to Splinter while April blew Shredder away with a blast from her mind. Proclaiming that his victory over Splinter is more important to him than even saving the world, Shredder is sucked into the black hole along with his followers and Splinter while the turtles, April and Casey escape Earth's destruction and then in \"Beyond the Known Universe\", they travel back in time to six months earlier in an effort to prevent this event from happening. In \"Earth's Last Stand\" these events were revisited, but the arrival of the Turtles from the future resulted in Shredder's attempt to murder Splinter being thwarted. The two engaged briefly in battle with Splinter proving victorious, and the unconscious Shredder was carried away by Tiger Claw.\n\nIn \"City at War\" due to the injuries he sustained from Splinter, Shredder has been confined to a hospital bed under the care of Stockman with Bebop and Rocksteady as his bodyguards. When Tiger Claw returns to report the loss of an entire weapons cache thanks to the Turtles and Karai back in Manhattan, making it clear Karai wants to take Shredder down one piece at a time by destroying his criminal empire before taking him out, Shredder decrees that if it's a war Karai wants, it's a war she'll get, before Stockman hooks an I.V. filled with mutagen up to Shredder, and as the mutagen is injected into Shredder, his eyes open wide as the mutagen takes effect. In \"The Insecta Trifecta\", Shredder is still receiving the mutagen drip as he now turns to Stockman as his last hope due to his undying loyalty since Tiger Claw and the others have become useless as of late in stopping Karai and the Turtles. When Stockman returns to report his mission a failure, Shredder is not worried about it, revealing to Stockman that his mutagen drip is finally taking effect as Shredder deploys a pair of blades from the back of his hand, right out of the skin itself. In \"The Super Shredder\", Shredder forces Stockman to give him the rest of the mutagen drip, which mutated him into his Super Shredder form, although it ended up monstrous he was still pleased. This form left him with blades coming out of his body, a muscular build, and bandaged feet and ankles. Shredder then collects his henchmen and travels back to his old lair. Karai tries to fight the Shredder along with Shinigami, but Shredder easily knocks Shinigami unconscious and he escapes with Karai. He then notices a van coming straight towards him (The Shell Raiser), and flips it over. He tells the turtles to have splinter meet him at the place that he last beat him. Shredder then sets the vehicle on fire and the turtles flee to the sewers. Shredder then creates a trap for Splinter and the Turtles, which is full of photos of Splinter, Tang Shen, and Karai. When Splinter enters he drops bars of iron to avoid them from escaping. He then light fire towards them but they jump underwater. As the Turtles, Splinter, and April continue to approach Shredder, Karai makes a remark and Splinter follows, but later finds out he was led into another trap. Shredder forces Splinter to fight him but Splinter escapes, ready to set up a plan of his own. Splinter leads Shredder to the Undercity, where he puts his plan into action. Shredder eventually finds Splinter and he steps on his tail. Shredder then takes Splinter deeper into the UnderCity, where he decides to finish him. Just as Shredder was about to strike Splinter, his arm started to lose control, causing him to step back. Splinter then throws a blade at a few gas tanks and both Splinter and Shredder fall to their deaths. However, in the following episode, \"Darkest Plight\", Shredder and Splinter are separated during the fall, and Shredder returns to the top of the Under-city to be rescued by Tiger Claw, who takes him back to recover before hunting down the Turtles. While Tiger Claw deals with April and Karai, Shredder goes after Leonardo, and nearly crushes him to death before Karai and April arrive to help. During the battle, Shredder tosses a wrecked fuel tanker semi-truck at Karai, only for April to catch it in her psychic grip, causing her Sol Star crystal to cause her eyes to glow blue and smile malevolently before hurling it back at Shredder. However, before Shredder can kill Leo, Karai pleads with him to reconsider doing something good in his life instead of being consumed by his vengeance. This lures Shredder in close enough for Karai to hit him in his most vulnerable spot: His exposed, pulsating mutated heart. Weakened, Shredder is saved by Tiger Claw, who drives him back to their hideout, where Shredder demands a larger dose of the mutagen from Stockman. When Tiger Claw objects, knowing it is too dangerous, Shredder overpowers him, forces Stockman to administer the dosage and roars as the mutagen takes effect as Tiger Claw watches in horror and fear. In \"Tale of Tiger Claw\", he is shown as a M.O.U.S.E.R. hologram to warn Tiger Claw of his next move against Splinter.\n\nIn \"Requiem\", he returns to New York City, far stronger and more vengeful than ever before. He shows up at the hideout where Karai is planning her next move with Shnigami and the Mighty Mutanimals. He defeats the Mutanimals effortlessly and badly injures Karai in the process. On the WOLF building, he faces off against Splinter, Slash, Raphael, April and Casey. He ultimately manages to murder Splinter and hurls him from the building to his death. He is then blasted by a tremendously powerful psychic wave from an enraged April, and is crushed by a garbage truck, though he again survives the onslaught.\n\nIn the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012 TV series, season 4)|season four]] finale \"Owari\" he has his lackeys prepare for the inevitable arrival of the Turtles, April and Casey. He burns down his new lair and confronts the Turtles in a final showdown on the roof. His unique mutation makes him immune to Donatello's retro-mutagen, which allows him to beat Raphael, Donatello and Michelangelo all at once, leaving only Leonardo left standing. After a heated one-on-one duel, Shredder is finally killed by Leonardo.\n\nMany months later, the Kabuto and his own heart were separated by unknown means and hidden in secret locations throughout New York. His heart was contained within a glass vial that came into the possession of Don Vzioso, which Tiger Claw and Kavaxas seek, as it is essential to revive him and then came back in a zombie-like form that wanted to die. Zombie Shredder was able to drag Kavaxas back to the Netherworld as they \"belong dead.\"\n\n===2018 animated series===\nIn the [[Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles|2018 animated series]], Shredder appears as the demonic leader of the Foot Clan. His backstory is that he was a man who was consumed by the Kuroi Yoroi armor. Shredder terrorized Japan until he was defeated by Splinter's ancestors 500 years ago and the Kuroi Yoroi was scattered across the world to prevent his return.\n\nThe Foot Clan, allied with Baron Draxum, are collecting the armor pieces to resurrect him starting in \"Shadow of Evil.\"\n\nIn \"Warren and Hypno, Sitting in a Tree\", Baron Draxum claims the gauntlet that turned out to be part of the Kuroi Yoroi.\n\nIn \"Operation: Normal\", the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute target the slime Y\u014dkai Sunita because the boots she was wearing are part of the Kuroi Yoroi. They managed to claim them.\n\nIn \"How to Make Enemies and Bend People to Your Will\", Baron Draxum and the Foot Recruit find Kuroi Yoroi fragment is at the botanical gardens. They claim it after setting up events where the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute would fail.\n\nIn \"One Man's Junk\", the next piece of the Kuroi Yuroi was in the possession of Repo Mantis who claimed from a Y\u014dkai and held in his salvage yard. After trapping the cat/mantis mutant Mrs. Nubbins who was owned by Repo Mantis, the Turtles learn from him that two fire-headed guys working as shoe salesmen bought them metal from him. This causes the Turtles to learn that the Foot Lieutenant and the Foot Brute claimed the metal.\n\nAfter the Kuroi Y\u014droi was completed in \"End Game\", Baron Draxum dons the armor and the Foot Brute and Lieutenant address him as Shredder, but he rejects the title. Furthermore, due to a flaw in the armor (the Turtles' Jupiter Jim figure shoved in to cover a hole when the faceplate was used as a tea kettle), the transformation failed to complete. After Draxum was defeated and cast out of the armor, it reassembled itself, having drained Draxum of his life force.\n\nIn \"Many Happy Returns\", Shredder acted like a feral beast. The Foot Lieutenant, Foot Brute, and Foot Recruit retreat to find out what went wrong. After discovering a flux in Shredder, Big Mama was able to provide a baubel for the Turtles and Splinter to trap Shredder with her doing a secret last-minute alteration to this plan.\n\n==Films==\nThe Shredder was played by [[James Saito]] in the first movie and by [[Fran\u00e7ois Chau]] in the second, while his immense Super Shredder form was played by professional wrestler [[Kevin Nash]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0621760/ Kevin Nash (I)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In all cases, the character was voiced by David McCharen. The Shredder's costume was, in the first movie, originally the same as in the original comic, with a red color. However, this was changed in the sequel to a violet color, reflecting the more cartoonish nature of the second film. In both movies, he also had a silver and black cape. In both films, he is served by his second-in-command Tatsu. In the Japanese versions, the Shredder is voiced by [[Norio Wakamoto]] (1st movie in VHS version), [[Hidekatsu Shibata]] (first movie in TV version), and [[Takeshi Watabe]] (second movie).\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (1990)===\n[[File:Shredder (James Saito).jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Saito]] as The Shredder in the film ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (1990)]]\n\nIn the first movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1990 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'', Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi were rival martial artists in Japan and both loved a woman named Tang Shen. Shen, who loved only Yoshi, persuaded him not to fight Saki honorably; instead, they fled for the United States. Saki followed them to New York City; when Yoshi returned home from his construction job he found his beloved Shen lying on the floor. And then, he saw her killer. Saki wasted no words and during the struggle, Splinter's cage was broken. Splinter leaped up into Saki's face, biting and clawing. But Saki threw him to the floor and took one swipe with his [[katana]], slicing Splinter's ear. After this incident, it was said that Saki is never heard from again. The comic book adaptation of the film retains the original comic book origin story, with Oroku Nagi being slain and Saki coming to America to seek vengeance.\n\nSaki, in the \"Shredder\" persona, establishes an American branch of the Foot Clan. With the aid of his second-in-command Tatsu, he manipulates and recruits troubled teens as a brutal yet Machiavellian leader and father figure, teaching them ninjitsu to make them into skilled thieves and [[Assassination|assassins]]. Shredder sends the Foot Clan to \"silence\" [[April O'Neil]] when she reports on the Foot Clan's connection to the recent crime wave, inadvertently leading them to the Turtles' hideout when Raphael saves April. Shredder had Splinter kidnapped and imprisoned him in his warehouse hideout, and has the Foot Clan hunt the Turtles. He beats Splinter while interrogating him about how the Turtles learned their fighting techniques.\n\nAfter the Turtles successfully defeat the Foot Clan in a final assault, Shredder confronts them on a rooftop. He defeats all of the Turtles with his superior skills and threatens Leonardo with his [[yari]] to force the others to toss away their weapons. Splinter, freed by Turtles' allies, Danny Pennington and [[Casey Jones (TMNT)|Casey Jones]], intervenes and reveals to Shredder that they met years ago, as he was Hamato Yoshi's pet. Shredder unmasks himself, revealing the scars that Splinter gave him, and charges towards Splinter to impale him. Splinter counters with Michelangelo's [[nunchaku]] to send him over the side of the roof. Shredder throws a tanto at Splinter. Splinter caught the knife, but had to let go of the nunchaku that was holding onto the spear, making Shredder fall into a parked [[garbage truck]] far below. Casey Jones then activates the crushing mechanism; the viewers are then shown a closeup of the Shredder's helmet being crushed, implying his death.\n\n===''TMNT II: The Secret of the Ooze'' (1991)===\nIn the second movie ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze]]'', the Turtles believe that since Casey had crushed him in the garbage truck, the Shredder was dead. It is soon revealed that Shredder had survived the crushing and revitalized his Foot Clan to get vengeance on the Turtles. After finding the Foot \"fallback\" headquarters in a junkyard, Tatsu was asking who would challenge him to cover for Shredder until Shredder appeared. Tatsu allowed Shredder to lead the Foot Clan. Shredder sent a member of the Foot to follow April, hoping to find the Turtles through her. When April's team was doing a report on T.G.R.I. in [[New Jersey]], April's camera operator/Foot Clan member Freddy found some mutated [[dandelion]]s and sent one to the Shredder. He then orders Tatsu to obtain a sample of the T.G.R.I. mutagen that mutated the Turtles, as well as kidnap researcher Jordan Perry. Using the last mutagen and Perry's research, the Shredder creates his own mutants, [[Tokka and Rahzar]], from a stolen [[Alligator snapping turtle|snapping turtle]] and a brown [[wolf]] respectively. Though initially enraged at their infant-like intelligence, he soon plays it to his advantage by manipulating the mutants as they imprinted him as their surrogate parent.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to kill the Turtles in the junkyard using a captured Raphael, Shredder unleashed Tokka and Rahzar onto a city street to \"have fun\" and destroy it. The Foot spy then gave April a message for the Turtles: that the Shredder would turn the mutants loose on [[Central Park]] next if they did not accede to a rematch at the construction site. After the Turtles de-mutate the two mutants (with help from Perry) and defeat Tatsu in a nightclub, the Shredder appears and threatens to mutate an innocent woman with a small reserve mutagen vial (the canister was knocked away by the Turtles' new human ally, Keno). Before he can mutate her, he is stopped when the Turtles play a keytar at full volume, sending the Shredder flying through a window from the force of a blown speaker. When the Turtles follow him outside on a pier, they discover that the Shredder has used the mutagen vial on himself. He is transformed into a massive \"Super Shredder\", an almost mindless giant-mutant being with immense [[superhuman strength]]. During his fight with the Turtles, Super Shredder knocks down the pier's pilings in a mindless rage, which then collapses onto him with the Turtles falling into the water below. Though the Turtles survive, the Shredder meets his demise from getting crushed by the destroyed pieces of the pier.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III'' (1993) and ''TMNT'' (2007)===\nThe Shredder did not appear in the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III|third film]] but is shown briefly at the beginning of the [[TMNT (film)|fourth film]] to help give the backstory of the Turtles, and his helmet that he wore in the 1990 film is visible on Splinter's shelf of mementos at the end of the movie. The possibility of his return is also strongly hinted at in the end of the film by Karai. However, the established storyline was abandoned in favor of the 2014 reboot.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' (2014)===\n[[Japanese Americans|Japanese American]] actor Tohoru Masamune portrayed the Shredder in ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Film Review: 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'|website=variety.com|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/reviews/film-review-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1201274733/|quote= Several years later, a crime wave is in full force in the city, led by a walking Cutco display called the Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) and his massive Foot Clan, though they've started to get their asses whupped by a stealthy troupe of martial-arts-savvy vigilantes.|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> Initially, [[William Fichtner]] was intended to portray a Caucasian version of the Shredder, with the anglicized real name of [[Eric Sacks]], instead of Oroku Saki.<ref>{{cite web|title='Crossing Lines': William Fichtner Reveals 'Sons Of Anarchy' Star Joining Show|url=http://huffpost.com/ca/entry/3478979|quote=What are you doing in \"Ninja Turtles\"?

After a [[Raphael (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|vigilante]] stops the Foot Clan, Shredder orders the Foot to take hostages down the subway in order to lure the vigilante out. Later in the film, Shredder's adopted son, Eric Sacks, informs Shredder that the vigilante is in fact four mutated Turtles who are test subjects of Project Renaissance, a science experiment of April O'Neil's late father. Sacks gives Shredder an armed suit and a helmet, the latter and the Foot Clan attack the Turtles' lair, where he defeats [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] and kidnaps three Turtles after Raphael was presumed dead. Sacks drains the Turtles' blood in order to create mutagen so that he can complete his and Shredder's plan: the latter will release a virus across the city and Sacks will sell the mutagen as a cure for the disease, making him even richer. As Shredder prepares to release the virus, the Turtles escape and confront him. Although he nearly defeats them, the Turtles were able to conquer Shredder with the help of April, which causes him to fall from the building on which he stood, but he survives and is shown to have a sample of the mutagen.\n\n===''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows'' (2016)===\n[[Brian Tee]] portrayed Shredder in the 2016 film, ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]''. In the beginning of the movie, the Foot Clan, led by a scientist named [[Baxter Stockman]], attempt to help Shredder escape from prison. Although the turtles try to prevent the escape, Stockman was able to help Shredder escape using a teleportation device. But Shredder is hijacked mid-teleport and ends up in a place called [[Dimension X (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Dimension X]]. There, he meets [[Krang]], who gives Shredder a mutagen canister in exchange for a promise to find the three components of a machine that Krang sent to [[Earth]] long ago, which when united will open a portal to his dimension. Shredder returns to New York City and recruits two criminals named Bebop and Rocksteady and has Stockman use Krang's mutagen to transform them to powerful animal mutants- a warthog and rhinoceros. Shredder, Bebop and Rocksteady find the components in a museum in New York and in a jungle in [[Brazil]]. Shredder and Stockman unite the components, creating a portal to Krang's dimension. Shredder betrays Stockman and has his men take him away, but upon entering the [[Technodrome]], Krang immediately betrays Shredder, freezing him and locking him away with his collection of other defeated foes.\n\n===''Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles''===\nAndrew Kishino voices Shredder in the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] animated film, ''[[Batman vs. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. In the film, Shredder allies his forces with [[Ra's al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]] to build a machine designed to transform [[Gotham City|Gotham]]'s citizens into unhinged mutants. In exchange for his assistance, Ra's promises Shredder access to one of his Lazarus Pits, which would grant him eternal life. When he and the Foot Clan try to steal a cloud seeder from [[Wayne Enterprises]], he ends up fighting Batman and barely comes out victorious after using an ancient technique. \n\nLater, he fights [[Batman]] once more when the Turtles and the Bat Family arrive at Ace Chemicals to stop him and Ra's from activating the machine. Though he gains the upper hand on the Dark Knight once again, he is thrown off when Batman says \"Cowabunga\" and gains assistance from Raphael. After Michaelangelo and Donatello destroy the machine, the debris sends him into a vat of chemicals as the plant explodes. In the post-credits scene, he is revealed to have survived the explosion and now strongly resembles [[the Joker]].\n\n==Video games==\nAs the original [[List of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles video games|''TMNT'' video games]] are mostly based on the 1987 cartoon, Shredder is often based on his first cartoon incarnation. He usually executes some plan to provoke the Turtles into retaliating and defeat them; these include kidnapping April O'Neil and stealing the [[Statue of Liberty]]. Shredder is usually the last boss in the games.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (NES game)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[NES]], 1989): Shredder is the final boss. He is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He causes the Turtles to lose roughly half their energy if he touches them, and has a gun that can de-mutate them, which instantly kills them. He wears a red costume like in the Mirage comics.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (arcade game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' ([[Arcade game|arcade]], 1989): Once again, Shredder is the final boss and is found at the end of the Technodrome level. He is armed with a sword, and has the ability to clone himself (the exact number of clones is one more than the number of Turtles attacking him in the arcade version). Shredder and his clones also have the ability to shoot lightning bolts from a device on the helmet, which de-mutate the Turtles they hit, killing them. When Shredder or one of his clones is close to death, his helmet falls off, a unique occurrence in the game series.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fall of the Foot Clan]]'' (1990): This game was the first one not to feature Shredder as the final boss. Instead, Shredder is the boss of the penultimate stage, which is set in a river. It is also the first game in which Shredder does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles. His only attack is a sword swipe, but he can teleport if hit. The final boss is Krang.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Manhattan Missions]]'' (1991): In this [[PC game]], Shredder fights the turtles in his Manhattan hideout, decorated in a Japanese style. His appearance is based on the Mirage comic version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: The Manhattan Project]]'' (1992): This game is the first to feature both a battle against Shredder and a second one against a mutated Super Shredder. The first battle takes place at the end of the Technodrome level, which is the sixth of the eight levels of the game. In this battle, Shredder uses a sword to attack the Turtles. Shredder later returns as the final boss of the game, on the stage set in Krang's spacecraft. This time, he mutates himself into Super Shredder, much as he did in the second movie which had been released earlier the same year (1991). Super Shredder has two superpowers, the ability to call down lightning, and the ability to shoot fireballs. These fireballs can de-mutate the Turtles, but unlike other games, this is not an instant kill.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Back from the Sewers]]'' (1991): A sequel to ''Fall of the Foot Clan'', this game also features Shredder as a regular level boss and Krang as the final boss. He does not have the ability to de-mutate the Turtles, but he does have a wider variety of attacks than in the previous [[Game Boy]] game. Shredder returns later in his mutated Super Shredder form, as a sub-level boss of the final Technodrome level. However, in this incarnation, his only super-power is the ability to teleport elsewhere on the screen. He attacks the Turtles using a sword.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time]]'' (1991): Shredder is again the final boss of the game, and found in the Technodrome. However, this time, he is not preceded by a Technodrome level. Instead, the Turtles fight through a Starbase level in the future (2100 AD) with Krang as boss, then teleport to the Technodrome in the present (1991 in the arcade game and 1992 in the [[SNES]] version) for the final confrontation. Shredder attacks with a sword, and can fire energy attacks. In the SNES port of the game, Shredder begins the battle by mutating himself into Super Shredder, and has the added superpowers of super-speed movement, fire ground attacks, ice air attacks, and a de-mutating fire ball which costs a turtle a life. The SNES port also added a Technodrome level earlier in the game, which leads to a battle with a regular Shredder. In this battle, Shredder is in a kind of battletank, armed with a machine gun and claws. The player views the action over Shredder's shoulder inside the tank, and the only way to cause damage is to hurl the never-ending waves of Foot Soldiers toward the screen and into the tank.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Hyperstone Heist]]'' (1992): This game uses a Super Shredder similar to the one in ''Turtles in Time''. His attacks are roughly the same.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III: Radical Rescue]]'' (1993): Unlike its two predecessors, ''Fall of the Foot Clan'' and ''Back from the Sewers'', this game does feature Shredder as the final boss. However, this time Shredder has become Cyber Shredder, half-man and half-machine. This form of Shredder possessed deadly kick moves and energy ball attacks, as well as being the only boss in the game with two life meters, as the meter instantly refills after it is drained the first time.\n\n[[File:Shredder villain SNES.gif|thumb|Shredder in the SNES version of ''Tournament Fighters'']]\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tournament Fighters]]'' (1993): This is the first game in which Shredder is not a boss but instead a regular playable character. Furthermore, his costume is based on the Mirage comics version. Finally, in the SNES incarnation of this game, he appears under the name Cyber-Shredder, but there is no indication that he has become a cybernetic being as in ''Radical Rescue''.\n\nAfter a 10-year hiatus, a new series of ''TMNT'' games was initiated. These new games are based on the 2003 cartoon series, and likewise, Shredder in the games is the same as in the cartoon.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2003): Shredder appears as the final boss. The Turtles face him on the helicarrier at the top of the Foot Helicarriers; he wields the Sword of Tengu in this fight. Shredder's combo attacks are quick and nearly continuous. When half of his health bar has been depleted, his attacks become much faster. There is also a secret final boss in which the player faces Shredder as Oroku Saki. His combos are much quicker and deadlier, and he also has a temporary powered-up state.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2: Battle Nexus]]'' (2004): The game begins a short while before the end of the previous game, and Shredder is encountered by the Turtles in the second stage of the game; however, he is not fought by the player, only in a cutscene. As in the cartoon, Shredder is defeated, but he survives the assault on his headquarters. Shredder resurfaces in the TCRI building later on, but once again, the player does not directly fight him; the main goal of the mission being to evacuate the Utroms back to their home planet. He is seemingly killed in the destruction of the TCRI building, but he once again survives. In a sub-plot exclusive to the game, he is detailed as being a mass murderer of Utroms on their homeworld, and he gave Utrom mercenary Slashurr a permanent scar. He later wiped Slashurr's memory, and employed him to kill the Turtles. However, Slashurr eventually remembers his past, and with the Turtles, battles Shredder and the Foot on his ship. The Turtles eventually defeat Shredder once again. In the Battle Nexus fighting tournament mode, Shredder appears as the final boss of the Foot Fight tournament, though the nature of these tournaments when it comes to the game's canon is questionable.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Melee]]'' (2005): Shredder appeared as a playable character and opponent in three forms\u2014his standard armor, without the armor (as Oroku Saki), and a golden \"Mega\" Shredder.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3: Mutant Nightmare]]'' (2005) The third chapter of the game, \"Exodus\", deals directly with the Turtles thwarting the Foot's efforts. As in the third-season finale, the Turtles and Splinter battle the Foot at their headquarters, and follow the Shredder aboard his starship. They nearly sacrifice themselves to kill Shredder as well, but the Utroms rescue them, and exile Shredder to a distant ice asteroid forever. Shredder is also encountered in the dark future as one of the final bosses of the Nightmare chapter of the game.\n*''[[TMNT (video game)|TMNT]]'' (2007): In the console versions of the 2007 movie-based game, Shredder appears as a boss in a flashback-within-a-flashback (as the events of the game are told to Splinter after their occurrence). The armor of Shredder in this game is based on the 2003 cartoon series version.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up|TMNT: Smash Up]]'' (2009): Shredder is a playable character in the [[PlayStation 2|PS2]] and [[Wii]] fighting game. He appears in both his Utrom Shredder and Cyber Shredder forms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wii.ign.com/dor/objects/14305526/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-smash-up-20090819101955472.html |title=IGN: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Smash-Up Screenshots (Wii) 2966717 |publisher=Wii.ign.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-08}}</ref>\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows]]'' (2013): Shredder appears as both the penultimate and final boss of the game. He recruits Baxter Stockman to build a new helmet for him using stolen Krang technology, which gives him [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] powers, including the ability to fly. Shredder is first fought in his lair when the Turtles come to save April and learn about his scheme. After escaping, he is fought again in the Krangs's secret undergroung facility, this time donning his new helmet built by Stockman. He is ultimately defeated by the Turtles, who destroy his helmet, leaving him to swear revenge.\n*''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014 film)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' (2014): The [[Nintendo 3DS]] game based on the 2014 film, Shredder, who is actually Eric Sacks, appears as the final boss. However, after defeating him, it is revealed that it was all an illusion created by Baxter Stockman, to allow the real Shredder to escape.\n\n==Other appearances==\nIn the anime adaptation ''[[Mutant Turtles: Choujin Densetsu-hen]]'', the backstory from the original cartoon was preserved. Unlike the rest of the main cast, Shredder's appearance was changed to match the ''Supermutants'' Shredder toy that was being sold at that time. The manga explained this by saying his original outfit was destroyed in a battle with the Turtles and Krang created the new armor for him. Shredder also gains the ability to transform into the dragon Devil Shredder using the Mutanite crystals he stole from the Neutrinos. With the energy from the evil [[Sprite (creature)|sprite]] Dark Mu, he was later able to transform into the gigantic Dark Devil Shredder. In the second volume of the anime he gets his Tiger Spirit ''Metal Mutant'' armor. He was voiced by [[Kiyoyuki Yanada]].\n\nShredder also made a guest appearance in an episode of the hit YouTube show ''[[Death Battle]]''. In the episode, his weapons and abilities were analyzed against ''[[X-Men]]'' villain [[Silver Samurai]]. In the end, Shredder proved himself the better fighter and beat his opponent.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20051018042755/http://www.ninjaturtles.com/html/profile7.htm The Shredder profile on the official ''TMNT'' website]\n\n{{Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Animated series villains]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1984]]\n[[Category:Fictional businesspeople]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with superhuman strength]]\n[[Category:Fictional code names]]\n[[Category:Fictional crime bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional dictators]]\n[[Category:Fictional immigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Fictional mass murderers]]\n[[Category:Fictional Ninjutsu practitioners]]\n[[Category:Fictional warlords]]\n[[Category:Superhero film characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003 TV series) characters]]\n[[Category:Television supervillains]]\n[[Category:Video game bosses]]\n[[Category:Fictional martial arts trainers]]\n[[Category:Fictional assassinated people]]\n[[Category:Fictional prison escapees]]\n[[Category:Fictional kidnappers]]\n[[Category:Fictional demons and devils]]\n[[Category:Fictional terrorists]]\n[[Category:Fictional Japanese people]]\n[[Category:Psychopathy in fiction]]\n", "name_user": "L-Hexoses", "label": "safe", "comment": "link to Tohoru Masamune", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shredder_(Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles)"}

Its [[Local government areas of Victoria|local government area]] is the [[City of Glen Eira]]. \n\nIt is bounded by Kooyong Road in the west, Glen Eira Road in the north, Glen Huntly Road in the south and Booran Road in the east.\n\nCaulfield is best known as the location of [[Caulfield Racecourse]] and the Caulfield campus of [[Monash University]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Toponymy===\nThe origin of the name of Caulfield is not known for certain, but the name seemed to be linked with [[Baron Caulfield]] of [[Ireland]], perhaps through John Caulfield, a pioneer of the colony.  The name Caulfield was in use by 1853, and the early maps always place it somewhere around the racecourse.\n\n===Pre-European history===\nThe local [[Yalukit]] people were coastal and dependent on seafoods, so few Aboriginal relics have been found in Caulfield.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\" /> Nevertheless, some contact did occur in the area between Aborigines and European settlers. Murrum Murrumbean was a local native from whom the placename [[Murrumbeena]] derives. Frederick Chapman (later Justice of the New Zealand Supreme Court) was able to recollect a [[corroboree]] which took place in Hotham Street, involving hundreds of Gippsland Aborigines.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\" />\n\n===Establishment===\nIn the mid nineteenth century, the Caulfield area was swampy, low-lying ground. It served as watering and pasture land for the pastoralists driving stock from Gippsland to Melbourne.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\">{{Citation|last=Murray PR and Wells JC|title=From sand, swamp and heath...|year=1980|publisher=The City of Caulfield|isbn=978-0-9598392-6-5 |pages=1}}</ref> In the 1840s, several distinct communities had arisen throughout the area. Owensville was located around the western end of Glen Eira Road. Alma Road Village was another middle class area further north. Camden Town was a working class area at the junction of Glen Huntly and Hawthorn Roads. Meanwhile, the area south of Paddy's Swamp (now Caulfield Park) developed into the main commercial area of Caulfield. Initially the Black Chapel at that point served as the area's first church. This building was soon converted to Boxill's general store.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\" /> The whole area was proclaimed the Caulfield Road District in 1857. It served as a location for several grand mansions for wealthy Melbourne citizens over the following decades. Caulfield Post Office opened on 1 January 1863 and closed in 1974. Caulfield Junction Post Office opened in 1923 and remains open.<ref name = \"a\">{{Citation| last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | accessdate = 11 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Population==\nAt the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]], Caulfield had a population of 5,595. 53.0% of people were born in Australia. The most common countries of birth were South Africa 5.4%, China 3.3%, Israel! 3.0%, Poland 2.8% and England 2.3%. 63.1% of people only spoke English at home.

Its [[Local government areas of Victoria|local government area]] is the [[City of Glen Eira]]. \n\nIt is bounded by Kooyong Road in the west, Glen Eira Road in the north, Glen Huntly Road in the south and Booran Road in the east.\n\nCaulfield is best known as the location of [[Caulfield Racecourse]] and the Caulfield campus of [[Monash University]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Toponymy===\nThe origin of the name of Caulfield is not known for certain, but the name seemed to be linked with [[Baron Caulfield]] of [[Ireland]], perhaps through John Caulfield, a pioneer of the colony.  The name Caulfield was in use by 1853, and the early maps always place it somewhere around the racecourse.\n\n===Pre-European history===\nThe local [[Yalukit]] people were coastal and dependent on seafoods, so few Aboriginal relics have been found in Caulfield.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\" /> Nevertheless, some contact did occur in the area between Aborigines and European settlers. Murrum Murrumbean was a local native from whom the placename [[Murrumbeena]] derives. Frederick Chapman (later Justice of the New Zealand Supreme Court) was able to recollect a [[corroboree]] which took place in Hotham Street, involving hundreds of Gippsland Aborigines.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\" />\n\n===Establishment===\nIn the mid nineteenth century, the Caulfield area was swampy, low-lying ground. It served as watering and pasture land for the pastoralists driving stock from Gippsland to Melbourne.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\">{{Citation|last=Murray PR and Wells JC|title=From sand, swamp and heath...|year=1980|publisher=The City of Caulfield|isbn=978-0-9598392-6-5 |pages=1}}</ref> In the 1840s, several distinct communities had arisen throughout the area. Owensville was located around the western end of Glen Eira Road. Alma Road Village was another middle class area further north. Camden Town was a working class area at the junction of Glen Huntly and Hawthorn Roads. Meanwhile, the area south of Paddy's Swamp (now Caulfield Park) developed into the main commercial area of Caulfield. Initially the Black Chapel at that point served as the area's first church. This building was soon converted to Boxill's general store.<ref name=\"From sand, swamp and heath...\" /> The whole area was proclaimed the Caulfield Road District in 1857. It served as a location for several grand mansions for wealthy Melbourne citizens over the following decades. Caulfield Post Office opened on 1 January 1863 and closed in 1974. Caulfield Junction Post Office opened in 1923 and remains open.<ref name = \"a\">{{Citation| last = Premier Postal History  | title = Post Office List | url = https://www.premierpostal.com/cgi-bin/wsProd.sh/Viewpocdwrapper.p?SortBy=VIC&country= | accessdate = 11 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==Population==\nAt the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 Census]], Caulfield had a population of 5,595. 53.0% of people were born in Australia.

The paper was originally an afternoon paper for the city of [[Columbus, Ohio]], which at the time had a population of 32,000. For its first few years, the paper rented a headquarters on North High Street and Lynn Alley in Columbus. It began with 800 subscribers.<ref name=\"AboutUs\">{{citation|last=Deitch |first=Linda |title=Memorable milestones in Columbus Dispatch history |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/sections/services/about-history.html# |publisher=The Columbus Dispatch |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 1888, the paper published its first full-page advertisement, for the Columbus Buggy Company. In 1895, the paper moved its headquarters to the northeast corner of Gay and High streets, a larger building on a site which was previously a grocer. On April 10, the paper published a 72-page edition to mark the move. On December 17, 1899, the paper published its first Sunday edition, a 36-page paper which cost 3\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|3|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}), and the daily editions were reduced in price to 2\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|2|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}). Two years later on March 3, 1901, the paper published its first color [[comic strip]]s.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper, renamed ''The Columbus Evening Dispatch'', changed hands several times in its early years. In 1905, it was purchased by brothers Harry Preston Wolfe and Robert Frederick Wolfe, who originally ran a shoe company. It was not the Wolfes' first entry into journalism; they had purchased the ''[[Ohio State Journal]]'' two years before. The ''Dispatch'' would remain in the hands of the Wolfe family for 110 years. On December 16, 1906, the paper published its first color ad, for Beggs Store. On April 9, 1907, the ''Dispatch'' offices were destroyed in a fire, and the building was demolished and rebuilt. In the interlude, the paper ran its offices out of 34/36 North High Street.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper's editorial staff traditionally has had a [[conservatism|conservative]] slant.<ref name = \"Bwk\">Lucia Moses, ''\"The Columbus Dispatch\"'', ''[[Brandweek]]'', April 30, 2001</ref><ref name = \"CNN\">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/24/sm.02.html \"CNN Sunday Morning\" <nowiki>[transcript]</nowiki>], ''[[CNN]]'', October 24, 2004</ref><ref name = \"AN\">Terry Smith, [http://www.athensnews.com/component/content/article/4-letters/19092-wearing_thin_thanks_for_your_letters_without \"Wearing Thin: Thanks for your letters!

The paper published its first issue as ''The Daily Dispatch'' on July 1, 1871, as a four-page paper which cost 4\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|4|1871}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}) per copy. The paper was originally an afternoon paper for the city of [[Columbus, Ohio]], which at the time had a population of 32,000. For its first few years, the paper rented a headquarters on North High Street and Lynn Alley in Columbus. It began with 800 subscribers.<ref name=\"AboutUs\">{{citation|last=Deitch |first=Linda |title=Memorable milestones in Columbus Dispatch history |url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/sections/services/about-history.html# |publisher=The Columbus Dispatch |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn April 2, 1888, the paper published its first full-page advertisement, for the Columbus Buggy Company. In 1895, the paper moved its headquarters to the northeast corner of Gay and High streets, a larger building on a site which was previously a grocer. On April 10, the paper published a 72-page edition to mark the move. On December 17, 1899, the paper published its first Sunday edition, a 36-page paper which cost 3\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|3|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}), and the daily editions were reduced in price to 2\u00a2 ({{Inflation|US|2|1899}}\u00a2 in {{Inflation-year|US}}). Two years later on March 3, 1901, the paper published its first color [[comic strip]]s.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper, renamed ''The Columbus Evening Dispatch'', changed hands several times in its early years. In 1905, it was purchased by brothers Harry Preston Wolfe and Robert Frederick Wolfe, who originally ran a shoe company. It was not the Wolfes' first entry into journalism; they had purchased the ''[[Ohio State Journal]]'' two years before. The ''Dispatch'' would remain in the hands of the Wolfe family for 110 years. On December 16, 1906, the paper published its first color ad, for Beggs Store. On April 9, 1907, the ''Dispatch'' offices were destroyed in a fire, and the building was demolished and rebuilt. In the interlude, the paper ran its offices out of 34/36 North High Street.<ref name=\"AboutUs\"/>\n\nThe paper's editorial staff traditionally has had a [[conservatism|conservative]] slant.<ref name = \"Bwk\">Lucia Moses, ''\"The Columbus Dispatch\"'', ''[[Brandweek]]'', April 30, 2001</ref><ref name = \"CNN\">[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/24/sm.02.html \"CNN Sunday Morning\" <nowiki>[transcript]</nowiki>], ''[[CNN]]'', October 24, 2004</ref><ref name = \"AN\">Terry Smith, [http://www.athensnews.com/component/content/article/4-letters/19092-wearing_thin_thanks_for_your_letters_without \"Wearing Thin: Thanks for your letters!
