As Jacob grows older, he begins to doubt the stories until the arrival of his grandfather's death. Blood-strewn, exhausted, and lying in his back garden on the outskirts of Florida Woods, Abraham's last words are a mystery: \"...find the bird in the loop on the other side of the old man's grave on September 3, 1940,<!-- 1940 in this book, 1943 in the film --> and tell them what happened.\" As his grandfather dies, Jacob catches sight of a horrific monster just like the ones described in Abraham's stories. Soon, he starts experiencing trauma and being plagued with nightmares relating to those monsters. Believing their son to be going crazy, Jacob's parents take him to Dr. Golan, a psychiatrist, who suggests that Jacob go to Cairnholm, Wales, the location of his grandfather's children's home to confront the place of his trauma. On his own, Jacob locates and explores the old house only to find it empty and everything caked in dust. According to the local people, the place is haunted and a bomb had killed all its inhabitants many years ago, on September 3, 1940.\n\nSensing a connection, Jacob refuses to give up and returns to the house one more time, where he encounters a mysterious girl who can conjure fire with her hands whom he follows, trying to question her after hearing her call out his grandfather's name. They reach the bogs surrounding the house before Jacob realizes that the people of Cairnholm are different, including the patrons at the inn and his father isn't there. Luckily, a confused Jacob is rescued by the girl from before and an invisible boy, who introduce themselves as Emma Bloom and Millard Nullings respectively. A suspicious Emma holds him captive and brings him to the children's home, where he finds it magically transformed to the paradise of his grandfather's stories, complete with the peculiar children and the \"wise old bird\", who is in fact the headmistress Miss Alma  LeFay Peregrine (named after that well-known raptorous bird of prey the Peregrine Falcon.) There Jacob is also introduced to other peculiar children apart from Emma and Millard: Bronwyn Bruntley, a girl with incredible strength, Claire Densmore, a little girl with an extra mouth at the back of her head, Olive Abroholos Elephanta, a little girl who can levitate, Enoch O'Connor, a boy who can raise the dead by transplanting hearts for a short amount of time, Hugh Apiston, a boy with bees living in his stomach, Fiona Frauenfeld, a girl with an affinity for growing plants, and Horace Somnusson, a boy with prophetic dreams. Shocked and befuddled by the state of the place, Olive and Millard explain that they are currently existing in a [[time loop]], a place where time is constantly reversed and where they all relive the same day every day, September 3, 1940. This is all thanks to Miss Peregrine, a special type of peculiar being known as an ''ymbryne'', one who can shapeshift into birds (namely a Peregrine Falcon after which she is named) and manipulate time. Apart from keeping them alive (if not the bomb would have killed them), this time loop also protects the peculiar children from being hunted by hollowgast&nbsp;\u2014 humanoid, tentacle-mouthed creatures that devour peculiars. That experiment occurred in the Siberian tundra, which was marked by a [[Tunguska Event|cataclysmic explosion]], and from there the hollowgast were born. In addition to hollowgast being a threat, hollows who have consumed enough peculiars are evolved into wights, beings who resemble humans in every aspect save their eyes, which have no pupils. These wights' ultimate goal is to gain power from the peculiars, as well as morph every one of their fellow hollowgast into wights that will rule the world.\n\nSoon, Miss Peregrine's former mentor Miss Avocet arrives at the loop mad with grief over the kidnapping of her wards to wights, who have executed their plan of raiding loops. Fearing for the children's safety, Jacob is tasked with the job of reporting any suspicious information going on in the outside world. With his comings and goings, Jacob and Emma begin to develop feelings for each other, as well as get a glimpse into his own peculiar self: he can see the hollows while other peculiars can't, just like his grandfather. Miss Peregrine's fears are confirmed when eyeless sheep bodies begin to pile up, and Martin, a worker in the Cairnholm Local Museum, is killed. Going against Miss Peregrine's orders to not leave the house, Enoch, Bronwyn, Emma, Jacob and Millard escape, and Enoch uses a sheep heart to briefly bring Martin back to life. Martin manages to inform the group of the presence of a wight on the island, but by then it is too late as one appears right behind them along with a hollow companion. To Jacob's shock, he reveals himself to be Dr. Golan, as well as Jacob's family's hired lawn gardener, and Jacob's middle school bus driver. Jacob refuses Golan's offer to join him in finding peculiars, and decides to stay with his friends. Golan sends his hollow after the group, and Emma and Jacob split up from the rest. After a brief scuffle, Jacob kills it with a pair of sheep shears. They make their way back to the orphanage, but discover that Golan has kidnapped Miss Peregrine and Miss Avocet and locked the rest of the children in the house.\n\nDr. Golan warns them not to attempt to rescue Miss Peregrine and leaves the loop, but Millard manages to sneak out invisibly and follow him. Jacob and his friends follow Millard's tracks and find Golan near a lighthouse trying to catch a boat with his other wight comrades. During the process of saving Miss Peregrine, who is trapped in her bird form, Millard is wounded from a gunshot, but Golan is ultimately killed by Jacob. Just then, the other wights arrive and even though they are able to rescue Miss Peregrine, Miss Avocet is taken away. Returning to the orphanage, they find it destroyed, leaving them having to track down the wights and discover how to help Miss Peregrine. It is then Jacob decides to follow his friends and returns to the present to say goodbye to his father, but promises to return when his mission is finished. Guided by only a prophetic dream from Horace, they set sail to find help.\n\n==Peculiardom==\n\n===Peculiars===\nOtherwise known as ''syndrigast'' (a word meaning \"peculiar spirit\" in the Old Peculiar language, which is in turn the author's adaptation of Old English, or Anglo-Saxon language), peculiar folk are a branch of humanity possessing a second soul which manifests itself in strange ways such as abnormal characteristics and abilities commonly referred to as ''peculiarities''.  Very rarely are peculiar children born to peculiar parents as the essence or gene of peculiarity often skips entire generations, making peculiar population vastly less than that of normal people.\n\n===Ymbrynes===\nAn '''ymbryne''' (pronounced ''IMM-brinn'') is a specific kind of female peculiar who can transform into distinct birds, control and manipulate time as she sees fit, and govern the peculiar world. Most essentially, the ability to control time lets these women possess a period of historical time by looping it, creating a potentially eternal sanctuary for peculiars. They often set out into the present-day world to rescue peculiars in dire situations or to search for those without an ymbryne. ''Ymbryne'' means \"revolution\" or \"circuit\" in Old Peculiar.\n\n===Council of Ymbrynes===\nThe '''Council of Ymbrynes''' is the official government and law of peculiardom. Their responsibilities include the maintenance of loop order, the writing or amending of laws on a regular basis, and the determination of sentences for those convicted of a crime. Members are not specified.\n\n===Time Loops===\n'''Time loops''' are the fabric of the peculiar world, often referred to as peculiardom. Similar to towns, cities, states, and countries, they act as specific locations. Together they create a vast and quite complex world of varying whereabouts and dates only peculiars are able to enter. Within these loops, peculiars live indefinitely without aging or reliving previous experiences, even as the day around them repeats itself. While it may appear to be a form of eternal youth, it is the suspension of time inevitable. In reality, many, if not all, of Miss Peregrine's children are over fifty years old, but the loop detains them as teenagers and small children physically and mentally. A loop must be reset daily or it will collapse, leaving all peculiars within it exposed to the outside world.\n\n===Aging Forward==\n\nYou age forward. That's it.\n\n===Hollowgast===\nA word meaning \"empty spirit\". The '''hollowgast''' are monsters who feed on peculiars. They were created by a freak-accident in an unethical and illegal experiment conducted by Miss Peregrine's two brothers. Hundreds had joined their cause, and with the aid of misguided but powerful ymbrynes, it was intended to achieve immortality without the limitations of time loops. Instead, it led to a catastrophic collapse that destroyed half of Siberia where the experiment took place. Everyone involved was presumed dead, but their corpses became deformed and crawled back to a lesser, animalistic state of life. Apart from their shadows, hollows are invisible to all but a gifted few including Abraham and Jacob Portman. They are also identified by the groups of large tentacle-like tongues that occupy their grotesquely stretched mouths. It is speculated that this outcome was the result of being reverse-aged to a time before their souls existed, thus the word ''hollowgast''. Their souls having been erased, hollows possess no form of peculiarity and cannot enter time loops.\n\n===Wights===\nIf a hollow consumes enough peculiar souls, its original human form is restored, with the exception of irises and pupils leaving the eyes entirely white.  Because of this, peculiars refer to these evolved creatures as '''wights'''.  They possess no extraordinary abilities but are highly skilled in posing as normal people under multiple identities and can even pass into time loops.  Much of their existence revolves around procuring peculiars for remaining hollows to devour. Once they set their eyes on a peculiar child, they will follow them around. As they did with Jacob all the way to the island.\n\n==Characters==\n===Peculiar Children===\n*'''Jacob Magellan Portman''' \u2014 A 16-year-old American teenager and the protagonist of the story.  Jacob becomes subject to [[acute stress reaction]] after witnessing his grandfather's death and claiming that a monster from his grandfather's childhood stories had killed him.  Everyone he knows begins to consider him crazy and avoids him.  His parents eventually take him to see a psychiatrist, on whose instruction Jacob's dad takes him on a trip to the Welsh island where his grandfather grew up.  There, Jacob discovers that the stories of a magical orphanage and peculiar children are real and so is the monster.  He also learns that the ability to see these monsters is actually an extremely rare peculiarity as they are invisible to all but a few like himself.\n*'''Abraham Portman''' \u2014 Abraham was Jacob's grandfather who also had the peculiarity of seeing the monsters.  He left Miss Peregrine's loop as a young man to join both the war against Germany and the war against the hollowgast, promising to make a home in America for his fellow peculiars.  But having started a family of his own during his time in the normal world, he never went back for them.  In spite of this, he was still pressured into eradicating hollows, resulting in long, frequent hunting-trips away from his wife and two children, a secret which they took as careless neglect.  Over the years, Abraham became a near-stranger to everyone he knew and, in his old age, was killed by one of the very monsters he had fought so valiantly to defeat.  Police simply concluded that dementia and an attack by wild animals were the cause of his death.\n*'''Emma''' '''Bloom'''\u2014 Emma is a teenager under Miss Peregrine's care. Her peculiarity manifested in her hands when she was ten years old.  They began to glow red, becoming painfully hot to the point of generating fire. Emma had a romantic relationship with Abraham which they maintained even as he went to war until he stopped responding to her letters.  After years without replying, Abraham finally wrote her back simply to tell her he could no longer do so because he'd married another woman.  Emma became heartbroken and bitter but still mourned him upon learning of his death when his grandson Jacob arrived in Miss Peregrine's time loop.  Although she treated Jacob harshly at first, their mutual sorrow for Abraham started a deeply sincere relationship between them.  \n*'''Millard Nullings''' \u2014 Millard is a young adolescent possessing the peculiarity of invisibility which is said to be quite uncommon.  He chooses to go about nude to stay fully invisible, but wears clothes at supper on Miss Peregrine's orders.  He is also exceptionally well-versed in all things peculiar and, as a hobby, spends much of his time documenting every little detail of the day they live in.\n*'''Bronwyn Bruntley''' \u2014 A young adolescent possessing super-human strength, Bronwyn is also kindhearted and a loyal friend.  She respects and obeys Miss Peregrine more than her fellow wards do, often correcting them and citing rules they're meant to follow, mostly in fear of anyone getting in trouble.  The only occasions for which she refuses to cooperate are when she is made to dress lady-like.  Before Miss Peregrine took her and her older brother Victor in, Bronwyn discovered her own strength at the age of ten when she snapped their abusive stepfather's neck without actually meaning to.\n*'''Enoch O'Connor''' \u2014 A young adolescent with the ability to [[necromancy|resurrect the dead]] and bring inanimate objects to life for a limited time by using the extracted organs of other living things.  Enoch was born to a family of [[funeral director|undertakers]] and, before moving into time loops, caused tremendous confusion by frequently bringing the dead to life at his father's funeral parlor.  He is the least liked of Miss Peregrine's wards as the others are put off by his selfish behavior, negative thinking, and obsession with violence.  His previous ymbryne was never specified, nor were his reasons for relocating to Miss Peregrine's loop.\n*'''Olive Abroholos Elephanta''' \u2014 Olive is the second youngest to Claire and comes across as quite giddy and openly friendly. Her peculiarity renders her lighter than air, making her float freely like a balloon.  She has barely any control over it and must always be weighted down or bound to something to keep from floating away.  Her most routine means is a pair of heavy leaden shoes.  \n*'''Hugh Apiston''' \u2014 Hugh is a teenager with bees living in his stomach.  His peculiarity allows him to communicate with them and command them.\n*'''Horace Somnusson''' \u2014 Horace is a young adolescent capable of having prophetic dreams, albeit very scarcely.  They occur most often as nightmares of events so horrifying, they have a tendency to throw him into bouts of shock.  He can be quite a snob and is an extremely passionate follower of fashion, commonly seen in a suit and tie with a top hat and monocle.\n*'''Fiona Frauenfeld''' \u2014 Fiona is a teenager possessing power over plants.  Her peculiarity allows her to manipulate their life and growth and control their movements.  She speaks with a thick Irish accent, though she rarely speaks at all, and has a romantic, [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with Hugh.\n*'''Claire Densmore''' \u2014 The youngest of all Miss Peregrine's wards, Claire also possesses the most grotesque peculiarity in their midst: a second mouth in the back of her head with sharp teeth, hidden beneath her blonde curls.  She is typically cheerful but becomes shy and self-conscious when made to dine with others.\n*'''Victor Bruntley''' \u2014 Miss Peregrine once had many more peculiars under her care, many of whom were killed by the hollowgast, including Bronwyn's older brother Victor.  Like Bronwyn, Victor possessed immense physical strength.  He left during the loop's early days, claiming he couldn't stand being trapped there; it was a reckless decision which led to his demise.  Until his burial when the loop closed, his lifeless body had remained at Miss Peregrine's home, locked away in his bedroom and neatly laid to rest in bed.  Some of the children would occasionally sneak in and have Enoch resurrect him, though he always seemed to be in a rush to get back to the afterlife.\n*'''The Twins''' \u2014 The Twins appear as two short children, wearing sacks on their heads that have holes for the eyes, however without their masks, they have pale gray, scaly skin with gray serpentine eyes and fangs. Not much is known about the Twin's personalities, besides the fact that they are shy and quiet due to the fact that they do not speak to anyone besides each other. Not too much is known about their peculiarity, but in the movie they were capable of turning a Wight into stone with just a glare, similar to Medusa in Greek Mythology. It was believed in the book they had a telepathic bond.\n\n===Ymbrynes===\nAll ymbrynes take on last names which correspond to the type of bird into which they can shapeshift (e.g., Miss Peregrine can turn into a [[peregrine falcon]]).\n\n* '''Alma LeFay Peregrine'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Peregrine is a highly skilled ymbryne and the headmistress of her children's-home. She is a delicate woman who enjoys smoking a pipe and adores her charges, though she can be strict at times.  At a very young age, she learned to hone her peculiarity as a student under Miss Avocet.  Miss Peregrine's loop is located on the fictional island of Cairnholm, Wales, on September 3, 1940, though it's actually September 2 for the first few hours.\n* '''Esmerelda Avocet'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Avocet is an elderly and wise woman from the mid-Victorian period in England.  Having taught most notable ymbrynes to master their craft, she is regarded as near-royalty.  Her loop is in Derbyshire on [[Swithun|July 15]], 1867, but it was invaded by wights and hollowgast, forcing her to flee to Miss Peregrine's loop.\n* '''Miss Nightjar'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Nightjar takes in difficult cases of peculiars.  One such case being Miss Peregrine's former ward, Charlotte.  Miss Nightjar's loop is in Swansea, Wales on April 3, 1901 and is co-run by Miss Thrush.\n* '''Miss Finch'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Finch  has an aunt who is also an ymbryne but prefers to stay in [[finch]] form.  Their loop is based in London, but the date is not stated.\n* '''Millicent Thrush'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Thrush has a loop in London and is headmistress of a children's home there but also co-runs Miss Nightjar's special-care home.\n* '''Miss Kestrel'''&nbsp;\u2014 Possibly a rather historical ymbryne.  Enoch mentions an old story of her being injured in a road accident.  The incident is said to have trapped her in the form of a [[kestrel]] for an entire week, leading to the collapse of her loop before she healed.  Location and date are not stated.\n* '''Balenciaga Wren'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Wren is the headmistress of a menagerie for peculiar animals.  Her loop is based in mainland Wales in a much older, unknown time.\n* '''Miss Gannett'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Gannett has a loop in Ireland, in June of 1770.\n* '''Miss Treecreeper'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Peregrine mentions her name but doesn't remember where or when her loop is based.\n\n===Non-Peculiars===\n* '''Franklin Portman'''&nbsp;\u2014 Jacob's father, Frank, is an unemployed, amateur ornithologist who volunteers at a bird rescue and likes to pass it off as his job.  He also spends much of his time writing manuscripts for nature books, though he's never completed one, giving up on his every project midway.  His whole life, he's had a rather rough relationship with his own father, Abraham, as he was almost never around.  Frank is very protective of his son, but understands his need for room to grow and learn on his own.\n* '''Maryann Portman'''&nbsp;\u2014 Maryann is Jacob's obsessively materialistic mother and Franklin's wife. She comes from a wealthy family that owns a drugstore company with one hundred and fifteen branches across the state of Florida.  While she loves her son and is immensely protective of him, she tends to be more concerned about public image and what people think of them.\n*'''Dr. Golan'''&nbsp;\u2014 Dr. Golan was one of the many peculiars who supported and participated in the disastrous experiment that created the hollowgast.  He is among those who have reached the state of being a wight, a term he disowns as \"their word.\"  He is a licensed psychiatrist and, in order to uncover information on Miss Peregrine's loop, has been stalking the Portman family for years under many a guise including their yard man, Jacob's middle school bus driver Mr. Barron, and ultimately himself when Jacob begins seeing him for therapy.\n*'''Malthus'''&nbsp;\u2014 Malthus was once a peculiar and an old friend of Dr. Golan's who also joined the rebellion against the ymbrynes, dying by the results of the experiment designed to overthrow them and reemerging a hollow.  He now travels with the restored Golan, devouring peculiars as they discover time loops.  For reasons not specified, Golan allowed him to kill Abraham before they could learn the location of Miss Peregrine's loop.  From then on, Malthus haunted Jacob, keeping a vigil on him day and night.\n*'''Martin Pagett'''&nbsp;\u2014 Martin is a part-time but knowledgeable and well-spoken curator of a small museum on Cairnholm, though due to the island's sparse renown and low tourist appeal, they rarely see any patronage.  He strikes up a bond with Jacob, giving him a rundown of Cairnholm's history and assisting him in learning how the children's home was destroyed.  Martin plays an unwitting but vital role in discovering Malthus and Dr. Golan on the island.\n*'''Oggie'''&nbsp;\u2014 Oggie is Martin's uncle, whom he introduces to Jacob in order to help him learn more about the fallen children's home.  Elderly and gruff but still sharp of wit, Oggie recalls the strange children and their reclusive headmistress and recounts the bombing in detail, occasionally veering off into rants on the weather and politics.  Though he longed to fight for his country, he was too young then and merely watched it all take place.\n* '''Susan Portman'''&nbsp;\u2014 Susan is Frank's younger sister and Jacob's aunt.

As Jacob grows older, he begins to doubt the stories until the arrival of his grandfather's death. Blood-strewn, exhausted, and lying in his back garden on the outskirts of Florida Woods, Abraham's last words are a mystery: \"...find the bird in the loop on the other side of the old man's grave on September 3, 1940,<!-- 1940 in this book, 1943 in the film --> and tell them what happened.\" As his grandfather dies, Jacob catches sight of a horrific monster just like the ones described in Abraham's stories. Soon, he starts experiencing trauma and being plagued with nightmares relating to those monsters. Believing their son to be going crazy, Jacob's parents take him to Dr. Golan, a psychiatrist, who suggests that Jacob go to Cairnholm, Wales, the location of his grandfather's children's home to confront the place of his trauma. On his own, Jacob locates and explores the old house only to find it empty and everything caked in dust. According to the local people, the place is haunted and a bomb had killed all its inhabitants many years ago, on September 3, 1940.\n\nSensing a connection, Jacob refuses to give up and returns to the house one more time, where he encounters a mysterious girl who can conjure fire with her hands whom he follows, trying to question her after hearing her call out his grandfather's name. They reach the bogs surrounding the house before Jacob realizes that the people of Cairnholm are different, including the patrons at the inn and his father isn't there. Luckily, a confused Jacob is rescued by the girl from before and an invisible boy, who introduce themselves as Emma Bloom and Millard Nullings respectively. A suspicious Emma holds him captive and brings him to the children's home, where he finds it magically transformed to the paradise of his grandfather's stories, complete with the peculiar children and the \"wise old bird\", who is in fact the headmistress Miss Alma  LeFay Peregrine (named after that well-known raptorous bird of prey the Peregrine Falcon.) There Jacob is also introduced to other peculiar children apart from Emma and Millard: Bronwyn Bruntley, a girl with incredible strength, Claire Densmore, a little girl with an extra mouth at the back of her head, Olive Abroholos Elephanta, a little girl who can levitate, Enoch O'Connor, a boy who can raise the dead by transplanting hearts for a short amount of time, Hugh Apiston, a boy with bees living in his stomach, Fiona Frauenfeld, a girl with an affinity for growing plants, and Horace Somnusson, a boy with prophetic dreams. Shocked and befuddled by the state of the place, Olive and Millard explain that they are currently existing in a [[time loop]], a place where time is constantly reversed and where they all relive the same day every day, September 3, 1940. This is all thanks to Miss Peregrine, a special type of peculiar being known as an ''ymbryne'', one who can shapeshift into birds (namely a Peregrine Falcon after which she is named) and manipulate time. Apart from keeping them alive (if not the bomb would have killed them), this time loop also protects the peculiar children from being hunted by hollowgast&nbsp;\u2014 humanoid, tentacle-mouthed creatures that devour peculiars. That experiment occurred in the Siberian tundra, which was marked by a [[Tunguska Event|cataclysmic explosion]], and from there the hollowgast were born. In addition to hollowgast being a threat, hollows who have consumed enough peculiars are evolved into wights, beings who resemble humans in every aspect save their eyes, which have no pupils. These wights' ultimate goal is to gain power from the peculiars, as well as morph every one of their fellow hollowgast into wights that will rule the world.\n\nSoon, Miss Peregrine's former mentor Miss Avocet arrives at the loop mad with grief over the kidnapping of her wards to wights, who have executed their plan of raiding loops. Fearing for the children's safety, Jacob is tasked with the job of reporting any suspicious information going on in the outside world. With his comings and goings, Jacob and Emma begin to develop feelings for each other, as well as get a glimpse into his own peculiar self: he can see the hollows while other peculiars can't, just like his grandfather. Miss Peregrine's fears are confirmed when eyeless sheep bodies begin to pile up, and Martin, a worker in the Cairnholm Local Museum, is killed. Going against Miss Peregrine's orders to not leave the house, Enoch, Bronwyn, Emma, Jacob and Millard escape, and Enoch uses a sheep heart to briefly bring Martin back to life. Martin manages to inform the group of the presence of a wight on the island, but by then it is too late as one appears right behind them along with a hollow companion. To Jacob's shock, he reveals himself to be Dr. Golan, as well as Jacob's family's hired lawn gardener, and Jacob's middle school bus driver. Jacob refuses Golan's offer to join him in finding peculiars, and decides to stay with his friends. Golan sends his hollow after the group, and Emma and Jacob split up from the rest. After a brief scuffle, Jacob kills it with a pair of sheep shears. They make their way back to the orphanage, but discover that Golan has kidnapped Miss Peregrine and Miss Avocet and locked the rest of the children in the house.\n\nDr. Golan warns them not to attempt to rescue Miss Peregrine and leaves the loop, but Millard manages to sneak out invisibly and follow him. Jacob and his friends follow Millard's tracks and find Golan near a lighthouse trying to catch a boat with his other wight comrades. During the process of saving Miss Peregrine, who is trapped in her bird form, Millard is wounded from a gunshot, but Golan is ultimately killed by Jacob. Just then, the other wights arrive and even though they are able to rescue Miss Peregrine, Miss Avocet is taken away. Returning to the orphanage, they find it destroyed, leaving them having to track down the wights and discover how to help Miss Peregrine. It is then Jacob decides to follow his friends and returns to the present to say goodbye to his father, but promises to return when his mission is finished. Guided by only a prophetic dream from Horace, they set sail to find help.\n\n==Peculiardom==\n\n===Peculiars===\nOtherwise known as ''syndrigast'' (a word meaning \"peculiar spirit\" in the Old Peculiar language, which is in turn the author's adaptation of Old English, or Anglo-Saxon language), peculiar folk are a branch of humanity possessing a second soul which manifests itself in strange ways such as abnormal characteristics and abilities commonly referred to as ''peculiarities''.  Very rarely are peculiar children born to peculiar parents as the essence or gene of peculiarity often skips entire generations, making peculiar population vastly less than that of normal people.\n\n===Ymbrynes===\nAn '''ymbryne''' (pronounced ''IMM-brinn'') is a specific kind of female peculiar who can transform into distinct birds, control and manipulate time as she sees fit, and govern the peculiar world. Most essentially, the ability to control time lets these women possess a period of historical time by looping it, creating a potentially eternal sanctuary for peculiars. They often set out into the present-day world to rescue peculiars in dire situations or to search for those without an ymbryne. ''Ymbryne'' means \"revolution\" or \"circuit\" in Old Peculiar.\n\n===Council of Ymbrynes===\nThe '''Council of Ymbrynes''' is the official government and law of peculiardom. Their responsibilities include the maintenance of loop order, the writing or amending of laws on a regular basis, and the determination of sentences for those convicted of a crime. Members are not specified.\n\n===Time Loops===\n'''Time loops''' are the fabric of the peculiar world, often referred to as peculiardom. Similar to towns, cities, states, and countries, they act as specific locations. Together they create a vast and quite complex world of varying whereabouts and dates only peculiars are able to enter. Within these loops, peculiars live indefinitely without aging or reliving previous experiences, even as the day around them repeats itself. While it may appear to be a form of eternal youth, it is the suspension of time inevitable. In reality, many, if not all, of Miss Peregrine's children are over fifty years old, but the loop detains them as teenagers and small children physically and mentally. A loop must be reset daily or it will collapse, leaving all peculiars within it exposed to the outside world.\n\n===Aging Forward===\nAs a result of time loops, those who reside in them may not be able to return to the present day, depending on how long they've been there.  In a mere matter of hours outside of the loop, the amount of time evaded will catch up.  An example of this is Miss Peregrine's own former ward, a young girl named Charlotte who left the loop while Miss Peregrine was away.  She was discovered by police in the mid-1980s and sent to a welfare agency.  When Miss Peregrine found her just two days later, she'd already aged thirty-five years.  Although she survived the ordeal, the unnatural aging process had caused Charlotte a great deal of mental disorder, and she was sent to live with Miss Nightjar, an ymbryne more suited for her care.  The same process of deterioration applies to anything taken out of time loops as another instance was an apple Jacob took back to the inn where he and his father were staying in the present day. He left it on the nightstand next to his bed as he fell asleep that night, but by morning, found it had rotted to the point of disintegrating.\n\n===Hollowgast===\nA word meaning \"empty spirit\". The '''hollowgast''' are monsters who feed on peculiars. They were created by a freak-accident in an unethical and illegal experiment conducted by Miss Peregrine's two brothers. Hundreds had joined their cause, and with the aid of misguided but powerful ymbrynes, it was intended to achieve immortality without the limitations of time loops. Instead, it led to a catastrophic collapse that destroyed half of Siberia where the experiment took place. Everyone involved was presumed dead, but their corpses became deformed and crawled back to a lesser, animalistic state of life. Apart from their shadows, hollows are invisible to all but a gifted few including Abraham and Jacob Portman. They are also identified by the groups of large tentacle-like tongues that occupy their grotesquely stretched mouths. It is speculated that this outcome was the result of being reverse-aged to a time before their souls existed, thus the word ''hollowgast''. Their souls having been erased, hollows possess no form of peculiarity and cannot enter time loops.\n\n===Wights===\nIf a hollow consumes enough peculiar souls, its original human form is restored, with the exception of irises and pupils leaving the eyes entirely white.  Because of this, peculiars refer to these evolved creatures as '''wights'''.  They possess no extraordinary abilities but are highly skilled in posing as normal people under multiple identities and can even pass into time loops.  Much of their existence revolves around procuring peculiars for remaining hollows to devour. Once they set their eyes on a peculiar child, they will follow them around. As they did with Jacob all the way to the island.\n\n==Characters==\n===Peculiar Children===\n*'''Jacob Magellan Portman''' \u2014 A 16-year-old American teenager and the protagonist of the story.  Jacob becomes subject to [[acute stress reaction]] after witnessing his grandfather's death and claiming that a monster from his grandfather's childhood stories had killed him.  Everyone he knows begins to consider him crazy and avoids him.  His parents eventually take him to see a psychiatrist, on whose instruction Jacob's dad takes him on a trip to the Welsh island where his grandfather grew up.  There, Jacob discovers that the stories of a magical orphanage and peculiar children are real and so is the monster.  He also learns that the ability to see these monsters is actually an extremely rare peculiarity as they are invisible to all but a few like himself.\n*'''Abraham Portman''' \u2014 Abraham was Jacob's grandfather who also had the peculiarity of seeing the monsters.  He left Miss Peregrine's loop as a young man to join both the war against Germany and the war against the hollowgast, promising to make a home in America for his fellow peculiars.  But having started a family of his own during his time in the normal world, he never went back for them.  In spite of this, he was still pressured into eradicating hollows, resulting in long, frequent hunting-trips away from his wife and two children, a secret which they took as careless neglect.  Over the years, Abraham became a near-stranger to everyone he knew and, in his old age, was killed by one of the very monsters he had fought so valiantly to defeat.  Police simply concluded that dementia and an attack by wild animals were the cause of his death.\n*'''Emma''' '''Bloom'''\u2014 Emma is a teenager under Miss Peregrine's care. Her peculiarity manifested in her hands when she was ten years old.  They began to glow red, becoming painfully hot to the point of generating fire. Emma had a romantic relationship with Abraham which they maintained even as he went to war until he stopped responding to her letters.  After years without replying, Abraham finally wrote her back simply to tell her he could no longer do so because he'd married another woman.  Emma became heartbroken and bitter but still mourned him upon learning of his death when his grandson Jacob arrived in Miss Peregrine's time loop.  Although she treated Jacob harshly at first, their mutual sorrow for Abraham started a deeply sincere relationship between them.  \n*'''Millard Nullings''' \u2014 Millard is a young adolescent possessing the peculiarity of invisibility which is said to be quite uncommon.  He chooses to go about nude to stay fully invisible, but wears clothes at supper on Miss Peregrine's orders.  He is also exceptionally well-versed in all things peculiar and, as a hobby, spends much of his time documenting every little detail of the day they live in.\n*'''Bronwyn Bruntley''' \u2014 A young adolescent possessing super-human strength, Bronwyn is also kindhearted and a loyal friend.  She respects and obeys Miss Peregrine more than her fellow wards do, often correcting them and citing rules they're meant to follow, mostly in fear of anyone getting in trouble.  The only occasions for which she refuses to cooperate are when she is made to dress lady-like.  Before Miss Peregrine took her and her older brother Victor in, Bronwyn discovered her own strength at the age of ten when she snapped their abusive stepfather's neck without actually meaning to.\n*'''Enoch O'Connor''' \u2014 A young adolescent with the ability to [[necromancy|resurrect the dead]] and bring inanimate objects to life for a limited time by using the extracted organs of other living things.  Enoch was born to a family of [[funeral director|undertakers]] and, before moving into time loops, caused tremendous confusion by frequently bringing the dead to life at his father's funeral parlor.  He is the least liked of Miss Peregrine's wards as the others are put off by his selfish behavior, negative thinking, and obsession with violence.  His previous ymbryne was never specified, nor were his reasons for relocating to Miss Peregrine's loop.\n*'''Olive Abroholos Elephanta''' \u2014 Olive is the second youngest to Claire and comes across as quite giddy and openly friendly. Her peculiarity renders her lighter than air, making her float freely like a balloon.  She has barely any control over it and must always be weighted down or bound to something to keep from floating away.  Her most routine means is a pair of heavy leaden shoes.  \n*'''Hugh Apiston''' \u2014 Hugh is a teenager with bees living in his stomach.  His peculiarity allows him to communicate with them and command them.\n*'''Horace Somnusson''' \u2014 Horace is a young adolescent capable of having prophetic dreams, albeit very scarcely.  They occur most often as nightmares of events so horrifying, they have a tendency to throw him into bouts of shock.  He can be quite a snob and is an extremely passionate follower of fashion, commonly seen in a suit and tie with a top hat and monocle.\n*'''Fiona Frauenfeld''' \u2014 Fiona is a teenager possessing power over plants.  Her peculiarity allows her to manipulate their life and growth and control their movements.  She speaks with a thick Irish accent, though she rarely speaks at all, and has a romantic, [[symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with Hugh.\n*'''Claire Densmore''' \u2014 The youngest of all Miss Peregrine's wards, Claire also possesses the most grotesque peculiarity in their midst: a second mouth in the back of her head with sharp teeth, hidden beneath her blonde curls.  She is typically cheerful but becomes shy and self-conscious when made to dine with others.\n*'''Victor Bruntley''' \u2014 Miss Peregrine once had many more peculiars under her care, many of whom were killed by the hollowgast, including Bronwyn's older brother Victor.  Like Bronwyn, Victor possessed immense physical strength.  He left during the loop's early days, claiming he couldn't stand being trapped there; it was a reckless decision which led to his demise.  Until his burial when the loop closed, his lifeless body had remained at Miss Peregrine's home, locked away in his bedroom and neatly laid to rest in bed.  Some of the children would occasionally sneak in and have Enoch resurrect him, though he always seemed to be in a rush to get back to the afterlife.\n*'''The Twins''' \u2014 The Twins appear as two short children, wearing sacks on their heads that have holes for the eyes, however without their masks, they have pale gray, scaly skin with gray serpentine eyes and fangs. Not much is known about the Twin's personalities, besides the fact that they are shy and quiet due to the fact that they do not speak to anyone besides each other. Not too much is known about their peculiarity, but in the movie they were capable of turning a Wight into stone with just a glare, similar to Medusa in Greek Mythology. It was believed in the book they had a telepathic bond.\n\n===Ymbrynes===\nAll ymbrynes take on last names which correspond to the type of bird into which they can shapeshift (e.g., Miss Peregrine can turn into a [[peregrine falcon]]).\n\n* '''Alma LeFay Peregrine'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Peregrine is a highly skilled ymbryne and the headmistress of her children's-home. She is a delicate woman who enjoys smoking a pipe and adores her charges, though she can be strict at times.  At a very young age, she learned to hone her peculiarity as a student under Miss Avocet.  Miss Peregrine's loop is located on the fictional island of Cairnholm, Wales, on September 3, 1940, though it's actually September 2 for the first few hours.\n* '''Esmerelda Avocet'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Avocet is an elderly and wise woman from the mid-Victorian period in England.  Having taught most notable ymbrynes to master their craft, she is regarded as near-royalty.  Her loop is in Derbyshire on [[Swithun|July 15]], 1867, but it was invaded by wights and hollowgast, forcing her to flee to Miss Peregrine's loop.\n* '''Miss Nightjar'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Nightjar takes in difficult cases of peculiars.  One such case being Miss Peregrine's former ward, Charlotte.  Miss Nightjar's loop is in Swansea, Wales on April 3, 1901 and is co-run by Miss Thrush.\n* '''Miss Finch'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Finch  has an aunt who is also an ymbryne but prefers to stay in [[finch]] form.  Their loop is based in London, but the date is not stated.\n* '''Millicent Thrush'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Thrush has a loop in London and is headmistress of a children's home there but also co-runs Miss Nightjar's special-care home.\n* '''Miss Kestrel'''&nbsp;\u2014 Possibly a rather historical ymbryne.  Enoch mentions an old story of her being injured in a road accident.  The incident is said to have trapped her in the form of a [[kestrel]] for an entire week, leading to the collapse of her loop before she healed.  Location and date are not stated.\n* '''Balenciaga Wren'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Wren is the headmistress of a menagerie for peculiar animals.  Her loop is based in mainland Wales in a much older, unknown time.\n* '''Miss Gannett'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Gannett has a loop in Ireland, in June of 1770.\n* '''Miss Treecreeper'''&nbsp;\u2014 Miss Peregrine mentions her name but doesn't remember where or when her loop is based.\n\n===Non-Peculiars===\n* '''Franklin Portman'''&nbsp;\u2014 Jacob's father, Frank, is an unemployed, amateur ornithologist who volunteers at a bird rescue and likes to pass it off as his job.  He also spends much of his time writing manuscripts for nature books, though he's never completed one, giving up on his every project midway.  His whole life, he's had a rather rough relationship with his own father, Abraham, as he was almost never around.  Frank is very protective of his son, but understands his need for room to grow and learn on his own.\n* '''Maryann Portman'''&nbsp;\u2014 Maryann is Jacob's obsessively materialistic mother and Franklin's wife. She comes from a wealthy family that owns a drugstore company with one hundred and fifteen branches across the state of Florida.  While she loves her son and is immensely protective of him, she tends to be more concerned about public image and what people think of them.\n*'''Dr. Golan'''&nbsp;\u2014 Dr. Golan was one of the many peculiars who supported and participated in the disastrous experiment that created the hollowgast.  He is among those who have reached the state of being a wight, a term he disowns as \"their word.\"  He is a licensed psychiatrist and, in order to uncover information on Miss Peregrine's loop, has been stalking the Portman family for years under many a guise including their yard man, Jacob's middle school bus driver Mr. Barron, and ultimately himself when Jacob begins seeing him for therapy.\n*'''Malthus'''&nbsp;\u2014 Malthus was once a peculiar and an old friend of Dr. Golan's who also joined the rebellion against the ymbrynes, dying by the results of the experiment designed to overthrow them and reemerging a hollow.  He now travels with the restored Golan, devouring peculiars as they discover time loops.  For reasons not specified, Golan allowed him to kill Abraham before they could learn the location of Miss Peregrine's loop.  From then on, Malthus haunted Jacob, keeping a vigil on him day and night.\n*'''Martin Pagett'''&nbsp;\u2014 Martin is a part-time but knowledgeable and well-spoken curator of a small museum on Cairnholm, though due to the island's sparse renown and low tourist appeal, they rarely see any patronage.  He strikes up a bond with Jacob, giving him a rundown of Cairnholm's history and assisting him in learning how the children's home was destroyed.  Martin plays an unwitting but vital role in discovering Malthus and Dr. Golan on the island.\n*'''Oggie'''&nbsp;\u2014 Oggie is Martin's uncle, whom he introduces to Jacob in order to help him learn more about the fallen children's home.  Elderly and gruff but still sharp of wit, Oggie recalls the strange children and their reclusive headmistress and recounts the bombing in detail, occasionally veering off into rants on the weather and politics.  Though he longed to fight for his country, he was too young then and merely watched it all take place.\n* '''Susan Portman'''&nbsp;\u2014 Susan is Frank's younger sister and Jacob's aunt.  While going through Abraham's possessions with them after his passing, she found his copy of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|''The Selected Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson'']] and that he had written a brief well-wish to Jacob on the title page.  When she gives it to him on his birthday, Jacob unwittingly discovers a letter from Miss Peregrine when it fell out from between the pages.\n*'''Ricky'''&nbsp;\u2014 Ricky is described as Jacob's best and only friend, though their relationship is more of a deal for personal benefit: in exchange for Jacob helping Ricky with his homework, Ricky acts as Jacob's bodyguard at school.\n\n==Reception==\n''Miss Peregrine's'' spent seventy weeks on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Sellers list]] for children's chapter books.

It was founded in 1907, when [[Transylvania]] was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and the current name \"CFR\" is the [[acronym]] for ''[[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]]'' (\"Romanian Railways\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19588706 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Champions League: What can Manchester United expect in Cluj? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on [[List of foreign Liga I players|foreign players]] for its success. In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 campaign]], they were champions of [[Liga I]] for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from [[Bucharest|capital]]-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed.

({{IPA-ro|t\u0361\u0283efe\u02ccre \u02c8klu\u0292}} or {{IPA-ro|\u02cct\u0361\u0283efere \u02c8klu\u0292|}}), is a Romanian professional [[association football|football]] [[football team|club]] based in the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]], [[Cluj County]]. It was founded in 1907, when [[Transylvania]] was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and the current name \"CFR\" is the [[acronym]] for ''[[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]]'' (\"Romanian Railways\").<ref>{{cite web|last=Hafez |first=Shamoon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19588706 |title=BBC Sport&nbsp;\u2013 Champions League: What can Manchester United expect in Cluj? |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=3 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nBefore receiving significant financial support from previous owner \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny in 2002, the club had spent most of its existence in the lower divisions. Since returning to the top flight in 2004, CFR Cluj has relied increasingly on [[List of foreign Liga I players|foreign players]] for its success. In the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 season]], they participated in their first [[UEFA|European competition]], the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup|Intertoto Cup]], finishing as runners-up. In the [[2007\u201308 Liga I|2007\u201308 campaign]], they were champions of [[Liga I]] for the first time in their history, taking the national title away from [[Bucharest|capital]]-based teams after seventeen years and consequently qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage in the process. Only six years earlier, CFR was playing in the [[Liga III|third tier]] of the [[Romanian football league system]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/7640867.stm | work=BBC News | title=Scolari forewarned | date=28 September 2008 | accessdate=28 April 2010}}</ref> Between [[2017\u201318 Liga I|2018]] and [[2018\u201319 Liga I|2019]], \"the White and Burgundies\" won back-to-back championships for the first time. CFR has won a total of twelve domestic trophies, all in the [[21st century]]\u2014five Liga I, four [[Cupa Rom\u00e2niei]], and three [[Supercupa Rom\u00e2niei]].\n\nCFR has a fierce rivalry with neighbouring [[FC Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], with matches between the two being known as the ''[[Cluj derby|Derbiul Clujului]]''.\n\n==History==\n\n===Establishment and early years (1907\u20131969)===\n[[File:Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club 1911.jpg|260px|thumb|''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' team in 1911.]]\nCFR was founded in 1907, when the city of [[Cluj-Napoca]] (then Kolozsv\u00e1r) was part of [[Austria-Hungary]], under the name ''Kolozsv\u00e1ri Vasutas Sport Club'' (\"Kolozsv\u00e1r Railway Sports Club\"). From 1907 to 1910, the team played in the municipal championship. However, the club did not have any notable achievements during this time. In 1911, the team won the newly organized Championship of Transylvania. The club consistently finished in second place in that competition between 1911 and 1914, a competition that was interrupted because of [[World War I]]. After the war, in 1920, Transylvania became part of Romania and the club accordingly changed its name to '''CFR Cluj''', maintaining its links with the national rail organisation, this time the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian]] state railway carrier, [[C\u0103ile Ferate Rom\u00e2ne]], hence the acronym. They went on to win two regional titles, in 1918\u201319 and 1919\u201320.\n\nBetween 1920 and 1934 the club did not have any notable achievements. Between 1934 and 1936, CFR played for two seasons in the [[Divizia B]], ranking sixth in the [[1934\u201335 Divizia B|1934\u201335 season]] and eighth in the [[1935\u201336 Divizia B|1935\u201336 season]]. In 1936, CFR was relegated to the [[Divizia C]], where the team played for two seasons, finishing [[1936\u201337 Divizia C|second]] and 4th, respectively. After [[World War II]], CFR played for one season in the Divizia C, earning the promotion to the Divizia B. Before the start of the [[1947\u201348 Divizia B|1947\u201348 season]], the team merged with another local club, [[Ferar Cluj]], and played in the [[Divizia A]] for the [[1947\u201348 Divizia A|very first time]] in history. Unfortunately, the team [[1948\u201349 Divizia A|lasted only two years in the first league]] and would not play there again for another 20 years. In 1960, another merger, this time with [[Dermata Cluj|Rapid Cluj]] resulted in ''CSM Cluj''. In 1964, the team's name was changed to ''Clujeana''. In that same year, the club's junior team won the national championship. Three years later, the team's name was reversed yet again to '''CFR Cluj'''.\n\n===Return to the top flight (1969\u20131976)===\n[[File:CFR Cluj League Performance.svg|thumb|right|290px|Chart of yearly table positions of CFR in the national leagues.]]\nIn [[1968\u201369 Divizia B|1969]], CFR finished first in Divizia B with 40 points, five more than their rival, [[FC Politehnica Timi\u0219oara|Politehnica Timi\u0219oara]]. The conclusive game of that season was a 1\u20131 draw with Politehnica. Politehnica had a 1\u20130 lead at half-time, but CFR came back with a fine header.\n\nDuring the summer of 1969, CFR Cluj advanced to Divizia A under the leadership of coach [[Constantin R\u0103dulescu (footballer, born 1924)|Constantin R\u0103dulescu]]. R\u0103dulescu was originally from southern Romania, but he grew to manhood in the stern atmosphere of [[Transylvania]]. Before coaching, he had played for CFR and another well-known local team, [[CFM Universitatea Cluj|Universitatea Cluj]], during the 1940s. In the [[1969\u201370 Divizia A|1969\u201370 first league championship]], CFR made its debut with a 2\u20130 victory over [[ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1962)|ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219]]. The next few games did not go as well. Apart from a 1\u20130 win over [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]], there were losses to [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]] (1\u20133) and [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] (0\u20132). These and other defeats were a factor in the team's downhill slide. However, the following spring CFR bounced back with a win over ASA T\u00e2rgu Mure\u0219 (1\u20130), after a goal from [[Octavian Ionescu (footballer, born 1949)|Octavian Ionescu]], and averted relegation.\n\nAt the beginning of CFR's [[1970\u201371 Divizia A|second season in Divizia A]], R\u0103dulescu was replaced by [[Eugen Iordache]] as head coach. During his tenure, CFR did not do well, and R\u0103dulescu was swiftly brought back. Even so, CFR Cluj found itself again at the bottom of the table before the winter break. The spring of 1971 was somewhat better, although CFR struggled again to avoid relegation. CFR's last game of that season, against [[FCM UTA Arad|UTA Arad]], was a memorable one. CFR led 1\u20130 at half-time. UTA Arad, however, overturned the match after scoring twice. Nonetheless, the persistence of the players from Cluj was rewarded with a late goal, tying the game at 2\u20132. UTA went on to [[1970\u201371 European Cup|play in the European Cups]], but, most importantly, CFR avoided relegation.\n\nThe [[1971\u201372 Divizia A|1971\u201372 season]] started off badly for CFR. Losses to Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti (1\u20133); [[FC Bihor Oradea|Cri\u0219ul Oradea]] (0\u20131, after a last-minute penalty kick), and [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] (1\u20132 after two regrettable own-goals) meant CFR's demise after the first round of the championship&nbsp;\u2013 the team finished at the bottom, with seven points. CFR's return was dramatic, although inconsistent at times. The team won some important games, such as a 1\u20130 with [[CS Universitatea Craiova|Universitatea Craiova]] and a 3\u20130 with [[FC Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti|Petrolul Ploie\u0219ti]]. By the end of the season, however, CFR was again struggling to stay in Divizia A. CFR was tied at half-time after having led with 2\u20130 in their game against [[FC Politehnica Ia\u0219i (1945)|Politehnica Ia\u0219i]]. In the second half, two late goals from Ionescu and Petrescu saved the team from relegation. When R\u0103dulescu and his players got back home to Cluj, 3,000 fans turned out to celebrate their performance.\n\nDuring the summer of 1972, CFR made an important transfer. [[Mihai Adam]], from Universitatea Cluj, was traded for Soos. Adam had been twice Romania's top scorer, and was considered one of the best Romanian players of his generation. He and the rest of the team would make the [[1972\u201373 Divizia A|1972\u201373 season]] the most successful in CFR's history. The team achieved its highest ranking ever in Romanian football, fifth in Divizia A. Several important results concluded a great season, including a 2\u20130 victory against [[FC Rapid Bucure\u0219ti|Rapid Bucure\u0219ti]], a 2\u20132 draw against [[FC Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti|Sportul Studen\u021besc Bucure\u0219ti]], and another draw, 1\u20131, with Steaua Bucure\u0219ti. Additionally, the stadium that CFR continues to use even today was built in 1973. To celebrate the completion of the stadium, CFR Cluj played a friendly game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. The game ended in a 2\u20131 victory for CFR.\n\nThe [[1973\u201374 Divizia A|1973\u201374 season]] was a rather bad one for CFR, as it barely saved itself from relegation, ranking 14th at the end of the season. The only notable achievement of that season was Mihai Adam's third title as Romania's top goal-scorer who, even though he was 33 years old, scored 23 goals. The [[1974\u201375 Divizia A|1974\u201375 season]] was much like the one before: CFR struggled to avoid relegation, achieving its objectives all the while. The [[1975\u201376 Divizia A|1975\u201376 season]] marked CFR's relegation and its last season in Divizia A during the 20th century. A contributing factor was the age of the team, with most of its players in their 30s.\n\n===Lower leagues (1976\u20132002)===\nDuring the [[1977\u201378 Divizia B|1977\u201378 season]], CFR attempted to make a comeback. However, the team finished only second in [[Divizia B]], after [[FC Baia Mare|Baia Mare]]. Four years later, [[1981\u201382 Divizia B|CFR slid further down]], into the third division, [[Divizia C]]. From then on, the team would alternate between the second and third leagues. In 1983, CFR played in Divizia B under its longstanding coach, Dr. Constantin R\u0103dulescu. In the 1990s, CFR struggled financially and found itself more than once on the brink of bankruptcy. Nevertheless, several very talented players were raised, including [[Cristian Dulca]], Attila Piro\u0219ka, [[Cristian Coroian]], and [[Alin Minteuan]].\n\n===P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny takeover, ascent and first European participation (2002\u20132007)===\nIn January 2002, a new sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, head of S.C. ECOMAX M.G., founded a new commercial sport society, with ECOMAX M.G. as the primary shareholder. By the end of the [[2001\u201302 Divizia C|2001\u201302 season]], CFR had been promoted back to Divizia B.\n\nThe [[2002\u201303 Divizia B|summer of 2003]] was very important for CFR as many new talented players were transferred including C\u0103t\u0103lin Bozdog, [[Adrian Anca]], Cristian Turcu, and Sabin P\u00eegli\u0219an. With these players and others, CFR entered the first league after [[2003\u201304 Divizia B|a successful season in Divizia B]]. CFR began the season strongly, holding first place for a while. Then the club's main sponsor, \u00c1rp\u00e1d P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny, became involved in a public scandal during which P\u00e1szk\u00e1ny accused several referees of corruption. The affair plagued the team and resulted in the dismissal of head coach GH. Cioceri. CFR lost several consecutive games before the scandal subsided. After the winter break, Cioceri was replaced by [[Aurel Sunda]]. In the spring of 2004, Sunda's team had a nearly perfect run, winning 14 out of 15 games, with only one draw. One round before the season's end, CFR was in second place, one point behind the [[CS Jiul Petro\u0219ani|Jiul Petro\u0219ani]] in first. But when Jiul was held to a draw by [[CS Gaz Metan Media\u0219|Gaz Metan Media\u0219]], and CFR won their last match 3\u20130, CFR advanced to the top of the league for the first time in 28 years. In the summer of 2004, CFR acquired many new players, including [[Vasile Jula]] and [[Radu Marginean]].\n\nCFR Cluj's [[2004\u201305 Divizia A|first year back in Divizia A]] was strong, yet inconsistent. CFR finished sixth after the first half of the 2004\u201305 championship. It was during this time that CFR played one of its most popular games ever, defeating, [[FC Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti|Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti]] at home. The final score was 4\u20132, after two goals each by Adrian Anca and Sorin Oncic\u0103. However, the second half of the championship proved disappointing for CFR, as it gathered only 12 points after 15 games. The team finished 11th, avoiding relegation.\n\nThe summer of 2005 brought significant change to CFR Cluj. The club's executives signed the team up for the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], being CFR's first European adventure. CFR began well, qualifying for the second round after two victories against [[FK Vetra]] (3\u20132 and 4\u20131).\n\nAlso, the Romanian international [[Dorinel Munteanu]] came to CFR from [[FC Steaua Bucure\u0219ti|Steaua Bucure\u0219ti]]. Munteanu would have the dual role of player-coach. His first game produced one of CFR's greatest successes. CFR defeated [[Athletic Bilbao]] of Spain 1\u20130 (although almost all players from Bilbao's side were from the reserve squad) during the second round of the [[2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. The only goal of the match was scored by [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] with a header. CFR then lost in [[Bilbao]] (1\u20130) but still qualified to the next round after a penalty shootout.\n\nMunteanu's team played the next game at Cluj, against French club [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]]. Adrian Anca played one of the greatest games in his career, even though the match ended in a 1\u20131 draw. Anca hit the crossbar with a header early in the game, and Tilinc\u0103 pushed the ball into the net from the rebound. Anca then went on to earn a penalty, but did not score. He then hit the crossbar a second time in the second half. The away game, in [[France]], was also an eventful game for CFR Cluj. The game began well for CFR, as [[Cristian Coroian]] scored from a penalty kick, earned by Adrian Anca. The second half went less smoothly for CFR; [[Julien Sabl\u00e9]] scored for Saint-\u00c9tienne, tying the game at 1\u20131. This was followed by CFR player [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Balint]]'s elimination. However, a [[Cosmin Tilinc\u0103]] goal gave the team the ability to tie with the French at the very last minute. The game ended in a 2\u20132 draw, so CFR went on to the next qualifying stage due to its away goals. In the next round CFR easily disposed of [[Zalgiris Vilnius]], 2\u20131 in [[Lithuania]] and 5\u20131 at home.\n\nFor the final match of the 2005 UEFA Interoto Cup, CFR Cluj's opponent was another French franchise, [[RC Lens]]. The first game, at Cluj, ended in a 1\u20131 draw with both sides having scored from free kicks. Cristian Turcu scored for CFR. The second game was played at [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]] in front of 30,000 French fans. The Romanian players showed signs of exhaustion and conceded three goals. Player-coach Dorinel Munteanu scored a goal from a free kick in the 89th minute. Thus ended CFR Cluj's Intertoto journey. CFR then finished fifth at the end of the [[2005\u201306 Divizia A|2005\u201306 domestic season]]. During the [[2006\u201307 Liga I|2006\u201307 season]], major changes at the club started to occur. Dorinel Munteanu resigned as player-coach, and was replaced by [[Cristiano Bergodi]]. Foreign players from Western Europe and South America were transferred. A partnership with Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] was signed.

The airport is also near the intersections of three major freeways, [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]], [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]], and [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]].\n\n=== Highways ===\nThe San Jose area has a large freeway system, including three [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate freeways]] and one [[United States Numbered Highways|U.S. Route]]. It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network [[Interstate Highway System#Planning|was planned]] by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later.\n\n[[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] runs south to the [[California Central Coast]] and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] to San Francisco. [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of San Francisco Peninsula. [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] heads north to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]] parallels I-880 to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n[[File:HTC Columbia (5584076774).jpg|thumb|Right|The 2010 [[Amgen Tour of California|Amgen ''Tour of California'']] outside the [[Fairmont San Jose]].]]\nSeveral state highways also serve San Jose: [[California State Route 17|SR 17]], [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], [[California State Route 87|SR 87]] and [[California State Route 237|SR 237]]. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], [[San Tomas Expressway]], and [[Lawrence Expressway]].\n\nSeveral regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.\n\nThe interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101, a rush-hour spot where the three freeways meet, has been known to have high-density traffic similar to [[Los Angeles County]] interchanges. It was constructed years before its completion. The two bridges, with no on-ramps or off-ramps stood over U.S. 101 at a 110-foot tall during the 70's, before opening in 1981. In 2010, the interchange was named the [[Joe Colla Interchange]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |title=Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 102 \u2013 Joe Colla Interchange |publisher=California State Legislature |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110181018/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n'''Major highways:'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[File:I-280 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]]\n* [[File:I-680 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]]\n* [[File:I-880 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]]\n* [[File:US 101 (1961 cutout).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]]\n* [[File:California 17.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]]\n* [[File:California 82.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 82|State Route 82]]\n* [[File:California 85.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 85|State Route 85]]\n* [[File:California 87.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]]\n* [[File:California 130.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 130|State Route 130]]\n* [[File:California 237.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Bicycling ===\n{{main|Cycling in San Jose, California}}\nCentral San Jose has seen a gradual expansion of bike lanes over the past decade, which now comprise a network of car-traffic-separated and buffered bike lanes. [[San Jose Bike Party]] is a volunteer-run monthly social cycling event that attracts up to 1,000 participants during summer months to \"build community through bicycling\". Unfortunately, fewer than one percent of city residents ride bicycles to work<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov|title=Table S0801, Commuting Characteristics By Sex, 2012\u20132017 American Community Survey for San Jose, California.|last=|first=|date=December 31, 2018|website=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=}}</ref> as their primary mode of transportation, a statistic unchanged in the past ten years.

These trails extend from near downtown San Jose for dozens of miles to the north and south, and are connected with each other via bicycle routes of varying quality. The city is planning to construct new trail extensions in coming years including the Three Creeks Trail and San Tomas Aquino Creek Trail.\n\n== Notable people ==\n{{main|List of people from San Jose, California}}\n\n== Sister cities ==\nSan Jose has one of the oldest [[Twin towns and Sister cities|Sister City programs]] in the nation. In 1957, when the city established a relationship with Okayama, Japan, it was only the third Sister City relationship in the nation, which had begun the prior year. The Office of Economic Development coordinates the San Jose Sister City Program which is part of [[Sister Cities International]]. {{As of|2014}}, there are eight [[sister cities]]:<ref>{{cite web

It is, however, the largest city in the country not served by a primary Interstate; most of the Interstate Highway Network [[Interstate Highway System#Planning|was planned]] by the early 1950s well before San Jose's rapid growth decades later.\n\n[[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. 101]] runs south to the [[California Central Coast]] and Los Angeles, and then runs north up near the eastern shore of the [[San Francisco Peninsula]] to San Francisco. [[Interstate 280 (California)|I-280]] also heads to San Francisco, but goes along just to the west of the cities of San Francisco Peninsula. [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] heads north to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], running parallel to the southeastern shore of [[San Francisco Bay]]. [[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]] parallels I-880 to [[Fremont, California|Fremont]], but then cuts northeast to the eastern cities of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].\n[[File:HTC Columbia (5584076774).jpg|thumb|Right|The 2010 [[Amgen Tour of California|Amgen ''Tour of California'']] outside the [[Fairmont San Jose]].]]\nSeveral state highways also serve San Jose: [[California State Route 17|SR 17]], [[California State Route 85|SR 85]], [[California State Route 87|SR 87]] and [[California State Route 237|SR 237]]. Additionally, San Jose is served by a system of county-wide expressways, which includes the [[Almaden Expressway]], [[Capitol Expressway]], [[San Tomas Expressway]], and [[Lawrence Expressway]].\n\nSeveral regional transportation projects have been undertaken in recent years to deal with congestion on San Jose freeways. This includes expansion of [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]] including more lanes near the downtown San Jose area.\n\nThe interchange for I-280 connecting with I-680 and U.S. 101, a rush-hour spot where the three freeways meet, has been known to have high-density traffic similar to [[Los Angeles County]] interchanges. It was constructed years before its completion. The two bridges, with no on-ramps or off-ramps stood over U.S. 101 at a 110-foot tall during the 70's, before opening in 1981. In 2010, the interchange was named the [[Joe Colla Interchange]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |title=Assembly Concurrent Resolution No. 102 \u2013 Joe Colla Interchange |publisher=California State Legislature |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110181018/http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100ACR102 |archive-date=November 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n'''Major highways:'''\n{{Div col|colwidth=14em}}\n* [[File:I-280 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 280 (California)|Interstate 280]]\n* [[File:I-680 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 680 (California)|Interstate 680]]\n* [[File:I-880 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 880 (California)|Interstate 880]]\n* [[File:US 101 (1961 cutout).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 101 in California|U.S. Route 101]]\n* [[File:California 17.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 17|State Route 17]]\n* [[File:California 82.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 82|State Route 82]]\n* [[File:California 85.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 85|State Route 85]]\n* [[File:California 87.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 87|State Route 87]]\n* [[File:California 130.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 130|State Route 130]]\n* [[File:California 237.svg|20px]] [[California State Route 237|State Route 237]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n=== Bicycling ===\n{{main|Cycling in San Jose, California}}\nCentral San Jose has seen a gradual expansion of bike lanes over the past decade, which now comprise a network of car-traffic-separated and buffered bike lanes.

The show was produced for [[CBBC]] by [[Lion Television]] with Citrus Television and ran from 2009 to 2013 for five series of thirteen half-hour episodes, with additional one-off seasonal and Olympic specials.\n\nThe TV show carries over the graphic style and much of the content of the [[Horrible Histories (book series)|''Horrible Histories'' book series]]. It maintains the franchise's overall irreverent but accurate focus on the dark, gruesome or scatological aspects of British and other [[Western world]] history, spanning from the [[Stone Age]] to the post-[[World War II]] era. Individual historical eras or civilisations are defined and named as in the books, with sketches from several different time periods combined within a single episode. [[Live-action]] sketches\u2014which often parody other UK media or celebrities\u2014and music videos are intercut with animations and quizzes. The starring troupe are [[Mathew Baynton]], [[Simon Farnaby]], [[Martha Howe-Douglas]], [[Jim Howick]], [[Laurence Rickard]], [[Sarah Hadland]] and [[Ben Willbond]], alongside a large supporting cast headed by [[Katy Wix]], [[Lawry Lewin]], [[Alice Lowe]] and [[Dominique Moore]]. The black rat puppet \"host\", Rattus Rattus, appears in short bridging segments, explaining the factual basis for each sketch.\n\nThe [[Horrible Histories troupe|creative team]] was largely recruited from the mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as ''[[Blackadder]]'' and the [[Monty Python]] films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive approach. It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.\n\nIn 2011, a spin-off game show, ''[[Horrible Histories: Gory Games]]'', was launched on CBBC. In the same year, the original show was repackaged for main channel [[BBC One]] as ''[[Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry]]'', with [[Stephen Fry|Fry]] replacing the puppet, Rattus Rattus, as presenter. [[Horrible Histories (2015 TV series)|A new series of special episodes]] began airing in 2015, featuring a new format and cast. Although the original series has ended, it continues to be frequently repeated on the [[CBBC Channel]] daily.\n\n==Background==\n''Horrible Histories'' is based on [[Horrible Histories (book series)|the British children's historical-comedy book series]] by [[Terry Deary]], first published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic UK]] in 1993 and since expanded into a [[Horrible Histories|multimedia franchise]]. The books and subsequent spin-off materials are intended to pique young children's interest in history via short, factually based but humorously told anecdotes highlighting aspects of the subject not usually covered in more traditional educational sources.<ref name=\"scanlon\">{{cite journal | title=History beyond the academy: humor and horror in children's history books | journal=New Review of Children's Literature and Librarianship, 16:2, 69\u201391|volume = 16| issue=2| pages=69\u201391|year=2011| author=Scanlon, Margaret| doi=10.1080/13614541.2010.540197 }}</ref>\n\nLionTV executive producer Richard Bradley, whose company had previously produced several adult history-themed programmes and whose son was a fan of the ''Horrible Histories'' books, was the initial driving force behind a new TV adaptation.<ref name=\"guardian_a\">{{cite web|author=Hickman, Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/17/horrible-histories-huge-hit |title=How Horrible Histories became a huge hit|work=The Guardian |date=17 March 2011|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> Deary was initially sceptical, having had a negative experience with the [[Horrible Histories (2001 TV series)|2001 animated series]], which had only loosely incorporated his concept. He finally agreed to the new project on the condition that it be explicitly \"horrible, funny and true\". While disclaiming any active role in developing the subsequent series, he would eventually contribute to the writing as well as appearing in several small roles.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" />\n\nThe producers were determined that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director [[Dominic Brigstocke]] concluded that the material was strong enough to stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" /> Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.<ref name=\"bcg_a\">{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/about/ | title=About: Horrible Histories | work=[[British Comedy Guide]] | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo do the material full justice, Brigstocke and series producer Caroline Norris used their industry contacts to put together a creative team consisting mostly of veterans of the adult UK comedy community.<ref name=\"bcg_a\" /><ref name=\"telegraph_a\"/> The BBC readily agreed to this cross-demographic experiment.

This stance sometimes encompassed traditionally accepted if not actually well-documented anecdotes, such as those involving [[Caligula]].<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> All the material used on the show was vetted by production assistant and self-described \"tyrannical pedant\" Greg Jenner during both writing and filming; he says that he has counted only eight errors out of more than 4,000 facts presented over the course of the show's run.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> Costuming and makeup were likewise painstakingly recreated based on primary historical sources where available.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /><ref name=\"bfi5\"/>\n\nWhen an error was discovered, the effort was made to correct it whenever possible. This process is perhaps most noticeable in the evolution of a song featuring the four [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King Georges: lyrics in the original 2009 video incorrectly saying that [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] had \"died on the [[Close stool|loo]]\" were correctly reassigned to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] for the song's reprise at the show's 2011 BBC Prom concert.<ref name=\"histex_a\" />\n\nTaking cues from what Deary describes as his \"seriously subversive\" attitude towards the mainstream British history education model<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> meant that the show inevitably incorporated sociopolitical comment. Perhaps most explicitly, Scots-Jamaican nurse [[Mary Seacole]] was deliberately championed in both a sketch and later song as a forgotten heroine in the shadow of [[Florence Nightingale]]. The activities of African-American activists [[Harriet Tubman]] and [[Rosa Parks]] were also showcased, as was ex-slave boxer [[Bill Richmond]].<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> According to Norris, a desire to include more women's stories was hampered by the traditionally male-dominated viewpoint of historical records.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\" /> The show did make an attempt to counteract this by giving showcase songs to the British [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] movement and [[Home front during World War II#Mobilisation of women|women's work on the British homefront during World War II]], and wherever possible highlighting strong-willed, dynamic female figures, including [[Queen Victoria]], [[Elizabeth I]] and [[Boudicca]]. Religious controversies, class divisions, the ethics of conquest, and labour conditions were likewise touched on.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" />\n\nThe association with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, as they had demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> Senior writer [[Steve Punt]] said that there were in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that \"everyone was very relieved\".<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" /> The producers did consider some topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the [[Holocaust]] or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly.<ref name=\"express_a\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would be nervous watching it with a ten-year-old.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers.<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the World War I [[Christmas truce]], for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe TV series used the [[Horrible Histories]] brand, logo and associated trademarks under licence from publisher [[Scholastic Books]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Loveday, Samantha|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|title=Horrible Histories heading to TV|work=Licensing.biz|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112185858/http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|archive-date=12 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television,{{refn|[http://citrustelevision.com/ Citrus Television] was formed by several of the ''Horrible Histories'' producers during the show's first series, and is credited alongside LionTV from the second series onward.|group=note}} with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production. Under series producer Norris and directors Brigstocke, Steve Connelly and Chloe Thomas, each series of thirteen episodes took approximately one year to produce.

In this sketch, Florence Nightingale says that she rejected the Jamaican-born Seacole's application to Nightingale's Crimean nursing corps because it was open to \"British girls\" only. This was held to be imputing racially discriminatory motives to Nightingale\u2014and thus implying them to be historical fact\u2014without sufficient proof.

launched on CBBC. Likewise coproduced by Lion TV and Citrus, the show is co-hosted by [[Dave Lamb]] with puppet Rattus Rattus and includes cameos from many of the parent show's cast.

Episodes centred around the life of one prominent historical figure played by an established comedy actor. It was in 2016 that a seventh series began with just three specials before  the full series in 2017. The three specials marked anniversaries through the year: 400 years since Shakespeare died, the BBCs 'Love to Read' campaign and 350 years since the Great Fire of London. There was a slight change in cast where the main stars [[Jalaal Hartley]], [[Tom Stourton]] and [[Jessica Ransom]] continued with new members. This was the first series where none of the main original cast were present.\n\n==Films==\nOn 18 September 2015 ''[[Bill (2015 film)|Bill]]'', a 2015 BBC comedy film based loosely around the early life of [[William Shakespeare]], was released. The film, though not officially related to the series, reunited and starred the original core performers of ''Horrible Histories'' in starring roles.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2013/bbc-films-bill-press-release.html|title=Stars of Horrible Histories to make Shakespeare film|date=22 March 2013|work=BBC Media Centre|accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/film/bill/details/ | title=Bill: production details | publisher=comedy.co.uk | work=British Comedy Guide | accessdate=12 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2017, it was announced that [[Altitude Film Distribution|Altitude Film Entertainment]] and Citrus Films were producing a film adaptation.

The show was produced for [[CBBC]] by [[Lion Television]] with Citrus Television and ran from 2009 to 2013 for five series of thirteen half-hour episodes, with additional one-off seasonal and Olympic specials.\n\nThe TV show carries over the graphic style and much of the content of the [[Horrible Histories (book series)|''Horrible Histories'' book series]]. It maintains the franchise's overall irreverent but accurate focus on the dark, gruesome or scatological aspects of British and other [[Western world]] history, spanning from the [[Stone Age]] to the post-[[World War II]] era. Individual historical eras or civilisations are defined and named as in the books, with sketches from several different time periods combined within a single episode. [[Live-action]] sketches\u2014which often parody other UK media or celebrities\u2014and music videos are intercut with animations and quizzes. The starring troupe are [[Mathew Baynton]], [[Simon Farnaby]], [[Martha Howe-Douglas]], [[Jim Howick]], [[Laurence Rickard]], [[Sarah Hadland]] and [[Ben Willbond]], alongside a large supporting cast headed by [[Katy Wix]], [[Lawry Lewin]], [[Alice Lowe]] and [[Dominique Moore]]. The black rat puppet \"host\", Rattus Rattus, appears in short bridging segments, explaining the factual basis for each sketch.\n\nThe [[Horrible Histories troupe|creative team]] was largely recruited from the mainstream adult UK comedy scene. They took inspiration from such quintessentially British historical-comedy classics as ''[[Blackadder]]'' and the [[Monty Python]] films. The series was a critical and ratings success, eventually gaining a wide all ages audience through its non-condescending and inclusive approach. It has won numerous domestic and international awards and has been named among the greatest British children's television series of all time.\n\nIn 2011, a spin-off game show, ''[[Horrible Histories: Gory Games]]'', was launched on CBBC. In the same year, the original show was repackaged for main channel [[BBC One]] as ''[[Horrible Histories with Stephen Fry]]'', with [[Stephen Fry|Fry]] replacing the puppet, Rattus Rattus, as presenter. [[Horrible Histories (2015 TV series)|A new series of special episodes]] began airing in 2015, featuring a new format and cast. Although the original series has ended, it continues to be frequently repeated on the [[CBBC Channel]] daily.\n\n==Background==\n''Horrible Histories'' is based on [[Horrible Histories (book series)|the British children's historical-comedy book series]] by [[Terry Deary]], first published by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic UK]] in 1993 and since expanded into a [[Horrible Histories|multimedia franchise]]. The books and subsequent spin-off materials are intended to pique young children's interest in history via short, factually based but humorously told anecdotes highlighting aspects of the subject not usually covered in more traditional educational sources.<ref name=\"scanlon\">{{cite journal | title=History beyond the academy: humor and horror in children's history books | journal=New Review of Children's Literature and Librarianship, 16:2, 69\u201391|volume = 16| issue=2| pages=69\u201391|year=2011| author=Scanlon, Margaret| doi=10.1080/13614541.2010.540197 }}</ref>\n\nLionTV executive producer Richard Bradley, whose company had previously produced several adult history-themed programmes and whose son was a fan of the ''Horrible Histories'' books, was the initial driving force behind a new TV adaptation.<ref name=\"guardian_a\">{{cite web|author=Hickman, Leo |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2011/mar/17/horrible-histories-huge-hit |title=How Horrible Histories became a huge hit|work=The Guardian |date=17 March 2011|accessdate=19 June 2013}}</ref> Deary was initially sceptical, having had a negative experience with the [[Horrible Histories (2001 TV series)|2001 animated series]], which had only loosely incorporated his concept.

While disclaiming any active role in developing the subsequent series, he would eventually contribute to the writing as well as appearing in several small roles.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" />\n\nThe producers were determined that the show be respectful of audience expectations for the Horrible Histories brand, maintaining its familiar visual style and content as far as possible. Early concepts for bringing it to the screen involved framing or interpretive devices, including a ghostly train carrying children into the past, or a wizard storyteller to act as their guide. Eventually Bradley with producer/director [[Dominic Brigstocke]] concluded that the material was strong enough to stand on its own, so they developed, in consultation with CBBC executives, a live-action sketch-comedy showcase.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" /> Once the writing was underway, the producers further discovered that sticking as closely as possible to the historical truth made it easier for them to find the humour within it. They then introduced a comedy style relying on parodies of familiar modern media [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] as a means of making these historical details more immediately accessible.<ref name=\"bcg_a\">{{cite web | url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/horrible_histories/about/ | title=About: Horrible Histories | work=[[British Comedy Guide]] | accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo do the material full justice, Brigstocke and series producer Caroline Norris used their industry contacts to put together a creative team consisting mostly of veterans of the adult UK comedy community.<ref name=\"bcg_a\" /><ref name=\"telegraph_a\"/> The BBC readily agreed to this cross-demographic experiment.

This stance sometimes encompassed traditionally accepted if not actually well-documented anecdotes, such as those involving [[Caligula]].<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> All the material used on the show was vetted by production assistant and self-described \"tyrannical pedant\" Greg Jenner during both writing and filming; he says that he has counted only eight errors out of more than 4,000 facts presented over the course of the show's run.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> Costuming and makeup were likewise painstakingly recreated based on primary historical sources where available.<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /><ref name=\"bfi5\"/>\n\nWhen an error was discovered, the effort was made to correct it whenever possible. This process is perhaps most noticeable in the evolution of a song featuring the four [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian]] King Georges: lyrics in the original 2009 video incorrectly saying that [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] had \"died on the [[Close stool|loo]]\" were correctly reassigned to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] for the song's reprise at the show's 2011 BBC Prom concert.<ref name=\"histex_a\" />\n\nTaking cues from what Deary describes as his \"seriously subversive\" attitude towards the mainstream British history education model<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> meant that the show inevitably incorporated sociopolitical comment.

The activities of African-American activists [[Harriet Tubman]] and [[Rosa Parks]] were also showcased, as was ex-slave boxer [[Bill Richmond]].<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> According to Norris, a desire to include more women's stories was hampered by the traditionally male-dominated viewpoint of historical records.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\" /> The show did make an attempt to counteract this by giving showcase songs to the British [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] movement and [[Home front during World War II#Mobilisation of women|women's work on the British homefront during World War II]], and wherever possible highlighting strong-willed, dynamic female figures, including [[Queen Victoria]], [[Elizabeth I]] and [[Boudicca]]. Religious controversies, class divisions, the ethics of conquest, and labour conditions were likewise touched on.<ref name=\"guardian_a\" />\n\nThe association with a proven and popular children's brand focusing on potentially sensitive subjects enabled the TV series to deflect any serious controversy regarding the same subjects, as they had demonstrably already been presented to children without any ill effects.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> Senior writer [[Steve Punt]] said that there were in fact very few complaints regarding the initial series' content, adding that \"everyone was very relieved\".<ref name=\"telegraph_a\" /> The producers did consider some topics intrinsically unsuited for an irreverent comic treatment, as for instance the [[Holocaust]] or the harsher details of slavery, and avoided them accordingly.<ref name=\"express_a\" /><ref name=\"histex_a\" /> Norris has described her personal criteria for age suitability as whether she would be nervous watching it with a ten-year-old.<ref name=\"FULLSESSION\" /> While BBC executives in large part were willing to concede the requirements of reflecting historical realities, some topics, notably suicide, needed careful handling to avoid potentially negative impact on younger viewers.<ref name=\"histex_a\" /> The show sometimes acknowledged particularly emotive subject matter (the World War I [[Christmas truce]], for example) by following up the sketch not with a joke, but a more sombre elaboration of the less comedic details.<ref name=\"guardblog_a\"/>\n\n==Production==\nThe TV series used the [[Horrible Histories]] brand, logo and associated trademarks under licence from publisher [[Scholastic Books]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Loveday, Samantha|url=http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|title=Horrible Histories heading to TV|work=Licensing.biz|date=11 October 2007|accessdate=8 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112185858/http://www.licensing.biz/news/read/horrible-histories-heading-to-tv/038035|archive-date=12 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was produced for the BBC by LionTV and Citrus Television,{{refn|[http://citrustelevision.com/ Citrus Television] was formed by several of the ''Horrible Histories'' producers during the show's first series, and is credited alongside LionTV from the second series onward.|group=note}} with post-production being handled by Platform Post Production.

It's quite amusing, though whether it will pique an interest in the subject, or\u2014as some say\u2014merely encourage children to learn more about defecation, gluttony, murder and torture, we cannot know.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Hoggart, Simon |url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/arts/6050573/shakespeare-in-school/ |title=Shakespeare in school|work=[[The Spectator]] |date=2 June 2010|accessdate=31 July 2013}}</ref>\n\nMore specifically, in September 2014, responding to a complaint from the Nightingale Society, the BBC Trust determined that the show had breached editorial guidelines in the sketch highlighting the controversy surrounding Mary Seacole's role in nursing history. In this sketch, Florence Nightingale says that she rejected the Jamaican-born Seacole's application to Nightingale's Crimean nursing corps because it was open to \"British girls\" only. This was held to be imputing racially discriminatory motives to Nightingale\u2014and thus implying them to be historical fact\u2014without sufficient proof. In response, the BBC pulled the offending sketch from their website and announced it would be removed from future showings of the episode.<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC rapped over Horrible Histories Florence Nightingale sketch|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29426242|accessdate=22 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=30 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn a 20th-anniversary retrospective of the franchise in ''The Telegraph'', [[David Horspool]], the history editor of the ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]'', defended the show's overall viewpoint, saying, \"There's no particular reason why grown-up historians shouldn't like ''Horrible Histories'' too&nbsp;... They simplify, and they have a definite point of view, but all historians are guilty of that to some degree.\" He further said that \"Getting children interested in the past isn't necessarily easy, and ''Horrible Histories'' does it extremely effectively\u2014and those who come to history because it's fun seem far more likely to stay with it in the long run.\"<ref name=\"telegraph2_a\" /> Writing for entertainment website DorkAdore, Anna Lowman added that \"Terry Deary had the fine idea of getting kids into history by giving the facts a human face and a joke or two&nbsp;...

Episodes centred around the life of one prominent historical figure played by an established comedy actor. It was in 2016 that a seventh series began with just three specials before  the full series in 2017. The three specials marked anniversaries through the year: 400 years since Shakespeare died, the BBCs 'Love to Read' campaign and 350 years since the Great Fire of London. There was a slight change in cast where the main stars [[Jalaal Hartley]], [[Tom Stourton]] and [[Jessica Ransom]] continued with new members. This was the first series where none of the main original cast were present.\n\n==Films==\nOn 18 September 2015 ''[[Bill (2015 film)|Bill]]'', a 2015 BBC comedy film based loosely around the early life of [[William Shakespeare]], was released.
