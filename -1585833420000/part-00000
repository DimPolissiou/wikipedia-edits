AHEPA was founded in response to the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and to assist Greek immigrants' assimilation into American society. AHEPA joined with [[B'nai B'rith]] and the [[NAACP]] to combat discrimination.\n\nThe mission of the AHEPA family is to promote Hellenism, education, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family, and individual excellence.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe AHEPA was founded as a fraternity in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, in July 1922.  Its initial mission was to promote the image of Greeks in America, assist them with citizenship and assimilation into American culture, and combat prejudice. With the full assimilation of Greek Americans, its mission evolved toward philanthropy, education, and promoting and preserving the Hellenic identity of the Greek Americans and the ethnic Greeks of other countries where AHEPA is present, such as [[Greek Australian|Australia]], [[Greek Canadians|Canada]], the [[Greek Bahamians|Bahamas]] as well as Greece and Cyprus.<ref>[[Alan Axelrod]], ''International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders'', New York: Facts on File, 1997, pp.4-5</ref><ref>[http://ahepa.org/dotnetnuke/Districts.aspx AHEPA Districts and chapters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706062245/http://ahepa.org/dotnetnuke/Districts.aspx |date=July 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe founders of the fraternity were eight men, all residents of Atlanta, who conceived the idea of the establishment of an association of mainly citizens of Greek descent, although not limited only to such members.

Local units were called \"Subordinate Lodges\" and state or territory structures were called \"Superior Lodges\". Now local groups are called \"Chapters\" and regional organizations are called \"Districts\". The national structure is still called the \"Supreme Lodge\", however, and all of its officers have \"Supreme\" in their title such as Supreme President, Supreme Treasurer etc.<ref>Schmidt, Alvin J.

At its third meeting, the Order decided to change this, allowing non-Greeks to join. In 1979, AHEPA had over 25,000 members in 400 chapters.<ref>Schmidt p.25</ref> By 1989, the number climbed to 60,000, despite an overall decline in memberships of fraternal groups during this period.<ref name=five>Axelrod p.5</ref>\n\nThere have been 540 chapters chartered in the United States, 16 chartered in Canada, 30 chartered in Greece, 5 chartered in Cyprus, and 10 chartered in Europe, Central America, and Caribbean.

Its initial mission was to promote the image of Greeks in America, assist them with citizenship and assimilation into American culture, and combat prejudice. With the full assimilation of Greek Americans, its mission evolved toward philanthropy, education, and promoting and preserving the Hellenic identity of the Greek Americans and the ethnic Greeks of other countries where AHEPA is present, such as [[Greek Australian|Australia]], [[Greek Canadians|Canada]], the [[Greek Bahamians|Bahamas]] as well as Greece and Cyprus.<ref>[[Alan Axelrod]], ''International Encyclopedia of Secret Societies and Fraternal Orders'', New York: Facts on File, 1997, pp.4-5</ref><ref>[http://ahepa.org/dotnetnuke/Districts.aspx AHEPA Districts and chapters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706062245/http://ahepa.org/dotnetnuke/Districts.aspx |date=July 6, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe founders of the fraternity were eight men, all residents of Atlanta, who conceived the idea of the establishment of an association of mainly citizens of Greek descent, although not limited only to such members.

Local units were called \"Subordinate Lodges\" and state or territory structures were called \"Superior Lodges\". Now local groups are called \"Chapters\" and regional organizations are called \"Districts\". The national structure is still called the \"Supreme Lodge\", however, and all of its officers have \"Supreme\" in their title such as Supreme President, Supreme Treasurer etc.<ref>Schmidt, Alvin J.

At its third meeting, the Order decided to change this, allowing non-Greeks to join. In 1979, AHEPA had over 25,000 members in 400 chapters.<ref>Schmidt p.25</ref> By 1989, the number climbed to 60,000, despite an overall decline in memberships of fraternal groups during this period.<ref name=five>Axelrod p.5</ref>\n\nThere have been 540 chapters chartered in the United States, 16 chartered in Canada, 30 chartered in Greece, 5 chartered in Cyprus, and 10 chartered in Europe, Central America, and Caribbean.

Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it.

This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}\n\nThe talks were very popular.

He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian<ref>Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up \"G.

Chesterton a Theologian?,\" ''The Chesterton Review''. (Rep. by [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0499.html ''CERC: Catholic Education Research Center''].)</ref> and [[apologist]], debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name=\"Father Brown on Chesterton,\"/> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845\u20131961'', 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html \"G.K. Chesterton, the Eccentric Prince of Paradox,\"] ''Christianity Today'', 8 January 2001.</ref><ref>Gray, Robert. [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/paradox-was-his-doxy/ \"Paradox Was His Doxy,\"] ''The American Conservative'', 23 March 2009.</ref>\n\n==Views and contemporaries==\n[[File:Three acres and a cow.JPG|thumb|Self-portrait of Chesterton based on the [[Distributism|distributist]] slogan \"[[Three acres and a cow]]\"]]\n\nChesterton's writing has been seen by some analysts as combining two earlier strands in English literature. Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the [[carpe diem]] religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward, and respect for, each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:\n\n{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will \u2026 If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}\n\n[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K. Chesterton.png|thumb|Title page of the 1909 edition of ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'', first published in the previous year]]\nThis style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' \u2013 that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':\n\n<blockquote>The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless \u2013 one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is \u2013 well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html|title=The Suicide of Thought>|work=dmu.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Blunders of Our Parties| newspaper = Illustrated London News | date = 19 April 1924}}.</ref> He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holroyd |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0701133504 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 214] |url=https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 }}</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary and friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|Edmund Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]].  Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form.  Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.\n\n===Charges of anti-Semitism===\n\nChesterton faced accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] during his lifetime, saying in chapter 13 of ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'' (1920) that it was something \"for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled\".

He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Anthony | last = Julius | authorlink = Anthony Julius | title = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010 | page = 422| title-link = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = G.

We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.</blockquote> In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as \"a parable\" and \"a flippant fancy\") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that \"The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\"\n\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.<ref name = \"Pearce2005\">{{cite book | last = Pearce|first= Joseph|authorlink= Joseph Pearce| title= Literary Giants, Literary Catholics | year = 2005 | publisher = Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-58617-077-6|page= 95}}</ref> As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937 : \n<blockquote>When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit.

In ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' (1920) he said that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo.

Chesterton wrote: <blockquote>the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/><ref name=Everlasting>{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|author=G.

Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\"<ref name=Eugenics/> He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs.

It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed.

Fisher Unwin]],{{sfn|Ker|2011|p=41}} where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902 the ''[[Daily News (London)|Daily News]]'' gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', for which he continued to write for the next thirty years.\n\nEarly on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images.  Even his fiction contained carefully concealed parables. [[Father Brown]] is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition and repentance. For example, in the story \"The Flying Stars\", Father Brown entreats the character [[Flambeau (character)|Flambeau]] to give up his life of crime: \"There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don't fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I've known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime.\"<ref>{{citation |last=Chesterton |first=G.

This allowed his talks to maintain an intimate character, as did the decision to allow his wife and secretary to sit with him during his broadcasts.{{sfn|Ker|2011}}\n\nThe talks were very popular.

He was a literary and social critic, historian, playwright, novelist, Catholic theologian<ref>Bridges, Horace J. (1914). [https://archive.org/stream/ethicaladdresses21ameruoft#page/20/mode/2up \"G.

Chesterton a Theologian?,\" ''The Chesterton Review''. (Rep. by [http://catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0499.html ''CERC: Catholic Education Research Center''].)</ref> and [[apologist]], debater, and mystery writer. He was a columnist for the ''Daily News'', ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', and his own paper, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''; he also wrote articles for the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'', including the entry on [[Charles Dickens]] and part of the entry on Humour in the 14th edition (1929). His best-known character is the priest-detective [[Father Brown]],<ref name=\"Father Brown on Chesterton,\"/> who appeared only in short stories, while ''[[The Man Who Was Thursday]]'' is arguably his best-known novel. He was a convinced Christian long before he was received into the Catholic Church, and Christian themes and symbolism appear in much of his writing. In the United States, his writings on [[distributism]] were popularised through ''[[The American Review (literary journal)|The American Review]]'', published by [[Seward Collins]] in New York.\n\nOf his nonfiction, ''Charles Dickens: A Critical Study'' (1906) has received some of the broadest-based praise. According to [[Ian Ker]] (''The Catholic Revival in English Literature, 1845\u20131961'', 2003), \"In Chesterton's eyes Dickens belongs to [[Merry England|Merry]], not [[Puritan]], England\"; Ker treats Chesterton's thought in Chapter 4 of that book as largely growing out of his true appreciation of Dickens, a somewhat shop-soiled property in the view of other literary opinions of the time.\n\nChesterton's writings consistently displayed wit and a sense of humour. He employed paradox, while making serious comments on the world, government, politics, economics, philosophy, theology and many other topics.<ref>Douglas, J. D. [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/augustweb-only/8-27-52.0.html \"G.K. Chesterton, the Eccentric Prince of Paradox,\"] ''Christianity Today'', 8 January 2001.</ref><ref>Gray, Robert.

Dickens' approach is one of these. Another is represented by [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]], whom Chesterton knew well: satirists and social commentators following in the tradition of [[Samuel Butler (1835-1902)|Samuel Butler]], vigorously wielding paradox as a weapon against complacent acceptance of the conventional view of things.\n\nChesterton's style and thinking were all his own, however, and his conclusions were often opposed to those of Oscar Wilde and George Bernard Shaw. In his book ''[[Heretics (book)|Heretics]]'', Chesterton has this to say of Wilde: \"The same lesson [of the pessimistic pleasure-seeker] was taught by the very powerful and very desolate philosophy of Oscar Wilde.  It is the [[carpe diem]] religion; but the carpe diem religion is not the religion of happy people, but of very unhappy people. Great joy does not gather the rosebuds while it may; its eyes are fixed on the immortal rose which Dante saw.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch7.html chapter 7]}}  More briefly, and with a closer approximation of Wilde's own style, he writes in ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' concerning the necessity of making symbolic sacrifices for the gift of creation: \"Oscar Wilde said that sunsets were not valued because we could not pay for sunsets. But Oscar Wilde was wrong; we can pay for sunsets. We can pay for them by not being Oscar Wilde.\"\n\nChesterton and Shaw were famous friends and enjoyed their arguments and discussions.  Although rarely in agreement, they both maintained good will toward, and respect for, each other. However, in his writing, Chesterton expressed himself very plainly on where they differed and why. In ''Heretics'' he writes of Shaw:\n\n{{quote |After belabouring a great many people for a great many years for being unprogressive, Mr. Shaw has discovered, with characteristic sense, that it is very doubtful whether any existing human being with two legs can be progressive at all. Having come to doubt whether humanity can be combined with progress, most people, easily pleased, would have elected to abandon progress and remain with humanity. Mr. Shaw, not being easily pleased, decides to throw over humanity with all its limitations and go in for progress for its own sake. If man, as we know him, is incapable of the philosophy of progress, Mr. Shaw asks, not for a new kind of philosophy, but for a new kind of man. It is rather as if a nurse had tried a rather bitter food for some years on a baby, and on discovering that it was not suitable, should not throw away the food and ask for a new food, but throw the baby out of window, and ask for a new baby.{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch4.html chapter 4]}}}}\n\nShaw represented the new school of thought, [[modernism]], which was rising at the time. Chesterton's views, on the other hand, became increasingly more focused towards the Church. In ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'' he writes: \"The worship of will is the negation of will \u2026 If Mr. Bernard Shaw comes up to me and says, 'Will something', that is tantamount to saying, 'I do not mind what you will', and that is tantamount to saying, 'I have no will in the matter.' You cannot admire will in general, because the essence of will is that it is particular.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1905 | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/heretics/ch20.html chapter 20]}}\n\n[[File:Title Page of Orthodoxy, by G.K. Chesterton.png|thumb|Title page of the 1909 edition of ''[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]'', first published in the previous year]]\nThis style of argumentation is what Chesterton refers to as using 'Uncommon Sense' \u2013 that is, that the thinkers and popular philosophers of the day, though very clever, were saying things that were nonsensical. This is illustrated again in ''Orthodoxy'': \"Thus when Mr. H. G. Wells says (as he did somewhere), 'All chairs are quite different', he utters not merely a misstatement, but a contradiction in terms. If all chairs were quite different, you could not call them 'all chairs'.\"{{Sfn | Chesterton | 1908b | loc = [http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html chapter 3]}} Or, again from ''Orthodoxy'':\n\n<blockquote>The wild worship of lawlessness and the materialist worship of law end in the same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy in the land of nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless \u2013 one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions are evil. But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is \u2013 well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cse.dmu.ac.uk/~mward/gkc/books/orthodoxy/ch3.html|title=The Suicide of Thought>|work=dmu.ac.uk}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nChesterton, as a political thinker, cast aspersions on both [[progressivism]] and [[conservatism]], saying, \"The whole modern world has divided itself into Conservatives and Progressives. The business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of the Conservatives is to prevent the mistakes from being corrected.\"<ref>{{Citation | title = The Blunders of Our Parties| newspaper = Illustrated London News | date = 19 April 1924}}.</ref> He was an early member of the [[Fabian Society]], but resigned from it at the time of the Boer War.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Holroyd |first1=Michael |title=Bernard Shaw Vol 2 |date=1989 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn=978-0701133504 |page=[https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 214] |url=https://archive.org/details/bernardshaw00holr/page/214 }}</ref>\n\nAnother contemporary and friend from schooldays was [[Edmund Clerihew Bentley|Edmund Bentley]], inventor of the [[clerihew]].  Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend's first published collection of poetry, ''Biography for Beginners'' (1905), which popularised the clerihew form.  Chesterton was also godfather to Bentley's son, [[Nicolas Bentley|Nicolas]], and opened his novel ''The Man Who Was Thursday'' with a poem written to Bentley.\n\n===Charges of anti-Semitism===\n\nChesterton faced accusations of [[anti-Semitism]] during his lifetime, saying in chapter 13 of ''[[The New Jerusalem (Chesterton book)|The New Jerusalem]]'' (1920) that it was something \"for which my friends and I were for a long period rebuked and even reviled\". Despite his prostestations to the contrary, the accusation continues to be repeated.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://books.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,12084,1455054,00.html | title = Last orders | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 9 April 2005}}.</ref> An early supporter of [[Alfred Dreyfus|Captain Dreyfus]], by 1906 he had turned into an [[Dreyfus Affair|anti-dreyfusard]].<ref>Chesterton, Gilbert.

Chesterton writes that popular perception of Jewish moneylenders could well have led Edward I's subjects to regard him as a \"tender father of his people\" for \"breaking the rule by which the rulers had hitherto fostered their bankers' wealth\". He felt that Jews, \"a sensitive and highly civilized people\" who \"were the capitalists of the age, the men with wealth banked ready for use\", might legitimately complain that \"Christian kings and nobles, and even Christian popes and bishops, used for Christian purposes (such as the Crusades and the cathedrals) the money that could only be accumulated in such mountains by a usury they inconsistently denounced as unchristian; and then, when worse times came, gave up the Jew to the fury of the poor\".<ref>{{Citation | first = Anthony | last = Julius | authorlink = Anthony Julius | title = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2010 | page = 422| title-link = Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England }}.</ref><ref>{{Citation | first = G.

We desired that in some fashion, and so far as possible, Jews should be represented by Jews, should live in a society of Jews, should be judged by Jews and ruled by Jews. I am an Anti-Semite if that is Anti-Semitism. It would seem more rational to call it Semitism.</blockquote> In the same place he proposed the thought experiment (describing it as \"a parable\" and \"a flippant fancy\") that Jews should be admitted to any role in English public life on condition that they must wear distinctively Middle Eastern garb, explaining that \"The point is that we should know where we are; and he would know where he is, which is in a foreign land.\"\n\nChesterton, like Belloc, openly expressed his abhorrence of [[Hitler]]'s rule almost as soon as it started.<ref name = \"Pearce2005\">{{cite book | last = Pearce|first= Joseph|authorlink= Joseph Pearce| title= Literary Giants, Literary Catholics | year = 2005 | publisher = Ignatius Press|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-1-58617-077-6|page= 95}}</ref> As [[Rabbi Stephen Wise]] wrote in a posthumous tribute to Chesterton in 1937 : \n<blockquote>When Hitlerism came, he was one of the first to speak out with all the directness and frankness of a great and unabashed spirit.

In ''The Feud of the Foreigner'' (1920) he said that the Jew \"is a foreigner far more remote from us than is a Bavarian from a Frenchman; he is divided by the same type of division as that between us and a Chinaman or a Hindoo. He not only is not, but never was, of the same race.\"<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/>\n\nIn ''The Everlasting Man'', while writing about human sacrifice, Chesterton suggested that medieval stories about [[Blood libel|Jews killing children]] might have resulted from a distortion of genuine cases of devil-worship. Chesterton wrote: <blockquote>the Hebrew prophets were perpetually protesting against the Hebrew race relapsing into an idolatry that involved such a war upon children; and it is probable enough that this abominable apostasy from the God of Israel has occasionally appeared in Israel since, in the form of what is called ritual murder; not of course by any representative of the religion of Judaism, but by individual and irresponsible diabolists who did happen to be Jews.<ref name=\"Mayers85-7\"/><ref name=Everlasting>{{cite book|title=The Everlasting Man|author=G.

Chesterton Anti-Semitic?,\"] by Dale Ahlquist.</ref>\n\n===Opposition to eugenics===\nIn ''Eugenics and Other Evils'' Chesterton attacked [[eugenics]] as Britain was moving towards passage of the [[Mental Deficiency Act 1913]]. Some backing the ideas of eugenics called for the government to sterilise people deemed \"mentally defective\"; this view did not gain popularity but the idea of segregating them from the rest of society and thereby preventing them from reproducing did gain traction. These ideas disgusted Chesterton who wrote, \"It is not only openly said, it is eagerly urged that the aim of the measure is to prevent any person whom these propagandists do not happen to think intelligent from having any wife or children.\"<ref name=Eugenics/> He blasted the proposed wording for such measures as being so vague as to apply to anyone, including \"Every tramp who is sulk, every labourer who is shy, every rustic who is eccentric, can quite easily be brought under such conditions as were designed for homicidal maniacs. That is the situation; and that is the point \u2026 we are already under the Eugenist State; and nothing remains to us but rebellion.\"<ref name=Eugenics>{{cite book|title=Eugenics and Other Evils|author=Gilbert Keith Chesterton|publisher=Cassell and Company, Ltd|location=London, UK|year=1922}}</ref>\n\nHe derided such ideas as founded on nonsense, \"as if one had a right to dragoon and enslave one's fellow citizens as a kind of chemical experiment\".<ref name=Eugenics/>\n\nChesterton also mocked the idea that poverty was a result of bad breeding: \"[it is a] strange new disposition to regard the poor as a race; as if they were a colony of Japs or Chinese coolies \u2026 The poor are not a race or even a type. It is senseless to talk about breeding them; for they are not a breed.

The quotation is from Chesterton's 1929 book, ''The Thing: Why I am a Catholic'', in the chapter, \"The Drift from Domesticity\":\n\n<blockquote>In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'<ref>Chesterton, G. K. (1929).

It was witnessed by his sister-in-law and by his close friend [[Anselm H\u00fcttenbrenner]], who provided a vivid description of the event. Beethoven's funeral was held three days later, and the procession was witnessed by a large crowd. He was buried in the cemetery at [[W\u00e4hring]], although his remains were moved in 1888 to the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]].\n\nH\u00fcttenbrenner's account has been used to ascribe motivations of resistance and anger to Beethoven in his final moments. Beethoven's last words and the exact cause of his death have also been the subject of some historical debate.\n\n==Final illness==\n[[File:Wien09 Schwarzspanierstrasse015 2017-03-04 GuentherZ 0491 GD Ludwig van Beethoven.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Schwarzspanierstra\u00dfe 15]]\nBeethoven suffered declining health throughout the last years of his life, including the so-called \"Late period\" when he produced some of his most admired work. The last work he was able to complete was the substitute final movement of the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|String Quartet No. 13, Op. 130]], composed to replace the difficult [[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]], which was published separately as Opus 133. Shortly thereafter, in late 1826, illness struck again, with episodes of vomiting and [[diarrhea]] that nearly ended his life.\n\nAs it became apparent that Beethoven would not recover, his friends gathered to help and to pay their final respects. Beethoven's doctors conducted four minor operations to relieve [[ascites]] (abdominal swelling), of which the first resulted in infection, the others not.

Since any imputations as to the dying man's emotional state are impossible to verify, they tend to be glossed over or ignored as irrelevant by modern Beethoven scholars.\n\n==Autopsy and post-mortem findings==\n[[File:Beethovendeathmask.jpg|thumb|upright|Death mask by Josef Dannhauser]]\nAn [[autopsy]] was performed on 27 March 1827 by Dr. Johann Wagner. While it is unclear who ordered the autopsy, a specific request by Beethoven in his [[Heiligenstadt Testament]] may have played a role in the decision.<ref name=\"Meredith1\">[[#Meredith|Meredith]], p. 1 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}</ref> The autopsy revealed a severely cirrhotic and shrunken [[liver]], of which [[ascites]] is a common consequence. Scholars disagree over whether Beethoven's liver damage was the result of heavy alcohol consumption, hepatic infection, or both. [[Hepatitis B]] and [[Hepatitis C|C]] are causes of cirrhosis, but they spread from contact with contaminated body fluids and were extremely rare in Beethoven's day. [[Hepatitis A]] on the other hand can be contracted from food and water that were not handled properly and was very common in the 19th century, although it does not cause liver cirrhosis or permanent organ damage.\n\nHeavy metal contamination is thought to be a contributing factor in Beethoven's death as these were commonly used in medicines of the time. It has also been theorized that he consumed large amounts of lead from illegally fortified wine. Putting [[lead sugar]] into wine was a very common practice to sweeten cheap wines, and despite being outlawed in most European countries during the 18th century, the prohibition was difficult to enforce and production of lead-fortified wine (which originated in Roman times) continued unabated. There is no indication the composer had syphilis beyond a mercury treatment prescribed to him around 1815, but these were used for various other ailments as well.\n\nThe autopsy indicated damage to his aural nerves as well as hardening of their accompanying arteries, although the latter appears to be consistent with natural aging and not inflammatory damage from [[syphilis]]. Beethoven's brain was described as possessing \"exaggerated folds\", an excess of fluid in the skull, and some thickening of the membranes inside the left ventricle. Scholars believe he may have had a degree of cerebral atrophy, although he showed no sign of cognitive impairment to the end. The skull was described as \"possessing unusual thickness\".\n\nBeethoven's kidneys had calcareous growths in them, indicating that he was likely developing [[renal papillary necrosis]] (RPN), a common result of [[analgesic]] abuse (it is known that he used large amounts of various drugs obtained from his brother Johann, a [[pharmacist]]). Diabetes is also a cause of RPN, and scholars have not ruled out the possibility that the composer had [[diabetes mellitus]]. His [[spleen]] was swollen to twice the normal size and he had [[portal hypertension]], both consistent with end-stage liver failure. He also appears to have had severe [[pancreatitis]], as the doctors described his [[pancreas]] as \"shrunken and fibrous\", with the exit duct being very thin and narrowed. Large amounts of reddish fluid had accumulated in Beethoven's abdomen, likely from spontaneous bacterial infections mixed with some blood. This was possibly a result of draining fluid from his abdomen in his last days, a practice that frequently caused infection and often death of the patient in a time before antibiotics and bacterial pathology were known.\n\nIn the days immediately preceding and following his death, a number of people, including [[Anton Schindler]] and [[Ferdinand Hiller]], cut locks of hair from Beethoven's head. Most of Hiller's lock is now in the Center for Beethoven Studies at [[San Jose State University]].<ref name=\"Meredith2\">[[#Meredith|Meredith]], p. 2 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}</ref> One of Beethoven's friends incorrectly thought that \"strangers had cut all of his hair off\"; in fact, the apparent lack of hair was due to a cloth cap that covered the hair while the body was lying in state.<ref name=\"Meredith3\">[[#Meredith|Meredith]], p. 3 {{Incomplete short citation|date=April 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 March 1827, castings for a [[death mask]] were taken.<ref name=\"Meredith2\"/> The body was clothed and placed in an oaken coffin, with the head given a wreath of white roses.

Among other evidence, the finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead, therefore Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.<ref>{{cite journal|first=M.

The last work he was able to complete was the substitute final movement of the [[String Quartet No. 13 (Beethoven)|String Quartet No. 13, Op. 130]], composed to replace the difficult [[Gro\u00dfe Fuge]], which was published separately as Opus 133.

Among other evidence, the finding of shrunken cochlear nerves at his autopsy is consistent with axonal degeneration due to heavy metals such as lead. Chronic low-level lead exposure causes a slowly progressive hearing loss with sensory and autonomic findings, rather than the classic wrist drop due to motor neuropathy from sub-acute poisoning. Beethoven's physicians thought that he had alcohol dependence. He particularly liked wine that happened to be tainted with lead, therefore Beethoven's chronic consumption of wine tainted with lead is a better explanation of his hearing loss than other causes.<ref>{{cite journal|first=M.

Mayer]] over creative, social and financial matters. For example, many people believe that at the double-wedding of Garbo and Gilbert and director [[King Vidor]] and actress [[Eleanor Boardman]], Mayer made a crude remark about Garbo that led Gilbert to punch Mayer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-xpm-2013-may-13-la-et-mn-john-gilbert-20130515-story.html|title=John Gilbert, the silent era's talk of the town|date=2013-05-13|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> This story has been disputed by some historians, although the bride, Eleanor Boardman\u2014claimed to be an eyewitness to the scene.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/you_must_remember_this/2015/10/the_true_story_of_the_romance_between_john_gilbert_and_greta_garbo.html|title=The Lover and the Object of His Affection|last=Longworth|first=Karina|date=2015-10-09|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-24|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, Mayer apparently detested Gilbert and was disgruntled that the actor had signed a contract for six pictures at $250,000 each. It was suggested that Mayer deliberately gave Gilbert bad scripts and ineffective directors in an effort to void the contract.\n\nWith the coming of sound, Gilbert's vocal talents made a good first impression in the all-star musical comedy ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' (1929), appearing in a [[Technicolor]] sequence with [[Norma Shearer]]. They played the balcony scene from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', first as written, and then using current slang. Most reviewers did not note any problems with Gilbert's voice at this time and some praised it.\n\n====''His Glorious Night''====\nAudiences awaited Gilbert's first romantic role on the talking screen. The vehicle was the [[Ruritanian]] romance ''[[His Glorious Night]]'' (1929), directed by [[Lionel Barrymore]]. According to reviewers, audiences laughed nervously at Gilbert's performance. The fault was not Gilbert's voice, it was said, but the awkward scenario along with overly ardent love scenes. In one, Gilbert keeps kissing his leading lady, ([[Catherine Dale Owen]]), while saying \"I love you\" over and over again. The scene was parodied in the MGM musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) in which a preview of the fictional ''The Dueling Cavalier'' flops disastrously. Director [[King Vidor]] stated that [[Rudolph Valentino]], Gilbert's main rival in the 1920s for romantic leads, probably would have suffered the same fate in the talkie era, had he lived. It was rumored that L.B. Mayer ordered Gilbert's voice to be gelded to a higher pitch to ruin him.\n\nThe next Gilbert film to be released was ''[[Redemption (1930 film)|Redemption]]'' (1930) with Adoree, actually shot before ''His Glorious Night''.\n\n===Decline===\nMGM put him in a more rugged film, ''[[Way for a Sailor]]'' (1930) with [[Wallace Beery]]. He followed it with ''[[Gentleman's Fate]]'' (1931).\n\nGilbert became increasingly depressed by progressively inferior films and idle stretches between productions, but he resolved to thwart Louis B. Mayer and see the six-picture contract through.\n\nGilbert's fortunes were temporarily restored when MGM's production chief [[Irving Thalberg]] gave him two projects that were character studies, giving Gilbert an excellent showcase for his versatility. ''[[The Phantom of Paris]]'' (1931), originally intended for [[Lon Chaney]] (who died from cancer in 1930), cast Gilbert as a debonair magician and showman who is falsely accused of murder and uses his mastery of disguise to unmask the real killer.<ref>John Gilbert First Actor To Utilize Super-Sensitive Film\n''The China Press'' 21 Dec 1931: A28.</ref>\n\n''[[Downstairs (film)|Downstairs]]'' (1932) was based on Gilbert's original story, with the actor playing against type as a scheming, [[blackmail]]ing [[chauffeur]].

He left the studio in 1933 at the end of his $10,000 a week contract.<ref>JOHN GILBERT ON VACATION: Now a Free Lance, Actor Expects Rejuvenation of Hollywood.\n''New York Times'' 19 Apr 1933: 14.</ref>\n\n===''Queen Christina'' - Comeback===\nGilbert announced his retirement from acting.

Garbo was top-billed, with Gilbert's name beneath the title. Again, the picture failed to revive his career.<ref>John Gilbert Wants Contract Interpreted\n''The Washington Post'' 6 Dec 1933: 8.</ref>\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] gave him what would be his final chance for a comeback in ''[[The Captain Hates the Sea]]'' (1934) in which he gave a capable performance as a frustrated playwright. But the off-screen cast of heavy drinkers encouraged his [[alcoholism]] and the film was his last.\n\n==Personal life==\nGilbert was married four times. His first marriage, on August 26, 1918, was to Olivia Burwell, a native of [[Mississippi]] whom Gilbert had met after her family moved to California. They separated the following year and Burwell returned to Mississippi for a while. She filed for divorce in Los Angeles in 1921.<ref>Golden, 2013. pp.38, 43, 60</ref>\n\nIn February 1921, Gilbert announced his engagement to actress [[Leatrice Joy]].

They soon began a highly publicized relationship, much to the delight of their fans. Gilbert wanted to marry her, but Garbo continually balked. Legend has it that a wedding was finally planned but Garbo failed to appear at the ceremony. Recent Garbo biographers, however, have questioned the veracity of this story.<ref>DEATH CALLS TO GILBERT, SCREEN STAR: Actor Dies After Heart Attack Great Lover of Films, Figure in Real Life Romances, Rose From Extra Ranks\n''Los Angeles Times'' 10 Jan 1936: 1.</ref>\n\nHe made ''[[The Show (1927 film)|The Show]]'' (1927) with Adoree for [[Tod Browning]] then did ''[[Twelve Miles Out]]'' (1927) with [[Joan Crawford]] and ''[[Man, Woman and Sin]]'' (1927) with [[Jeanne Eagels]].<ref>JOHN GILBERT WON SPURS\n''Los Angeles Times'' 10 Mar 1927: A11.</ref>\n\nHe was reunited with Garbo in ''[[Love (1927 American film)|Love]]'' (1927), which was a modern adaptation of ''[[Anna Karenina]]''. It was slyly advertised by MGM as \"Garbo and Gilbert in ''Love''.\" In 1927 he went to jail for ten days for disturbing the peace.<ref>John Gilbert, Actor, To Jail for 10 Days\n''The Washington Post'' 19 Apr 1927: 1.</ref>\n\nGilbert made ''[[The Cossacks (1928 film)|The Cossacks]]'' (1928) with Adoree; ''[[Four Walls (film)|Four Walls]]'' (1928) with Crawford; ''[[Show People]]'' (1928) with [[Marion Davies]] for Vidor, in which Gilbert only had a cameo; and ''[[The Masks of the Devil]]'' (1928) for [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]].\n\nGilbert and Garbo were teamed for a third time in ''[[A Woman of Affairs]]'' (1928). His last silent film was ''[[Desert Nights]]'' (1929).\n\n===Coming of Sound===\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{essay|section|date=July 2017}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\n}}\nThroughout his time at MGM, Gilbert frequently clashed with studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] over creative, social and financial matters. For example, many people believe that at the double-wedding of Garbo and Gilbert and director [[King Vidor]] and actress [[Eleanor Boardman]], Mayer made a crude remark about Garbo that led Gilbert to punch Mayer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-xpm-2013-may-13-la-et-mn-john-gilbert-20130515-story.html|title=John Gilbert, the silent era's talk of the town|date=2013-05-13|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref> This story has been disputed by some historians, although the bride, Eleanor Boardman\u2014claimed to be an eyewitness to the scene.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/podcasts/you_must_remember_this/2015/10/the_true_story_of_the_romance_between_john_gilbert_and_greta_garbo.html|title=The Lover and the Object of His Affection|last=Longworth|first=Karina|date=2015-10-09|work=Slate|access-date=2019-11-24|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}</ref>\n\nIn any case, Mayer apparently detested Gilbert and was disgruntled that the actor had signed a contract for six pictures at $250,000 each. It was suggested that Mayer deliberately gave Gilbert bad scripts and ineffective directors in an effort to void the contract.\n\nWith the coming of sound, Gilbert's vocal talents made a good first impression in the all-star musical comedy ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' (1929), appearing in a [[Technicolor]] sequence with [[Norma Shearer]]. They played the balcony scene from [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', first as written, and then using current slang. Most reviewers did not note any problems with Gilbert's voice at this time and some praised it.\n\n====''His Glorious Night''====\nAudiences awaited Gilbert's first romantic role on the talking screen. The vehicle was the [[Ruritanian]] romance ''[[His Glorious Night]]'' (1929), directed by [[Lionel Barrymore]]. According to reviewers, audiences laughed nervously at Gilbert's performance. The fault was not Gilbert's voice, it was said, but the awkward scenario along with overly ardent love scenes. In one, Gilbert keeps kissing his leading lady, ([[Catherine Dale Owen]]), while saying \"I love you\" over and over again. The scene was parodied in the MGM musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]'' (1952) in which a preview of the fictional ''The Dueling Cavalier'' flops disastrously. Director [[King Vidor]] stated that [[Rudolph Valentino]], Gilbert's main rival in the 1920s for romantic leads, probably would have suffered the same fate in the talkie era, had he lived. It was rumored that L.B. Mayer ordered Gilbert's voice to be gelded to a higher pitch to ruin him.\n\nThe next Gilbert film to be released was ''[[Redemption (1930 film)|Redemption]]'' (1930) with Adoree, actually shot before ''His Glorious Night''.\n\n===Decline===\nMGM put him in a more rugged film, ''[[Way for a Sailor]]'' (1930) with [[Wallace Beery]]. He followed it with ''[[Gentleman's Fate]]'' (1931).\n\nGilbert became increasingly depressed by progressively inferior films and idle stretches between productions, but he resolved to thwart Louis B. Mayer and see the six-picture contract through.\n\nGilbert's fortunes were temporarily restored when MGM's production chief [[Irving Thalberg]] gave him two projects that were character studies, giving Gilbert an excellent showcase for his versatility. ''[[The Phantom of Paris]]'' (1931), originally intended for [[Lon Chaney]] (who died from cancer in 1930), cast Gilbert as a debonair magician and showman who is falsely accused of murder and uses his mastery of disguise to unmask the real killer.<ref>John Gilbert First Actor To Utilize Super-Sensitive Film\n''The China Press'' 21 Dec 1931: A28.</ref>\n\n''[[Downstairs (film)|Downstairs]]'' (1932) was based on Gilbert's original story, with the actor playing against type as a scheming, [[blackmail]]ing [[chauffeur]]. The films were well received by critics and fans but failed to revive his career.<ref>John Gilbert Delights In Own Creation: Reviewer Encournges Actor To Break Away From Saecharine Roles\nM A. ''The China Press'' 0 Dec 1932: 3.</ref> In between he appeared in ''[[West of Broadway]]'' (1931).\n\nShortly after making ''Downstairs'', he married co-star [[Virginia Bruce]]; the couple divorced in 1934.\n\nGilbert fulfilled his contract with an unimportant \"B\" picture - ''[[Fast Workers]]'' (1933) directed by Browning. He left the studio in 1933 at the end of his $10,000 a week contract.<ref>JOHN GILBERT ON VACATION: Now a Free Lance, Actor Expects Rejuvenation of Hollywood.\n''New York Times'' 19 Apr 1933: 14.</ref>\n\n===''Queen Christina'' - Comeback===\nGilbert announced his retirement from acting. He was working at Fox as an \"honorary\" director when in August 1933 Gilbert announced he had signed a seven year contract with MGM at $75\u2013100,000 a picture.<ref>John Gilbert Signs Seven Year Contract as Actor for M-G-M\n''Chicago Daily Tribune'' 11 Aug 1933: 21.</ref> The reason was  Greta Garbo insisted that Gilbert return to MGM to play her leading man in ''[[Queen Christina (film)|Queen Christina]]'' (1933), directed by [[Rouben Mamoulian]]. Garbo was top-billed, with Gilbert's name beneath the title. Again, the picture failed to revive his career.<ref>John Gilbert Wants Contract Interpreted\n''The Washington Post'' 6 Dec 1933: 8.</ref>\n\n[[Columbia Pictures]] gave him what would be his final chance for a comeback in ''[[The Captain Hates the Sea]]'' (1934) in which he gave a capable performance as a frustrated playwright. But the off-screen cast of heavy drinkers encouraged his [[alcoholism]] and the film was his last.\n\n==Personal life==\nGilbert was married four times. His first marriage, on August 26, 1918, was to Olivia Burwell, a native of [[Mississippi]] whom Gilbert had met after her family moved to California. They separated the following year and Burwell returned to Mississippi for a while. She filed for divorce in Los Angeles in 1921.<ref>Golden, 2013. pp.38, 43, 60</ref>\n\nIn February 1921, Gilbert announced his engagement to actress [[Leatrice Joy]].

The expression Orthodox, is for the Dutch situation at least, of a later date than the existence of the congregations that make up the NIK and the NIK itself. The [[Rabbi]] of the NIK is Rabbi Dr. [[Raphael Evers]]. In total, the NIK has some 20{{cn|date=July 2019}} rabbis actively working in 18 congregations throughout the country, serving some 5,000 Jews.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nThe NIK was founded in 1814 under the reign of [[William I of the Netherlands|Willem I]], although the first steps towards a central organisation of Jewish communities in the Netherlands (which was the initial purpose of the NIK) were already taken in 1808, under command of [[Napoleon]]. The NIK was to form an umbrella over the existing Jewish communities. The NIK and its member-congregations maintained the traditional view on Judaism as it had been ever since and kept on going along this line, till today. Both the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] communities were included. The newly found umbrella organisation had a clear hierarchical design: the Jewish communities were governed on a local level by twelve so-called large \"hoofdsynagogen\" (lit.: head synagogues), which had the power over the medium-sized synagogues (communities), which themselves had power over the smallest synagogues (called \"bijkerken\", like small Jewish communities on the Dutch countryside). Of the twelve \"hoofdsynagogen\", two were located in [[Amsterdam]] (Ashkenazi and Sephardic), two in [[The Hague]] (Ashkenazi and Sephardic), and one each in [[Rotterdam]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Middelburg]], [[Den Bosch]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Zwolle]], [[Leeuwarden]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] (all Ashkenazi, at that time called \"Hoogduits\", lit. \"High German\"). Two years later, another two were included: one in [[Maastricht]], and one in [[Brussels]] (at that time [[Belgium]] was part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands).\n\nThis form of structuring the Jewish community in the Netherlands gave a lot of power to the (chief) rabbis, as they were given the power to govern the entire community. With the new constitution in 1848 however, things changed. In its first step to a fully secular state, the government decided towards a separation of Church and State. This banned rabbis from any administrative role whatsoever.\n\n1871 saw new regulations for the organisation. The Sephardic communities left the NIK to form the [[Portugees-Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]], gaining full independence within the Jewish community again as they had had in the centuries preceding the NIK. The NIK became thus fully Ashkenazi.\n\nThe NIK saw its height in 1877 when it administered over some 176 Jewish communities throughout the Netherlands. The following decades saw a steady decline, administrating 139 communities on the eve of [[World War II]]. \n\n===20th century===\nThe [[Holocaust]] destroyed most of the congregations, as at least 105,000 on a total of 140,000 Dutch Jews were killed by the [[Nazis]] between 1940 and 1945.\n\n\n===21st century===\nThe NIK has some 20 rabbis governing some 36 Jewish communities or some 5,000 Jews and giving chaplaincy in the armed forces and to Jewish inmates.  This makes them the largest Jewish religious organisation in the Netherlands. The NIK follows the rules of [[Orthodox Judaism]], meaning among other things a separation between men and women during religious services and only accepting members who are [[Halakha|halakhically]] Jewish. Despite the fact that the NIK follows the rules of Orthodox Judaism, most members do not consider themselves to be Orthodox Jews; thus making the NIK an organisation with a traditional Jewish outlook.\n\nMain rabbi for the NIK is Rabbi Dr. Raphael Evers, who serves by large as the face of the organisation in the media, representing the Jewish voice and opinion.\n\nAlong with the larger Jewish communities, the NIK is responsible for supervising whether the rules for [[kashrut]] are followed, as well as the [[mikvah|mikvaot]] (ritual baths), the upkeep of some two-hundred Jewish cemeteries in the Netherlands (on a national total of two-hundred-and-fifty) and (Orthodox) conversions to Judaism by non-Jews. The NIK also functions as a Jewish book publisher for the rather small Dutch language, bringing a variety of books with Jewish content to the Dutch-reading public, a.o. translated Torah, prayerbooks, part of the Mishna, Kitsur Shulchan Aruch, manuals for Jewish daily life and a successful structured plan for Jewish education to children from 4 years old and on to over 13 years.\nPart of the NIK is the Nederlands Isra\u00eblietisch Seminarium, the Jewish seminary, a state-recognized educational institution, which educates for Jewish teacher and rabbi.\nFour times a year the NIK publishes Hakehillot, a magazine for the Jews in the Netherlands, whilst it maintains a weekly updated news site and e-letter too.\n\n==Congregations==\n===Current===\nCongregations are called Nederlands Isra\u00eblietische Gemeente (NIG) or Joodse Gemeente. They exist in the following places:\n* '''[[Almere]]'''. The NIG Almere was founded on 5 January 1997, making it the youngest NIK-Jewish community in the country. Rabbi for the community is rabbi Moshe Stiefel, who also has plans to start a community in [[Lelystad]], the capital of [[Flevoland]] province. Because of its proximity to Amsterdam, with more than 15,000 Jews the center of Jewish life in the Netherlands, Jewish Almere is steadily growing. A Jewish cemetery for the community was inaugurated on January 2004.\n* '''[[Amersfoort]]'''. The Jewish community in Amersfoort is currently one of the biggest outside of Amsterdam. Jewish life in Amersfoort started in the 17th century when [[Sephardic Jews]] settled inside the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/9784/amersfoort.html |title=Jewish Amersfoort |accessdate=30 December 2007 |language=Dutch |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmmWqHOZ |archivedate=25 October 2009 }}</ref> At the beginning of the 18th century they were joined by [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. The community grew to some 400 members in 1930. A large number of them managed to go into hiding at the beginning of the Second World War. The community was re-established in 1945, and had some 230 members in the first two decades after the war, diminishing to some 130 at the end of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jhm.nl/cultuur-en-geschiedenis/nederland/utrecht/amersfoort | title=Jewish Historical Museum Amsterdam - Amersfoort | accessdate=17 January 2012 | language=Dutch}}</ref> Nevertheless, the community still thrives. Amersfoort is the residence of Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs, who serves as the main religious leader for the Jewish communities outside of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Leiden. Amersfoort is also home to the Sinai Center for Jewish Mental Health.\n* '''[[Jewish Amsterdam|Amsterdam]]'''. \n* '''[[Breda]]'''. The Jewish community in Breda numbers some 60 members, spread over the western part of the province of [[North Brabant]]. Jewish life officially started in 1803, and grew fast, numbering 230 persons in 1840 and 284 in 1899. This eventually declined to 181 persons in 1930. Approximately one of three Breda Jews survived the Holocaust. Jewish life restarted again after the war, and now Breda still boosts a lifely community, which has its own library and magazine.\n* '''[[Bussum]]'''. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bussum saw the rise of a Jewish community. Religious services were first held in Bussum in 1911. The community grew strong in the years following, reaching 341 members in 1930. After that, the community grew even more due to the influx of dozens of German-Jewish refugees. Approximately half of the Jews in Bussum were killed in the Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War. After the war Jewish life was restored and managed to flourish, with more than 200 people part of the community up until the 1970s. This number diminished slightly to some 150 members at the eve of the 21st century, making it one of the bigger Jewish communities in the Netherlands outside of Amsterdam (home to 15,000 Jews).\n[[File:Enschede Synagoge Ingang.jpg|thumb|The synagogue in the city of [[Enschede]], inaugurated by the Jewish community in 1928.]]\n* '''[[Enschede]]'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synagoge-enschede.nl/|title=synagoge-enschede.nl|website=www.synagoge-enschede.nl}}</ref>  The 17th century saw the first arrival of Jews in [[Enschede]]. The community grew due to the existence of industry in and around the city, and there were more than 1,400 Jews living in the city in 1941. Although the community was hit hard during the war, 395 Jews were still left in or returned to the city in June 1945.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.synagoge-enschede.nl/ | title=Synagogue Enschede - Jewish Enschede | publisher=Synagoge-Enschede.nl | accessdate=30 December 2007 | language=Dutch}}</ref> The first few years saw a strong Jewish community of some 300 persons resurfacing in the city. However, due to migration, aging, assimilation, and secularization, the community dwindled to some 70 members in 2006. The NIG communities in [[Hengelo]] and [[Almelo]] merged with the NIG community in Enschede in June 2006 to form the '''NIG Twente''', [[Twente]] being the region around Enschede. August 2007 saw the appointment of a new rabbi within the community, rabbi Eliahoe Aharon Philipson, after rabbi Dov I. Salzmann, the previous rabbi, being the first post-Holocaust rabbi, retired and returned to his hometown Rehovot in Israel.\n* [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]\n* [[Haarlem]]. Since the end of the 20th century being led by the dynamic rabbi Shmuel Spiero and since then one of the faster-growing communities.\n* '''[[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitische Gemeente Den Haag|The Hague]]'''\n* '''[[Leeuwarden]]'''. Jewish life in Leeuwarden flourished in the second part of the 19th century when the community numbered some 1,200 persons. This declined to 750 in the 1930s. The Holocaust saw the destruction of the once vibrant community. In 1951 the community had some 139 members; nowadays some 50 people are part of the congregation. In 1980 new synagogue was inaugurated in the former rabbi's residence, after the pre-war synagogue proved to be too big for the declining community. At the beginning of the 21st century, the local community managed to hold a weekly course in Talmud.\n* '''[[Leiden]]'''. Having the [[Leiden University|oldest university]] in the Netherlands, Leiden has for a long time attracted a large number of students, including many Jews. In the 17th and 18th century, most of them were of [[Sefardic]] origin; later on, the community became predominantly [[Ashkenazi]]. The community saw its height in the middle of the 19th century, numbering more than 500 persons. In 1930 the community had declined to some 340 persons. The Holocaust severely affected Jewish life in Leiden but did not destroy it. In 1998, some 100 persons were part of the NIG Leiden.<ref>http://www.joodsleiden.nl/index.html</ref> Among them is a large number of (non-Dutch) students. Leiden is also the home of the Joods Studiecentrum (Jewish Center of Learning)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joodsstudiecentrum.nl/|title=Joods Studiecentrum Leiden|website=www.joodsstudiecentrum.nl}}</ref> established in 1983 to accommodate the growing interest in the Netherlands among Jews and non-Jews in learning more about Judaism.\n* '''[[Maastricht]]'''. The congregation in Maastricht is led by Rabbi Yaakov Y. Schapiro, an American, affiliated to the [[Chabad]] movement. The community was formed in the 1980s when several communities throughout the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] joined together to form one congregation in Maastricht.<ref>http://www.synagoguemaastricht.com/</ref> [[Shabbath]] services are held on a weekly basis. Kosher food in Maastricht is available since the rabbi's arrival.\n* '''[[Middelburg]]'''. The NIG congregation in Middelburg is part of a congregation that compromises the entire province of [[Zeeland]]. It numbers some 40 active members, most of them concentrated around Middelburg and [[Vlissingen]]. The Holocaust saw the destruction of the old Jewish community of Middelburg, but eventually, after 50 years, a new synagogue was inaugurated in November 1994. On 30 June 2004, a Jewish marriage took place at the synagogue, the first one in Middelburg since the start of [[World War II]] in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~vriespr/ejgz.html|title=More information on NIG Zeeland|publisher=}}</ref>\n* '''[[Nijmegen]]'''. The Jewish community in Nijmegen was once the biggest and oldest Jewish community in the Netherlands, already in existence in the first part of the 14th century. The community was destroyed in 1349 after accusations that Jews had spread the [[Black Plague]], but several Jews resettled in the town again already in 1386. This community lasted some 100 years. At the beginning of the 17th century, Jewish life was again established. The community grew to some 530 persons in 1940. In the five years following, however, the community was largely destroyed by the Nazis. This didn't prevent the survivors from restarting the community again after the war had ended. In 2000, the community returned to its original 17th-century synagogue and left the 19th-century building adjacent to what was once the synagogue. The Jewish community is growing since the move to the ancient synagogue, attracting new interested Jewish people. It holds services and all kinds of cultural, social and religious events.\n[[File:Synagoge Zwolle.jpg|thumb|The synagogue in the city of [[Zwolle]].]]\n* '''[[Rotterdam]]'''. The history of the Jewish community in Rotterdam starts at the beginning of the 17th century, with the arrival of several [[Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands|Sephardic]] traders settling in this port city. The community grows slowly. From 1650 onwards, several Ashkenazi Jews, fleeing persecution in Poland and Germany, also settle in Rotterdam. With the growth of the city, the Jewish community grows as well, numbering some 2,500 at the end of the 18th century, making it the second-largest Jewish community in the Netherlands after Amsterdam. Up until the 1930s, the community grew even further, numbering almost 11,000 at the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. The Holocaust put a stop to the flourishing Jewish life in the town; no more than 13% of the Rotterdam Jews survives.

Hilversum was hit hard by the Holocaust: no more than 10% of its Jewish inhabitants survived the war. Despite that, Jewish life in Hilversum flourished in the 1950s and 1960s, with some 200 Jews attending synagogue and participating in the Hilversum ''kehillah''. After that numbers dwindled.

The expression Orthodox, is for the Dutch situation at least, of a later date than the existence of the congregations that make up the NIK and the NIK itself. The [[Rabbi]] of the NIK is Rabbi Dr. [[Raphael Evers]]. In total, the NIK has some 20{{cn|date=July 2019}} rabbis actively working in 18 congregations throughout the country, serving some 5,000 Jews.{{cn|date=July 2019}}\n\n==History==\n===19th century===\nThe NIK was founded in 1814 under the reign of [[William I of the Netherlands|Willem I]], although the first steps towards a central organisation of Jewish communities in the Netherlands (which was the initial purpose of the NIK) were already taken in 1808, under command of [[Napoleon]]. The NIK was to form an umbrella over the existing Jewish communities. The NIK and its member-congregations maintained the traditional view on Judaism as it had been ever since and kept on going along this line, till today. Both the [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] and [[Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]] communities were included. The newly found umbrella organisation had a clear hierarchical design: the Jewish communities were governed on a local level by twelve so-called large \"hoofdsynagogen\" (lit.: head synagogues), which had the power over the medium-sized synagogues (communities), which themselves had power over the smallest synagogues (called \"bijkerken\", like small Jewish communities on the Dutch countryside). Of the twelve \"hoofdsynagogen\", two were located in [[Amsterdam]] (Ashkenazi and Sephardic), two in [[The Hague]] (Ashkenazi and Sephardic), and one each in [[Rotterdam]], [[Amersfoort]], [[Middelburg]], [[Den Bosch]], [[Nijmegen]], [[Zwolle]], [[Leeuwarden]] and [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] (all Ashkenazi, at that time called \"Hoogduits\", lit. \"High German\"). Two years later, another two were included: one in [[Maastricht]], and one in [[Brussels]] (at that time [[Belgium]] was part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands).\n\nThis form of structuring the Jewish community in the Netherlands gave a lot of power to the (chief) rabbis, as they were given the power to govern the entire community. With the new constitution in 1848 however, things changed. In its first step to a fully secular state, the government decided towards a separation of Church and State. This banned rabbis from any administrative role whatsoever.\n\n1871 saw new regulations for the organisation. The Sephardic communities left the NIK to form the [[Portugees-Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap]], gaining full independence within the Jewish community again as they had had in the centuries preceding the NIK. The NIK became thus fully Ashkenazi.\n\nThe NIK saw its height in 1877 when it administered over some 176 Jewish communities throughout the Netherlands. The following decades saw a steady decline, administrating 139 communities on the eve of [[World War II]]. \n\n===20th century===\nThe [[Holocaust]] destroyed most of the congregations, as at least 105,000 on a total of 140,000 Dutch Jews were killed by the [[Nazis]] between 1940 and 1945.\n\n\n===21st century===\nThe NIK has some 20 rabbis governing some 36 Jewish communities or some 5,000 Jews and giving chaplaincy in the armed forces and to Jewish inmates.  This makes them the largest Jewish religious organisation in the Netherlands. The NIK follows the rules of [[Orthodox Judaism]], meaning among other things a separation between men and women during religious services and only accepting members who are [[Halakha|halakhically]] Jewish. Despite the fact that the NIK follows the rules of Orthodox Judaism, most members do not consider themselves to be Orthodox Jews; thus making the NIK an organisation with a traditional Jewish outlook.\n\nMain rabbi for the NIK is Rabbi Dr. Raphael Evers, who serves by large as the face of the organisation in the media, representing the Jewish voice and opinion.\n\nAlong with the larger Jewish communities, the NIK is responsible for supervising whether the rules for [[kashrut]] are followed, as well as the [[mikvah|mikvaot]] (ritual baths), the upkeep of some two-hundred Jewish cemeteries in the Netherlands (on a national total of two-hundred-and-fifty) and (Orthodox) conversions to Judaism by non-Jews. The NIK also functions as a Jewish book publisher for the rather small Dutch language, bringing a variety of books with Jewish content to the Dutch-reading public, a.o. translated Torah, prayerbooks, part of the Mishna, Kitsur Shulchan Aruch, manuals for Jewish daily life and a successful structured plan for Jewish education to children from 4 years old and on to over 13 years.\nPart of the NIK is the Nederlands Isra\u00eblietisch Seminarium, the Jewish seminary, a state-recognized educational institution, which educates for Jewish teacher and rabbi.\nFour times a year the NIK publishes Hakehillot, a magazine for the Jews in the Netherlands, whilst it maintains a weekly updated news site and e-letter too.\n\n==Congregations==\n===Current===\nCongregations are called Nederlands Isra\u00eblietische Gemeente (NIG) or Joodse Gemeente. They exist in the following places:\n* '''[[Almere]]'''. The NIG Almere was founded on 5 January 1997, making it the youngest NIK-Jewish community in the country. Rabbi for the community is rabbi Moshe Stiefel, who also has plans to start a community in [[Lelystad]], the capital of [[Flevoland]] province. Because of its proximity to Amsterdam, with more than 15,000 Jews the center of Jewish life in the Netherlands, Jewish Almere is steadily growing. A Jewish cemetery for the community was inaugurated on January 2004.\n* '''[[Amersfoort]]'''. The Jewish community in Amersfoort is currently one of the biggest outside of Amsterdam. Jewish life in Amersfoort started in the 17th century when [[Sephardic Jews]] settled inside the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Oracle/9784/amersfoort.html |title=Jewish Amersfoort |accessdate=30 December 2007 |language=Dutch |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kmmWqHOZ |archivedate=25 October 2009 }}</ref> At the beginning of the 18th century they were joined by [[Ashkenazi Jews]]. The community grew to some 400 members in 1930. A large number of them managed to go into hiding at the beginning of the Second World War. The community was re-established in 1945, and had some 230 members in the first two decades after the war, diminishing to some 130 at the end of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.jhm.nl/cultuur-en-geschiedenis/nederland/utrecht/amersfoort | title=Jewish Historical Museum Amsterdam - Amersfoort | accessdate=17 January 2012 | language=Dutch}}</ref> Nevertheless, the community still thrives. Amersfoort is the residence of Rabbi Binyomin Jacobs, who serves as the main religious leader for the Jewish communities outside of Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, and Leiden. Amersfoort is also home to the Sinai Center for Jewish Mental Health.\n* '''[[Jewish Amsterdam|Amsterdam]]'''. \n* '''[[Breda]]'''. The Jewish community in Breda numbers some 60 members, spread over the western part of the province of [[North Brabant]]. Jewish life officially started in 1803, and grew fast, numbering 230 persons in 1840 and 284 in 1899. This eventually declined to 181 persons in 1930. Approximately one of three Breda Jews survived the Holocaust. Jewish life restarted again after the war, and now Breda still boosts a lifely community, which has its own library and magazine.\n* '''[[Bussum]]'''. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bussum saw the rise of a Jewish community. Religious services were first held in Bussum in 1911. The community grew strong in the years following, reaching 341 members in 1930. After that, the community grew even more due to the influx of dozens of German-Jewish refugees. Approximately half of the Jews in Bussum were killed in the Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War. After the war Jewish life was restored and managed to flourish, with more than 200 person part of the community up until the 1970s. This number diminished slightly to some 150 members at the eve of the 21st century, making it one of the bigger Jewish communities in the Netherlands outside of Amsterdam (home to 15,000 Jews).\n[[File:Enschede Synagoge Ingang.jpg|thumb|The synagogue in the city of [[Enschede]], inaugurated by the Jewish community in 1928.]]\n* '''[[Enschede]]'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synagoge-enschede.nl/|title=synagoge-enschede.nl|website=www.synagoge-enschede.nl}}</ref>  The 17th century saw the first arrival of Jews in [[Enschede]]. The community grew due to the existence of industry in and around the city, and there were more than 1,400 Jews living in the city in 1941. Although the community was hit hard during the war, 395 Jews were still left in or returned to the city in June 1945.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.synagoge-enschede.nl/ | title=Synagogue Enschede - Jewish Enschede | publisher=Synagoge-Enschede.nl | accessdate=30 December 2007 | language=Dutch}}</ref> The first few years saw a strong Jewish community of some 300 persons resurfacing in the city. However, due to migration, aging, assimilation, and secularization, the community dwindled to some 70 members in 2006. The NIG communities in [[Hengelo]] and [[Almelo]] merged with the NIG community in Enschede in June 2006 to form the '''NIG Twente''', [[Twente]] being the region around Enschede. August 2007 saw the appointment of a new rabbi within the community, rabbi Eliahoe Aharon Philipson, after rabbi Dov I. Salzmann, the previous rabbi, being the first post-Holocaust rabbi, retired and returned to his hometown Rehovot in Israel.\n* [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]]\n* [[Haarlem]]. Since the end of the 20th century being led by the dynamic rabbi Shmuel Spiero and since then one of the faster-growing communities.\n* '''[[Nederlands Isra\u00eblitische Gemeente Den Haag|The Hague]]'''\n* '''[[Leeuwarden]]'''. Jewish life in Leeuwarden flourished in the second part of the 19th century when the community numbered some 1,200 persons. This declined to 750 in the 1930s. The Holocaust saw the destruction of the once vibrant community. In 1951 the community had some 139 members; nowadays some 50 people are part of the congregation. In 1980 new synagogue was inaugurated in the former rabbi's residence, after the pre-war synagogue proved to be too big for the declining community. At the beginning of the 21st century, the local community managed to hold a weekly course in Talmud.\n* '''[[Leiden]]'''. Having the [[Leiden University|oldest university]] in the Netherlands, Leiden has for a long time attracted a large number of students, including many Jews. In the 17th and 18th century, most of them were of [[Sefardic]] origin; later on, the community became predominantly [[Ashkenazi]]. The community saw its height in the middle of the 19th century, numbering more than 500 persons. In 1930 the community had declined to some 340 persons. The Holocaust severely affected Jewish life in Leiden but did not destroy it. In 1998, some 100 persons were part of the NIG Leiden.<ref>http://www.joodsleiden.nl/index.html</ref> Among them is a large number of (non-Dutch) students. Leiden is also the home of the Joods Studiecentrum (Jewish Center of Learning)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.joodsstudiecentrum.nl/|title=Joods Studiecentrum Leiden|website=www.joodsstudiecentrum.nl}}</ref> established in 1983 to accommodate the growing interest in the Netherlands among Jews and non-Jews in learning more about Judaism.\n* '''[[Maastricht]]'''. The congregation in Maastricht is led by rabbi Yaakov Y. Schapiro, an American, affiliated to the [[Chabad]] movement. The community was formed in the 1980s when several communities throughout the province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] joined together to form one congregation in Maastricht.<ref>http://www.synagoguemaastricht.com/</ref> [[Shabbath]] services are held on a weekly basis. Kosher food in Maastricht is available since the rabbi's arrival.\n* '''[[Middelburg]]'''. The NIG congregation in Middelburg is part of a congregation which compromises the entire province of [[Zeeland]]. It numbers some 40 active members, most of them concentrated around Middelburg and [[Vlissingen]]. The Holocaust saw the destruction of the old Jewish community of Middelburg, but eventually, after 50 years, a new synagogue was inaugurated in November 1994. On 30 June 2004, a Jewish marriage took place at the synagogue, the first one in Middelburg since the start of [[World War II]] in 1940.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~vriespr/ejgz.html|title=More information on NIG Zeeland|publisher=}}</ref>\n* '''[[Nijmegen]]'''. The Jewish community in Nijmegen was once the biggest and oldest Jewish community in the Netherlands, already in existence in the first part of the 14th century. The community was destroyed in 1349 after accusations that Jews had spread the [[Black Plague]], but several Jews resettled in the town again already in 1386. This community lasted some 100 years. At the beginning of the 17th century, Jewish life was again established. The community grew to some 530 persons in 1940. In the five years following, however, the community was largely destroyed by the Nazis. This didn't prevent the survivors from restarting the community again after the war had ended. In 2000, the community returned to its original 17th-century synagogue and left the 19th-century building adjacent to what was once the synagogue. The Jewish community is growing since the move to the ancient synagogue, attracting new interested Jewish people. It holds services and all kinds of cultural, social and religious events.\n[[File:Synagoge Zwolle.jpg|thumb|The synagogue in the city of [[Zwolle]].]]\n* '''[[Rotterdam]]'''. The history of the Jewish community in Rotterdam starts at the beginning of the 17th century, with the arrival of several [[Sephardic Jews in the Netherlands|Sephardic]] traders settling in this port city. The community grows slowly. From 1650 onwards, several Ashkenazi Jews, fleeing persecution in Poland and Germany, also settle in Rotterdam. With the growth of the city, the Jewish community grows as well, numbering some 2,500 at the end of the 18th century, making it the second-largest Jewish community in the Netherlands after Amsterdam. Up until the 1930s, the community grew even further, numbering almost 11,000 at the beginning of the [[Second World War]]. The Holocaust put a stop to the flourishing Jewish life in the town; no more than 13% of the Rotterdam Jews survives. In the 1950s, a community numbering some 800 persons (no more than 7% of the pre-war number) revitalises Jewish life again. Besides the existing NIK congregation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nik.nl/default.asp?oUrl=gemeente_detail.asp?fld_pk_GemeenteId=11xxxxxxxxsoort=|title=Nederlands-Isra\u00eblitisch Kerkgenootschap|website=www.nik.nl}}</ref> another Jewish congregation is formed, this one not modern Orthodox but Liberal in form, aligned to the [[Verbond voor Liberaal-Religieuze Joden in Nederland|NVPJ]].
