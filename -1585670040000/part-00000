The original town was platted by a New Yorker named Christian Sharer. A mill was constructed and the Kishwaukee dammed but the town failed. By 1837, after some controversy, the location of [[county seat]] was settled in favor of Orange, Sycamore's original name, and the settlement moved to the present-day site of the city.<ref name=nrhp>Wagner, Robert. \"[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200124.pdf Sycamore Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203200043/http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200124.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }},\" ([[PDF]]), National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form, December 13, 1978, ''[[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]]'', accessed May 21, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe present-day town site was platted by James Waterman and Evans Wharry in 1837 (the same year Chicago was founded). The first settler at the new site was Carlos Lattin, who preceded the town, having arrived in 1835.<ref name=nrhp/> Lattin staked a claim that included most of the present west side of the city and erected his first cabin just north of downtown.<ref name=nrhp/>\n\n===County seat location===\nEarly in the city's history, it seemed that Sycamore might not be the location of the [[DeKalb County Courthouse (Illinois)|DeKalb County Courthouse]]: other towns were vying for the [[county seat]] title.

This time, it was the city of [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]] that sought to wrest the title of county seat away from Sycamore. Two of DeKalb's most prominent citizens, [[Jacob Haish]] and [[Isaac L. Ellwood]], each promised to donate $20,000 to help absorb some of the new building's cost. The city of Sycamore responded, raising funds of their own, and after some back and forth and legal wrangling, the issue was settled in Sycamore's favor.<ref name=mac/>\n\n===Later settlement===\nFollowing the end of the second county seat controversy, in 1839, the first DeKalb County Courthouse was built in the city, as well as Sycamore's first hotel. A year later the settlement consisted of 12 houses, which increased to 18 by 1844. Sycamore then began an era of steady growth marked by population increases in 1848 to 262, 1849 to 320, 1850 to 390, 1851 to 435.<ref name=nrhp/> The Sycamore and Cortland Railroad arrived in the late 1850s and a station was erected in Sycamore. Sycamore was home to 41 commercial and industrial business by 1855. In 1858, Sycamore was incorporated as a [[village]]. Following the [[American Civil War]] the railroad began to assist Sycamore's growth and the settlement was incorporated as a [[city]] in 1869.<ref name=nrhp/>\n\n===Maria Ridulph murder===\n{{Main|Murder of Maria Ridulph}}\n\nSycamore is the location of a notable [[cold case]], the 1957 abduction and murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. On the evening of December 3, 1957, Maria disappeared while playing outside her family's Sycamore home. She was last seen by her playmate Kathy Chapman (n\u00e9e Sigman) with a young man who called himself \"Johnny\" and had approached the girls offering them [[piggyback (transportation)|piggyback]] rides. A search and investigation by local and state police and the [[FBI]] failed to locate either Maria or \"Johnny\", and the following April, Maria's body was found in a field approximately 100 miles from Sycamore. The case remained unsolved for over 50 years until in 2011, Jack Daniel McCullough, a former neighbor of the Ridulphs, was arrested and convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maria. The case received national news coverage as the oldest cold case in US history to result in a conviction.<ref name=48hours>{{cite AV media|people=Greg Fisher, Judy Rybak, and Peter Henderson (producers)|date=May 24, 2014|year=|title=48 Hours Presents: Cold as Ice|trans-title=|medium=documentary|language=English|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-a-childhood-memory-help-solve-1957-murder-of-maria-ridulph/|access-date=April 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424041003/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-a-childhood-memory-help-solve-1957-murder-of-maria-ridulph/|archive-date=April 24, 2016|format=|time=|location=|publisher=[[CBS News]]|id=|isbn=|oclc=|quote=Oldest cold case to go to trial in U.S. tests memories, forces family to expose deep, dark secrets in search of justice for murdered girl|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, in April 2016, McCullough's conviction was overturned and he was released from prison after a post-conviction review of the evidence indicated that he could not have committed the crime.<ref name=oneill04152016>{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=April 15, 2016 |title=Judge Overturns 1957 Cold Case Murder Conviction; Jack McCullough Goes Free |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/us/1957-cold-case-jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph/index.html |access-date=April 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415171802/http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/us/1957-cold-case-jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph/index.html |archive-date=April 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=oneill04222016>{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Charges Dropped in 1957 Cold Case Murder |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/us/jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph-1957-cold-case/ |work=CNN |access-date=April 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422231923/http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/us/jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph-1957-cold-case/ |archive-date=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===2010 earthquake===\n{{Main|2010 Illinois earthquake}}\nOn February 10, 2010, Sycamore and the surrounding areas experienced an [[earthquake]].

It has a commercial district based and centered on [[Illinois Route 64]]. The population was 17,519 at the 2010 census, up from 12,020 in 2000. Sycamore is the county seat of DeKalb County and was named after the sycamore tree.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sycamore_Public_Library,_Sycamore,_Illinois_LCCN2011633629.tif|thumb|right|[[Sycamore Public Library]] (1905) a Carnegie library]]\n\n===Early settlement===\nThe first European settlers to the Sycamore-area arrived in 1835 and concentrated themselves mostly north of the [[Kishwaukee River]] and the present site of Sycamore. The original town was platted by a New Yorker named Christian Sharer. A mill was constructed and the Kishwaukee dammed but the town failed. By 1837, after some controversy, the location of [[county seat]] was settled in favor of Orange, Sycamore's original name, and the settlement moved to the present-day site of the city.<ref name=nrhp>Wagner, Robert. \"[http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200124.pdf Sycamore Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203200043/http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/hargis/PDFs/200124.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }},\" ([[PDF]]), National Register of Historic Places Inventory - Nomination Form, December 13, 1978, ''[[Illinois Historic Preservation Agency]]'', accessed May 21, 2008.</ref>\n\nThe present-day town site was platted by James Waterman and Evans Wharry in 1837 (the same year Chicago was founded). The first settler at the new site was Carlos Lattin, who preceded the town, having arrived in 1835.<ref name=nrhp/> Lattin staked a claim that included most of the present west side of the city and erected his first cabin just north of downtown.<ref name=nrhp/>\n\n===County seat location===\nEarly in the city's history, it seemed that Sycamore might not be the location of the [[DeKalb County Courthouse (Illinois)|DeKalb County Courthouse]]: other towns were vying for the [[county seat]] title.  A now-defunct town called Brush Point was the choice of a Dr. Henry Madden; and the [[County clerk|Clerk of the Court]] Rufus Colton would have preferred Coltonville, where he made his home.<ref name=mac/> Colton had set the first session of county court to be held at his home in Coltonville.<ref name=court/> In his attempt to make Coltonville the county seat, Colton decided to hold a new election for the status in 1837. Colton made sure that Coltonville would win the election by telling only the population of Coltonville about it. His political tactics were eventually cancelled by an act of the [[Illinois General Assembly]],<ref name=mac>Klein, Ron and McIntyre, Mac. \"[http://www.dekalbcounty-il.com/courthouse.html Looking Back at the DeKalb County Courthouse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927193508/http://www.dekalbcounty-il.com/courthouse.html |date=September 27, 2007 }},\" ''DeKalb County Online''.

This time, it was the city of [[DeKalb, Illinois|DeKalb]] that sought to wrest the title of county seat away from Sycamore. Two of DeKalb's most prominent citizens, [[Jacob Haish]] and [[Isaac L. Ellwood]], each promised to donate $20,000 to help absorb some of the new building's cost. The city of Sycamore responded, raising funds of their own, and after some back and forth and legal wrangling, the issue was settled in Sycamore's favor.<ref name=mac/>\n\n===Later settlement===\nFollowing the end of the second county seat controversy, in 1839, the first DeKalb County Courthouse was built in the city, as well as Sycamore's first hotel. A year later the settlement consisted of 12 houses, which increased to 18 by 1844. Sycamore then began an era of steady growth marked by population increases in 1848 to 262, 1849 to 320, 1850 to 390, 1851 to 435.<ref name=nrhp/> The Sycamore and Cortland Railroad arrived in the late 1850s and a station was erected in Sycamore. Sycamore was home to 41 commercial and industrial business by 1855. In 1858, Sycamore was incorporated as a [[village]]. Following the [[American Civil War]] the railroad began to assist Sycamore's growth and the settlement was incorporated as a [[city]] in 1869.<ref name=nrhp/>\n\n===Maria Ridulph murder===\n{{Main|Murder of Maria Ridulph}}\n\nSycamore is the location of a notable [[cold case]], the 1957 abduction and murder of 7-year-old Maria Ridulph. On the evening of December 3, 1957, Maria disappeared while playing outside her family's Sycamore home. She was last seen by her playmate Kathy Chapman (n\u00e9e Sigman) with a young man who called himself \"Johnny\" and had approached the girls offering them [[piggyback (transportation)|piggyback]] rides. A search and investigation by local and state police and the [[FBI]] failed to locate either Maria or \"Johnny\", and the following April, Maria's body was found in a field approximately 100 miles from Sycamore. The case remained unsolved for over 50 years until in 2011, Jack Daniel McCullough, a former neighbor of the Ridulphs, was arrested and convicted of kidnapping and murdering Maria. The case received national news coverage as the oldest cold case in US history to result in a conviction.<ref name=48hours>{{cite AV media|people=Greg Fisher, Judy Rybak, and Peter Henderson (producers)|date=May 24, 2014|year=|title=48 Hours Presents: Cold as Ice|trans-title=|medium=documentary|language=English|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-a-childhood-memory-help-solve-1957-murder-of-maria-ridulph/|access-date=April 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160424041003/http://www.cbsnews.com/news/can-a-childhood-memory-help-solve-1957-murder-of-maria-ridulph/|archive-date=April 24, 2016|format=|time=|location=|publisher=[[CBS News]]|id=|isbn=|oclc=|quote=Oldest cold case to go to trial in U.S. tests memories, forces family to expose deep, dark secrets in search of justice for murdered girl|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, in April 2016, McCullough's conviction was overturned and he was released from prison after a post-conviction review of the evidence indicated that he could not have committed the crime.<ref name=oneill04152016>{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=April 15, 2016 |title=Judge Overturns 1957 Cold Case Murder Conviction; Jack McCullough Goes Free |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/us/1957-cold-case-jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph/index.html |access-date=April 15, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160415171802/http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/15/us/1957-cold-case-jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph/index.html |archive-date=April 15, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=oneill04222016>{{cite news |last=O'Neill |first=Ann |date=April 22, 2016 |title=Charges Dropped in 1957 Cold Case Murder |url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/us/jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph-1957-cold-case/ |work=CNN |access-date=April 22, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422231923/http://www.cnn.com/2016/04/22/us/jack-mccullough-maria-ridulph-1957-cold-case/ |archive-date=April 22, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===2010 earthquake===\n{{Main|2010 Illinois earthquake}}\nOn February 10, 2010, Sycamore and the surrounding areas experienced an [[earthquake]].

As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982/83 many of the industries built by his predecessor suffered with a huge surge in import costs. After years of appreciation under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and despite huge increases in foreign aid the Rupee depreciated.\n\n=== Foreign exchange rate ===\nThe Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar until around the start of the 21st century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar. Pakistan's central bank then stabilised by lowering interest rates and buying dollars, in order to preserve the country's export competitiveness\n\n=== Foreign exchange reserves ===\n\nPakistan maintains foreign reserves with [[State Bank of Pakistan]]. The currency of the reserves was solely US dollar incurring speculated losses after the dollar prices fell during 2005, forcing the then Governor SBP [[Ishrat Hussain]] to step down. In the same year the SBP issued an official statement proclaiming diversification of reserves in currencies including Euro and Yen, withholding ratio of diversification.\n\nFollowing the international credit crisis and spikes in crude oil prices, Pakistan's economy could not withstand the pressure and on 11 October 2008, State Bank of Pakistan reported that the country's foreign exchange reserves had gone down by $571.9 million to $7749.7 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forexpk.com/ |title=Forex Currency Rates Pakistan \u2013 Forex Open Market Rates \u2013 Prize Bond Draw Result \u2013 Rates and schedule \u2013 Finance News & Updates |publisher=Forexpk.com |date=2014-01-06 |accessdate=2014-01-11}}</ref> The foreign exchange reserves had declined more by $10 billion to a level of $6.59 billion.\nin June 2013 Pakistan was on the brink of default on its financial commitments.

While per-capita agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by the growth of the non-agricultural sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen rapid growth in industries (such as apparel, textiles, and cement) and services (such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and finance).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Major sectors ==\n{{See also|List of Pakistani companies}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\n[[File:Agriculture by Province.jpg|thumb|Agriculture by Province]]\n[[File:MangoTree.jpeg|thumb|Mango Orchard in [[Multan]], Pakistan]]\n\nThe most important crops are wheat, [[sugarcane]], cotton, and rice, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 26,674,000 tonnes of wheat, almost equal to all of Africa (27.1 million tonnes) and more than all of South America (25.9 million tonnes), according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=wheat production|website=fao.org|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> In the previous market year of 2018/19 Pakistan exported a record 4.5 million tonnes of rice  as compared to around 4 MMT during the corresponding period last year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Grain%20and%20Feed%20Update_Islamabad_Pakistan_12-30-2019|title=Pakistan Grain and Feed Update|last=|first=|date=|website=gain.fas.usda.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/field/2007/1000497/index.html|title=Pakistan cuts pesticide use dramatically|website=fao.org}}</ref>\n\nPakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years when its harvest is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest [[camel]] market, second-largest [[apricot]] and [[ghee]] market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, play a central role in the government's economic reform package.\n\nMajority of the population, directly or indirectly, dependent on this sector. It contributes about 18.5% percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and accounts for 37.4% of employed labor force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.<ref name=\":3\" /> During 2017\u201318, agriculture sector recorded a remarkable growth of 3.70 percent and surpassed its targeted growth of 3.5 percent and last year's growth of 2.18 percent.

About 25% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia. Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year round warmth. Agriculture accounts for about 18.9% of GDP and employs about 42.3% of the labour force. [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited]] is the largest financial institution geared towards the development of agriculture sector through provision of financial services and technical expertise.\n\n==== Mining ====\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. Based on available information, the country's more than 6,00,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. In the wake of 18th amendment to the constitution all the provinces are free to exploit and explore the mineral resources which are in their jurisdiction.\nMining and quarrying contributes 13.19% in industrial sector and its share in GDP is 2.8%. Pakistan mining and quarrying sector grew by 3.04% in 2018 against the negative growth of -0.38% last year.\n\nIn the recent past, exploration by government agencies as well as by multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of sizeable minerals deposits. Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province, covered by thick alluvial cover have opened new vistas for metallic minerals exploration. Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals. The discovery of coal deposits having over 175 billion tonnes of reserves at Thar in the Sindh province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternative source of energy. There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones.\n\nExtraction of principal minerals in the last 5 fiscal years is given in the table below :-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//mbs/monthly_bulletin_of_statistics_july_2019.pdf|title=Extraction of Principal Minerals|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Pakistan is manufacturing and selling weapons to over 40 countries, bringing in $20 million annually.The country's arms imports increased by 119 percent between the 2004\u20132008 and 2009\u201313, with China providing 54pc and the USA 27pc of Pakistan's imports.\n\n==== Textiles ====\n{{Main|Textile industry in Pakistan}}\nMost of the Textile Industry is established in Punjab. Before 1990, the situation was different; most of the industry was in Karachi. Textile industry in Pakistan is traditional and conservative, producing and exporting most of low cost raw articles e.g. Raw Cotton, Yarn, fabric etc. Share of finished goods and branded articles is nominal. Pakistan has a potential to quadruple its textile production and export, due to emerging Chinese markets and with its existing infrastructure. 10% of United States imports regarding clothing and other form of textiles is covered by Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe textile sector accounts for 70% of Pakistan's exports, but the working conditions of workers are deplorable. Small manufacturing workshops generally do not sign employment contracts, do not respect the minimum wage and sometimes employ children. Violations of labour law also occur among major subcontractors of international brands, where workers may be beaten, insulted by their superiors or paid below the minimum wage. Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a [[Karachi]] factory. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones. Elsewhere, \"workers involved in the creation of trade unions are victims of violence, intimidation, threats or dismissals\".<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2019/01/25/un-rapport-de-l-ong-human-rights-watch-denonce-les-conditions-de-travail-dans-le-textile-au-pakistan_5414575_3234.html</ref>\n\n==== Other ====\n{{as of|2010}}, Pakistan is one of the largest users of CNG ([[compressed natural gas]]) in the world.

Pakistan faces a significant challenge in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity.\nWhile the government claims credit for overseeing a turnaround in the economy through a comprehensive recovery, it has just failed to oversee a similar improvement in the quality of the network for electricity supply.\nMost cities in Pakistan receive substantial sunlight throughout the year, which would suggest good conditions for investment in solar energy. If the rich people in Pakistan are shifted to solar energy that they should be forced to purchase solar panels, the shortfall can be controlled. this will make the economy boost again as before 2007. According to an econometric analysis published in Quality & Quantity by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich and his colleague Muhammad Shahbaz, economic growth in Pakistan leads to electricity consumption but not vice versa.<ref>Shahbaz, Muhammad and Feridun, Mete (2012) Electricity consumption and economic growth empirical evidence from Pakistan.

Most barriers to the flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of equity participation is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing business has been becoming increasingly difficult over the past decade due to political instability, rising domestic insurgency and insecurity and vehement corruption.

However, in subsequent years exports have declined considerably. This declined started from financial year 2014-15 when an international commodity slump set in. This was compounded by structural supply side constraints including energy shortages, high input costs and an overvalued exchange rate. From financial year 2014 to 2016, exports declined by 12.4 percent. Exports growth trend over this period was similar to the world trade growth patterns. Pakistan's external sector continued facing stress during 2016\u201317. But still Pakistan's merchandise trade exports grew by 0.1 percent during the fiscal year 2016\u201317. The imports continued to grow at a much faster rate and grew by a large percentage of 18.0 during the FY 2017 as compared to the previous year.<ref name=\"sbp.gov.pk\">http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Aug/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\nWorld imports had been stagnant between 2011 and 2014 but registered significant drop since early 2015 because of weak commodity and product prices and weak global economic activity. Economic growth was lacklustre in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\ncountries which contributed to the slowdown in [[China]]. Furthermore, the ratio between real growth in world imports and world real GDP growth substantially declined. This decline in the import content of economic activity triggered a shift in consumption worldwide from traded towards non-traded goods, import substitution, a slowdown in the pace of [[Free trade|trade liberalization]], and gave currency to protectionist measures. A bulk of Pakistan's exports are directed to the OECD region and China. Historical data suggest strong correlation between Pakistani exports to imports in OECD and China. As per FY 2016 data, more than half of country's exports are shipped to these two destinations i.e. OECD and China. A decline in Pakistan overall exports,thus occurred in this backdrop.<ref name=\"financegov\">http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/08-Trade.pdf</ref>\n\nPakistan's imports are showing rising trend at a relatively faster rate due to the increased economic activity as part of [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), particularly in the Energy sector. The construction projects under CPEC require heavy machinery that has to be imported. It is also observed that the economy is currently being led both by investments as well as consumption, resulting in relatively higher levels of imports. During FY 2018 Pakistan's exports picked up and reached to US$24.8 billion showing a growth of 12.6 percent over previous year FY 2017. Imports on the other hand also increased by 16.2 percent and touched the highest figure of US$56.6 billion. As a result, the trade deficit widened to US$31.8 billion which was the highest since last ten years.

Encouragingly for the country, the period saw the completion of multiple merger and acquisition deals between local and foreign companies. Moreover, multiple foreign automakers announced their intention to enter the Pakistani market, and some also entered into joint ventures with local conglomerates. This indicates that Pakistan is clearly on foreign investors' radar, and provides a positive outlook for FDI inflows going forward. government's successful issuance of a US$1.0 billion Sukuk in the international capital market, at an extremely low rate of 5.5 percent.\nBesides, Pakistan continued to enjoy support from international financial institutions (IFIs) like the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]], and from bilateral partners like [[China]], in the post-EFF period: net official loan inflows of US$1.1 billion were recorded during the period. As a result, the country's FX reserve amounted to US$20.8 billion by 4 May 2017 sufficient to finance around four month of import payments.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n=== Economic aid ===\n{{Main|Foreign aid to Pakistan}}\nPakistan receives economic aid from several sources as loans and grants. The [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]] (WB), [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB), etc. provide long-term loans to Pakistan. Pakistan also receives bilateral aid from developed and oil-rich countries. [[Foreign aid to Pakistan|Foreign aid]] has been one of the main sources of money for the Pakistani Economy.

This decline in remittances is mainly due to the adverse economic conditions of Arabian and gulf countries after the fall in oil prices in 2016. However, the recent development activities in the Qatar FIFA World Cup, Dubai Expo, Saudi Arabia's implementation of its Vision 2030 and particularly the recent visit of the P.M to Kuwait should all be helpful in opening new avenues for employment in these countries .

As a result, the rupee devalued by 38.5% between 1982/83 many of the industries built by his predecessor suffered with a huge surge in import costs. After years of appreciation under [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] and despite huge increases in foreign aid the Rupee depreciated.\n\n=== Foreign exchange rate ===\nThe Pakistani rupee depreciated against the US dollar until around the start of the 21st century, when Pakistan's large current-account surplus pushed the value of the rupee up versus the dollar.

While per-capita agricultural output has grown since then, it has been outpaced by the growth of the non-agricultural sectors, and the share of agriculture has dropped to roughly one-fifth of Pakistan's economy. In recent years, the country has seen rapid growth in industries (such as apparel, textiles, and cement) and services (such as telecommunications, transportation, advertising, and finance).{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n== Major sectors ==\n{{See also|List of Pakistani companies}}\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Main|Agriculture in Pakistan}}\n[[File:Agriculture by Province.jpg|thumb|Agriculture by Province]]\n[[File:MangoTree.jpeg|thumb|Mango Orchard in [[Multan]], Pakistan]]\n\nThe most important crops are wheat, [[sugarcane]], cotton, and rice, which together account for more than 75% of the value of total crop output. Pakistan's largest food crop is wheat. In 2017, Pakistan produced 26,674,000 tonnes of wheat, almost equal to all of Africa (27.1 million tonnes) and more than all of South America (25.9 million tonnes), according to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database|FAOSTAT]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC|title=wheat production|website=fao.org|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> In the previous market year of 2018/19 Pakistan exported a record 4.5 million tonnes of rice  as compared to around 4 MMT during the corresponding period last year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Grain%20and%20Feed%20Update_Islamabad_Pakistan_12-30-2019|title=Pakistan Grain and Feed Update|last=|first=|date=|website=gain.fas.usda.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref> Pakistan has also cut the use of dangerous pesticides dramatically.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/field/2007/1000497/index.html|title=Pakistan cuts pesticide use dramatically|website=fao.org}}</ref>\n\nPakistan is a net food exporter, except in occasional years when its harvest is adversely affected by droughts. Pakistan exports rice, cotton, fish, fruits (especially Oranges and Mangoes), and vegetables and imports vegetable oil, wheat, pulses and consumer foods. The country is Asia's largest [[camel]] market, second-largest [[apricot]] and [[ghee]] market and third-largest cotton, onion and milk market. The economic importance of agriculture has declined since independence, when its share of GDP was around 53%. Following the poor harvest of 1993, the government introduced agriculture assistance policies, including increased support prices for many agricultural commodities and expanded availability of agricultural credit. From 1993 to 1997, real growth in the agricultural sector averaged 5.7% but has since declined to about 4%. Agricultural reforms, including increased wheat and oil seed production, play a central role in the government's economic reform package.\n\nMajority of the population, directly or indirectly, dependent on this sector. It contributes about 18.5% percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and accounts for 37.4% of employed labor force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.<ref name=\":3\" /> During 2017\u201318, agriculture sector recorded a remarkable growth of 3.70 percent and surpassed its targeted growth of 3.5 percent and last year's growth of 2.18 percent.

About 25% of Pakistan's total land area is under cultivation and is watered by one of the largest irrigation systems in the world. Pakistan irrigates three times more acres than Russia. Pakistan agriculture also benefits from year round warmth. Agriculture accounts for about 18.9% of GDP and employs about 42.3% of the labour force. [[Zarai Taraqiati Bank Limited]] is the largest financial institution geared towards the development of agriculture sector through provision of financial services and technical expertise.\n\n==== Mining ====\n{{Main|Mining in Pakistan}}\nPakistan is endowed with significant mineral resources and is emerging as a very promising area for prospecting/exploration for mineral deposits. Based on available information, the country's more than 6,00,000&nbsp;km\u00b2 of outcrops area demonstrates varied geological potential for metallic and non-metallic mineral deposits. In the wake of 18th amendment to the constitution all the provinces are free to exploit and explore the mineral resources which are in their jurisdiction.\nMining and quarrying contributes 13.19% in industrial sector and its share in GDP is 2.8%. Pakistan mining and quarrying sector grew by 3.04% in 2018 against the negative growth of -0.38% last year.\n\nIn the recent past, exploration by government agencies as well as by multinational mining companies presents ample evidence of the occurrences of sizeable minerals deposits. Recent discoveries of a thick oxidised zone underlain by sulphide zones in the shield area of the Punjab province, covered by thick alluvial cover have opened new vistas for metallic minerals exploration. Pakistan has a large base for industrial minerals. The discovery of coal deposits having over 175 billion tonnes of reserves at Thar in the Sindh province has given an impetus to develop it as an alternative source of energy. There is vast potential for precious and dimension stones.\n\nExtraction of principal minerals in the last 5 fiscal years is given in the table below :-<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/sites/default/files//mbs/monthly_bulletin_of_statistics_july_2019.pdf|title=Extraction of Principal Minerals|last=|first=|date=|website=PBS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 February 2020}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Pakistan is manufacturing and selling weapons to over 40 countries, bringing in $20 million annually.The country's arms imports increased by 119 percent between the 2004\u20132008 and 2009\u201313, with China providing 54pc and the USA 27pc of Pakistan's imports.\n\n==== Textiles ====\n{{Main|Textile industry in Pakistan}}\nMost of the Textile Industry is established in Punjab. Before 1990, the situation was different; most of the industry was in Karachi. Textile industry in Pakistan is traditional and conservative, producing and exporting most of low cost raw articles e.g. Raw Cotton, Yarn, fabric etc. Share of finished goods and branded articles is nominal. Pakistan has a potential to quadruple its textile production and export, due to emerging Chinese markets and with its existing infrastructure. 10% of United States imports regarding clothing and other form of textiles is covered by Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe textile sector accounts for 70% of Pakistan's exports, but the working conditions of workers are deplorable. Small manufacturing workshops generally do not sign employment contracts, do not respect the minimum wage and sometimes employ children. Violations of labour law also occur among major subcontractors of international brands, where workers may be beaten, insulted by their superiors or paid below the minimum wage. Factories do not comply with safety standards, leading to accidents: in 2012, 255 workers died in a fire at a [[Karachi]] factory. With 547 labour inspectors in Pakistan supervising the country's 300,000 factories, the textile industry is out of control. Nor are workers protected by trade unions, which are prohibited in industrial export zones. Elsewhere, \"workers involved in the creation of trade unions are victims of violence, intimidation, threats or dismissals\".<ref>https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2019/01/25/un-rapport-de-l-ong-human-rights-watch-denonce-les-conditions-de-travail-dans-le-textile-au-pakistan_5414575_3234.html</ref>\n\n==== Other ====\n{{as of|2010}}, Pakistan is one of the largest users of CNG ([[compressed natural gas]]) in the world.

The report noted that the present housing stock is also rapidly aging and an estimate suggests that more than 50% of stock is over 50 years old. It is also estimated that 50% of the urban population now lives in slums and squatter settlements. The report said that meeting the backlog in housing, besides replacement of out-lived housing units, is beyond the financial resources of the government.

Pakistan faces a significant challenge in revamping its network responsible for the supply of electricity.\nWhile the government claims credit for overseeing a turnaround in the economy through a comprehensive recovery, it has just failed to oversee a similar improvement in the quality of the network for electricity supply.\nMost cities in Pakistan receive substantial sunlight throughout the year, which would suggest good conditions for investment in solar energy. If the rich people in Pakistan are shifted to solar energy that they should be forced to purchase solar panels, the shortfall can be controlled. this will make the economy boost again as before 2007. According to an econometric analysis published in Quality & Quantity by Mete Feridun of University of Greenwich and his colleague Muhammad Shahbaz, economic growth in Pakistan leads to electricity consumption but not vice versa.<ref>Shahbaz, Muhammad and Feridun, Mete (2012) Electricity consumption and economic growth empirical evidence from Pakistan.

Most barriers to the flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of equity participation is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing business has been becoming increasingly difficult over the past decade due to political instability, rising domestic insurgency and insecurity and vehement corruption.

However, in subsequent years exports have declined considerably. This declined started from financial year 2014-15 when an international commodity slump set in. This was compounded by structural supply side constraints including energy shortages, high input costs and an overvalued exchange rate. From financial year 2014 to 2016, exports declined by 12.4 percent. Exports growth trend over this period was similar to the world trade growth patterns. Pakistan's external sector continued facing stress during 2016\u201317. But still Pakistan's merchandise trade exports grew by 0.1 percent during the fiscal year 2016\u201317. The imports continued to grow at a much faster rate and grew by a large percentage of 18.0 during the FY 2017 as compared to the previous year.<ref name=\"sbp.gov.pk\">http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Aug/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\nWorld imports had been stagnant between 2011 and 2014 but registered significant drop since early 2015 because of weak commodity and product prices and weak global economic activity. Economic growth was lacklustre in the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]]\ncountries which contributed to the slowdown in [[China]]. Furthermore, the ratio between real growth in world imports and world real GDP growth substantially declined. This decline in the import content of economic activity triggered a shift in consumption worldwide from traded towards non-traded goods, import substitution, a slowdown in the pace of [[Free trade|trade liberalization]], and gave currency to protectionist measures. A bulk of Pakistan's exports are directed to the OECD region and China. Historical data suggest strong correlation between Pakistani exports to imports in OECD and China. As per FY 2016 data, more than half of country's exports are shipped to these two destinations i.e. OECD and China. A decline in Pakistan overall exports,thus occurred in this backdrop.<ref name=\"financegov\">http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/08-Trade.pdf</ref>\n\nPakistan's imports are showing rising trend at a relatively faster rate due to the increased economic activity as part of [[China Pakistan Economic Corridor]] (CPEC), particularly in the Energy sector. The construction projects under CPEC require heavy machinery that has to be imported. It is also observed that the economy is currently being led both by investments as well as consumption, resulting in relatively higher levels of imports. During FY 2018 Pakistan's exports picked up and reached to US$24.8 billion showing a growth of 12.6 percent over previous year FY 2017. Imports on the other hand also increased by 16.2 percent and touched the highest figure of US$56.6 billion. As a result, the trade deficit widened to US$31.8 billion which was the highest since last ten years.

While [[remittances]] and Coalition Support Fund inflows both declined slightly over the same period last year, however, the impact was offset by an improvement in the income account, mainly due to lower profit repatriations by oil and gas firms.<ref name=\"financegov\" />\n\n'''Current account'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Current account deficit]] increased to US$12.4 billion in FY 2017, against US$3.2 billion in FY 2016.<ref>http://www.sbp.org.pk/reports/stat_reviews/Bulletin/2017/Nov/ExternalSector.pdf</ref>\n\nHowever, the impact of high current deficit on [[foreign exchange reserves]] was not severe, as financial inflows were available to the country to partially offset the gap; these inflows helped ensure stability in the exchange rate. Net [[Foreign direct investment|FDI]] grew by 12.4 percent and reached US$1.6 billion in the nine-months period, whereas net FPI saw an inflow of US$631 million, against an outflow of US$393 million last year. Encouragingly for the country, the period saw the completion of multiple merger and acquisition deals between local and foreign companies. Moreover, multiple foreign automakers announced their intention to enter the Pakistani market, and some also entered into joint ventures with local conglomerates. This indicates that Pakistan is clearly on foreign investors' radar, and provides a positive outlook for FDI inflows going forward. government's successful issuance of a US$1.0 billion Sukuk in the international capital market, at an extremely low rate of 5.5 percent.\nBesides, Pakistan continued to enjoy support from international financial institutions (IFIs) like the [[World Bank]] and [[Asian Development Bank]], and from bilateral partners like [[China]], in the post-EFF period: net official loan inflows of US$1.1 billion were recorded during the period.

The Pakistanis settled in Western Europe and North America are important sources of remittances to Pakistan.

This decline in remittances is mainly due to the adverse economic conditions of Arabian and gulf countries after the fall in oil prices in 2016. However, the recent development activities in the Qatar FIFA World Cup, Dubai Expo, Saudi Arabia's implementation of its Vision 2030 and particularly the recent visit of the P.M to Kuwait should all be helpful in opening new avenues for employment in these countries . Going forward one can expect improvements in the coming years.\n\nRemittances sent home by overseas Pakistanis in the fiscal year 2016/17 are as under:<ref name=\"sbp.gov.pk\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Tobacco products such as cigars and cigarettes were the only manufactured products among Cuba's leading exports, and even these were produced by a preindustrial process.

Sugar had done well from 1985\u201390 and crashed precipitously in 1990\u201391 and did not recover for five years. Cuba had been insulated from world sugar prices by Soviet price guarantees.

To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]] and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.\n\nGovernment efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, \"The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn\u2019t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible.

Havana devotes significant resources to building tourist facilities and renovating historic structures. Cuban officials estimate roughly 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba in 1999 yielding about $1.9 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in gross revenues. In 2000, 1,773,986 foreign visitors arrived in Cuba.

This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods \u2013 and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]] \u2013 could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened the gap between Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term socialist policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |title=Lessons From Cuba |date=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628061024/http://www.traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |archivedate=28 June 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2017}} Travel Outward</ref>\n\n====Retail====\nCuba has a small retail sector.

Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. Cuba's primary import partner is Venezuela. The second largest trade partner is Canada, with a 22% share of the Cuban export market.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cuba/canada-cuba-trade.html FAQs on Canada-Cuba trade] CBC</ref>\n\nCuba began courting foreign investment in the Special Period. Foreign investors must form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that 332 [[joint venture]]s had begun. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies. Investors are constrained by the [[Helms\u2013Burton Act|U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act]] that provides sanctions for those who traffic in property expropriated from U.S. citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/cuba/35715.htm|title=Cuba (11/03)|newspaper=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nCuba's average tariff rate is 10 percent.

One is sometimes called the \"national currency\" (or CUP) the other is the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]] (or CUC, often called \"dollar\" in the spoken language). There are currently 25 CUP per CUC.\n\nIn 1994 the possession and use of US dollars was legalised, and by 2004 the US dollar was in widespread use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] \u2013 estimated at $500\u2013800 million annually \u2013 the government set up state-run \"dollar stores\" throughout Cuba that sold \"luxury\" food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using national pesos. As such, the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.\n\nHowever, in response to stricter [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]] and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove US dollars from circulation. In its place, the convertible peso was created, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to the US dollar 1:1. A 10% surcharge is levied for cash conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, which does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. An increasing number of tourist zones accept Euros.\n\n===Private businesses===\n\nOwners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') originally could seat no more than 12 people<ref name=\"O'Rourke2007\">{{cite book|author=P.

Its overall score was 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America\nregion and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the \u201crepressed\u201d category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.\n\nDespite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. [[The Heritage Foundation]] states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion.

Sugar had done well from 1985\u201390 and crashed precipitously in 1990\u201391 and did not recover for five years. Cuba had been insulated from world sugar prices by Soviet price guarantees. However, the Cuban economy began to boost again following a rapid improvement in trade and diplomatic relations between Cuba and Venezuela following the election of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela in 1998, who became Cuba's most important trading partner and diplomatic ally.\n\nThis era was referred to as the \"Special Period in Peacetime\" later shortened to \"[[Special Period]]\". A ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'' paper claimed that \"The famine in Cuba during the Special Period was caused by political and economic factors similar to the ones that caused a [[famine in North Korea]] in the mid-1990s, on the grounds that both countries were run by authoritarian regimes that denied ordinary people the food to which they were entitled to when the public food distribution collapsed and priority was given to the elite classes and the military.\"<ref name=\"cmaj\">{{cite journal|title=Health Consequences of Cuba's Special Period|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=29 July 2008|volume = 179|issue = 3|pages = 257|doi = 10.1503/cmaj.1080068|pmid = 18663207|pmc = 2474886}}</ref> Other reports painted an equally dismal picture, describing Cubans having to resort to eating anything they could find, from Havana Zoo animals to domestic cats.<ref name=\"parrotdiplomacy\">{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11792274|title=Parrot diplomacy|work=The Economist|date=24 July 2008}}</ref> But although the collapse of centrally planned economies in the Soviet Union and other countries of the Eastern bloc subjected Cuba to severe economic difficulties, which led to a drop in calories per day from 3052 in 1989 to 2600 in 2006, mortality rates were not strongly affected thanks to the priority given on maintaining a [[social safety net]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/08/cubas_organic_r.php|title=Cuba's Organic Revolution|work=TreeHugger|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe government undertook several  [[Cuban economic reforms|reforms]] to stem excess [[liquidity]], increase labor incentives and alleviate serious shortages of food, [[consumer good]]s and services. To alleviate the economic crisis, the government introduced a few [[market economy|market]]-oriented reforms including opening to [[tourism]], allowing [[Foreign Direct Investment|foreign investment]], legalizing the [[U.S. dollar]] and authorizing self-employment for some 150 occupations. (This policy was later partially reversed, so that while the U.S. dollar is no longer accepted in businesses, it remains legal for Cubans to hold the currency.) These measures resulted in modest [[economic growth]]. The [[free market|liberalized]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] markets introduced in October 1994, at which state and private farmers sell above-quota production at [[free market]] prices, broadened legal consumption alternatives and reduced [[black market]] prices.\n\nGovernment efforts to lower subsidies to unprofitable enterprises and to shrink the money supply caused the semi-official [[exchange rate]] for the [[Cuban peso]] to move from a peak of 120 to the dollar in the summer of 1994 to 21 to the dollar by year-end 1999. The drop in GDP apparently halted in 1994, when Cuba reported 0.7% growth, followed by increases of 2.5% in 1995 and 7.8% in 1996. Growth slowed again in 1997 and 1998 to 2.5% and 1.2% respectively. One of the key reasons given was the failure to notice that sugar production had become uneconomic. Reflecting on the Special period Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]] later admitted that many mistakes had been made, \"The country had many economists and it is not my intention to criticize them, but I would like to ask why we hadn\u2019t discovered earlier that maintaining our levels of sugar production would be impossible. The Soviet Union had collapsed, oil was costing $40 a barrel, sugar prices were at basement levels, so why did we not rationalize the industry?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=270631&area=/insight/insight__international%252|title=Wayback Machine|date=13 June 2015|accessdate=23 August 2018}}{{dead link|date=January 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Living conditions]] in 1999 remained well below the 1989 level.\n\n===Recovery===\n[[File:GDP-Caribbean.png|thumb|350px|right|Historical evolution of [[GDP per capita]] of Cuba and some other Caribbean countries, based on [http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/Historical_Statistics/horizontal-file_02-2010.xls Maddison] and current [http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/08informacion/panorama2010/Panorama2010.pdf Cuban statistics] ]]\n\nDue to the continued growth of tourism, growth began in 1999 with a 6.2% increase in GDP.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NGjxCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83&dq=Due+to+the+continued+growth+of+tourism,+growth+began+in+1999+with+a+6.2%25+increase+in+GDP#v=onepage|title=Cuba Investment, Trade Laws and Regulations Handbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Basic Laws|last=Inc|first=IBP|date=2015-01-26|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781433075698|language=en}}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} Growth then picked up, with a growth in GDP of 11.8% in 2005 according to government figures.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = P\u00e9rez-L\u00f3pez | first1 = Jorge F | year = 2006 | title = The Cuban Economy in 2005\u20132006: The End of the Special Period?. | url = | journal = Cuba in Transition | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 1\u201313 }}</ref> In 2007 the Cuban economy grew by 7.5%, higher than the Latin American average.

Havana devotes significant resources to building tourist facilities and renovating historic structures. Cuban officials estimate roughly 1.6 million tourists visited Cuba in 1999 yielding about $1.9 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] in gross revenues. In 2000, 1,773,986 foreign visitors arrived in Cuba. Revenue from tourism reached US$1.7 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Cuba-TOURISM-TRAVEL-AND-RECREATION.html|title=Tourism, travel, and recreation \u2013 Cuba|website=Mationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref> By 2012, some 3 million visitors brought nearly \u00a32 billion yearly.<ref>{{youtube|id=3LoFX3uhctI |title=BBC 2012 SimonReeve}}</ref>\n\nThe growth of tourism has had social and economic repercussions.

This situation was exacerbated by the influx of dollars during the 1990s, potentially creating a dual economy based on the dollar (the currency of tourists) on the one hand and the peso on the other. Scarce imported goods \u2013 and even some of local manufacture, such as [[rum]] and [[coffee]] \u2013 could be had at dollar-only stores, but were hard to find or unavailable at peso prices. As a result, Cubans who earned only in the peso economy, outside the tourist sector, were at a disadvantage. Those with dollar incomes based upon the service industry began to live more comfortably. This widened the gap between Cubans' material standards of living, in conflict with the Cuban Government's long term socialist policies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |title=Lessons From Cuba |date=4 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030628061024/http://www.traveloutward.com/articles/caribbean/6-03_cuba.shtml |archivedate=28 June 2003 |accessdate=21 January 2017}} Travel Outward</ref>\n\n====Retail====\nCuba has a small retail sector. A few large shopping centers operated in Havana  as of September 2012 but charged US prices. Pre-Revolutionary commercial districts were largely shut down. The majority of stores are small dollar stores, bodegas, agro-mercados (farmers' markets) and street stands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Americas/Cuba.html|title=Cuba|website=Nationsencyclopedia.com|accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Finance===\nThe financial sector remains heavily regulated and access to credit for entrepreneurial activity is seriously impeded by the shallowness of the financial market.\n\n===Foreign investment and trade===\nThe Netherlands receives the largest share of Cuban exports (24%), 70 to 80% of which go through Indiana Finance BV, a company owned by the [[Van 't Wout]] family, who have close personal ties with Fidel Castro. Currently, this trend can be seen in other colonial Caribbean communities who have direct political ties with the global economy. Cuba's primary import partner is Venezuela. The second largest trade partner is Canada, with a 22% share of the Cuban export market.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/cuba/canada-cuba-trade.html FAQs on Canada-Cuba trade] CBC</ref>\n\nCuba began courting foreign investment in the Special Period. Foreign investors must form joint ventures with the Cuban government. The sole exception to this rule are Venezuelans, who are allowed to hold 100% ownership in businesses due to an agreement between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuban officials said in early 1998 that 332 [[joint venture]]s had begun. Many of these are loans or contracts for management, supplies, or services normally not considered equity investment in Western economies. Investors are constrained by the [[Helms\u2013Burton Act|U.S.-Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act]] that provides sanctions for those who traffic in property expropriated from U.S. citizens.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://2009-2017.state.gov/outofdate/bgn/cuba/35715.htm|title=Cuba (11/03)|newspaper=U.S. Department of State|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>\n\nCuba's average tariff rate is 10 percent. As of 2014, the country's planned economy deterred foreign trade and investment.

One is sometimes called the \"national currency\" (or CUP) the other is the [[Cuban convertible peso|convertible peso]] (or CUC, often called \"dollar\" in the spoken language). There are currently 25 CUP per CUC.\n\nIn 1994 the possession and use of US dollars was legalised, and by 2004 the US dollar was in widespread use in the country. To capture the hard currency flowing into the island through tourism and [[remittances]] \u2013 estimated at $500\u2013800 million annually \u2013 the government set up state-run \"dollar stores\" throughout Cuba that sold \"luxury\" food, household and clothing items, compared with basic necessities, which could be bought using national pesos. As such, the standard of living diverged between those who had access to dollars and those without. Jobs that could earn dollar salaries or tips from foreign businesses and tourists became highly desirable. It was common to meet doctors, engineers, scientists and other professionals working in restaurants or as taxicab drivers.\n\nHowever, in response to stricter [[United States embargo against Cuba|economic sanctions by the US]] and because the authorities were pleased with Cuba's economic recovery, the Cuban government decided in October 2004 to remove US dollars from circulation. In its place, the convertible peso was created, which although not internationally traded, has a value pegged to the US dollar 1:1. A 10% surcharge is levied for cash conversions from US dollars to the convertible peso, which does not apply to other currencies, so it acts as an encouragement for tourists to bring currencies such as [[Euro]]s, [[pound sterling|pounds sterling]] or [[Canadian dollar]]s into Cuba. An increasing number of tourist zones accept Euros.\n\n===Private businesses===\n\nOwners of small private restaurants (''[[paladar]]es'') originally could seat no more than 12 people<ref name=\"O'Rourke2007\">{{cite book|author=P.

Set monthly fees must be paid regardless of income earned and frequent inspections yield stiff fines when any of the many self-employment regulations are violated.\n\nAs of 2012, more than 150,000 farmers had signed up to lease land from the government for bonus crops. Before, home-owners were only allowed to swap;  once buying and selling were allowed, prices rose.<ref name=BBC2012SimonReeve/>\n\nIn cities, \"[[urban agriculture]]\" farms small parcels. Growing [[organop\u00f3nicos]] (organic gardens) in the private sector has been attractive to city-dwelling small producers who sell their products where they produce them, avoiding taxes and enjoying a measure of government help from the Ministry of Agriculture (MINAGRI) in the form of seed houses and advisers.\n\n==Wages, Development, and Pensions==\nTypical wages range from 400 non-convertible Cuban pesos a month, for a factory worker, to 700 per month for a doctor, or a range of around 17\u201330 US dollars per month.

Its overall score was 0.2 point higher than last year, with deteriorations in trade freedom, fiscal freedom, monetary freedom and freedom from corruption counterbalanced by an improvement in business freedom. Cuba ranked least free of 29 countries in the South and Central America\nregion and its overall score was significantly lower than the regional average. Over the 20-year history of the Index, Cuba's economic freedom remained stagnant near the bottom of the \u201crepressed\u201d category. Its overall score improvement was less than 1 point over the past two decades, with score gains in fiscal freedom and freedom from corruption offset by double-digit declines in business freedom and investment freedom.\n\nDespite some progress in restructuring the state sector since 2010, the private sector remained constrained by heavy regulations and tight state controls. [[The Heritage Foundation]] states that open-market policies were not in place to spur growth in trade and investment and the lack of competition continued to stifle dynamic economic expansion. A watered-down reform package endorsed by the Party trimmed the number of state workers and expanded the list of approved professions, but many details of the reform remained obscure.<ref name=\"2014 Index of Economic Freedom\">{{cite web|title=Cuba 2014 |work= [[Index of Economic Freedom]]|url=http://www.heritage.org/index/country/cuba|publisher=[[The Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Taxes and revenues ==\nAs of 2009, Cuba had $47.08 billion in revenues and $50.34 billion in expenditures with 34.6% of GDP in public debt, an account balance of $513 million and $4.647 billion in reserves of foreign exchange and gold.<ref name=\"The World Factbook\" /> Government spending is around 67 percent of GDP and public debt is around 35 percent of the domestic economy.
