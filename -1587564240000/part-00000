Unusually, the station building is on a bridge above the platforms, in a setup similar to [[Leixlip Louisa Bridge railway station]]. The station has a ticket office, automatic ticket machines and a small coffee shop. The ticket office is open between 05:45-00:06 AM, Monday to Sunday.\n\n=== DART ===\nFrom the inception of the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART)]] service in 1984, all DART services stop at D\u00fan Laoghaire.\n\n=== Other services ===\nD\u00fan Laoghaire is on the intercity [[Dublin\u2013Rosslare railway line|Dublin-Rosslare]] and commuter [[Dundalk]]-[[Dublin]]-[[Arklow]]-[[Gorey]] routes, and all trains on these routes stop here. They often run non-stop between [[D\u00fan Laoghaire|Dun Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Dublin Pearse]], and freight and maintenance trains pass through D\u00fan Laoghaire without stopping.\n\n==History==\nThe original station for [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], then known as Kingstown, was situated some {{Convert|0.5|mi|km}} closer to Dublin at the West Pier near to or at the present-day [[Salthill and Monkstown railway station]]. That station was the southern terminus of the first railway in Ireland, the [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]] (D&KR), which opened in 1834.{{sfnp|Kullmann|2018|pp=26\u201327}}<ref> https://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf</ref>  For the first public timetable the station was named ''Kingstown'' but in contract documents it was at least sometimes referred to as ''Dunleary''.{{Sfnp|Grierson|1887|pp=108, 116, 120}}\n\nBefore the D&KR had even begun to be built it became apparent that the [[Packet trade|Packet boats]] were to use either the East Pier or the new wharf being built.  Therefore, in 1833 the D&KR raised a parliamentary bill so its railway could be extended beyond the East Pier with a new station at Kingstown then on to Dalkey.{{efn|The D&KR had some eventual ambitions of reaching Bray}}. Mobilised opposition from a rival canal group and local opposition caused the Bill to fail in June 1833.{{sfnp|Murray|1981|p=32\u201437}}\n\nThe D&KR regrouped and with lobbying presented a less ambitious Bill to the site of the current station only in 1834. [[Gresham Hotel#A-ThomasGresham|Thomas M. Gresham]], a D&KR shareholder and main spokesperson for the opposition, being awarded a silver plate in August 1833 for the same at a personal cost of \u00a31,200, was persuaded not to oppose the 1834 bill.

Ireland|Ireland]].\n\n==Services==\nD\u00fan Laoghaire has two through platforms and one terminal platform. Unusually, the station building is on a bridge above the platforms, in a setup similar to [[Leixlip Louisa Bridge railway station]]. The station has a ticket office, automatic ticket machines and a small coffee shop. The ticket office is open between 05:45-00:06 AM, Monday to Sunday.\n\n=== DART ===\nFrom the inception of the [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit|Dublin Area Rapid Transit (DART)]] service in 1984, all DART services stop at D\u00fan Laoghaire.\n\n=== Other services ===\nD\u00fan Laoghaire is on the intercity [[Dublin\u2013Rosslare railway line|Dublin-Rosslare]] and commuter [[Dundalk]]-[[Dublin]]-[[Arklow]]-[[Gorey]] routes, and all trains on these routes stop here. They often run non-stop between [[D\u00fan Laoghaire|Dun Laoghaire]] and [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Dublin Pearse]], and freight and maintenance trains pass through D\u00fan Laoghaire without stopping.\n\n==History==\nThe original station for [[D\u00fan Laoghaire]], then known as Kingstown, was situated some {{Convert|0.5|mi|km}} closer to Dublin at the West Pier near to or at the present-day [[Salthill and Monkstown railway station]]. That station was the southern terminus of the first railway in Ireland, the [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]] (D&KR), which opened in 1834.{{sfnp|Kullmann|2018|pp=26\u201327}}<ref> https://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf</ref>  For the first public timetable the station was named ''Kingstown'' but in contract documents it was at least sometimes referred to as ''Dunleary''.{{Sfnp|Grierson|1887|pp=108, 116, 120}}\n\nBefore the D&KR had even begun to be built it became apparent that the [[Packet trade|Packet boats]] were to use either the East Pier or the new wharf being built.  Therefore, in 1833 the D&KR raised a parliamentary bill so its railway could be extended beyond the East Pier with a new station at Kingstown then on to Dalkey.{{efn|The D&KR had some eventual ambitions of reaching Bray}}. Mobilised opposition from a rival canal group and local opposition caused the Bill to fail in June 1833.{{sfnp|Murray|1981|p=32\u201437}}\n\nThe D&KR regrouped and with lobbying presented a less ambitious Bill to the site of the current station only in 1834. [[Gresham Hotel#A-ThomasGresham|Thomas M. Gresham]], a D&KR shareholder and main spokesperson for the opposition, being awarded a silver plate in August 1833 for the same at a personal cost of \u00a31,200, was persuaded not to oppose the 1834 bill. Other obstacles including an agreement to cross the old part of Dunleary harbour and demolition of a Martello fortification needed an agreement with the Admiralty and Ordnance. The Bill was passed in May 1834 but logistics meant Dargan began work in May 1836 finishing about a year later.

Further improvements were carried out in connection with the introduction of DART electric trains in 1984.\n\nA replacement station entrance, with a combined ticket office and automated barriers, was built above the railway lines at street level in 1998. It was constructed with a steel framework supporting a taut sail-like canopy and with glazed panels as side features.\n\n===Naming===\nAlso called Kingstown Harbour the station was renamed '''Kingstown''' in 1861, and renamed '''D\u00fan Laoghaire''' in 1921.{{cn|date=September 2019}} It was given the additional name \"Mallin\" on 10 April 1966, 50 years after the [[Easter Rising]], when [[C\u00f3ras Iompair \u00c9ireann]] renamed 15 major stations after [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] leaders. It is named in honour of [[Michael Mallin]], a leader in the 1916 Easter Rising. although it is usually referred to simply as D\u00fan Laoghaire.\n\n== Transport services ==\nDirectly outside the station are [[bus]] stops for [[Dublin Bus]], [[Go-Ahead Ireland]] and other private bus operator routes:\n\n[[Dublin Bus]] Routes:\n\n* 46a - [[Phoenix Park]] to D\u00fan Laoghaire Station, via [[Dublin]] city centre\n* [[Dublin Bus]] 7N Nitelink from [[Dublin]] city centre to [[Shankill, Dublin|Shankill]], via D\u00fan Laoghaire Station (Fri & Sat only)\n\n[[Go-Ahead Ireland]] routes:\n\n* 45a / 45b - Dun Laoghaire Station to [[Kilmacanogue]], via [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]]\n* 59 - D\u00fan Laoghaire Station to [[Killiney]], via [[Dalkey]]\n* 63 -  D\u00fan Laoghaire Station to [[Kilternan]], via [[Foxrock]]\n* 75 / 75a - D\u00fan Laoghaire Station to [[Tallaght]], via [[Stillorgan]]\n* 111 - [[Dalkey]] to [[Cherrywood, Dublin|Bride's Glen]], via D\u00fan Laoghaire Station.

And while researching this area the teachers, professionals, and researchers can be grouped according to the research requirements. Focus groups in library science field research help study user's behavior and the impact of services on the library use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social sciences===\nIn the [[social sciences]] and [[urban planning]], focus groups allow interviewers to study people in a more natural conversation pattern than typically occurs in a one-to-one interview. In combination with [[participant observation]], they can be used for learning about groups and their patterns of interaction. An advantage is their fairly low cost compared to [[Opinion poll|surveys]], as one can get results relatively quickly and increase the sample size of a report by talking with several people at once.<ref>Marshall, Catherine, and Gretchen B. Rossman. 1999. ''Designing Qualitative Research''. 3rd Ed. London: Sage Publications, p. 115</ref> Another advantage is that they can be used as an occasion for participants to learn from one another as they exchange and build on one another's views so that the participants can experience the research as an enriching encounter. This counteracts the extractive nature of research which seeks to \"mine\" participants for data (with no benefit for them) as criticized by various authors, and in particular Indigenous-oriented authors (and others sharing similar sentiments), as explained, for example, by Romm (2015): http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/2087.\n\n===Marketing===\nIn the world of [[marketing]], focus groups are seen as an important tool for acquiring feedback regarding new products, as well as various other topics. In marketing, focus groups are usually used in the early stages of product or concept development, when organizations are trying to create an overall direction for marketing initiative. In particular, focus groups allow companies wishing to develop, package, name, or test market a new product, to discuss, view, and/or test the new product before it is made available to the public. This can provide valuable information about the potential market acceptance of the product.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nA focus group is an interview, conducted by a trained moderator among a small group of respondents. The interview is conducted informally and naturally where respondents are free to give views from any aspect. Focus groups are similar to, but should not be confused with in-depth interviews. The moderator uses a discussion guide that has been prepared in advance of the focus group to guide the discussion.  Generally, the discussion goes from overall impressions of a brand or product category and becomes more specific as the discussion progresses.\n\nParticipants are recruited on the basis of similar demographics, psychographics, buying attitudes, or behaviors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greenbaum |first=Thomas|title=Moderating Focus Groups|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-2044-7}}</ref>\n\nRepresentatives of the stakeholder (often a design team in the case of testing acceptance on a new product) are not involved in the focus group, not to bias the exercise. However, they may attend the focus group, either through video cameras or by watching through a one-way mirror.\n\nTraditional focus groups can provide accurate information, and are less expensive than other forms of traditional [[marketing research]]. There can be significant costs, however: if a product is to be marketed on a nationwide basis, it would be critical to gather respondents from various locales throughout the country since attitudes about a new product may vary due to geographical considerations. This would require considerable expenditure on travel and lodging expenses. Additionally, the site of a traditional focus group may or may not be in a locale convenient to a specific client, so client representatives may have to incur travel and lodging expenses as well.\n\nToday, using [[audience response]] keypads to collect questionnaire answers is the new industry trend.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Usability engineering===\n* In [[usability engineering]], a focus group is a survey method to collect the feedback of users on software or a website. This marketing method can be applied to computer products to better understand the motivations of users and their perception of the product. Unlike other methods of [[ergonomics]], the focus group implies several participants: users or future users of the application. The focus group can only collect subjective data, not objective data on the use of the application as the [[usability test]] for example.\n\n==Types==\nVariants of focus groups include:\n* '''Two-way focus group''' - one focus group watches another focus group and discusses the observed interactions and conclusion\n* '''Dual moderator focus group''' - one moderator ensures the session progresses smoothly, while another ensures that all the topics are covered\n* '''Dueling moderator focus group''' (fencing-moderator) - two moderators deliberately take opposite sides on the issue under discussion\n* '''Respondent moderator focus group''' - one and only one of the respondents is asked to act as the moderator temporarily\n* '''Client participant focus groups''' - one or more client representatives participate in the discussion, either covertly or overtly\n* '''Mini focus groups''' - groups are composed of four or five members rather than 6 to 12\n* '''Teleconference focus groups ''' - telephone network is used\n* '''Creativity groups'''\n* '''Band obsessive group'''\n* '''[[Online focus group]]s''' - computers connected via the internet are used\n* '''Phone/ web focus groups ''' - live group conducted over the phone and online with 6 to 8 participants\n\n== Online focus groups ==\nFocus groups typically are conducted face-to-face, but the emergence of technology has enabled qualitative research to reach online approaches.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Tom|last2=McKee|first2=Kim|last3=McCoughlin|first3=Pauline|date=2015-04-23|title=Online focus groups and qualitative research in the social sciences: their merits and limitations in a study of housing and youth|journal=People, Place and Policy Onlin|volume=9|issue=1|pages=17\u201328|doi=10.3351/ppp.0009.0001.0002|doi-access=free}}</ref>  There are two types of online methods; synchronous and asynchronous.

This is also known as the group effect where group members engage in \"a kind of \u2018chaining\u2019 or \u2018cascading\u2019 effect; talk links to, or tumbles out of, the topics and expressions preceding it\" (Lindlof & Taylor, 2002, p.&nbsp;182)<ref>Lindlof, T. R., & Taylor, B. C. (2002). ''Qualitative Communication Research Methods, 2nd Edition''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref>\n* Group members discover a common language to describe similar experiences. This enables the capture of a form of \"native language\" or \"vernacular speech\" to understand the situation\n* Focus groups also provide an opportunity for disclosure among similar others in a setting where participants are validated. For example, in the context of [[workplace bullying]], targeted employees often find themselves in situations where they experience a lack of voice and feelings of isolation. Use of focus groups to study workplace bullying, therefore, serves as both an efficacious and ethical venue for collecting data (see, e.g., Tracy, Lutgen-Sandvik, & Alberts, 2006)<ref>Tracy, S. J., Lutgen-Sandvik, P., & Alberts, J. K. (2006). Nightmares, demons, and slaves: Exploring the painful metaphors of workplace bullying. ''Management Communication Quarterly, 20'', 148-185.</ref>\n\n==Problems and criticism==\nA fundamental difficulty with focus groups (and other forms of [[qualitative research]]) is the issue of ''observer dependency'': the results obtained are influenced by the researcher or his or her reading of the group's discussion, raising questions of validity (see [[experimenter's bias]]).\nFocus groups are \"One shot case studies\" especially if they are measuring a property-disposition relationship within the social sciences, unless they are repeated.<ref>Nachmais, Chava Frankfort; Nachmias, David. 2008. ''Research methods in the Social Sciences: Seventh Edition'' New York, NY: Worth Publishers</ref> Focus groups can create severe issues of external validity, especially the reactive effects of the testing arrangement.<ref>Campbell, Donald T., Stanley, Julian C. ''Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research.'' Chicago, IL: Rand McNally</ref>  Other common (and related) criticism involve [[groupthink]] and [[social desirability bias]].\n\nAnother issue is with the setting itself.  If the focus groups are held in a laboratory setting with a moderator who is a professor and the recording instrument is obtrusive, the participants may either hold back on their responses and/or try to answer the moderator's questions with answers the participants feel that the moderator wants to hear.  Another issue with the focus group setting is the lack of anonymity.  With all of the other participants, there can not be any guarantee of confidentiality.\n\n[[Douglas Rushkoff]]<ref>Rushkoff, Douglas, ''Get back in the box: innovation from the inside out'', New York: Collins, 2005</ref> argues that focus groups are often useless, and frequently cause more trouble than they are intended to solve, with focus groups often aiming to please rather than offering their own opinions or evaluations, and with data often [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]] to support a foregone conclusion. Rushkoff cites the disastrous introduction of [[New Coke]] in the 1980s as a vivid example of focus group design, implementation, and analysis gone bad.\n\nJonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, also said that Apple had found a good reason not to do focus groups: \"They just ensure that you don\u2019t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products.\" <ref name=\"Jary\">{{cite news |last1=Jary |first1=Simon |title=Apple's I've reveals design secrets |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1141509/jonathan_ive_london.html |accessdate=29 December 2018 |publisher=Macworld U.K. |date=July 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Data analysis==\nThe analysis of focus group data presents both challenges and opportunities when compared to other types of qualitative data. Some authors<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Jamie|title=Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish|isbn=978-0-85702-138-0|page=150}}</ref> have suggested that data should be analyzed in the same manner as interview data, while others have suggested that the unique features of focus group data \u2013 particularly the opportunity that it provides to observe interactions between group members - means that distinctive forms of analysis should be used. Data analysis can take place at the level of the individual or the group.\n\nFocus group data provides the opportunity to analyze the strength with which an individual holds an opinion.  If they are presented with opposing opinions or directly challenged, the individual may either modify their position or defend it. Bringing together all the comments that an individual makes in order can enable the researcher to determine whether their view changes in the course of discussion and, if so, further examination of the transcript may reveal which contributions by other focus group members brought about the change.\n\nAt the collective level, focus group data can sometimes reveal shared understandings or common views.  However, there is a danger that a consensus can be assumed when not every person has spoken: the researcher will need to consider carefully whether the people who have not expressed a view can be assumed to agree with the majority, or whether they may simply be unwilling to voice their disagreement.<ref>Harding, Jamie. 2013. ''Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish'' London, SAGE Publishers</ref>\n\n==United States government==\nThe [[United States]] federal government makes extensive use of focus groups to assess public education materials and messages for their many programs.  While many of these are appropriate for the purpose, many others are reluctant compromises which federal officials have had to make as a result of studies independent of whether a focus group is a

And while researching this area the teachers, professionals, and researchers can be grouped according to the research requirements. Focus groups in library science field research help study user's behavior and the impact of services on the library use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social sciences===\nIn the [[social sciences]] and [[urban planning]], focus groups allow interviewers to study people in a more natural conversation pattern than typically occurs in a one-to-one interview. In combination with [[participant observation]], they can be used for learning about groups and their patterns of interaction. An advantage is their fairly low cost compared to [[Opinion poll|surveys]], as one can get results relatively quickly and increase the sample size of a report by talking with several people at once.<ref>Marshall, Catherine, and Gretchen B. Rossman. 1999. ''Designing Qualitative Research''. 3rd Ed. London: Sage Publications, p. 115</ref> Another advantage is that they can be used as an occasion for participants to learn from one another as they exchange and build on one another's views so that the participants can experience the research as an enriching encounter. This counteracts the extractive nature of research which seeks to \"mine\" participants for data (with no benefit for them) as criticized by various authors, and in particular Indigenous-oriented authors (and others sharing similar sentiments), as explained, for example, by Romm (2015): http://www.qualitative-research.net/index.php/fqs/article/view/2087.\n\n===Marketing===\nIn the world of [[marketing]], focus groups are seen as an important tool for acquiring feedback regarding new products, as well as various other topics. In marketing, focus groups are usually used in the early stages of product or concept development, when organizations are trying to create an overall direction for marketing initiative. In particular, focus groups allow companies wishing to develop, package, name, or test market a new product, to discuss, view, and/or test the new product before it is made available to the public. This can provide valuable information about the potential market acceptance of the product.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\nA focus group is an interview, conducted by a trained moderator among a small group of respondents. The interview is conducted informally and naturally where respondents are free to give views from any aspect. Focus groups are similar to, but should not be confused with in-depth interviews. The moderator uses a discussion guide that has been prepared in advance of the focus group to guide the discussion.  Generally, the discussion goes from overall impressions of a brand or product category and becomes more specific as the discussion progresses.\n\nParticipants are recruited on the basis of similar demographics, psychographics, buying attitudes, or behaviors.<ref>{{cite book |last=Greenbaum |first=Thomas|title=Moderating Focus Groups|year=2000|publisher=Sage Publications, Inc.|location=Thousand Oaks, California|isbn=0-7619-2044-7}}</ref>\n\nRepresentatives of the stakeholder (often a design team in the case of testing acceptance on a new product) are not involved in the focus group, not to bias the exercise. However, they may attend the focus group, either through video cameras or by watching through a one-way mirror.\n\nTraditional focus groups can provide accurate information, and are less expensive than other forms of traditional [[marketing research]]. There can be significant costs, however: if a product is to be marketed on a nationwide basis, it would be critical to gather respondents from various locales throughout the country since attitudes about a new product may vary due to geographical considerations. This would require considerable expenditure on travel and lodging expenses. Additionally, the site of a traditional focus group may or may not be in a locale convenient to a specific client, so client representatives may have to incur travel and lodging expenses as well.\n\nToday, using [[audience response]] keypads to collect questionnaire answers is the new industry trend.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}\n\n===Usability engineering===\n* In [[usability engineering]], a focus group is a survey method to collect the feedback of users on software or a website. This marketing method can be applied to computer products to better understand the motivations of users and their perception of the product. Unlike other methods of [[ergonomics]], the focus group implies several participants: users or future users of the application. The focus group can only collect subjective data, not objective data on the use of the application as the [[usability test]] for example.\n\n==Types==\nVariants of focus groups include:\n* '''Two-way focus group''' - one focus group watches another focus group and discusses the observed interactions and conclusion\n* '''Dual moderator focus group''' - one moderator ensures the session progresses smoothly, while another ensures that all the topics are covered\n* '''Dueling moderator focus group''' (fencing-moderator) - two moderators deliberately take opposite sides on the issue under discussion\n* '''Respondent moderator focus group''' - one and only one of the respondents is asked to act as the moderator temporarily\n* '''Client participant focus groups''' - one or more client representatives participate in the discussion, either covertly or overtly\n* '''Mini focus groups''' - groups are composed of four or five members rather than 6 to 12\n* '''Teleconference focus groups ''' - telephone network is used\n* '''Creativity groups'''\n* '''Band obsessive group'''\n* '''[[Online focus group]]s''' - computers connected via the internet are used\n* '''Phone/ web focus groups ''' - live group conducted over the phone and online with 6 to 8 participants\n\n== Online focus groups ==\nFocus groups typically are conducted face-to-face, but the emergence of technology has enabled qualitative research to reach online approaches.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Tom|last2=McKee|first2=Kim|last3=McCoughlin|first3=Pauline|date=2015-04-23|title=Online focus groups and qualitative research in the social sciences: their merits and limitations in a study of housing and youth|journal=People, Place and Policy Onlin|volume=9|issue=1|pages=17\u201328|doi=10.3351/ppp.0009.0001.0002|doi-access=free}}</ref>  There are two types of online methods; synchronous and asynchronous.

This is also known as the group effect where group members engage in \"a kind of \u2018chaining\u2019 or \u2018cascading\u2019 effect; talk links to, or tumbles out of, the topics and expressions preceding it\" (Lindlof & Taylor, 2002, p.&nbsp;182)<ref>Lindlof, T. R., & Taylor, B. C. (2002). ''Qualitative Communication Research Methods, 2nd Edition''. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage.</ref>\n* Group members discover a common language to describe similar experiences. This enables the capture of a form of \"native language\" or \"vernacular speech\" to understand the situation\n* Focus groups also provide an opportunity for disclosure among similar others in a setting where participants are validated. For example, in the context of [[workplace bullying]], targeted employees often find themselves in situations where they experience a lack of voice and feelings of isolation. Use of focus groups to study workplace bullying, therefore, serves as both an efficacious and ethical venue for collecting data (see, e.g., Tracy, Lutgen-Sandvik, & Alberts, 2006)<ref>Tracy, S. J., Lutgen-Sandvik, P., & Alberts, J. K. (2006). Nightmares, demons, and slaves: Exploring the painful metaphors of workplace bullying. ''Management Communication Quarterly, 20'', 148-185.</ref>\n\n==Problems and criticism==\nA fundamental difficulty with focus groups (and other forms of [[qualitative research]]) is the issue of ''observer dependency'': the results obtained are influenced by the researcher or his or her reading of the group's discussion, raising questions of validity (see [[experimenter's bias]]).\nFocus groups are \"One shot case studies\" especially if they are measuring a property-disposition relationship within the social sciences unless they are repeated.<ref>Nachmais, Chava Frankfort; Nachmias, David. 2008. ''Research methods in the Social Sciences: Seventh Edition'' New York, NY: Worth Publishers</ref> Focus groups can create severe issues of external validity, especially the reactive effects of the testing arrangement.<ref>Campbell, Donald T., Stanley, Julian C. ''Experimental and Quasi-Experimental Designs for Research.'' Chicago, IL: Rand McNally</ref>  Other common (and related) criticism involve [[groupthink]] and [[social desirability bias]].\n\nAnother issue is with the setting itself.  If the focus groups are held in a laboratory setting with a moderator who is a professor and the recording instrument is obtrusive, the participants may either hold back on their responses and/or try to answer the moderator's questions with answers the participants feel that the moderator wants to hear.  Another issue with the focus group setting is the lack of anonymity.  With all of the other participants, there can not be any guarantee of confidentiality.\n\n[[Douglas Rushkoff]]<ref>Rushkoff, Douglas, ''Get back in the box: innovation from the inside out'', New York: Collins, 2005</ref> argues that focus groups are often useless, and frequently cause more trouble than they are intended to solve, with focus groups often aiming to please rather than offering their own opinions or evaluations, and with data often [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picked]] to support a foregone conclusion. Rushkoff cites the disastrous introduction of [[New Coke]] in the 1980s as a vivid example of focus group design, implementation, and analysis gone bad.\n\nJonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president of industrial design, also said that Apple had found a good reason not to do focus groups: \"They just ensure that you don\u2019t offend anyone, and produce bland inoffensive products.\" <ref name=\"Jary\">{{cite news |last1=Jary |first1=Simon |title=Apple's I've reveals design secrets |url=https://www.macworld.com/article/1141509/jonathan_ive_london.html |accessdate=29 December 2018 |publisher=Macworld U.K. |date=July 2, 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Data analysis==\nThe analysis of focus group data presents both challenges and opportunities when compared to other types of qualitative data. Some authors<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harding|first1=Jamie|title=Qualitative Data Analysis from Start to Finish|isbn=978-0-85702-138-0|page=150}}</ref> have suggested that data should be analyzed in the same manner as interview data, while others have suggested that the unique features of focus group data \u2013 particularly the opportunity that it provides to observe interactions between group members - means that distinctive forms of analysis should be used. Data analysis can take place at the level of the individual or the group.\n\nFocus group data provides the opportunity to analyze the strength with which an individual holds an opinion.  If they are presented with opposing opinions or directly challenged, the individual may either modify their position or defend it. Bringing together all the comments that an individual makes in order can enable the researcher to determine whether their view changes in the course of discussion and, if so, further examination of the transcript may reveal which contributions by other focus group members brought about the change.\n\nAt the collective level, focus group data can sometimes reveal shared understandings or common views.  However, there is a danger that a consensus can be assumed when not every person has spoken: the researcher will need to consider carefully whether the people who have not expressed a view can be assumed to agree with the majority, or whether they may simply be unwilling to voice their disagreement.<ref>Harding, Jamie. 2013.

Modern tuckpointing tools are constructed from hardened [[tool steel]]. Tuckpointing tools typically have a wooden or synthetic handle that is attached to the tool surface by a metal [[ferrule]]. The tool surface itself has a sharp-pointed front and a flat, beaded or grooved base; the sharp point aids the user in smoothing the tuckpointed line. This is similar in principle to the pointed floats used by concrete finishers to smooth out a surface.\n\nThe thickness and width of a tuckpointing tool is variable, with common measurements ranging from 1 mm to 14 mm. The thickness and width of these tools are heavily dependent upon the mason's personal preference and the type of brick or stonework that they are tuckpointing. Wider tools are often used when tuckpointing stonework.\n\nThere are many different types of tuckpointing tools now available: \"Standard Tuckpointing Tools (flat bottomed)\", \"Square Beaded Tuckpointing Tool\", \"Round Beaded Tuckpointing Tools\", \"Stubnose and Longnose Tuckpointing tools\", and also rarer \"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\".\n\nStandard or flat bottomed tuckpointing tools were once the most commonly used tuckpointing tools, primarily because of the ease at which they could be manufactured by early blacksmiths. Standard tuckpointing tools are very versatile and can be used for a variety of different jobs ranging from very fine detail work up to wide stone tuckpointing work.\n\nTuckpointing tools are sometimes \"beaded\". First, beaded tuckpointing tools were crude instruments made by blacksmiths by hitting a rounded leading edged hammer against a red hot tuckpointing iron. This process has since been refined, and now a small rounded or square fillet is \"ground\" into the flat of the tuckpointing tool that comes into contact with the \"perps\" or \"lines\" in the brickwork. In bricklaying terms, the \"perps\" are the gaps between the bricks in which mortar runs in the vertical direction, perpendicular to the ends<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishtechnews.ie/robots-podcast-hadrian-bricklaying-robot-with-mark-pivac/|title=Robots podcast: Hadrian bricklaying robot, with Mark Pivac|last=Cocking|first=Simon|date=2017-03-23|website=Irishtechnews.ie|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>. \"Lines\" run in the horizontal direction.\n\nThe lengths of tools again vary based upon personal preferences, but the most common lengths are usually between 7.5 and 12.5 cm. However, masons and bricklayers sometimes need tuckpointing tools which are much shorter or much longer. Shorter tools help the worker access hard to reach spots, like under a window or in a corner. These shorter tuckpointing tools are referred to as \"stubnose\" tools, while their longer counterparts are known as \"longnose\" tools. They are available in many different beaded or grooved profiles.\n\nSquare beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, 12 mm, and 13 mm wide ground square profiles. Round beaded tuckpointing tools are available in 5 mm, 6 mm, 8 mm, 10 mm, and 12 mm ground round profiles.\n\n\"Rounded Corner Tuckpointing Tools\" are curved; instead of a flat bottom, the tool has a curved bottom surface which helps in applying lime putty to rounded bricks. \n\nThe process of tuckpointing requires that the excess lime putty is \"cut\" away from the fine tuckpointed line. This is performed using a Frenchmen<ref name=\":0\" /> knife or a double Frenchmen knife. A Frenchmen knife is a type of knife with a small sharp bent tip that allows the lime putty to be cut when guided along the tuckpointed line with a tuckpointer's straight edge. A double Frenchmen knife works by cutting both top and bottom tuckpointed fine lines in one pass, making the process quicker. Double Frenchmen knives can be adjusted to match the width of the fine tuckpointed lines.\n\nTuckpointing is a fairly rare but not forgotten trade. Many historic homes with classic [[Italianate architecture]] like the Werribee Mansion at [[Werribee Park]], in Victoria, Australia west of Melbourne, are great examples of recent tuckpointing which display the contrast between the tuckpointed white lines in the mortar between the bluestone architecture.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==External links==\n*{{cite web| url = https://www.masonrymagazine.com/blog/2008/09/01/tuckpointing-and-repointing-tools | title = Tuckpointing and repointing tools | date = 2008-09-01}}\n\n{{Stonemasonry}}\n\n[[Category:Masonry]]\n[[Category:Bricks]]\n[[Category:Stonemasonry]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the process of renewing the external part of mortar joints|Repointing}}\n \n[[Image:Tuck pointing Westminster.jpg|thumb|Brickwork of [[10 Downing Street]], showing fine white fillets in carefully matched dark mortar]]'''Tuckpointing''' (also called tuck pointing or tuck-pointing) is a way of using two contrasting colours of [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] in the [[mortar joint]]s of [[brickwork]], with one colour matching the bricks themselves to give an artificial impression that very fine joints have been made.

Chitra spent a year in a mental asylum because she witnessed her family being murdered. Chitra and Krishna become friends. While Chitra is looking through her binoculars, she witnesses a murder where she can clearly see the victim's face. Chitra reports the incident to the police, but they find no evidence of the crime. Chitra suspects that her past mental condition is relapsing. Eventually, the police finds out that the female victim did, in fact, exist.

He cannot acknowledge their illegitimate relation without tainting his reputation. It is revealed that he lured his daughter to Araku to kill her. Although Chitra witnessed the murder, the Circle Inspector tried to make it look like a figment of Chitra's imagination, and is infuriated when Chitra refuses to believe that the murder was her hallucination.

He began his professional career at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in 2005, having progressed through the [[Middlesbrough F.C. Reserves and Academy|club's academy]]. After making his debut for the club in January 2006, he became a regular player, and at the age of 18 years and 47 days was the youngest man to captain Middlesbrough where he made 91 appearances and scored four goals. He switched to [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in July 2008. Cattermole quickly became a regular for Wigan, amassing 35 appearances in the 2008\u201309 season. After attracting interest from other Premier League clubs, he joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in August 2009. Despite a few injury problems early in his spell at the club, manager [[Steve Bruce]] selected him as captain for the start of the 2010\u201311 season, a role he would hold for three seasons, until [[Paolo di Canio]] gave [[John O'Shea]] the role prior to the start of the 2013\u201314 season.\n\nInternationally, Cattermole represented [[England national football team|England]] at [[England national under-16 football team|under-16]], [[England national under-17 football team|under-17]], [[England national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[England national under-19 football team|under-19]] and [[England national under-21 football team|under-21]] levels. Cattermole has also made appearances on Bang-Bros, Red Tube and Brazzers as a gay erotic actor. He is famous for going down on Phil Mitchell and his glistening sports career.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Middlesbrough===\nA product of the Middlesbrough [[Middlesbrough F.C.

He then played the full match and captained the side in the 4\u20133 defeat by Manchester City.\n\nOn the eve of the 2010\u201311 season, Cattermole was selected by manager Bruce as the replacement captain after [[Lorik Cana]]'s departure. He was also handed the vacant number 6 shirt. He received a red card in the first game of the season against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a second bookable offence. Bruce later referred to referee Anthony Taylor as 'out of his depth'. Cattermole played most of the 90 minutes in Sunderland's 3\u20130 away win against Chelsea, coming off in added time in the second half and was pivotal in the victory. He then earned the Man of the Match award for his performance at home to West Ham, a game which Sunderland won 1\u20130. Cattermole's tough tackling style has put him into troublesome situations with referees. Bruce, despite backing Cattermole as club captain, said that his disciplinary record must improve. Again, Cattermole suffered an injury-hit season, making 24 appearances in total (two more than the previous season).<ref>{{Soccerbase season|43076|2010|name=Lee Cattermole|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Soccerbase season|43076|2009|name=Lee Cattermole|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nCattermole remained captain at the start of the [[2011\u201312 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2011\u201312 season]] and received yellow cards in the first two games, against Liverpool and Newcastle. He then fell out of favour, with his next full match not coming until 5 November, in a defeat at Manchester United. Following Bruce's sacking and the appointment of [[Martin O'Neill]] as his successor, it was suggested Cattermole might lose the captaincy, especially after he and [[Nicklas Bendtner]] were arrested for allegedly damaging cars in Newcastle city centre. However, he led the team on his first appearance under O'Neill, a 3\u20132 win at QPR. Cattermole had arguably two of his best performances for the Black Cats in their 1\u20130 win over Manchester City on New Years Day 2012 and a 4\u20131 win at Wigan two days later. After the victory over Manchester City, O'Neill told his captain: \"Well done, absolutely brilliant.

After making his debut for the club in January 2006, he became a regular player, and at the age of 18 years and 47 days was the youngest man to captain Middlesbrough where he made 91 appearances and scored four goals.

He was also handed the vacant number 6 shirt. He received a red card in the first game of the season against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for a second bookable offence. Bruce later referred to referee Anthony Taylor as 'out of his depth'. Cattermole played most of the 90 minutes in Sunderland's 3\u20130 away win against Chelsea, coming off in added time in the second half and was pivotal in the victory. He then earned the Man of the Match award for his performance at home to West Ham, a game which Sunderland won 1\u20130. Cattermole's tough tackling style has put him into troublesome situations with referees. Bruce, despite backing Cattermole as club captain, said that his disciplinary record must improve. Again, Cattermole suffered an injury-hit season, making 24 appearances in total (two more than the previous season).<ref>{{Soccerbase season|43076|2010|name=Lee Cattermole|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Soccerbase season|43076|2009|name=Lee Cattermole|accessdate=31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nCattermole remained captain at the start of the [[2011\u201312 Sunderland A.F.C. season|2011\u201312 season]] and received yellow cards in the first two games, against Liverpool and Newcastle.

Following Bruce's sacking and the appointment of [[Martin O'Neill]] as his successor, it was suggested Cattermole might lose the captaincy, especially after he and [[Nicklas Bendtner]] were arrested for allegedly damaging cars in Newcastle city centre. However, he led the team on his first appearance under O'Neill, a 3\u20132 win at QPR. Cattermole had arguably two of his best performances for the Black Cats in their 1\u20130 win over Manchester City on New Years Day 2012 and a 4\u20131 win at Wigan two days later. After the victory over Manchester City, O'Neill told his captain: \"Well done, absolutely brilliant.

It is also the location of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]].\n\n==Geography==\nCrystal City is centered along a stretch of Richmond Highway ([[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. 1]]), just south of [[The Pentagon]], just east of [[Pentagon City]], and within walking distance to the west of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]]. Characterized as one of many \"urban villages\" by Arlington County, Crystal City is almost exclusively populated by high-rise apartment buildings, corporate offices, hotels, and numerous shops and restaurants. There is also an extensive network of underground shopping areas and connecting corridors beneath Crystal City.\n\nCrystal City has a [[Crystal City (Washington Metro)|station]] on the [[Washington Metro]] [[Blue Line (Washington Metro)|Blue]] and [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Lines]], and [[Crystal City (VRE station)|another]] on the [[Virginia Railway Express]] [[commuter train]] system.\n\nThe layout of Crystal City was considered avant-garde at the time of construction, with [[city block|superblocks]] bounded by arterial and circulating roads, and with pedestrian traffic and the businesses serving it relocated from the streets to the pedestrian tunnels. However, Crystal City has since been redesigned to give it a more traditional, urban feel, with restaurants at street level, and with traffic patterns changed to make streets like Crystal Drive function as city streets, rather than as circulating roads.<ref name=\"ggw\">{{cite web|url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post.cgi?id=2565|title=Envisioning Crystal City as part of a larger community|publisher=Greater Greater Washington|date=2009-05-14|accessdate=2009-10-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612222655/http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post.cgi?id=2565|archivedate=2010-06-12}}</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of Crystal City's extensive integration with both office buildings and residential high-rise buildings, it is possible for most residents living to the east of Route 1 to traverse from one end to the other (roughly north-south), performing shopping or dining along the way, entirely underground, thus making a large part of Crystal City an [[underground city]]. This is of particular convenience during inclement weather.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:2345 Crystal Drive Hbrackett.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Brown metal and glass building, curved at the center and angled at the sides/|Crystal Park Four, former US Airways headquarters in July 2009.]]\nBefore development by the Charles E. Smith Company, the area was mostly composed of industrial sites, junkyards, and low-rent motels. A [[drive-in theater]] existed at the intersection of Jefferson Davis Highway and 20th Street South between 1947 and 1963 and is visible on aerial photos of the period. The [[Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad|RF&P]] railroad tracks were moved closer to National Airport to accommodate more space for development.\n\nThough it is not a [[planned community]], it unfolded in much that fashion after construction began on the first few condominiums and office buildings in 1963. The name \"Crystal City\" came from the first building, which was called ''Crystal House'' and had an elaborate crystal chandelier in the lobby. Every subsequent building took on the Crystal name (e.g., Crystal Gateway, Crystal Towers) and eventually the whole neighborhood. Crystal City is largely integrated in layout and extensive landscaping, as well as the style and materials of the high rise buildings, most of which have a speckled granite exterior.\n\nCrystal City's ''Crystal Underground'' shopping mall opened in September 1976. Billed as a \"turn-of-the-century shopping village,\" it featured antique leaded glass shop windows and cobblestone \"streets.\" Emphasis was on locally owned and operated businesses and personalized service. The largest retail outlets were a {{convert|12000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Jelleff's]] women's store, Larimers gourmet grocery and delicatessen, and a [[Drug Fair]]. The mall also featured an \"Antique Alley\" with small antique and craft stores. At opening there were 40 stores, with an anticipated expansion of {{convert|150000|sqft|m2}} with 70 more shops including the Crystal Palace food court.<ref>\"Crystal Underground opens,\" by Pat Royse, ''The Washington Post'', Sep 30, 1976, p. VA_14.</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2004, the Crystal City area underwent a number of changes. Many buildings' addresses were changed on this date, several major roads were turned into two-way streets, and many of the markings for the traditional building names (e.g., \"Crystal Gateway 1\") were removed. As a result, local residents may refer to building names that are difficult for visitors to find.<ref name=\"daw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/crystal-city.html |title=Crystal City Name Changes (Address Changes) |author=David A.

It is also the location of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]].\n\n==Geography==\nCrystal City is centered along a stretch of Richmond Highway ([[U.S. Route 1 in Virginia|U.S. 1]]), just south of [[The Pentagon]], just east of [[Pentagon City]], and within walking distance to the west of [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]]. Characterized as one of many \"urban villages\" by Arlington County, Crystal City is almost exclusively populated by high-rise apartment buildings, corporate offices, hotels, and numerous shops and restaurants. There is also an extensive network of underground shopping areas and connecting corridors beneath Crystal City.\n\nCrystal City has a [[Crystal City (Washington Metro)|station]] on the [[Washington Metro]] [[Blue Line (Washington Metro)|Blue]] and [[Yellow Line (Washington Metro)|Yellow Lines]], and [[Crystal City (VRE station)|another]] on the [[Virginia Railway Express]] [[commuter train]] system.\n\nThe layout of Crystal City was considered avant-garde at the time of construction, with [[city block|superblocks]] bounded by arterial and circulating roads, and with pedestrian traffic and the businesses serving it relocated from the streets to the pedestrian tunnels. However, Crystal City has since been redesigned to give it a more traditional, urban feel, with restaurants at street level, and with traffic patterns changed to make streets like Crystal Drive function as city streets, rather than as circulating roads.<ref name=\"ggw\">{{cite web|url=http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post.cgi?id=2565|title=Envisioning Crystal City as part of a larger community|publisher=Greater Greater Washington|date=2009-05-14|accessdate=2009-10-26|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612222655/http://greatergreaterwashington.org/post.cgi?id=2565|archivedate=2010-06-12}}</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of Crystal City's extensive integration with both office buildings and residential high-rise buildings, it is possible for most residents living to the east of Route 1 to traverse from one end to the other (roughly north-south), performing shopping or dining along the way, entirely underground, thus making a large part of Crystal City an [[underground city]]. This is of particular convenience during inclement weather.\n\n== History ==\n[[Image:2345 Crystal Drive Hbrackett.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Brown metal and glass building, curved at the center and angled at the sides/|Crystal Park Four, former US Airways headquarters in July 2009.]]\nBefore development by the Charles E. Smith Company, the area was mostly composed of industrial sites, junkyards, and low-rent motels. A [[drive-in theater]] existed at the intersection of Jefferson Davis Highway and 20th Street South between 1947 and 1963 and is visible on aerial photos of the period. The [[Richmond, Fredericksburg & Potomac Railroad|RF&P]] railroad tracks were moved closer to National Airport to accommodate more space for development.\n\nThough it is not a [[planned community]], it unfolded in much that fashion after construction began on the first few condominiums and office buildings in 1963. The name \"Crystal City\" came from the first building, which was called ''Crystal House'' and had an elaborate crystal chandelier in the lobby. Every subsequent building took on the Crystal name (e.g., Crystal Gateway, Crystal Towers) and eventually the whole neighborhood. Crystal City is largely integrated in layout and extensive landscaping, as well as the style and materials of the high rise buildings, most of which have a speckled granite exterior.\n\nCrystal City's ''Crystal Underground'' shopping mall opened in September 1976. Billed as a \"turn-of-the-century shopping village,\" it featured antique leaded glass shop windows and cobblestone \"streets.\" Emphasis was on locally owned and operated businesses and personalized service. The largest retail outlets were a {{convert|12000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [[Jelleff's]] women's store, Larimers gourmet grocery and delicatessen, and a [[Drug Fair]]. The mall also featured an \"Antique Alley\" with small antique and craft stores. At opening there were 40 stores, with an anticipated expansion of {{convert|150000|sqft|m2}} with 70 more shops including the Crystal Palace food court.<ref>\"Crystal Underground opens,\" by Pat Royse, ''The Washington Post'', Sep 30, 1976, p. VA_14.</ref>\n\nOn June 26, 2004, the Crystal City area underwent a number of changes. Many buildings' addresses were changed on this date, several major roads were turned into two-way streets, and many of the markings for the traditional building names (e.g., \"Crystal Gateway 1\") were removed. As a result, local residents may refer to building names that are difficult for visitors to find.<ref name=\"daw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/crystal-city.html |title=Crystal City Name Changes (Address Changes) |author=David A.
