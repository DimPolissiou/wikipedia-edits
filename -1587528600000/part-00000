The years during which her sons reigned have been called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici\" as she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France.<ref>Thomson, 98; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 3; Neale, ''The Age of Catherine de Medici''.</ref> \n\nShe was born in Florence to [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino|Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Duke of Urbino]] and  [[Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne]]. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] and [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]]. Catherine's marriage was arranged by her uncle [[Pope Clement VII]]. Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]], who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old King Francis II. When Francis II died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as [[regent]] for her son [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX, King of France]]. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months).\n\nCatherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant [[French Wars of Religion|civil and religious war in France]]. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or [[Huguenots]], as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 272.</ref> In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572, in which thousands of [[Huguenot]]s were killed in Paris and throughout France.\n\nSome historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters.<ref>Knecht, 272. For a summary of the fluctuations in Catherine's historical reputation, see the preface to R. J. Knecht's ''Catherine de' Medici'', 1998: xi\u2013xiv.</ref> In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the [[House of Valois|Valois monarchy]] on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 20.</ref> Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 26.</ref> According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in 16th-century Europe.<ref name=\"stragexi\">Strage, Mark (1976).

Clement called Catherine's betrothal to [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orl\u00e9ans]] \"the greatest match in the world\".]]\nCatherine de' Medici was born on 13 April 1519 in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], the only child of [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]], and his wife, [[Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at [[Amboise]] as part of the alliance between King [[Francis I of France]] and Lorenzo's uncle [[Pope Leo X]] against the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]]. According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were \"as pleased as if it had been a boy\".\n\nWithin a month of Catherine's birth, both her parents were dead: Madeleine died on 28 April of [[puerperal fever]] or [[plague (disease)|plague]], and Lorenzo died on 4 May,<ref name =\"kviii\"/> his title over Urbino reverting to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]]. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her.<ref name =\"kviii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 8.</ref>\n\nCatherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]]). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, [[Clarice de' Medici]]. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her ''duchessina'' (\"the little duchess\"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the [[Duchy of Urbino]].<ref>Young, ''The Medici: Volume II'', 15.</ref>\n\nIn 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal [[Silvio Passerini]], and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 11.</ref> The final one, the ''Santissima Annuziata delle Murate'' was her home for three years. Mark Strage described these years as \"the happiest of her entire life\".<ref name=\"strage13\">Strage, pp. 13, 15</ref> Clement had no choice but to crown [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 10\u201311.</ref> In October 1529, Charles's troops laid [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)|siege to Florence]]. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification.<ref name=\"strage15\">Strage, p.15</ref> The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.<ref name= \"kxii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 12.</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Henri & Catherine.jpg|thumb|right|Catherine and Henry's marriage, painted seventeen years after the event]]\nOn her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as \"small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 14.</ref> Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including [[James V of Scotland]] who sent the [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530.<ref>Hay, Denys, ed., ''The Letters of James V'', HMSO (1954), p.173, 180\u20132, 189,</ref> When Francis I of France proposed his second son, [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who, despite her wealth, was of common origin.\n\nThe wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving,<ref name=knecht/> took place in the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]] in [[Marseille]] on 28 October 1533.<ref>[http://www.marseille13.fr/fr/eglise-saint-ferreol-les-augustins Marseille 13: Eglise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]</ref> Prince Henry danced and [[jousting|jousted]] for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that \"each had shown valour in the joust\".<ref name=knecht>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 16.</ref> Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings.\n\nCatherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please. The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court. The next pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, \"The girl has come to me stark naked.\" Despite this, Francis quickly developed an affection for his daughter-in-law, impressed by her intelligence and affability, and sharing with her a love for hunting and outdoor activities. She became part of the inner circle of female friends known as the ''Petite Bande'', which accompanied the King on his frequent moves from residence to residence.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Medici| author=G.F. Young| publisher=Modern Library| year=1930| p=398-399}}</ref>\n\nPrince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, [[Filippa Duci|Philippa Duci]], one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29\u201330. Henry legitimised the child under the name [[Diane de France]]; he also produced at least two sons by other women.</ref> This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.\n\n===Dauphine===\n[[File:Henry II, king of France.. F Clouet.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], by [[Corneille de Lyon]]. During his childhood, Henry spent almost four and a half years as a hostage in Spain, an ordeal that marked him for life, leaving him introverted and gloomy.]]\nIn 1536, Henry's older brother, [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis]], caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir. Suspicion abounded that the Dauphin had been poisoned by Catherine to promote her husband as the heir to the French throne, especially when one of the Italian nobles who accompanied her to France, [[Sebastiano de Montecuccoli]], confessed under torture to the poisoning. Although Montecuccoli squarely placed the blame on the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V]], and never implicated Catherine, her status as a mistrusted foreigner led many in France to perceive her as guilty.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Medici| author=G.B. Young| publisher=Modern Library| year=1930| p=401}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Dauphine of France|dauphine]], Catherine was expected to provide a future heir to the throne.<ref name = \"kxxiv\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29.</ref> According to the court chronicler [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant\u00f4me|Brant\u00f4me]], \"many people advised the king and the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France\".<ref>Knecht, 29.</ref> Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her \"source of life\", and drinking mule's urine. On 19 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a [[Francis II of France|son]], named after King Francis.\n\nAfter becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician [[Jean Fernel]], who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]]. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (born 27 June 1550); the future [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (born 19 September 1551); and [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]] (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the [[House of Valois|Valois dynasty]], which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.\n\nCatherine's ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, at the age of 15, Henry had taken as his mistress the 38-year-old [[Diane de Poitiers]], whom he adored for the rest of his life.<ref>Heritier, 38\u201342.</ref> Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint-Denis]] on 10 June 1549.\n\n===Queen of France===\n[[File:KatharinavonMedici.jpg|thumb|left|Catherine de' Medici, as queen of France. \"Her mouth is too large and her eyes too prominent and colourless for beauty\", wrote a Venetian envoy as Catherine approached forty, \"but a very distinguished-looking woman, with a shapely figure, a beautiful skin and exquisitely shaped hands\".]]\nHenry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen.<ref>Morris, 247</ref> Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 42\u201343.</ref> Henry gave the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau|Ch\u00e2teau of Chenonceau]], which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, who took her place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.\n[[File:Jeton en argent sur Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.jpg|thumb|Silver jeton on Catherine de'M\u00e9dici]]\n\nThe imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 38.</ref> Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 34.</ref> The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.\n\nHenry's reign also saw the rise of the Guise brothers, [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles]], who became a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and Henry's boyhood friend [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Francis]], who became [[Counts and Dukes of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. Their sister [[Mary of Guise]] had married [[James V of Scotland]] in 1538 and was the mother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis.<ref>Guy, 46.</ref> Catherine brought her up with her own children at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's [[regent]].<ref>Guy, 41.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brazilian ball for Henry II in Rouen October 1 1550.jpg|thumb|\"[[France Antarctique|Brazilian ball]]\" for [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and Catherine de' Medici in [[Rouen]], 1 October 1550, a precursor to the creation of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Brazil]].]]\nOn 3\u20134 April 1559, Henry signed the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]] with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and England, ending a long period of [[Italian Wars]]. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine's thirteen-year-old daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] to [[Philip II of Spain]].<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 55.</ref> Their [[proxy wedding]], in Paris on 22 June 1559, was celebrated with festivities, balls, [[masque]]s, and five days of [[jousting]].\n\nKing Henry took part in the jousting, sporting Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery]], knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\">Pettegree, 154.</ref> Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters \"of a good bigness\" sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Ch\u00e2teau de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, \"for fear\", in the words of a chronicler, \"of being expelled by the Queen\". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words \"''lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor''\" (\"from this come my tears and my pain\"), and wore black [[mourning]] in memory of Henry.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 56\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Queen mother==\n\n===Reign of Francis II===\n[[File:FrancoisII.jpg| thumb| upright| [[Francis II of France]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], 1560. Francis found the crown so heavy at his coronation that four nobles had to hold it in place as he walked up the steps to his throne.<ref>Guy, 102\u20133.</ref>]]\n\n[[Francis II of France|Francis II]] became king at the age of fifteen. In what has been called a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'', the Cardinal of Lorraine and the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]]\u2014whose niece, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], had married Francis II the year before\u2014seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the [[Louvre Palace]] with the young couple.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 59.</ref> The English ambassador reported a few days later that \"the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 60.</ref> For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself.<ref>Morris, 248.</ref> Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: \"This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that&nbsp;...\". Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]] to the crown. She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.\n\nThe Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], the [[First Prince of the Blood]], and then, with more success, to his brother, [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force.<ref>Holt, 38\u201339.</ref> When the Guises heard of the plot,<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 64; Holt, 44. The incident was known later as the [[Amboise conspiracy|\"tumult\" or conspiracy of Amboise]].</ref> they moved the court to the fortified [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]]. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the ch\u00e2teau. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 282.</ref> Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nIn June 1560, [[Michel de l'H\u00f4pital]] was appointed [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Chancellor of France]]. He sought the support of France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 32.</ref> Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Cond\u00e9 raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an [[abscess]] in his ear.<ref>Knecht, 72; Guy, 119.</ref>\n\nWhen Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], in return for the release of his brother Cond\u00e9.<ref>Pettegree, 154; Hoogvliet, 105. The regency was traditionally the preserve of the princes of the blood.</ref> As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (''gouvernante de France''), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: \"My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 73.</ref>\n\n===Reign of Charles IX===\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles IX of France]], after [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], c. 1565. The Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiel described Charles as \"an admirable child, with fine eyes, gracious movements, though he is not robust. He favours physical exercise that is too violent for his health, for he suffers from shortness of breath\".]]\n\nAt first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 28.</ref>\n\nShe summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting [[Colloquy of Poissy]] ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission.<ref>Manetsch, 22.</ref> Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, \"she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 80.</ref> In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 311; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 11\u201312. The edict, also known as the Edict of Toleration and the Edict of January, was significant for effectively recognising the existence of Protestant churches and permitting their worship outside city walls.</ref> On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the [[Massacre of Vassy]], the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at [[Wassy|Vassy (Wassy)]], killing 74 and wounding 104.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 87.</ref> Guise, who called the massacre \"a regrettable accident\", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the [[French Wars of Religion]]. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 140.</ref>\n\nWithin a month [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], and [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Gaspard de Coligny]] had raised an army of 1,800. They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down. She therefore told him: \"Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 89.</ref> The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held [[Rouen]]. Catherine visited the deathbed of [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], after he was fatally wounded by an [[arquebus]] shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, \"My courage is as great as yours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 90.</ref> The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived.

She also met her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] at [[Bayonne]] near the Spanish border, amidst lavish [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities]]. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] excused himself from the occasion. He sent the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 104, 107\u20138.</ref>\n\nIn 1566, through the ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie]], and because of a long-standing [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], Charles and Catherine proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French [[Huguenots]] and French and German [[Lutherans]] in Ottoman-controlled [[Moldavia]], in order to create a military colony and a buffer against the [[Habsburg]]. This plan also had the added advantage of removing the Huguenots from [[France]], but it failed to interest the Ottomans.<ref name=\"Faroqhi\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=-m8mind_TVIC&pg=PA37 ''The Ottoman Empire and the world around it'' by Suraiya Faroqhi p.37]</ref>\n\nOn 27 September 1567, in a swoop known as the [[Surprise of Meaux]], Huguenot forces attempted to ambush the king, triggering renewed civil war.<ref>Wood, 17.</ref> Taken unawares, the court fled to Paris in disarray.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 147.</ref> The war was ended by the [[Peace of Longjumeau]] of 22\u201323 March 1568, but civil unrest and bloodshed continued.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 118.</ref> The Surprise of Meaux marked a turning point in Catherine's policy towards the Huguenots.

Nevertheless, the [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.<ref>Wood, 28.</ref>\n\nCatherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554-1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref>Holt, 77.</ref> After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for [[Philip II of Spain]]. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and [[Henry III of Navarre]], Jeanne' son, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 135.</ref>\n\nCatherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: \"Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had.

Quoted by Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 148\u201349.</ref> playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 151. An autopsy revealed tuberculosis and an abscess.</ref> The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]], Paris.\n\n====St. Bartholomew's Day massacre====\nThree days later, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm.<ref>Sutherland, ''Massacre of St Bartholomew'', 313.</ref> A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse.<ref>Holt, 83.

Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 154\u201357. Coligny was lobbying the king to intervene against the empire in the Netherlands.<br />\u2022 The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, [[Francis, Duke of Guise]].<br />\u2022 For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83\u20134.</ref> Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.<ref>Pettegree, 159\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], which began two days later, has stained Catherine's reputation ever since.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\"/> There is reason to believe she was party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX is said to have ordered, \"Then kill them all!

It is almost certain, however, that when Charles gave the order \"Kill them all!\", he meant those drawn up on a list by Catherine, and not, as has often been claimed, all Huguenots.</ref> Historians have suggested that Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.<ref>Holt, 84.</ref>\n\nThe slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian [[Jules Michelet]], \"St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season\".<ref>Quoted by Morris, 252.</ref> On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 163\u201364; Heller, 117; Manetsch, 60\u201361.

As [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], he often showed more interest in pious devotions than in government.]]\n\n===Reign of Henry III===\nTwo years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were \"oh, my mother&nbsp;...\" The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he had been elected [[List of Polish monarchs#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|king]] the year before. However, three months after his coronation at [[Wawel Cathedral]], Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: \"I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end&nbsp;... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 172.</ref>\n\nHenry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[flagellation]].<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 232, 240, 247.</ref>\n\nHenry married [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaud\u00e9mont]] in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal [[nuncio]] Salviati observed, \"it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring&nbsp;... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long.\" As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]], known as \"Monsieur\", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 22.</ref> Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 205.</ref>\n\nIn 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown.<ref>Holt, 104.</ref> On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the [[Edict of Beaulieu]]. The treaty became known as the ''Peace of Monsieur'' because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown.<ref>Holt, 105\u20136; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 186.</ref> Francis died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 212\u201313.</ref> Catherine wrote, the next day: \"I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that He lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 217.</ref> The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams.

Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent [[Pomponne de Belli\u00e8vre]] to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at [[Agen]] and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough \"to put food on her table\". Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Usson]]. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 254\u201355.</ref> Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.\n\nCatherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 189.</ref> Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 209.</ref> On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: \"She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 200.</ref> She was under no illusions, however.

After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 185.</ref> The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal Charles de Bourbon]] on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the [[treaty of Joinville]] with Spain, and prepared to make war on the \"heretics\".<ref>Pettegree, 164.</ref> By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 255.</ref> As Catherine put it, \"peace is carried on a stick\" (''b\u00e2ton porte paix'').<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 249.</ref> \"Take care\", she wrote to the king, \"especially about your person.

In the [[Treaty of Nemours]], signed on 7 July 1585, he was forced to give in to all the League's demands, even that he pay its troops.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 440.</ref> He went into hiding to fast and pray, surrounded by a bodyguard known as \"[[The forty-five guards|the Forty-five]]\", and left Catherine to sort out the mess.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 253.</ref> The monarchy had lost control of the country, and was in no position to assist England in the face of the coming Spanish attack.

Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, had been kept in the dark.<ref>Henry wrote a note to Villeroy, which began: \"Villeroy, I remain very well contented with your service; do not fail however to go away to your house where you will stay until I send for you; do not seek the reason for this my letter, but obey me.\" Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 300\u20133.</ref> The king's actions effectively ended her days of power.\n\nAt the meeting of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done.

As Guise entered the king's chamber, the Forty-five plunged their blades into his body, and he died at the foot of the king's bed. At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons.<ref>Pettegree, 165.</ref> Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, \"Please forgive me.

In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display.

They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on [[Mythology|mythological]] themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her \"a great creative artist in festivals.\"<ref>Yates, 68.</ref> Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]],'' emerged from these creative advances.<ref>Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121\u201322.</ref> Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.<ref>Lee, 44.</ref>\n\nCatherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture. \"As the daughter of the Medici,\" suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, \"she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.\"<ref>Babelon, 263.</ref> After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 6.</ref> These included work on ch\u00e2teaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s]], and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the H\u00f4tel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.<ref>Knecht, 228.</ref>\n\nCatherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.<ref>Knecht, 223.</ref> Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]] as a tomb for her dead husband.<ref>Hoogvliet, 108.</ref> As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1504\u20131570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528\u20131590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument \"the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance.\"<ref name = \"zccclxxvix\">Zerner, 379.</ref> Catherine also commissioned [[Germain Pilon]] to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.<ref>Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may be referring to Artemisia, who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which became part of her own body.</ref>\n\nAlthough Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts,<ref>Thomson, 168.</ref> most of her patronage left no permanent legacy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 244.</ref> The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.\n\n[[File:COA french queen Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.svg|thumb|Coat of arms]]\n\n=== Culinary legend ===\nThe legend that de' Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians.<ref name=\"Davidson2014\">{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ|edition=2nd|date=11 August 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|page=232}}</ref> Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner [[fork]], [[parsley]], the [[artichoke]], [[lettuce]], [[broccoli]], the [[garden pea]], [[pasta]], [[Parmesan]], as well as the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[tomato]] of the [[New World]].

In fact, a large population of Italians\u2014bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\u2014had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning [[Renaissance]]. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.\n\nThe earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for \"cuisine\" in [[Diderot]] and [[d\u2019Alembert]]\u2019s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' published in 1754, which describes [[haute cuisine]] as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via \"that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de\u2019 Medici.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|last2=le Rond d'Alembert|first2=Jean|title=Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers|date=1754|publisher=Briasson, David, Le Breton and Durand|location=Paris|page=vol.

Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]'s penile deformity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The \"infertility\" of Catherine de Medici and its influence on 16th century France|last = Gordetsky, Rabinowitz and O'Brien|volume = 16|issue = 2|journal = The Canadian Journal of Urology|year = 2009|pages = 4584\u20138|url = https://www.canjurol.com/pdfs/DrGordetsky.pdf|pmid = 19364432}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Catherine de Medici's alleged talisman.jpg|thumb|The talisman Nostradamus allegedly made for Catherine de' Medici|276x276px]]\nSuspicion was fuelled to some degree by her entertainment of questionable characters at court\u2014for example, the reputed seer [[Nostradamus]], who was rumoured to have created a [[talisman]] for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in [[necromancy]] and the black arts. [[Cosimo Ruggeri]], in particular, was believed to be Catherine's own \"trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts\", although there is not a great deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Witchcraft prosecutions in Italy|last = Herzig|first = Tamar|publisher = Oxford|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = |editor-last = Levack}}</ref> Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe|last = Wiesner-Hanks|first = Merry|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 253}}</ref> and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.\n\nCatherine herself had been educated in [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]].

Nevertheless, Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for Witchcraft in Italy. This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled 'witches' simply because they did not act the way a woman should (humble and grateful), or simply to suit personal agendas.<ref name=\":1\" /> This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects, who labelled her \"the Italian woman\".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2010/06/history%E2%80%99s-black-widow-the-legend-of-catherine-de-medici.html|title = History's Black Widow: The Legend of Catherine de Medici|access-date = 20 February 2016|website = Wonders and Marvels|last = Gortner|first = C.

The years during which her sons reigned have been called \"the age of Catherine de' Medici\" as she had extensive, if at times varying, influence in the political life of France.<ref>Thomson, 98; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 3; Neale, ''The Age of Catherine de Medici''.</ref> \n\nShe was born in Florence to [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino|Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici, Duke of Urbino]] and  [[Madeleine de La Tour d'Auvergne]]. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, Catherine married Henry, second son of [[Francis I of France|King Francis I]] and [[Claude of France|Queen Claude of France]]. Catherine's marriage was arranged by her uncle [[Pope Clement VII]]. Henry excluded Catherine from participating in state affairs and instead showered favors on his chief mistress, [[Diane de Poitiers]], who wielded much influence over him. Henry's death thrust Catherine into the political arena as mother of the frail 15-year-old King Francis II. When Francis II died in 1560, she became regent on behalf of her 10-year-old son King Charles IX and was granted sweeping powers. From 1560 to 1563, she ruled France as [[regent]] for her son [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX, King of France]]. After Charles died in 1574, Catherine played a key role in the reign of her third son, Henry III. He dispensed with her advice only in the last months of her life (he would outlive her by seven months).\n\nCatherine's three sons reigned in an age of almost constant [[French Wars of Religion|civil and religious war in France]]. The problems facing the monarchy were complex and daunting but Catherine was able to keep the monarchy and the state institutions functioning even at a minimum level. At first, Catherine compromised and made concessions to the rebelling Calvinist Protestants, or [[Huguenots]], as they became known. She failed, however, to grasp the theological issues that drove their movement. Later she resorted, in frustration and anger, to hard-line policies against them.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 272.</ref> In return, she came to be blamed for the excessive persecutions carried out under her sons' rule, in particular for the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of 1572, in which thousands of [[Huguenot]]s were killed in Paris and throughout France.\n\nSome historians have excused Catherine from blame for the worst decisions of the crown, though evidence for her ruthlessness can be found in her letters.<ref>Knecht, 272. For a summary of the fluctuations in Catherine's historical reputation, see the preface to R. J. Knecht's ''Catherine de' Medici'', 1998: xi\u2013xiv.</ref> In practice, her authority was always limited by the effects of the civil wars. Her policies, therefore, may be seen as desperate measures to keep the [[House of Valois|Valois monarchy]] on the throne at all costs, and her patronage of the arts as an attempt to glorify a monarchy whose prestige was in steep decline.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 20.</ref> Without Catherine, it is unlikely that her sons would have remained in power.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 26.</ref> According to Mark Strage, one of her biographers, Catherine was the most powerful woman in 16th-century Europe.<ref name=\"stragexi\">Strage, Mark (1976).

Prologue, p.xi.</ref>\n\n==Birth and upbringing==\n[[File:El papa Clemente VII, por Sebastiano del Piombo.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Giulio di Giuliano de' Medici, [[Pope Clement VII]], by [[Sebastiano del Piombo]], c.1531. Clement called Catherine's betrothal to [[Henry II of France|Henry of Orl\u00e9ans]] \"the greatest match in the world\".]]\nCatherine de' Medici was born on 13 April 1519 in [[Florence]], [[Republic of Florence]], the only child of [[Lorenzo de' Medici, Duke of Urbino]], and his wife, [[Madeleine de la Tour d'Auvergne]], the countess of Boulogne. The young couple had been married the year before at [[Amboise]] as part of the alliance between King [[Francis I of France]] and Lorenzo's uncle [[Pope Leo X]] against the [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I]]. According to a contemporary chronicler, when Catherine was born, her parents were \"as pleased as if it had been a boy\".\n\nWithin a month of Catherine's birth, both her parents were dead: Madeleine died on 28 April of [[puerperal fever]] or [[plague (disease)|plague]], and Lorenzo died on 4 May,<ref name =\"kviii\"/> his title over Urbino reverting to [[Francesco Maria I della Rovere]]. King Francis wanted Catherine to be raised at the French court, but Pope Leo had other plans for her.<ref name =\"kviii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 8.</ref>\n\nCatherine was first cared for by her paternal grandmother, Alfonsina Orsini (wife of [[Piero di Lorenzo de' Medici|Piero de' Medici]]). After Alfonsina's death in 1520, Catherine joined her cousins and was raised by her aunt, [[Clarice de' Medici]]. The death of Pope Leo in 1521 briefly interrupted Medici power until Cardinal Giulio de' Medici was elected [[Pope Clement VII]] in 1523. Clement housed Catherine in the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in Florence, where she lived in state. The Florentine people called her ''duchessina'' (\"the little duchess\"), in deference to her unrecognised claim to the [[Duchy of Urbino]].<ref>Young, ''The Medici: Volume II'', 15.</ref>\n\nIn 1527, the Medici were overthrown in Florence by a faction opposed to the regime of Clement's representative, Cardinal [[Silvio Passerini]], and Catherine was taken hostage and placed in a series of convents.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 11.</ref> The final one, the ''Santissima Annuziata delle Murate'' was her home for three years. Mark Strage described these years as \"the happiest of her entire life\".<ref name=\"strage13\">Strage, pp. 13, 15</ref> Clement had no choice but to crown [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]] Holy Roman Emperor in return for his help in retaking the city.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 10\u201311.</ref> In October 1529, Charles's troops laid [[Siege of Florence (1529\u20131530)|siege to Florence]]. As the siege dragged on, voices called for Catherine to be killed and exposed naked and chained to the city walls. Some even suggested that she be handed over to the troops to be used for their sexual gratification.<ref name=\"strage15\">Strage, p.15</ref> The city finally surrendered on 12 August 1530. Clement summoned Catherine from her beloved convent to join him in Rome where he greeted her with open arms and tears in his eyes. Then he set about the business of finding her a husband.<ref name= \"kxii\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 12.</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n[[File:Henri & Catherine.jpg|thumb|right|Catherine and Henry's marriage, painted seventeen years after the event]]\nOn her visit to Rome, the Venetian envoy described Catherine as \"small of stature, and thin, and without delicate features, but having the protruding eyes peculiar to the Medici family\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', p. 14.</ref> Suitors, however, lined up for her hand, including [[James V of Scotland]] who sent the [[John Stewart, Duke of Albany|Duke of Albany]] to Clement to conclude a marriage in April and November 1530.<ref>Hay, Denys, ed., ''The Letters of James V'', HMSO (1954), p.173, 180\u20132, 189,</ref> When Francis I of France proposed his second son, [[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], in early 1533, Clement jumped at the offer. Henry was a prize catch for Catherine, who, despite her wealth, was of common origin.\n\nThe wedding, a grand affair marked by extravagant display and gift-giving,<ref name=knecht/> took place in the [[\u00c9glise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]] in [[Marseille]] on 28 October 1533.<ref>[http://www.marseille13.fr/fr/eglise-saint-ferreol-les-augustins Marseille 13: Eglise Saint-Ferr\u00e9ol les Augustins]</ref> Prince Henry danced and [[jousting|jousted]] for Catherine. The fourteen-year-old couple left their wedding ball at midnight to perform their nuptial duties. Henry arrived in the bedroom with King Francis, who is said to have stayed until the marriage was consummated. He noted that \"each had shown valour in the joust\".<ref name=knecht>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 16.</ref> Clement visited the newlyweds in bed the next morning and added his blessings to the night's proceedings.\n\nCatherine saw little of her husband in their first year of marriage, but the ladies of the court treated her well, impressed with her intelligence and keenness to please. The death of Pope Clement VII on 25 September 1534, however, undermined Catherine's standing in the French court. The next pope, [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], broke the alliance with France and refused to pay her huge dowry. King Francis lamented, \"The girl has come to me stark naked.\" Despite this, Francis quickly developed an affection for his daughter-in-law, impressed by her intelligence and affability, as well as a mutual love for hunting and outdoor activities. She became part of the inner circle of female friends known as the ''Petite Bande'', which accompanied the King on his frequent moves from residence to residence.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Medici| author=G.F. Young| publisher=Modern Library| year=1930| p=398-399}}</ref>\n\nPrince Henry showed no interest in Catherine as a wife; instead, he openly took mistresses. For the first ten years of the marriage, Catherine failed to produce any children. In 1537, [[Filippa Duci|Philippa Duci]], one of Henry's mistresses, gave birth to a daughter, whom he publicly acknowledged.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29\u201330. Henry legitimised the child under the name [[Diane de France]]; he also produced at least two sons by other women.</ref> This proved that Henry was fertile and added to the pressure on Catherine to produce a child.\n\n===Dauphine===\n[[File:Henry II, king of France.. F Clouet.jpg|thumb|170px|right|[[Henry II of France|Henry, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans]], by [[Corneille de Lyon]]. During his childhood, Henry spent almost four and a half years as a hostage in Spain, an ordeal that marked him for life, leaving him introverted and gloomy.]]\nIn 1536, Henry's older brother, [[Francis, Dauphin of France (1518-1536)|Francis]], caught a chill after a game of tennis, contracted a fever and died shortly after, leaving Henry the heir. Suspicion abounded that the Dauphin had been poisoned by Catherine to promote her husband as the heir to the French throne, especially when one of the Italian nobles who accompanied her to France, [[Sebastiano de Montecuccoli]], confessed under torture to the poisoning. Although Montecuccoli squarely placed the blame on the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V]], and never implicated Catherine, her status as a mistrusted foreigner led many in France to perceive her as guilty.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Medici| author=G.B. Young| publisher=Modern Library| year=1930| p=401}}</ref>\n\nAs [[Dauphine of France|dauphine]], Catherine was expected to provide a future heir to the throne.<ref name = \"kxxiv\">Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 29.</ref> According to the court chronicler [[Pierre de Bourdeille, seigneur de Brant\u00f4me|Brant\u00f4me]], \"many people advised the king and the [[Dauphin of France|Dauphin]] to repudiate her, since it was necessary to continue the line of France\".<ref>Knecht, 29.</ref> Divorce was discussed. In desperation, Catherine tried every known trick for getting pregnant, such as placing cow dung and ground stags' antlers on her \"source of life\", and drinking mule's urine. On 19 January 1544, she at last gave birth to a [[Francis II of France|son]], named after King Francis.\n\nAfter becoming pregnant once, Catherine had no trouble doing so again. She may have owed her change of fortune to the physician [[Jean Fernel]], who had noticed slight abnormalities in the couple's sexual organs and advised them how to solve the problem. Catherine quickly conceived again and on 2 April 1545 she bore a daughter, [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]]. She went on to bear Henry a further eight children, six of whom survived infancy, including the future [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] (born 27 June 1550); the future [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] (born 19 September 1551); and [[Francis, Duke of Anjou]] (born 18 March 1555). The long-term future of the [[House of Valois|Valois dynasty]], which had ruled France since the 14th century, seemed assured.\n\nCatherine's ability to bear children, however, failed to improve her marriage. In 1534, at the age of 15, Henry had taken as his mistress the 38-year-old [[Diane de Poitiers]], whom he adored for the rest of his life.<ref>Heritier, 38\u201342.</ref> Even so, he respected Catherine's status as his consort. When King Francis I died on 31 March 1547, Catherine became queen consort of France. She was crowned in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis|basilica of Saint-Denis]] on 10 June 1549.\n\n===Queen of France===\n[[File:KatharinavonMedici.jpg|thumb|left|Catherine de' Medici, as queen of France. \"Her mouth is too large and her eyes too prominent and colourless for beauty\", wrote a Venetian envoy as Catherine approached forty, \"but a very distinguished-looking woman, with a shapely figure, a beautiful skin and exquisitely shaped hands\".]]\nHenry allowed Catherine almost no political influence as queen.<ref>Morris, 247</ref> Although she sometimes acted as regent during his absences from France, her powers were strictly nominal.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 42\u201343.</ref> Henry gave the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau|Ch\u00e2teau of Chenonceau]], which Catherine had wanted for herself, to Diane de Poitiers, who took her place at the centre of power, dispensing patronage and accepting favours.\n[[File:Jeton en argent sur Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.jpg|thumb|Silver jeton on Catherine de'M\u00e9dici]]\n\nThe imperial ambassador reported that in the presence of guests, Henry would sit on Diane's lap and play the guitar, chat about politics, or fondle her breasts.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 38.</ref> Diane never regarded Catherine as a threat. She even encouraged the king to spend more time with Catherine and sire more children. In 1556, Catherine nearly died giving birth to twin daughters, Joan and Victoria. Surgeons saved her life by breaking the legs of Joan, who died in her womb.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 34.</ref> The surviving daughter, Victoria, died seven weeks later. Catherine had no more children.\n\nHenry's reign also saw the rise of the Guise brothers, [[Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine|Charles]], who became a [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]], and Henry's boyhood friend [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Francis]], who became [[Counts and Dukes of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. Their sister [[Mary of Guise]] had married [[James V of Scotland]] in 1538 and was the mother of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. At the age of five and a half, Mary was brought to the French court, where she was promised to the Dauphin, Francis.<ref>Guy, 46.</ref> Catherine brought her up with her own children at the French court, while Mary of Guise governed Scotland as her daughter's [[regent]].<ref>Guy, 41.</ref>\n\n[[File:Brazilian ball for Henry II in Rouen October 1 1550.jpg|thumb|\"[[France Antarctique|Brazilian ball]]\" for [[Henry II of France|Henry II]] and Catherine de' Medici in [[Rouen]], 1 October 1550, a precursor to the creation of [[France Antarctique]] in [[Brazil]].]]\nOn 3\u20134 April 1559, Henry signed the [[Italian War of 1551\u20131559|Peace of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis]] with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and England, ending a long period of [[Italian Wars]]. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine's thirteen-year-old daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] to [[Philip II of Spain]].<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 55.</ref> Their [[proxy wedding]], in Paris on 22 June 1559, was celebrated with festivities, balls, [[masque]]s, and five days of [[jousting]].\n\nKing Henry took part in the jousting, sporting Diane's black-and-white colours. He defeated the dukes of Guise and Nemours, but the young [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery]], knocked him half out of the saddle. Henry insisted on riding against Montgomery again, and this time, Montgomery's lance shattered in the king's face.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\">Pettegree, 154.</ref> Henry reeled out of the clash, his face pouring blood, with splinters \"of a good bigness\" sticking out of his eye and head. Catherine, Diane, and Prince Francis all fainted. Henry was carried to the Ch\u00e2teau de Tournelles, where five splinters of wood were extracted from his head, one of which had pierced his eye and brain. Catherine stayed by his bedside, but Diane kept away, \"for fear\", in the words of a chronicler, \"of being expelled by the Queen\". For the next ten days, Henry's state fluctuated. At times he even felt well enough to dictate letters and listen to music. Slowly, however, he lost his sight, speech, and reason, and on 10 July 1559 he died, aged 40. From that day, Catherine took a broken lance as her emblem, inscribed with the words \"''lacrymae hinc, hinc dolor''\" (\"from this come my tears and my pain\"), and wore black [[mourning]] in memory of Henry.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 56\u201358.</ref>\n\n==Queen mother==\n\n===Reign of Francis II===\n[[File:FrancoisII.jpg| thumb| upright| [[Francis II of France]], by [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], 1560. Francis found the crown so heavy at his coronation that four nobles had to hold it in place as he walked up the steps to his throne.<ref>Guy, 102\u20133.</ref>]]\n\n[[Francis II of France|Francis II]] became king at the age of fifteen. In what has been called a ''[[coup d'\u00e9tat]]'', the Cardinal of Lorraine and the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]]\u2014whose niece, [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], had married Francis II the year before\u2014seized power the day after Henry II's death and quickly moved themselves into the [[Louvre Palace]] with the young couple.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 59.</ref> The English ambassador reported a few days later that \"the house of Guise ruleth and doth all about the French king\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 60.</ref> For the moment, Catherine worked with the Guises out of necessity. She was not strictly entitled to a role in Francis's government, because he was deemed old enough to rule for himself.<ref>Morris, 248.</ref> Nevertheless, all his official acts began with the words: \"This being the good pleasure of the Queen, my lady-mother, and I also approving of every opinion that she holdeth, am content and command that&nbsp;...\". Catherine did not hesitate to exploit her new authority. One of her first acts was to force Diane de Poitiers to hand over the crown jewels and return the [[Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]] to the crown. She later did her best to efface or outdo Diane's building work there.\n\nThe Guise brothers set about persecuting the Protestants with zeal. Catherine adopted a moderate stance and spoke against the Guise persecutions, though she had no particular sympathy for the Huguenots, whose beliefs she never shared. The Protestants looked for leadership first to [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], the [[First Prince of the Blood]], and then, with more success, to his brother, [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], who backed a plot to overthrow the Guises by force.<ref>Holt, 38\u201339.</ref> When the Guises heard of the plot,<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 64; Holt, 44. The incident was known later as the [[Amboise conspiracy|\"tumult\" or conspiracy of Amboise]].</ref> they moved the court to the fortified [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]]. The Duke of Guise launched an attack into the woods around the ch\u00e2teau. His troops surprised the rebels and killed many of them on the spot, including the commander, La Renaudie.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 282.</ref> Others they drowned in the river or strung up around the battlements while Catherine and the court watched.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 65\u201366.</ref>\n\nIn June 1560, [[Michel de l'H\u00f4pital]] was appointed [[List of Justice Ministers of France|Chancellor of France]]. He sought the support of France's constitutional bodies and worked closely with Catherine to defend the law in the face of the growing anarchy.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 32.</ref> Neither saw the need to punish Protestants who worshipped in private and did not take up arms. On 20 August 1560, Catherine and the chancellor advocated this policy to an assembly of notables at [[Ch\u00e2teau de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]]. Historians regard the occasion as an early example of Catherine's statesmanship. Meanwhile, Cond\u00e9 raised an army and in autumn 1560 began attacking towns in the south. Catherine ordered him to court and had him imprisoned as soon as he arrived. He was tried in November, found guilty of offences against the crown, and sentenced to death. His life was saved by the illness and death of the king, as a result of an infection or an [[abscess]] in his ear.<ref>Knecht, 72; Guy, 119.</ref>\n\nWhen Catherine had realized Francis was going to die, she made a pact with Antoine de Bourbon by which he would renounce his right to the regency of the future king, [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]], in return for the release of his brother Cond\u00e9.<ref>Pettegree, 154; Hoogvliet, 105. The regency was traditionally the preserve of the princes of the blood.</ref> As a result, when Francis died on 5 December 1560, the Privy Council appointed Catherine as governor of France (''gouvernante de France''), with sweeping powers. She wrote to her daughter Elisabeth: \"My principal aim is to have the honour of God before my eyes in all things and to preserve my authority, not for myself, but for the conservation of this kingdom and for the good of all your brothers\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 73.</ref>\n\n===Reign of Charles IX===\n[[File:Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - Portrait de Charles IX - Fran\u00e7ois Clouet - Inv.1012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles IX of France]], after [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]], c. 1565. The Venetian ambassador Giovanni Michiel described Charles as \"an admirable child, with fine eyes, gracious movements, though he is not robust. He favours physical exercise that is too violent for his health, for he suffers from shortness of breath\".]]\n\nAt first Catherine kept the nine-year-old king, who cried at his coronation, close to her, and slept in his chamber. She presided over his council, decided policy, and controlled state business and patronage. However, she was never in a position to control the country as a whole, which was on the brink of civil war. In many parts of France the rule of nobles held sway rather than that of the crown. The challenges Catherine faced were complex and in some ways difficult for her to comprehend as a foreigner.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 28.</ref>\n\nShe summoned church leaders from both sides to attempt to solve their doctrinal differences. Despite her optimism, the resulting [[Colloquy of Poissy]] ended in failure on 13 October 1561, dissolving itself without her permission.<ref>Manetsch, 22.</ref> Catherine failed because she saw the religious divide only in political terms. In the words of historian R. J. Knecht, \"she underestimated the strength of religious conviction, imagining that all would be well if only she could get the party leaders to agree\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 80.</ref> In January 1562, Catherine issued the tolerant [[Edict of Saint-Germain]] in a further attempt to build bridges with the Protestants.<ref>Knecht, ''Renaissance France'', 311; Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 11\u201312. The edict, also known as the Edict of Toleration and the Edict of January, was significant for effectively recognising the existence of Protestant churches and permitting their worship outside city walls.</ref> On 1 March 1562, however, in an incident known as the [[Massacre of Vassy]], the Duke of Guise and his men attacked worshipping Huguenots in a barn at [[Wassy|Vassy (Wassy)]], killing 74 and wounding 104.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 87.</ref> Guise, who called the massacre \"a regrettable accident\", was cheered as a hero in the streets of Paris while the Huguenots called for revenge. The massacre lit the fuse that sparked the [[French Wars of Religion]]. For the next thirty years, France found itself in a state of either civil war or armed truce.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 140.</ref>\n\nWithin a month [[Louis, Prince of Cond\u00e9 (1530\u20131569)|Louis de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9]], and [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Gaspard de Coligny]] had raised an army of 1,800. They formed an alliance with England and seized town after town in France. Catherine met Coligny, but he refused to back down. She therefore told him: \"Since you rely on your forces, we will show you ours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 89.</ref> The royal army struck back quickly and laid siege to Huguenot-held [[Rouen]]. Catherine visited the deathbed of [[Antoine of Navarre|Antoine de Bourbon, King of Navarre]], after he was fatally wounded by an [[arquebus]] shot. Catherine insisted on visiting the field herself and when warned of the dangers laughed, \"My courage is as great as yours\".<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 90.</ref> The Catholics took Rouen, but their triumph was short lived. On 18 February 1563, a spy called [[Jean de Poltrot|Poltrot de M\u00e9r\u00e9]] fired an arquebus into the back of the [[Francis, Duke of Guise|Duke of Guise]], at the siege of Orl\u00e9ans.

She also met her daughter [[Elisabeth of Valois|Elisabeth]] at [[Bayonne]] near the Spanish border, amidst lavish [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|court festivities]]. [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] excused himself from the occasion. He sent the [[Fernando \u00c1lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba|Duke of Alba]] to tell Catherine to scrap the Edict of Amboise and to find punitive solutions to the problem of heresy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 104, 107\u20138.</ref>\n\nIn 1566, through the ambassador to the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Guillaume de Grandchamp de Grantrie]], and because of a long-standing [[Franco-Ottoman alliance]], Charles and Catherine proposed to the Ottoman Court a plan to resettle French [[Huguenots]] and French and German [[Lutherans]] in Ottoman-controlled [[Moldavia]], in order to create a military colony and a buffer against the [[Habsburg]].

Nevertheless, the [[Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], signed on 8 August 1570 because the royal army ran out of cash, conceded wider toleration to the Huguenots than ever before.<ref>Wood, 28.</ref>\n\nCatherine looked to further Valois interests by grand dynastic marriages. In 1570, Charles IX married [[Elisabeth of Austria (1554-1592)|Elisabeth of Austria]], daughter of [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Catherine was also eager for a match between one of her two youngest sons and [[Elizabeth I of England]].<ref>Holt, 77.</ref> After Catherine's daughter Elisabeth died in childbirth in 1568, she had touted her youngest daughter [[Margaret of Valois|Margaret]] as a bride for [[Philip II of Spain]]. Now she sought a marriage between Margaret and [[Henry III of Navarre]], Jeanne' son, with the aim of uniting Valois and Bourbon interests. Margaret, however, was secretly involved with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise|Henry of Guise]], the son of the late Duke of Guise. When Catherine found this out, she had her daughter brought from her bed. Catherine and the king then beat her, ripping her nightclothes and pulling out handfuls of her hair.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 135.</ref>\n\nCatherine pressed Jeanne d'Albret to attend court. Writing that she wanted to see Jeanne's children, she promised not to harm them. Jeanne replied: \"Pardon me if, reading that, I want to laugh, because you want to relieve me of a fear that I've never had. I've never thought that, as they say, you eat little children\".<ref>Bryson, 282.</ref> When Jeanne did come to court, Catherine pressured her hard,<ref>Jeanne d'Albret wrote to her son, Henry: \"I am not free to talk with either the King or Madame, only the Queen Mother, who goads me [''me traite \u00e1 la fourche'']&nbsp;... You have doubtless realized that their main object, my son, is to separate you from God, and from me\". Quoted by Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 148\u201349.</ref> playing on Jeanne's hopes for her beloved son. Jeanne finally agreed to the marriage between her son and Margaret, so long as Henry could remain a Huguenot. When Jeanne arrived in Paris to buy clothes for the wedding, she was taken ill and died on 9 June 1572, aged forty-three. Huguenot writers later accused Catherine of murdering her with poisoned gloves.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 151. An autopsy revealed tuberculosis and an abscess.</ref> The wedding took place on 18 August 1572 at [[Notre-Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame]], Paris.\n\n====St. Bartholomew's Day massacre====\nThree days later, [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Admiral Coligny]] was walking back to his rooms from the Louvre when a shot rang out from a house and wounded him in the hand and arm.<ref>Sutherland, ''Massacre of St Bartholomew'', 313.</ref> A smoking arquebus was discovered in a window, but the culprit had made his escape from the rear of the building on a waiting horse.<ref>Holt, 83.

Catherine, who was said to have received the news without emotion, made a tearful visit to Coligny and promised to punish his attacker. Many historians have blamed Catherine for the attack on Coligny. Others point to the Guise family or a Spanish-papal plot to end Coligny's influence on the king.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 154\u201357. Coligny was lobbying the king to intervene against the empire in the Netherlands.<br />\u2022 The Duke of Anjou was later reported as saying that he and Catherine had planned the assassination with Anne d'Este, who longed to avenge her husband, [[Francis, Duke of Guise]].<br />\u2022 For an overview of historians' various interpretations, see Holt, 83\u20134.</ref> Whatever the truth, the bloodbath that followed was soon beyond the control of Catherine or any other leader.<ref>Pettegree, 159\u201360.</ref>\n\nThe [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]], which began two days later, has stained Catherine's reputation ever since.<ref name=\"Pettegree, 154\"/> There is reason to believe she was party to the decision when on 23 August Charles IX is said to have ordered, \"Then kill them all!

It is almost certain, however, that when Charles gave the order \"Kill them all!\", he meant those drawn up on a list by Catherine, and not, as has often been claimed, all Huguenots.</ref> Historians have suggested that Catherine and her advisers expected a Huguenot uprising to avenge the attack on Coligny. They chose therefore to strike first and wipe out the Huguenot leaders while they were still in Paris after the wedding.<ref>Holt, 84.</ref>\n\nThe slaughter in Paris lasted for almost a week. It spread to many parts of France, where it persisted into the autumn. In the words of historian [[Jules Michelet]], \"St Bartholomew was not a day, but a season\".<ref>Quoted by Morris, 252.</ref> On 29 September, when Navarre knelt before the altar as a Roman Catholic, having converted to avoid being killed, Catherine turned to the ambassadors and laughed. From this time dates the legend of the wicked Italian queen. Huguenot writers branded Catherine a scheming Italian, who had acted on [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli|Machiavelli]]'s principles to kill all enemies in one blow.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 163\u201364; Heller, 117; Manetsch, 60\u201361.

As [[Henry III of France|Henry III]], he often showed more interest in pious devotions than in government.]]\n\n===Reign of Henry III===\nTwo years later, Catherine faced a new crisis with the death of Charles IX at the age of twenty-three. His dying words were \"oh, my mother&nbsp;...\" The day before he died, he named Catherine regent, since his brother and heir, Henry the Duke of Anjou, was in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], where he had been elected [[List of Polish monarchs#Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|king]] the year before. However, three months after his coronation at [[Wawel Cathedral]], Henry abandoned that throne and returned to France in order to become king of France. Catherine wrote to Henry of Charles IX's death: \"I am grief-stricken to have witnessed such a scene and the love which he showed me at the end&nbsp;... My only consolation is to see you here soon, as your kingdom requires, and in good health, for if I were to lose you, I would have myself buried alive with you.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 172.</ref>\n\nHenry was Catherine's favourite son. Unlike his brothers, he came to the throne as a grown man. He was also healthier, though he suffered from weak lungs and constant fatigue. His interest in the tasks of government, however, proved fitful. He depended on Catherine and her team of secretaries until the last few weeks of her life. He often hid from state affairs, immersing himself in acts of piety, such as [[pilgrimage]]s and [[flagellation]].<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 232, 240, 247.</ref>\n\nHenry married [[Louise de Lorraine-Vaud\u00e9mont]] in February 1575, two days after his coronation. His choice thwarted Catherine's plans for a political marriage to a foreign princess. Rumours of Henry's inability to produce children were by that time in wide circulation. The papal [[nuncio]] Salviati observed, \"it is only with difficulty that we can imagine there will be offspring&nbsp;... physicians and those who know him well say that he has an extremely weak constitution and will not live long.\" As time passed and the likelihood of children from the marriage receded, Catherine's youngest son, [[Francis, Duke of Anjou|Francis, Duke of Alen\u00e7on]], known as \"Monsieur\", played upon his role as heir to the throne, repeatedly exploiting the anarchy of the civil wars, which were by now as much about noble power struggles as religion.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 22.</ref> Catherine did all in her power to bring Francis back into the fold. On one occasion, in March 1578, she lectured him for six hours about his dangerously subversive behaviour.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 205.</ref>\n\nIn 1576, in a move that endangered Henry's throne, Francis allied with the Protestant princes against the crown.<ref>Holt, 104.</ref> On 6 May 1576, Catherine gave in to almost all Huguenot demands in the [[Edict of Beaulieu]]. The treaty became known as the ''Peace of Monsieur'' because it was thought that Francis had forced it on the crown.<ref>Holt, 105\u20136; Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 186.</ref> Francis died of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] in June 1584, after a disastrous intervention in the Low Countries during which his army had been massacred.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 212\u201313.</ref> Catherine wrote, the next day: \"I am so wretched to live long enough to see so many people die before me, although I realize that God's will must be obeyed, that He owns everything, and that He lends us only for as long as He likes the children whom He gives us.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 217.</ref> The death of her youngest son was a calamity for Catherine's dynastic dreams.

Margaret, however, became almost as much of a thorn in Catherine's side as Francis, and in 1582, she returned to the French court without her husband. Catherine was heard yelling at her for taking lovers. Catherine sent [[Pomponne de Belli\u00e8vre]] to Navarre to arrange Margaret's return. In 1585, Margaret fled Navarre again. She retreated to her property at [[Agen]] and begged her mother for money. Catherine sent her only enough \"to put food on her table\". Moving on to the fortress of Carlat, Margaret took a lover called d'Aubiac. Catherine asked Henry to act before Margaret brought shame on them again. In October 1586, therefore, he had Margaret locked up in the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Usson]]. D'Aubiac was executed, though not, despite Catherine's wish, in front of Margaret.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 254\u201355.</ref> Catherine cut Margaret out of her will and never saw her again.\n\nCatherine was unable to control Henry in the way she had Francis and Charles.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 189.</ref> Her role in his government became that of chief executive and roving diplomat. She travelled widely across the kingdom, enforcing his authority and trying to head off war. In 1578, she took on the task of pacifying the south. At the age of fifty-nine, she embarked on an eighteen-month journey around the south of France to meet Huguenot leaders face to face. Her efforts won Catherine new respect from the French people.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 209.</ref> On her return to Paris in 1579, she was greeted outside the city by the Parlement and crowds. The Venetian ambassador, Gerolamo Lipomanno, wrote: \"She is an indefatigable princess, born to tame and govern a people as unruly as the French: they now recognize her merits, her concern for unity and are sorry not to have appreciated her sooner.\"<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 200.</ref> She was under no illusions, however.

After the Edict of Beaulieu, they had started forming local leagues to protect their religion.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 185.</ref> The death of the heir to the throne in 1584 prompted the Duke of Guise to assume the leadership of the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]]. He planned to block Henry of Navarre's succession and place Henry's Catholic uncle [[Charles, Cardinal de Bourbon|Cardinal Charles de Bourbon]] on the throne instead. In this cause, he recruited the great Catholic princes, nobles and prelates, signed the [[treaty of Joinville]] with Spain, and prepared to make war on the \"heretics\".<ref>Pettegree, 164.</ref> By 1585, Henry III had no choice but to go to war against the League.<ref>Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 255.</ref> As Catherine put it, \"peace is carried on a stick\" (''b\u00e2ton porte paix'').<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 249.</ref> \"Take care\", she wrote to the king, \"especially about your person.

Catherine, in bed with a lung infection, had been kept in the dark.<ref>Henry wrote a note to Villeroy, which began: \"Villeroy, I remain very well contented with your service; do not fail however to go away to your house where you will stay until I send for you; do not seek the reason for this my letter, but obey me.\" Sutherland, ''Secretaries of State'', 300\u20133.</ref> The king's actions effectively ended her days of power.\n\nAt the meeting of the Estates, Henry thanked Catherine for all she had done.

At the same moment, eight members of the Guise family were rounded up, including the Duke of Guise's brother, [[Louis II, Cardinal of Guise]], whom Henry's men hacked to death the next day in the palace dungeons.<ref>Pettegree, 165.</ref> Immediately after the murder of Guise, Henry entered Catherine's bedroom on the floor below and announced, \"Please forgive me.

In an age of civil war and declining respect for the monarchy, she sought to bolster royal prestige through lavish cultural display. Once in control of the royal purse, she launched a programme of artistic patronage that lasted for three decades. During this time, she presided over a distinctive late [[French Renaissance]] culture in all branches of the arts.<ref>Knecht, 220.</ref>\n\nAn [[inventory]] drawn up at the [[H\u00f4tel de la Reine]] after Catherine's death shows her to have been a keen collector. Listed works of art included [[tapestry|tapestries]], hand-drawn maps, sculptures, rich fabrics, [[ebony]] furniture inlaid with [[ivory]], sets of china, and [[Limoges]] pottery.<ref>Knecht, 240\u201341.</ref> There were also hundreds of portraits, for which a vogue had developed during Catherine's lifetime. Many portraits in her collection were by [[Jean Clouet]] (1480\u20131541) and his son [[Fran\u00e7ois Clouet]] ({{circa|1510}}{{snd}}1572). Fran\u00e7ois Clouet drew and painted portraits of all Catherine's family and of many members of the court.<ref>Dimier, 205\u20136.</ref> After Catherine's death, a decline in the quality of French portraiture set in. By 1610, the school patronised by the late Valois court and brought to its pinnacle by Fran\u00e7ois Clouet had all but died out.<ref>Dimier, 308\u201319; Jollet, 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nBeyond portraiture, little is known about the painting at Catherine de' Medici's court.<ref name=\"biic\"/> In the last two decades of her life, only two painters stand out as recognisable personalities: [[Jean Cousin the Younger]] ({{circa|lk=no|1522|1594}}), few of whose works survive, and [[Antoine Caron]] ({{circa|lk=no|1521}}{{snd}}1599), who became Catherine's official painter after working at [[Fontainebleau]] under [[Francesco Primaticcio|Primaticcio]]. Caron's vivid [[Mannerism]], with its love of ceremonial and its preoccupation with massacres, reflects the neurotic atmosphere of the French court during the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]].<ref>Blunt calls Caron's style \"perhaps the purest known type of Mannerism in its elegant form, appropriate to an exquisite but neurotic society.\" Blunt, 98, 100.</ref>\n\nMany of Caron's paintings, such as those of the ''Triumphs of the Seasons'', are of [[allegory|allegorical]] subjects that echo the [[Catherine de' Medici's court festivals|festivities]] for which Catherine's court was famous. His designs for the [[Valois Tapestries]] celebrate the ''f\u00eates,'' picnics, and mock battles of the \"magnificent\" entertainments hosted by Catherine. They depict events held at Fontainebleau in 1564; at [[Bayonne]] in 1565 for the summit meeting with the Spanish court; and at the [[Tuileries Palace|Tuileries]] in 1573 for the visit of the Polish ambassadors who presented the Polish crown to Catherine's son [[Henry III of France|Henry of Anjou]].<ref name = \"biic\">Blunt, 98.</ref>\n\n[[File:Ballet 1582.png|thumb|200px|upright|The ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]],'' from a 1582 engraving by Jacques Patin]]\nThe musical shows in particular allowed Catherine to express her creative gifts. They were usually dedicated to the ideal of peace in the realm and based on [[Mythology|mythological]] themes. To create the necessary dramas, music, and scenic effects for these events, Catherine employed the leading artists and architects of the day. Historian Frances Yates has called her \"a great creative artist in festivals.\"<ref>Yates, 68.</ref> Catherine gradually introduced changes to the traditional entertainments: for example, she increased the prominence of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. A distinctive new art form, the ''[[ballets de cour|ballet de cour]],'' emerged from these creative advances.<ref>Yates, 51; Strong, 102, 121\u201322.</ref> Owing to its synthesis of dance, music, verse, and setting, the production of the ''[[Ballet Comique de la Reine]]'' in 1581 is regarded by scholars as the first authentic ballet.<ref>Lee, 44.</ref>\n\nCatherine de' Medici's great love among the arts was architecture. \"As the daughter of the Medici,\" suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, \"she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.\"<ref>Babelon, 263.</ref> After Henry II's death, Catherine set out to immortalise her husband's memory and to enhance the grandeur of the Valois monarchy through a series of costly building projects.<ref>Sutherland, ''Ancien R\u00e9gime'', 6.</ref> These included work on ch\u00e2teaux at Montceaux-en-Brie, [[Saint-Maur-des-Foss\u00e9s]], and Chenonceau. Catherine built two new palaces in Paris: the Tuileries and the H\u00f4tel de la Reine. She was closely involved in the planning and supervising of all her architectural schemes.<ref>Knecht, 228.</ref>\n\nCatherine had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings.<ref>Knecht, 223.</ref> Poets lauded her as the new Artemisia, after [[Artemisia II of Caria]], who built the [[Mausoleum of Maussollos|Mausoleum]] at [[Halicarnassus]] as a tomb for her dead husband.<ref>Hoogvliet, 108.</ref> As the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel, she commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry at the basilica of Saint Denis. It was designed by [[Francesco Primaticcio]] (1504\u20131570), with sculpture by Germain Pilon (1528\u20131590). Art historian Henri Zerner has called this monument \"the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance.\"<ref name = \"zccclxxvix\">Zerner, 379.</ref> Catherine also commissioned [[Germain Pilon]] to carve the marble sculpture that contains Henry II's heart. A poem by Ronsard, engraved on its base, tells the reader not to wonder that so small a vase can hold so large a heart, since Henry's real heart resides in Catherine's breast.<ref>Hoogvliet, 111. Ronsard may be referring to Artemisia, who drank the ashes of her dead husband, which became part of her own body.</ref>\n\nAlthough Catherine spent ruinous sums on the arts,<ref>Thomson, 168.</ref> most of her patronage left no permanent legacy.<ref>Knecht, ''Catherine de' Medici'', 244.</ref> The end of the Valois dynasty so soon after her death brought a change in priorities.\n\n[[File:COA french queen Catherine de M\u00e9dicis.svg|thumb|Coat of arms]]\n\n=== Culinary legend ===\nThe legend that de' Medici introduced a long list of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time is a myth routinely discredited by most food historians.<ref name=\"Davidson2014\">{{cite book|author=Alan Davidson|title=The Oxford Companion to Food|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RL6LAwAAQBAJ|edition=2nd|date=11 August 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-967733-7|page=232}}</ref> Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner [[fork]], [[parsley]], the [[artichoke]], [[lettuce]], [[broccoli]], the [[garden pea]], [[pasta]], [[Parmesan]], as well as the [[turkey (bird)|turkey]] and [[tomato]] of the [[New World]].

In fact, a large population of Italians\u2014bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including [[Leonardo da Vinci]]\u2014had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning [[Renaissance]]. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.\n\nThe earliest known reference to Catherine as the popularizer of Italian culinary innovation is the entry for \"cuisine\" in [[Diderot]] and [[d\u2019Alembert]]\u2019s ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' published in 1754, which describes [[haute cuisine]] as decadent and effeminate and explains that fussy sauces and fancy fricassees arrived in France via \"that crowd of corrupt Italians who served at the court of Catherine de\u2019 Medici.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Diderot|first1=Denis|last2=le Rond d'Alembert|first2=Jean|title=Encyclop\u00e9die, ou dictionnaire raisonn\u00e9 des sciences, des arts et des m\u00e9tiers|date=1754|publisher=Briasson, David, Le Breton and Durand|location=Paris|page=vol.

[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] was treated with similar suspicion\u2014she too entertained questionable characters (such as her advisor, [[John Dee]]), and produced no official heir. Essentially, however, there exists no concrete proof that either woman took part in the occult, and it is now believed that Catherine's trouble in providing an heir was in fact due to [[Henry II of France|Henry II]]'s penile deformity.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The \"infertility\" of Catherine de Medici and its influence on 16th century France|last = Gordetsky, Rabinowitz and O'Brien|volume = 16|issue = 2|journal = The Canadian Journal of Urology|year = 2009|pages = 4584\u20138|url = https://www.canjurol.com/pdfs/DrGordetsky.pdf|pmid = 19364432}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Catherine de Medici's alleged talisman.jpg|thumb|The talisman Nostradamus allegedly made for Catherine de' Medici|276x276px]]\nSuspicion was fuelled to some degree by her entertainment of questionable characters at court\u2014for example, the reputed seer [[Nostradamus]], who was rumoured to have created a [[talisman]] for Catherine, made from a mixture of metals, goat blood and human blood. Catherine also gave patronage to the Ruggeri brothers, who were renowned astrologers, but were also known for their involvement in [[necromancy]] and the black arts. [[Cosimo Ruggeri]], in particular, was believed to be Catherine's own \"trusted necromancer, and specialist in the dark arts\", although there is not a great deal of surviving documentation to tell of his life. Though some suggest that they were simply magicians, for many living in Italy at the time, the distinction between 'magician' and 'witch' was unclear.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Witchcraft prosecutions in Italy|last = Herzig|first = Tamar|publisher = Oxford|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = |editor-last = Levack}}</ref> Entertaining individuals that appeared to subvert the natural religious order during the most intense period of witch hunting<ref>{{Cite book|title = Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe|last = Wiesner-Hanks|first = Merry|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2012|isbn = |location = |pages = 253}}</ref> and a time of great religious conflict was therefore an easy way to arouse suspicion.\n\nCatherine herself had been educated in [[astrology]] and [[astronomy]].

Nevertheless, Catherine was never formally accused or prosecuted despite the fact that her reign experienced the greatest number of prosecutions for Witchcraft in Italy. This lends some weight to the suggestion that people were labelled 'witches' simply because they did not act the way a woman should (humble and grateful), or simply to suit personal agendas.<ref name=\":1\" /> This may be particularly true for Catherine as an Italian woman ruling in France; several historians argue that she was disliked by her French subjects, who labelled her \"the Italian woman\".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.wondersandmarvels.com/2010/06/history%E2%80%99s-black-widow-the-legend-of-catherine-de-medici.html|title = History's Black Widow: The Legend of Catherine de Medici|access-date = 20 February 2016|website = Wonders and Marvels|last = Gortner|first = C.

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

The torch is depicted on both the NYU seal and the more abstract NYU logo, designed in 1965 by renowned graphic designer [[Tom Geismar]] of the branding and design firm [[Chermayeff & Geismar]]. There are at least two versions of the possible origin of the university color, [[Violet (color)|violet]]. Some believe that it may have been chosen because [[Violet (plant)|violets]] are said to have grown abundantly in Washington Square and around the buttresses of the Old University Building. Others argue that the color may have been adopted because the violet was the flower associated with [[Athens]], the center of learning in [[ancient Greece]].\n\n===Cultural setting===\n[[Washington Square Park|Washington Square]] and [[Greenwich Village]] have been hubs of [[cultural learning|cultural life]] in New York City since the early 19th century. Much of this culture has intersected with NYU at various points in its history. [[Artist]]s of the [[Hudson River School]], the United States' first prominent school of painters, settled around Washington Square. [[Samuel F.B. Morse]], a noted artist who also pioneered the telegraph and created the Morse Code, served as the first chair of Painting and Sculpture. He and [[Daniel Huntington (artist)|Daniel Huntington]] were early tenants of the Old University Building in the mid-19th century. (The university rented out studio space and residential apartments within the \"academic\" building.) As a result, they had notable interaction with the cultural and academic life of the university.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/>\n\nIn the 1870s, sculptors [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] and [[Daniel Chester French]] lived and worked near the Square. By the 1920s, [[Washington Square Park]] was nationally recognized as a focal point for artistic and moral rebellion. As such, the Washington Square campus became more diverse and bustled with urban energy, contributing to academic change at NYU.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> Famed residents of this time include [[Eugene O'Neill]], [[John French Sloan|John Sloan]], and [[Maurice Prendergast]]. In the 1930s, the abstract expressionists [[Jackson Pollock]] and [[Willem de Kooning]], and the realists [[Edward Hopper]] and [[Thomas Hart Benton (painter)|Thomas Hart Benton]] had studios around Washington Square. In the 1960s the area became one of the centers of the beat and folk generation, when [[Allen Ginsberg]] and [[Bob Dylan]] settled there. This led to tension with the university, which at the time was in the midst of an aggressive facilities expansion phase.<ref name=\"nyuandvillage\"/> In 1975, the university opened The [[Grey Art Gallery]] at 100 Washington Square East, housing the NYU art collection and featuring museum quality exhibitions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/collection/collection.html|title=Home -

Much of the area is traditionally dedicated to fishing and agriculture. Today, it is also an oil-producing area with the mostly oil-dedicated port of [[Dos Bocas (port)|Dos Bocas]]. There is also some tourism connected to the area's beaches and natural attractions, and the area is promoted under the state's Cacao Route tourism program.\n\n==The town==\nThe town of Para\u00edso is located on the coast of Tabasco, 75&nbsp;km north of the capital of Villahermosa.<ref name=\"laregion\">{{cite web |url= http://www.laregion.com.mx/tabasco/guia/municipios/paraiso.php |title=La Guia de Para\u00edso |year=2002 |publisher= |location= La Regi\u00f3n newspaper Editorial Cibern\u00e9tica de M\u00e9xico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Para\u00edso Guide |accessdate=January 8, 2012 }}</ref>  Although one of its important economic activities is tourism, the center of the town has not been overwhelmed with hotels and other tourist oriented businesses.

The municipality does not have a coat-of-arms.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nThe town of Para\u00edso was most likely founded sometime between 1848 and 1852 as a camp by indigenous people in the Mecoac\u00e1n area and then later occupied by [[mestizo]]s from [[Jalpa de M\u00e9ndez (municipality)|Jalpa de M\u00e9ndez]] and [[Comalcalco (municipality)|Comalcalco]]. However, local writer \u00c1ngel Su\u00e1rez Rodr\u00edguez asserts that it was founded in 1823 when the ranch of the same name was declared a town. It is true that in this year a church dedicated to Mark the Evangelist and the Virgin of the Assumption was built on the ranch.<ref name=\"mexdes\"/><ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nFrom the 19th century on, much of the area was dedicated to the production of [[cacao tree|cacao]] and fruit trees. During this same time, it was a [[Reform War|Liberal or federalist stronghold]] even having its own radical guerrilla army known as \u201cLos Cangrejos y Pejelagartos\u201d (Crabs and Pejalagarto fish). However, the town declined in the latter part of the century and by 1872 there were only four permanent houses.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nDuring the [[Mexican Revolution]], General Ignacio Gutierrez Gomez took the town in 1911. It was taken again in 1914 by Generals Carlos Greene Ramirez and Ramon Sosa Torres.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nAfter the war, the city grew sufficiently that in 1945 it was declared a city by Tabasco governor [[No\u00e9 de la Flor Casanova]].<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==Geography and environment==\n[[File:VaraderoBeach15.JPG|250px|thumb|Varadero Beach]]\nThe land is part of the Tabasco floodplain on the Gulf of Mexico with an average elevation of only two meters above sea level. It is flat with a slight incline towards the sea. The soil is sandy with some clay mixed nearest the ocean with clay dominating inland. Due to its low-lying nature and climate, the area has abundant surface water in the forms of lagoons, lakes, estuaries and wetlands. Major bodies of water include lakes and lagoons such as Mecoac\u00e1n, La Machona, Tupilco, Puente de Osti\u00f3n, La Encerrada (Amatillo), Tres Palmas, El Zorro, Arrastradero, Las Flores, Lagartera Tilapa, Manat\u00ed and El Eslab\u00f3n. The last receives its waters from the Gonzalez River as it empties into the Gulf. Other rivers and streams include the Seco, El Corcho, Tupilco, Cocohital, El Corinto, Arroyo Verde and Arroyo Verde.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nSurface water flow in the municipality is split into east and west, both connected by the R\u00edo Seco River and the Jobo Canal. The east is dominated by the Mecoac\u00e1n lagoon which opens into the Gulf of Mexico at Dos Bocas. Linked to it are smaller lagoons such as the Eslab\u00f3n, La Tinaja and El Carmen/Ram\u00edrez.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/> The [[Mecoac\u00e1n Lagoon]] and estuary is a shallow area with an average depth of 1.5 meters and a total extension of 5,160 hectares. Mecoac\u00e1n is considered to be the second most important lagoon system in Tabasco with extensive oyster banks below bordered by mangrove areas which have been reduced through timber exploitation. The seaward side is formed by a chain of small islands at the mouth of the river with the largest three km in length.<ref name=\"eperez\">{{cite journal |last=P\u00e9rez S\u00e1nchez |first=Eunice |author2=James F.

There are also two small lakes such as the Los Angeles. The Gonz\u00e1lez River is the principal river on the east side, which forms the border with Centla municipality. It forms the Estero Lagoon before emptying into the sea at the Chiltepec. The west also has the Arrastradero Lagoon, which receives fresh water from various small streams such as El Tiger. It connects to a smaller lagoon called Las Flores. The Tres Palmas Lake extends to the north-south, widest in the north. It receives water from the Soledad River. Other lakes include Puente de Ostion, Tupilquillo and T\u00eda Juana.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\nThe climate is hot and wet with rains year round, especially in the summer/fall with an average annual rainfall of 1,751.4&nbsp;mm.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/> Flooding is a common problem with the last major flooding emergency declared in October 2011.<ref name=\"segob\">{{cite news |title=Declara Segob emergencia para Comalcalco y Para\u00edso, Tabasco |newspaper=NOTIMEX |location=Mexico |date=October 25, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Segob declares emergency for Comalcalco and Para\u00edso Tabasco }}</ref> The coldest months are November, December and January with average temperatures around 22&nbsp;\u00b0C.

Soils near the ocean tend to be saline. Most of the municipality has perennial rainforest with trees between fifteen and thirty meters tall. However, most of these areas are disturbed with none virgin. In the low ocean front areas there are beaches and mangroves. There is the occasional nopal cactus. Wildlife is mostly limited to bird and reptile species such as [[stork]]s, [[kingfisher]]s, seagulls, buzzards, marine and freshwater turtles, and various small lizards.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:VaraderoBeach25.JPG|thumb|250px|Oil rigs and tanker off the coast of the municipality]]\nThe municipality has 57,755 hectares of land with 17% used for agriculture, 16% for livestock, 12% forest and 55% is residential/urban, wetlands or bodies of water. The municipality has an annual agricultural, industrial, arts and crafts fair in April. About thirty three percent of the working population is employed in agriculture and fishing. The most important crop in the municipality is [[coconut]] as the number one producer in the state, accounting for over sixty percent of cropland. Other important crops include cacao and bananas. Corn and beans are generally grown in small plots for family consumption. Livestock is not an important economic product although some cattle, pigs and domestic fowl is raised. There are still some tropical hardwood trees such as mahogany which is mostly used to make furniture.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/> Fishing occurs in both ocean and fresh waters catching sea bass, shrimp and shellfish. It is a major producer and distributor of oysters and lately of edible jellyfish, most of which is farmed.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/> However, fishing has been threatened by a number of factors.

Oil drilling is mostly done in two fields: Puerto Ceiba Mesozoico and Puerto Ceiba Terciario, each with two wells. These produce over two thousand barrels daily along with 1.2 million cubic feet of natural gas. Most manufacturing is small concerns which produce corn flour, chocolate, ice, clothing, cinderblock and tortillas. The production of fiberglass is an important source of employment. Handcrafts include figures from dried coconuts and seashells as well as hammocks.<ref name=\"encmuc\"/>\n[[File:Paraiso.Puerto Ceiba.jpg|250px|thumb|Kayak's in Puerto Ceiba.]]\nOil spills both on land and in the ocean have been problematic not only for fishing but for tourism as well.

Major bodies of water include lakes and lagoons such as Mecoac\u00e1n, La Machona, Tupilco, Puente de Osti\u00f3n, La Encerrada (Amatillo), Tres Palmas, El Zorro, Arrastradero, Las Flores, Lagartera Tilapa, Manat\u00ed and El Eslab\u00f3n.

Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices.

However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger.

Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).

However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health.

He pioneered the capture and study of live sharks and for several decades was considered one of the world's foremost experts on shark anatomy and behavior. Over the course of his life, Gilbert published two books and approximately 150 scientific papers. As a recipient of both Carnegie and Guggenheim Fellowships and chair of the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]]' Shark Research Panel, Gilbert travelled the world to better learn and understand shark behavior.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGilbert was born December 1, 1912 to Scott and Hester Gilbert in [[North Branford, Connecticut]].<ref name=\"''2''\">Adler, K., Anderson, J., Leonard, S., Evans, H., \"Perry Webster Gilbert.\" Cornell University Faculty Memorial Statement. 2000.

When Gilbert was a child, the family would frequently spend time on the seashore, developing in him an early appreciation for marine life that would be reignited in his academic career. His father Scott, a carpenter and homebuilder, would take Gilbert fishing, treading for clams, and tonging for oysters.<ref name=\"''6''\">{{cite journal | title=Perry W. Gilbert on JSTOR  | date=February 16, 2001 | jstor=1448126 }}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Gilbert started his schooling in a one-room schoolhouse in his hometown of North Branford, but his mother ultimately proved to be dissatisfied with the quality of the education that the school provided. She sent him to a school of 600 students in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], about 10 miles away by trolley. While he was initially labeled as a \u201chick\u201d by his classmates, Gilbert would often invite classmates to his family's farm and by his last year in school he had become the class president.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nEventually, Gilbert's parents were forced to sell the family home to make way for a new city reservoir, and the Gilberts relocated to nearby [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], a town on the coast of [[Long Island Sound]]. As Gilbert continued his education at [[Branford High School (Connecticut)|Branford High School]], he spent his free time collecting wildlife specimens, including [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s, often studying books on them. He also spent his summers working at a cemetery digging graves and mowing lawns, during which time he learned much from the [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]\u2019s father about budding roses, grafting plants, and raising evergreens. Upon graduating high school, Gilbert was accepted into [[Dartmouth College]], and - although his father's business had been destroyed by the [[Great Depression|Depression]] - his aunt was able to provide funding for his college education.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Academic career ==\nGilbert initially entered [[Dartmouth College]] in 1930, studying both vertebrate anatomy under Professor William Ballard and histology and embryology under Professor Norman Arnold.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> He graduated in 1934 with a bachelor's degree in [[zoology]], and continued on at Dartmouth as an instructor for two years.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> In 1936, Gilbert decided to pursue his Ph.D. and with financial support from a Cramer Fellowship he started his doctoral research on comparative anatomy of burrowing and terrestrial [[Squirrel|sciurid]] mammals at [[Cornell University]].<ref name=\"''6''\" /> Under the advisement of [[Mammalogy|mammalogist]] William J. Hamilton II, Gilbert achieved his doctorate in 1940 and was immediately hired as in instructor in Cornell's Department of Zoology by Chairman Benjamin Young.<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nGilbert ended up having a long career at Cornell, and was continuously affiliated with the University for 64 years. He began as an instructor, being promoted to an Assistant Professor in 1943, a Tenured Associate Professor in 1946, and ultimately to a Professor of Zoology from 1952-1978. Thereafter, Gilbert served as a Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior, Emeritus.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> He taught [[Comparative anatomy|Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy]] during fall, spring, and often summer terms from 1940-1967, a course which was known for its large enrollment as it was a requirement for entrance to most medical schools.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> During [[World War II]], Gilbert taught comparative anatomy to the pre-medical corps of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] for six days a week, every week for a year except Christmas Day.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nGilbert was known among the student population for drawing multi-colored, [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] drawings on the chalkboard using both hands simultaneously, and for giving summative [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thoughts at the end of each lecture.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> He also kept a collection of note cards with details on every one of his students, which he used to remember particulars of over 5000 students in the course of his career.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> During Gilbert's time at Cornell, the University underwent a departmental reorganization that resulted in the formation of the Division of Biological Sciences, in which Gilbert chose to join the new Section of Neurobiology and Behavior, which is now the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n[[Robert Hueter]], Senior Scientist, Director of the Center of Shark Research, and Perry W. Gilbert Chair in Shark Research at [[Mote Marine Laboratory|Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium]], has written that \u201cThousands of professionals in the biological sciences today - and certainly those in comparative anatomy, functional morphology, neurobiology and even ichthyology - can trace their roots to some relationship with Perry Gilbert the teacher\u201d.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nSoon after arriving at Cornell, Gilbert met Claire Rachel Kelly in Hamilton's mammalogy class.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> She was pursuing her [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] at Cornell, and on September 3, 1938 the two were married.<ref name=\"''5''\">{{cite web | title=Claire Kelly Gilbert's Obituary on Herald Tribune | website=Herald Tribune | date=January 22, 1915 | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/heraldtribune/obituary.aspx?n=claire-kelly-gilbert&pid=101040364 | access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> The couple began their married life in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] on Linden Avenue in Collegetown, later moved to a farm on Coddington Road, and eventually settled on the Parkway.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> When Gilbert gained his position as Director of Mote Marine Laboratory in 1967, the Gilberts relocated from Ithaca to [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]].<ref name=\"''5''\" /> They had eight children together, including five sons - David, Stephen, John, Christopher, and Philip - and three daughters - Anne, Mary, and Lois.<ref name=\"''1''\" /> The family also owned a farmhouse on the Danby Hills, known as \u201cthe Nob\u201d which served as a seasonal vacation retreat as well as a site for social gatherings of Gilbert's colleagues, students, and friends.<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nClaire Kelly Gilbert edited Gilbert's publications and co-authored several of them.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> Claire learned [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] in order to translate scientific [[treatise]]s on sharks.<ref name=\"''5''\" /> In Sarasota, she volunteered at St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Shop and sang alto in the choir at Incarnation Church. Following the death of her husband, Claire sold the home in [[Siesta Key, Florida|Siesta Key]] in 2002 and moved to an Ithacare Community in Ithaca called Longview. She died of a [[stroke]] at the age of 92.<ref name=\"''5''\" />\n\n== Early academic work ==\nEarly on, Gilbert's academic work varied widely in nature. Gilbert's first published academic paper, initially penned in 1935 during his time at Dartmouth, focused on the structure and function of avian lungs and air sacs; this paper was ultimately published in 1939. He went on to write his 1940 doctoral [[Thesis|dissertation]] on the anatomy of burrowing squirrels, particularly the [[Groundhog|woodchuck]].<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nIn 1949, Gilbert took his first sabbatical as a Carnegie Fellow in Embryology.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> He worked with Dr. [[George W. Corner|George Corner]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], and ultimately this fellowship resulted in several publications including an illustrated monograph on the origin and development of the human extrinsic eye muscles.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Research in shark biology and behavior ==\nAs a professor, Gilbert oversaw the dissections of many animal specimens but took special interest in the biology of [[Squalidae|dogfish sharks]].<ref name=\"''1''\">{{cite web | last=Nagourney | first=Eric | title=Perry W. Gilbert, 87, Dies; Shark Expert and Defender | website=The New York Times | date=October 25, 2000 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/25/us/perry-w-gilbert-87-dies-shark-expert-and-defender.html | access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> Here his interest in shark biology appears to have begun. Gilbert's first published paper on sharks was focused specifically on the male [[Genitourinary system|urogenital system]] of the [[frilled shark]], published in [[Copeia]] in 1941. He supplemented this first article two years later with an additional paper on the male frilled shark anatomy, published in the [[Journal of Morphology]] in 1943.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> Gilbert's interest and expertise in sharks grew over the course of his career, growing to dominate his academic work in the coming decades.\n\nGilbert went on to study male [[spiny dogfish]] and [[Dusky smooth-hound|smooth dogfish]] at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] in the mid-1950s, resulting in papers about the functional [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of shark claspers and siphon sacs.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> The late 1950s, and 1957 in particular, proved to be fruitful for Gilbert's emerging shark research. During 1957 and 1958, he studied at [[MDI Biological Laboratory|Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory]] in Maine, using [[radioactive tracer]]s to observe the transfer of [[nutrient]]s between mothers and embryos in spiny dogfish. This work was accomplished with the help of his eldest son, David, who was a student at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] at the time.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> In 1957, Gilbert and his colleague F. G. Wood made a breakthrough while conducting research at [[Marineland of Florida|Marineland]] in Florida, and inventing an [[anesthetic]] named [[Tricaine mesylate|MS 222]] that could be sprayed into the gills of large sharks, ultimately publishing a widely cited paper on the subject in Science in 1957.<ref name=\"''1''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> Gilbert went on his second sabbatical in 1957, with the support of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], studying sharks at the [[Lerner Marine Laboratory]] in [[Bimini]].<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nOver the course of his career, Gilbert conducted research - primarily shark-focused, but also including other marine life - at a wide array of research facilities, including: the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts; Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Maine; Lerner Marine Laboratory in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]; Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Florida (which later became Mote Marine Laboratory, under Gilbert's directorship: see below); [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[California]]; and various other labs in [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and the [[South Seas]]. During his career, Gilbert also led scientific expeditions in [[Tahiti]] and [[British Honduras]].<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Work with the Office of Naval Research ==\n\nGilbert's growing expertise around sharks eventually drew the attention of the [[Office of Naval Research|Office of Naval Research (ONR)]]. Concurrently with Gilbert's research efforts, ONR was funding research around methods for repelling shark attacks, which had been reported as a problem for shipwrecked navy personnel and downed pilots during World War II. In 1957, Sid Galler of ONR approached Gilbert and asked him to serve as the chair of the American Institute of Biological Sciences\u2019 ONR-funded Shark Research Panel.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nAs the chair of the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert was tasked with traveling around the world to encourage, coordinate, and direct programs in shark research, as well as to conduct his own research as needed. While the ONR work had initially been specifically focused on developing some sort of [[shark repellent]], Gilbert helped convince them to \"support a broad program in basic research, opening the door to a new era of scientific studies on sharks around the world\".<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nBetween 1960 and 1969, Gilbert authored more than 40 scientific articles on sharks, including research relating to sharks\u2019 vision, [[Bite force quotient|bite force]], [[Chemoreception in fish|chemoreception]], attack behavior, and methods for repelling them.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> Gilbert's early work with ONR also resulted in the publication of the edited volume \"Sharks and Survival\" (1963), a collection of peer reviewed papers with contributions from experts in the field.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nAs a part of his work with the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert helped to plan and coordinate two major [[Symposium|symposia]] on shark research.

He used contacts that he had cultivated over his 30-year career to help boost the reputation and breadth of research in the facility, often soliciting experts from other universities, museums, and the [[National Institutes of Health]].<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nIn the mid-1970s, it became clear that the laboratory would need to be moved once again due to various problems, including [[coastal erosion]] of the Siesta Key.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> Gilbert took on the planning, design, local politicking, and fundraising for the move, and oversaw the creation of Mote's current facility on City Island in Sarasota, Florida.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> The new facility was much larger, with further growth in mind. Following this move, Gilbert retired as Director in 1978.\n\n== Retirement and death ==\nUpon his retirement as Director of Mote Marine Laboratory in 1978, Gilbert continued to work as Mote Senior Scientist and member of the Board of Trustees. A new education building was named in his honor, and the endowed \u201cPerry W. Gilbert Chair in Shark Research\u201d was established.

He pioneered the capture and study of live sharks and for several decades was considered one of the world's foremost experts on shark anatomy and behavior. Over the course of his life, Gilbert published two books and approximately 150 scientific papers. As a recipient of both Carnegie and Guggenheim Fellowships and chair of the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]]' Shark Research Panel, Gilbert travelled the world to better learn and understand shark behavior.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nGilbert was born December 1, 1912 to Scott and Hester Gilbert in [[North Branford, Connecticut]].<ref name=\"''2''\">Adler, K., Anderson, J., Leonard, S., Evans, H., \"Perry Webster Gilbert.\" Cornell University Faculty Memorial Statement. 2000.

When Gilbert was a child, the family would frequently spend time on the seashore, developing in him an early appreciation for marine life that would be reignited in his academic career. His father Scott, a carpenter and homebuilder, would take Gilbert fishing, treading for clams, and tonging for oysters.<ref name=\"''6''\">{{cite journal | title=Perry W. Gilbert on JSTOR  | date=February 16, 2001 | jstor=1448126 }}</ref>\n\nAs a child, Gilbert started his schooling in a one-room schoolhouse in his hometown of North Branford, but his mother ultimately proved to be dissatisfied with the quality of the education that the school provided. She sent him to a school of 600 students in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], about 10 miles away by trolley. While he was initially labeled as a \u201chick\u201d by his classmates, Gilbert would often invite classmates to his family's farm and by his last year in school he had become the class president.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nEventually, Gilbert's parents were forced to sell the family home to make way for a new city reservoir, and the Gilberts relocated to nearby [[Branford, Connecticut|Branford]], a town on the coast of [[Long Island Sound]]. As Gilbert continued his education at [[Branford High School (Connecticut)|Branford High School]], he spent his free time collecting wildlife specimens, including [[Butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s, often studying books on them. He also spent his summers working at a cemetery digging graves and mowing lawns, during which time he learned much from the [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]\u2019s father about budding roses, grafting plants, and raising evergreens. Upon graduating high school, Gilbert was accepted into [[Dartmouth College]], and - although his father's business had been destroyed by the [[Great Depression|Depression]] - his aunt was able to provide funding for his college education.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Academic career ==\nGilbert initially entered [[Dartmouth College]] in 1930, studying both vertebrate anatomy under Professor William Ballard and histology and embryology under Professor Norman Arnold.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> He graduated in 1934 with a bachelor's degree in [[zoology]], and continued on at Dartmouth as an instructor for two years.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> In 1936, Gilbert decided to pursue his Ph.D. and with financial support from a Cramer Fellowship he started his doctoral research on comparative anatomy of burrowing and terrestrial [[Squirrel|sciurid]] mammals at [[Cornell University]].<ref name=\"''6''\" /> Under the advisement of [[Mammalogy|mammalogist]] William J. Hamilton II, Gilbert achieved his doctorate in 1940 and was immediately hired as in instructor in Cornell's Department of Zoology by Chairman Benjamin Young.<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nGilbert ended up having a long career at Cornell, and was continuously affiliated with the University for 64 years. He began as an instructor, being promoted to an Assistant Professor in 1943, a Tenured Associate Professor in 1946, and ultimately to a Professor of Zoology from 1952-1978. Thereafter, Gilbert served as a Professor of Neurobiology and Behavior, Emeritus.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> He taught [[Comparative anatomy|Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy]] during fall, spring, and often summer terms from 1940-1967, a course which was known for its large enrollment as it was a requirement for entrance to most medical schools.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> During [[World War II]], Gilbert taught comparative anatomy to the pre-medical corps of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] for six days a week, every week for a year except Christmas Day.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nGilbert was known among the student population for drawing multi-colored, [[Symmetry|symmetrical]] drawings on the chalkboard using both hands simultaneously, and for giving summative [[Philosophy|philosophical]] thoughts at the end of each lecture.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> He also kept a collection of note cards with details on every one of his students, which he used to remember particulars of over 5000 students in the course of his career.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> During Gilbert's time at Cornell, the University underwent a departmental reorganization that resulted in the formation of the Division of Biological Sciences, in which Gilbert chose to join the new Section of Neurobiology and Behavior, which is now the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n[[Robert Heuter]], Senior Scientist, Director of the Center of Shark Research, and Perry W. Gilbert Chair in Shark Research at [[Mote Marine Laboratory|Mote Marine Laboratory & Aquarium]], has written that \u201cThousands of professionals in the biological sciences today - and certainly those in comparative anatomy, functional morphology, neurobiology and even ichthyology - can trace their roots to some relationship with Perry Gilbert the teacher\u201d.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Personal life ==\nSoon after arriving at Cornell, Gilbert met Claire Rachel Kelly in Hamilton's mammalogy class.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> She was pursuing her [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] at Cornell, and on September 3, 1938 the two were married.<ref name=\"''5''\">{{cite web | title=Claire Kelly Gilbert's Obituary on Herald Tribune | website=Herald Tribune | date=January 22, 1915 | url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/heraldtribune/obituary.aspx?n=claire-kelly-gilbert&pid=101040364 | access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> The couple began their married life in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] on Linden Avenue in Collegetown, later moved to a farm on Coddington Road, and eventually settled on the Parkway.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> When Gilbert gained his position as Director of Mote Marine Laboratory in 1967, the Gilberts relocated from Ithaca to [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]].<ref name=\"''5''\" /> They had eight children together, including five sons - David, Stephen, John, Christopher, and Philip - and three daughters - Anne, Mary, and Lois.<ref name=\"''1''\" /> The family also owned a farmhouse on the Danby Hills, known as \u201cthe Nob\u201d which served as a seasonal vacation retreat as well as a site for social gatherings of Gilbert's colleagues, students, and friends.<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nClaire Kelly Gilbert edited Gilbert's publications and co-authored several of them.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> Claire learned [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Italian language|Italian]] in order to translate scientific [[treatise]]s on sharks.<ref name=\"''5''\" /> In Sarasota, she volunteered at St. Vincent de Paul Thrift Shop and sang alto in the choir at Incarnation Church. Following the death of her husband, Claire sold the home in [[Siesta Key, Florida|Siesta Key]] in 2002 and moved to an Ithacare Community in Ithaca called Longview. She died of a [[stroke]] at the age of 92.<ref name=\"''5''\" />\n\n== Early academic work ==\nEarly on, Gilbert's academic work varied widely in nature. Gilbert's first published academic paper, initially penned in 1935 during his time at Dartmouth, focused on the structure and function of avian lungs and air sacs; this paper was ultimately published in 1939. He went on to write his 1940 doctoral [[Thesis|dissertation]] on the anatomy of burrowing squirrels, particularly the [[Groundhog|woodchuck]].<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nIn 1949, Gilbert took his first sabbatical as a Carnegie Fellow in Embryology.<ref name=\"''2''\" /> He worked with Dr. [[George W. Corner|George Corner]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore]], and ultimately this fellowship resulted in several publications including an illustrated monograph on the origin and development of the human extrinsic eye muscles.<ref name=\"''2''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Research in shark biology and behavior ==\nAs a professor, Gilbert oversaw the dissections of many animal specimens but took special interest in the biology of [[Squalidae|dogfish sharks]].<ref name=\"''1''\">{{cite web | last=Nagourney | first=Eric | title=Perry W. Gilbert, 87, Dies; Shark Expert and Defender | website=The New York Times | date=October 25, 2000 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/25/us/perry-w-gilbert-87-dies-shark-expert-and-defender.html | access-date=December 27, 2017}}</ref> Here his interest in shark biology appears to have begun. Gilbert's first published paper on sharks was focused specifically on the male [[Genitourinary system|urogenital system]] of the [[frilled shark]], published in [[Copeia]] in 1941. He supplemented this first article two years later with an additional paper on the male frilled shark anatomy, published in the [[Journal of Morphology]] in 1943.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> Gilbert's interest and expertise in sharks grew over the course of his career, growing to dominate his academic work in the coming decades.\n\nGilbert went on to study male [[spiny dogfish]] and [[Dusky smooth-hound|smooth dogfish]] at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] in the mid-1950s, resulting in papers about the functional [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] of shark claspers and siphon sacs.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> The late 1950s, and 1957 in particular, proved to be fruitful for Gilbert's emerging shark research. During 1957 and 1958, he studied at [[MDI Biological Laboratory|Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory]] in Maine, using [[radioactive tracer]]s to observe the transfer of [[nutrient]]s between mothers and embryos in spiny dogfish. This work was accomplished with the help of his eldest son, David, who was a student at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] at the time.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> In 1957, Gilbert and his colleague F. G. Wood made a breakthrough while conducting research at [[Marineland of Florida|Marineland]] in Florida, and inventing an [[anesthetic]] named [[Tricaine mesylate|MS 222]] that could be sprayed into the gills of large sharks, ultimately publishing a widely cited paper on the subject in Science in 1957.<ref name=\"''1''\" /><ref name=\"''6''\" /> Gilbert went on his second sabbatical in 1957, with the support of a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], studying sharks at the [[Lerner Marine Laboratory]] in [[Bimini]].<ref name=\"''2''\" />\n\nOver the course of his career, Gilbert conducted research - primarily shark-focused, but also including other marine life - at a wide array of research facilities, including: the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, Massachusetts; Mt. Desert Island Biological Laboratory in Maine; Lerner Marine Laboratory in the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]]; Cape Haze Marine Laboratory in Florida (which later became Mote Marine Laboratory, under Gilbert's directorship: see below); [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[California]]; and various other labs in [[Florida]], [[Hawaii]], [[South Africa]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], and the [[South Seas]]. During his career, Gilbert also led scientific expeditions in [[Tahiti]] and [[British Honduras]].<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\n== Work with the Office of Naval Research ==\n\nGilbert's growing expertise around sharks eventually drew the attention of the [[Office of Naval Research|Office of Naval Research (ONR)]]. Concurrently with Gilbert's research efforts, ONR was funding research around methods for repelling shark attacks, which had been reported as a problem for shipwrecked navy personnel and downed pilots during World War II. In 1957, Sid Galler of ONR approached Gilbert and asked him to serve as the chair of the American Institute of Biological Sciences\u2019 ONR-funded Shark Research Panel.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nAs the chair of the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert was tasked with traveling around the world to encourage, coordinate, and direct programs in shark research, as well as to conduct his own research as needed. While the ONR work had initially been specifically focused on developing some sort of [[shark repellent]], Gilbert helped convince them to \"support a broad program in basic research, opening the door to a new era of scientific studies on sharks around the world\".<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nBetween 1960 and 1969, Gilbert authored more than 40 scientific articles on sharks, including research relating to sharks\u2019 vision, [[Bite force quotient|bite force]], [[Chemoreception in fish|chemoreception]], attack behavior, and methods for repelling them.<ref name=\"''6''\" /> Gilbert's early work with ONR also resulted in the publication of the edited volume \"Sharks and Survival\" (1963), a collection of peer reviewed papers with contributions from experts in the field.<ref name=\"''6''\" />\n\nAs a part of his work with the Shark Research Panel, Gilbert helped to plan and coordinate two major [[Symposium|symposia]] on shark research. One of these symposia was held at Lerner Marine Laboratory in the Bahamas. The symposium collected 70 researchers, twelve of whom were affiliated with Mt.

The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form The Ganges.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAfter flowing {{convert|256.90|km|mi|abbr=on}} {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.\n\nThe Ganges river follows an {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} the Ganges joins the river [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism.

After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]].

Frequently, discharge is described for the mouth of the Meghna River, thus combining the Ganges with the [[Brahmaputra]] and Meghna.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.<ref name=\"Britannica-Brahmaputra\">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]]. It was assumed that during the worst dry season the Ganges flow would be around {{convert|1400|to|1600|m3/s|abbr=on}}, thus leaving {{convert|280|to|420|m3/s|abbr=on}} for the then East Pakistan.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=136\u201337}} East Pakistan objected and a protracted dispute ensued. In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem. One plan is for another barrage to be built in Bangladesh at [[Pangsha Upazila|Pangsha]], west of [[Dhaka]].

She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to [[Ganges Delta|Ganges Sagar]], where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara.<ref name=eck1998-p145/> In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the ''avatarana'', the source stream of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], (Sanskrit, \"of Bhagiratha\").<ref name=eck1998-p145/>\n\n===Redemption of the Dead===\n[[Image:HinduCremationVaranasi1903.jpg|thumb|Preparations for cremations on the banks of the Ganges in [[Varanasi]], 1903.

His soul arrives before [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of Death, to be judged for the hereafter. Having no compensating virtue, Vahika's soul is at once dispatched to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]]. While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below.

An ancient symbol in India, it pre-dates all appearances of the goddess Ganga in art.<ref name=darian2001-p114/> The ''makara'' has a dual symbolism.

Here, in the [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).<ref name=darian2001-p114/>\n\nThe ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.<ref name=darian-2001-p118>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}</ref> The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').<ref name=darian-2001-p118/> The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself. Although she has provided sustenance to millions, she has also brought hardship, injury, and death by causing major floods along her banks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|pp=119\u201320}}</ref> The goddess Ganga is also accompanied by a dwarf attendant, who carries a cosmetic bag, and on whom she sometimes leans, as if for support.<ref name=pal-1997-p43/> (See, for example, frames 1, 2, and 4 above.)\n\nThe ''purna kumbha'' or full pot of water is the second most discernible element of the Ganga iconography.<ref name=darian-2001-p125>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=125}}</ref> Appearing first also in the relief in the Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured.<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, in the [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh#Dashavatara temple|Dashavatara temple]], [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]] (seventh century), the [[Badoli Temples|Trimurti temple]], Badoli, [[Chittor Fort|Chittorgarh]], Rajasthan, and at the [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh#Tourist attractions|Lakshmaneshwar temple]], [[Kharod]], [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]],<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames.

However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.

The five confluences, known as the [[Panch Prayag]], are all along the Alaknanda. They are, in downstream order, [[Vishnuprayag]], where the Dhauliganga joins the Alaknanda; [[Nandprayag]], where the Nandakini joins; [[Karnaprayag]], where the Pindar joins, [[Rudraprayag]], where the Mandakini joins; and finally, [[Devprayag]], where the Bhagirathi joins the Alaknanda to form The Ganges.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nAfter flowing {{convert|256.90|km|mi|abbr=on}} {{sfn|Krishna Murti|1991|p=19}} through its narrow Himalayan valley, the Ganges emerges from the mountains at [[Rishikesh]], then [[debouch]]es onto the [[Gangetic Plain]] at the pilgrimage town of [[Haridwar]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> At Haridwar, a dam diverts some of its waters into the [[Ganges Canal]], which irrigates the ''[[Doab]]'' region of [[Uttar Pradesh]], whereas the river, whose course has been roughly southwest until this point, now begins to flow southeast through the plains of northern India.\n\nThe Ganges river follows an {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} arching course passing through the cities of [[Kannauj]], [[Farukhabad]], and [[Kanpur]]. Along the way it is joined by the [[Ramganga]], which contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|500|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}} the Ganges joins the river [[Yamuna]] at the [[Triveni Sangam]] at [[Allahabad]], a holy confluence in Hinduism.

After the Tamsa the [[Gomti River]] joins, flowing south from the Himalayas. The Gomti contributes an average annual flow of about {{convert|234|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. Then the [[Ghaghara River]] (Karnali River), also flowing south from the Himalayas of Nepal, joins. The Ghaghara (Karnali), with its average annual flow of about {{convert|2990|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, is the largest tributary of the Ganges. After the Ghaghara (Karnali) confluence the Ganges is joined from the south by the [[Son River]], contributing about {{convert|1000|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}. The [[Gandaki River]], then the [[Kosi River]], join from the north flowing from Nepal, contributing about {{convert|1654|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}} and {{convert|2166|m3/s|cuft/s|abbr=on}}, respectively. The Kosi is the third largest tributary of the Ganges, after the Ghaghara (Karnali) and Yamuna.{{sfn|Jain|Agarwal|Singh|2007|p=341}}The Kosi merges into the Ganges near Kursela in Bihar.\n\nAlong the way between [[Prayagraj]] and [[Malda, West Bengal|Malda]], West Bengal, the Ganges river passes the towns of [[Chunar]], [[Mirzapur]], [[Varanasi]], [[Ghazipur]], [[Patna]], [[Chhapra|Chapra]], [[Hajipur]], [[Munger]],[[Sahibganj]],  [[Rajmahal]], [[Bhagalpur]], [[Ballia]], [[Buxar]], [[Simaria]], [[Sultanganj]], and [[Farakka, West Bengal|Farakka]]. At Bhagalpur, the river begins to flow south-southeast and at [[Farakka]], it begins its attrition with the branching away of its first [[distributary]], the [[Hooghly River|Bh\u0101girathi-Hooghly]], which goes on to become the [[Hooghly River]]. Just before the border with [[Bangladesh]] the [[Farakka Barrage]] controls the flow of Ganges, diverting some of the water into a feeder canal linked to the Hooghly for the purpose of keeping it relatively silt-free. The Hooghly River is formed by the confluence of the Bhagirathi River and [[Ajay River]] at [[Katwa]], and Hooghly has a number of tributaries of its own. The largest is the [[Damodar River]], which is {{convert|676|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, with a drainage basin of {{convert|25820|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Dhungel|Pun|2009|p=215}} The Hooghly River empties into the Bay of Bengal near [[Sagar Island]].{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} Between Malda and the Bay of Bengal, the Hooghly river passes the towns and cities of [[Murshidabad]], [[Nabadwip]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Howrah]].\n\nAfter entering [[Bangladesh]], the main branch of the Ganges river is known as the [[Padma River|Padma]].

Frequently, discharge is described for the mouth of the Meghna River, thus combining the Ganges with the [[Brahmaputra]] and Meghna.

About 84% of the total rainfall occurs in the monsoon from June to September. Consequently, [[streamflow]] in the Ganges is highly seasonal. The average dry season to monsoon discharge ratio is about 1:6, as measured at [[Hardinge Bridge]]. This strong seasonal variation underlies many problems of land and water resource development in the region.{{sfn|Mirza|2004}} The seasonality of flow is so acute it can cause both drought and [[flood]]s. Bangladesh, in particular, frequently experiences drought during the dry season and regularly suffers extreme floods during the monsoon.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|p=133}}\n\nIn the Ganges Delta many large rivers come together, both merging and [[River bifurcation|bifurcating]] in a complicated network of [[Channel (geography)|channels]]. The two largest rivers, the Ganges and [[Brahmaputra]], both split into distributary channels, the largest of which merge with other large rivers before themselves joining. This current channel pattern was not always the case. Over time the rivers in Ganges Delta have [[Avulsion (river)|changed course]], sometimes altering the network of channels in significant ways.\n\nBefore the late 12th century the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary was the main channel of the Ganges and the Padma was only a minor spill-channel. The main flow of the river reached the sea not via the modern Hooghly River but rather by the [[Adi Ganga]]. Between the 12th and 16th centuries the Bhagirathi-Hooghly and Padma channels were more or less equally significant. After the 16th century the Padma grew to become the main channel of the Ganges.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2001| pp=126\u201327}} It is thought that the Bhagirathi-Hooghly became increasingly choked with silt, causing the main flow of the Ganges to shift to the southeast and the Padma River. By the end of the 18th century the Padma had become the main distributary of the Ganges.{{sfn|Parua|2009}} One result of this shift to the Padma was that the Ganges joined the Meghna and Brahmaputra rivers before emptying into the Bay of Bengal, together instead of separately. The present confluence of the Ganges and Meghna formed about 150 years ago.<ref name=\"Catling1992\">{{cite book|last=Catling|first=David|title=Rice in deep water|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N5JxwKx1RAgC&pg=PA175|accessdate=23 April 2011|year=1992|publisher=[[International Rice Research Institute]]|isbn=978-9712200052|page=175}}</ref>\n\nAlso near the end of the 18th century, the course of the lower Brahmaputra changed dramatically, altering its relationship with the Ganges. In 1787 there was a great flood on the [[Teesta River]], which at the time was a tributary of the Ganges-Padma River. The flood of 1787 caused the Teesta to undergo a sudden change course (an [[Avulsion (river)|avulsion]]), shifting east to join the Brahmaputra and causing the Brahmaputra to shift its course south, cutting a new channel. This new main channel of the Brahmaputra is called the Jamuna River. It flows south to join the Ganges-Padma. Since ancient times the main flow of the Brahmaputra was more easterly, passing by the city of [[Mymensingh]] and joining the Meghna River. Today this channel is a small distributary but retains the name Brahmaputra, sometimes Old Brahmaputra.<ref name=\"Britannica-Brahmaputra\">{{cite encyclopedia |year= 2011 |title= Brahmaputra River |encyclopedia= [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] |edition= Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library |url= http://www.library.eb.com/eb/article-48056 |accessdate=25 April 2011}}</ref> The site of the old Brahmaputra-Meghna confluence, in the locality of [[Langalbandh]], is still considered sacred by Hindus.

The original purpose of the barrage, which was completed in 1975, was to divert up to {{convert|1100|m3/s|abbr=on}} of water from the Ganges to the Bhagirathi-Hooghly distributary in order to restore navigability at the [[Port of Kolkata]]. It was assumed that during the worst dry season the Ganges flow would be around {{convert|1400|to|1600|m3/s|abbr=on}}, thus leaving {{convert|280|to|420|m3/s|abbr=on}} for the then East Pakistan.{{sfn|Salman|Uprety|2002|pp=136\u201337}} East Pakistan objected and a protracted dispute ensued. In 1996 a 30-year treaty was signed with Bangladesh. The terms of the agreement are complicated, but in essence they state that if the Ganges flow at Farakka was less than {{convert|2000|m3/s|abbr=on}} then India and Bangladesh would each receive 50% of the water, with each receiving at least {{convert|1000|m3/s|abbr=on}} for alternating ten-day periods. However, within a year the flow at Farakka fell to levels far below the historic average, making it impossible to implement the guaranteed sharing of water. In March 1997, flow of the Ganges in Bangladesh dropped to its lowest ever, {{convert|180|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Dry season flows returned to normal levels in the years following, but efforts were made to address the problem. One plan is for another barrage to be built in Bangladesh at [[Pangsha Upazila|Pangsha]], west of [[Dhaka]].

She is then led by the waiting Bhagiratha down into the plains at Haridwar, across the plains first to the confluence with the [[Yamuna River|Yamuna]] at Prayag and then to Varanasi, and eventually to [[Ganges Delta|Ganges Sagar]], where she meets the ocean, sinks to the netherworld, and saves the sons of Sagara.<ref name=eck1998-p145/> In honour of Bhagirath's pivotal role in the ''avatarana'', the source stream of the Ganges in the Himalayas is named [[Bhagirathi River|Bhagirathi]], (Sanskrit, \"of Bhagiratha\").<ref name=eck1998-p145/>\n\n===Redemption of the Dead===\n[[Image:HinduCremationVaranasi1903.jpg|thumb|Preparations for cremations on the banks of the Ganges in [[Varanasi]], 1903.

His soul arrives before [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yama]], the Lord of Death, to be judged for the hereafter. Having no compensating virtue, Vahika's soul is at once dispatched to [[Naraka (Hinduism)|hell]]. While this is happening, his body on earth, however, is being picked at by vultures, one of whom flies away with a foot bone. Another bird comes after the vulture, and in fighting him off, the vulture accidentally drops the bone into the Ganges below.

An ancient symbol in India, it pre-dates all appearances of the goddess Ganga in art.<ref name=darian2001-p114/> The ''makara'' has a dual symbolism.

Here, in the [[Udaygiri Caves#Caves, sculptures and inscriptions|Cave V]], flanking the main figure of Vishnu shown in his boar incarnation, two river goddesses, Ganga and [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]] appear atop their respective mounts, ''makara'' and ''[[kurma]]'' (a turtle or tortoise).<ref name=darian2001-p114/>\n\nThe ''makara'' is often accompanied by a ''[[gana]]'', a small boy or child, near its mouth, as, for example, shown in the Gupta period relief from [[Vidisha#Historic Places and Monuments|Besnagar]], Central India, in the left-most frame above.<ref name=darian-2001-p118>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=118}}</ref> The ''gana'' represents both posterity and development (''udbhava'').<ref name=darian-2001-p118/> The pairing of the fearsome, life-destroying ''makara'' with the youthful, life-affirming ''gana'' speaks to two aspects of the Ganges herself. Although she has provided sustenance to millions, she has also brought hardship, injury, and death by causing major floods along her banks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|pp=119\u201320}}</ref> The goddess Ganga is also accompanied by a dwarf attendant, who carries a cosmetic bag, and on whom she sometimes leans, as if for support.<ref name=pal-1997-p43/> (See, for example, frames 1, 2, and 4 above.)\n\nThe ''purna kumbha'' or full pot of water is the second most discernible element of the Ganga iconography.<ref name=darian-2001-p125>{{Harvnb|Darian|2001|p=125}}</ref> Appearing first also in the relief in the Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured.<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, in the [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh#Dashavatara temple|Dashavatara temple]], [[Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh]] (seventh century), the [[Badoli Temples|Trimurti temple]], Badoli, [[Chittor Fort|Chittorgarh]], Rajasthan, and at the [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh#Tourist attractions|Lakshmaneshwar temple]], [[Kharod]], [[Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh]],<ref name=darian-2001-p125/> (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames.

However, after the [[Agra famine of 1837\u201338]], during which the [[East India Company]]'s administration spent [[Rs.]] 2,300,000 on famine relief, the idea of a canal became more attractive to the Company's budget-conscious Court of Directors. In 1839, the [[Governor General of India]], [[George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland|Lord Auckland]], with the Court's assent, granted funds to Cautley for a full survey of the swath of land that underlay and fringed the projected course of the canal.

Auckland's successor as Governor General, [[Edward Law, 1st Earl of Ellenborough|Lord Ellenborough]], appeared less receptive to large-scale public works, and for the duration of his tenure, withheld major funds for the project. Only in 1844, when a new Governor-General, [[Henry Hardinge, 1st Viscount Hardinge|Lord Hardinge]], was appointed, did official enthusiasm and funds return to the Ganges canal project. Although the intervening impasse had seemingly affected Cautley's health and required him to return to Britain in 1845 for recuperation, his European sojourn gave him an opportunity to study contemporary hydraulic works in the United Kingdom and Italy. By the time of his return to India even more supportive men were at the helm, both in the [[North-Western Provinces]], with [[James Thomason (British colonial governor)|James Thomason]] as Lt. Governor, and in [[British India]] with [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Lord Dalhousie]] as Governor-General.

The objective of this centrally funded scheme was to treat the effluent from all the major towns along the Ganges and reduce pollution in the river by at least 75%. The Ganga Action Plan built upon the existing, but weakly enforced, 1974 Water Prevention and Control Act. A government audit of the Ganga Action Plan in 2000 reported limited success in meeting effluent targets. Development plans for sewage treatment facilities were submitted by only 73% of the cities along the Ganges, and only 54% of these were judged acceptable by the authorities. Not all the cities reported how much effluent was being treated, and many continued to discharge raw sewage into the river. Test audits of installed capacity indicated poor performance, and there were long delays in constructing planned treatment facilities. After 15 yr. of implementation, the audit estimated that the Ganga Action Plan had achieved only 14% of the anticipated sewage treatment capacity. The environmental impact of this failure has been exacerbated by the removal of large quantities of irrigation water from the Ganges which offset any gains from effluent reductions.\"\n----}} a \"major failure\".{{efn|name=haberman|1= {{harvtxt|Haberman|2006}}<br />\"The Ganga Action Plan, commonly known as GAP, was launched dramatically in the holy city of Banares (Varanasi) on 14 June 1985, by Prime Minister [[Rajiv Gandhi]], who promised, {{'}}We shall see that the waters of the Ganga become clean once again.{{'}} The stated task was {{'}}to improve water quality, permit safe bathing all along the 2,525 kilometers from the Ganges's origin in the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal, and make the water potable at important pilgrim and urban centres on its banks.{{'}} The project was designed to tackle pollution from twenty-five cities and towns along its banks in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal by intercepting, diverting, and treating their effluents. With the GAP's Phase II, three important tributaries\u2014Damodar, Gomati, and Yamuna\u2014were added to the plan. Although some improvements have been made to the quality of the Ganges's water, many people claim that the GAP has been a major failure. The environmental lawyer M. C. Mehta, for example, filed public interest litigation against project, claiming {{'}}GAP has collapsed.{{'}}\"\n----}}{{efn|name=gardner|1={{harvtxt|Gardner|2003}}<br />\"The Ganges, also known as the Ganga, is one of the world's major rivers, running for more than 2,500 kilometres from the Himalayas to the Bay of Bengal. It is also one of the most polluted, primarily from sewage, but also from animal carcasses, human corpses, and soap and other pollutants from bathers. Indeed, scientists measure fecal coliform levels at thousands of times what is permissible and levels of oxygen in the water are similarly unhealthy. Renewal efforts have centred primarily on the government-sponsored Ganga Action Plan (GAP), started in 1985 with the goal of cleaning up the river by 1993. Several western-style sewage treatment plants were built along the river, but they were poorly designed, poorly maintained and prone to shut down during the region's frequent power outages. The GAP has been a colossal failure, and many argue that the river is more polluted now than it was in 1985.\" (pa.166)\n----}}{{efn|name=bharati|1= {{harvtxt|Bharati|2006}}<br />\"The World Bank estimates the health costs of water pollution in India to be equivalent to three per cent of the country's gross domestic product. With Indian rivers being severely polluted, interlinking them may actually increase these costs. Also, with the widely recognised failure of the Ganga Action Plan, there is a danger that contaminants from the Gangetic basin might enter other basins and destroy their natural cleansing processes. The new areas that will be river-fed after the introduction of the scheme may experience crop failures or routing due to alien compounds carried into their streams from the polluted Gangetic basin streams.\" (p. 26)\n----}}\n\nAccording to one study,<ref name=mandal>{{Citation|last=Mandal|first=R.

The expenditure was almost doubled. But the result was not very appreciable. Much expenditure was done over the political propaganda. The concerning governments and the related agencies were not very prompt to make it a success. The public of the areas was not taken into consideration. The releasing of urban and industrial wastes in the river was not controlled fully. The flowing of dirty water through drains and sewers were not adequately diverted. The continuing customs of burning dead bodies, throwing carcasses, washing of dirty clothes by washermen, and immersion of idols and cattle wallowing were not checked. Very little provision of public latrines was made and the open defecation of lakhs of people continued along the riverside. All these made the Action Plan a failure.</blockquote>\n\nThe failure of the Ganga Action Plan, has also been variously attributed to \"environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions,\"{{efn|name=singh|1= {{harvtxt| Singh|Singh|2007}}<br />\"In February 1985, the Ministry of Environment and Forest, Government of India launched the Ganga Action Plan, an environmental project to improve the river water quality. It was the largest single attempt to clean up a polluted river anywhere in the world and has not achieved any success in terms of preventing pollution load and improvement in water quality of the river. Failure of the Ganga Action Plan may be directly linked with the environmental planning without proper understanding of the human\u2013environment interactions.

The failure of the Ganga Action Plan to clean the sacred river is partly associated to our traditions and beliefs. The disposal of dead bodies, the immersion of idols and public bathing are the part of Hindu customs and rituals which are based on the notion that the sacred river leads to the path of salvation and under no circumstances its water can become impure. Burning of dead bodies through wood, bursting of crackers during Diwali, putting thousands of tonnes of fuel wood under fire during Holi, immersion of Durga and Ganesh idols into rivers and seas etc. are part of Hindu customs and are detrimental to the environment.
