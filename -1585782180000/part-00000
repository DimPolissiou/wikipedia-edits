Upon graduating high school, he studied music at The College of Idaho from 1923 to 1925 before he was accepted into the Bush Conservatory of Music in Chicago, Illinois. His abilities in theory and composition earned him a scholarship to study music theory at [[Juilliard]], however, it is unclear if he ever pursued this invitation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=The College of Idaho Department of Music|title=A Tribute to Professors: Beale, Smith, Skyrm, Davidson, Cerveny, and Gabbard|publisher=The College of Idaho|pages=5\u20137}}</ref>\n\nSmith spent much of his life working at [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Disney]] as composer for many of its films' scores, animated and live-action alike, movie and television alike; from 1962 to 1963, he also composed music for ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]''. In ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', he is one of the studio employees in the orchestra. He also composed the scores for several of the ''[[True-Life Adventures]]'' episodes.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Macdonald|first1=Scott|title=Up Close and Political : The Short Ruminations on Ideology in the Nature Film|journal=Film Quarterly|date=Spring 2006|volume=3|issue=59}}</ref>\n\nIn 1950, Smith and [[Oliver Wallace]] composed the musical score of [[Cinderella (1950 film)|Disney's ''Cinderella'']].\n\nSmith's main collaborator and partner was Hazel \"Gil\" George, who wrote the song title for ''[[The Light in the Forest (film)|The Light in the Forest]]'' with him and [[Lawrence Edward Watkin]]. Another one of Smith's collaborator was [[George Bruns]] who worked with him on films like [[Westward Ho the Wagons!]]. Smith also did the [[stock music]] for the ''[[Blondie (1938 film)#Blondie film series|Blondie]]'' series of the late 1940s and early 1950s.

{"title_page": "Officer of the United States", "text_new": "An '''officer of the United States''' is a functionary of the [[Executive (government)|executive]] or [[United States federal courts|judicial]] branches of the [[federal government of the United States]] to whom is delegated some part of the country's [[sovereignty|sovereign power]]. The term \"officer of the United States\" is not a title, but a term of classification for a certain type of official.\n\nWith a limited number of exceptions, all officers of the United States are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and are subject to the approval of the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] unless it chooses not to require such approval. Civilian officers of the United States are entitled to preface their names with the honorific style \"the Honorable\" for life; though in practice, this rarely occurs. Officers of the United States should not be confused with employees of the United States; the latter are more numerous and lack the special legal authority of the former.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Establishment===\n\n====Origin and definition====\nThe [[Appointments Clause]] of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] ([[Article Two of the United States Constitution|Article II]], section 2, clause 2), empowers the [[President of the United States]] to appoint \"Officers of the United States\" with the \"[[advice and consent]]\" of the [[United States Senate]].

Day-to-day administration of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] was based on persons \"holding sovereign authority delegated from the King that enabled them in conducting the affairs of government to affect the people.\" This was an extension of the general [[common law|common-law]] rule that \"where one man hath to do with another's affairs against his will, and without his leave, that this is an office, and he who is in it, is an officer.\"<ref name=\"doj\"/>\n\nAccording to an April 2007 memorandum opinion by the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Legal Counsel]], addressed to the general counsels of the executive branch, defined \"officer of the United States\" as:<ref name=\"doj\">{{cite book|author=[[Steven G.

A person who would hold such a position must be properly made an 'officer of the United States' by being appointed pursuant to the procedures specified in the Appointments Clause.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Obama signing Kagan's commission.jpg|right|thumb|[[Barack Obama]] signs the commission document investing [[Elena Kagan]] as an officer of the United States in 2010, specifically as a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].]]\n\nThe difference between an \"Officer of the United States\" and a mere \"Employee of the United States,\" therefore, ultimately rests on whether the office held has been explicitly delegated part of the \"sovereign power of the United States\". Delegation of \"sovereign power\" means possession of the authority to commit the federal government of the United States to some legal obligation, such as by signing a contract, executing a treaty, interpreting a law, or issuing military orders. A [[United States federal judge|federal judge]], for instance, has been delegated part of the \"sovereign power\" of the United States to exercise; while a [[letter carrier]] for the [[United States Postal Service]] has not. Some very prominent title-holders, including the [[White House Chief of Staff]], the [[White House Press Secretary]] and most other high-profile presidential staff assistants, are only employees of the United States as they have no authority to exercise the sovereign power of the federal government.<ref name=\"doj\"/><ref name=\"pitt\"/>\n\n====Military officers and secondary appointments====\nIn addition to civilian officers of the United States, persons who hold military commissions are also considered officers of the United States. While not explicitly defined as such in the Constitution, this fact is implicit in its structure. According to a 1996 opinion by then-[[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] [[Walter E. Dellinger III|Walter Dellinger]] of the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s [[Office of Legal Counsel]], \"even the lowest ranking military or naval officer is a potential commander of United States armed forces in combat&mdash;and, indeed, is in theory a commander of large military or naval units by presidential direction or in the event of catastrophic casualties among his or her superiors.\"<ref name=doj2>{{cite book|author=[[Walter Dellinger]]|title=The Constitutional Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress|date=7 May 1996|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] [[Office of Legal Counsel]]|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1996/05/31/op-olc-v020-p0124_0.pdf|ref=doj2}} p. 144, n. 54.</ref> The officer's authority to command the forces of the United States draws its legitimacy from the president himself as \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\"; the president cannot reasonably be expected to command every soldier, or any soldier, in the field and so delegates his authority to command to officers he commissions.<ref name=\"doj\"/>\n\nCommissioned officers of the seven [[uniformed services of the United States]]&mdash;the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], [[NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps]], and [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]]&mdash;are all officers of the United States. Under current law, the Senate does not require the commissions of all military officers to be confirmed; however, anyone being first promoted to [[major (rank)|major]] in the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps, or [[lieutenant commander]] in the Navy, does require such confirmation. This results in several hundred promotions that annually must be confirmed by the Senate, though these are typically confirmed en masse without individual hearings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Colton|title=Congress and Civil-Military Relations|date=2015|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=1626161801|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2ruBgAAQBAJ&dq=}}</ref><ref name=\"doj\"/>\n[[File:James Stockdale Formal Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Military officers are considered officers of the United States.]]\nFinally, some persons not appointed by the president but, instead, appointed by persons or bodies who are, themselves, appointed by the president may be officers of the United States if defined as such under the law. Examples include [[United States magistrate judge]]s, who are appointed by [[United States district court]]s, and the [[Postmaster General of the United States]], who is appointed by the [[Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service]], which, in turn, is appointed by the president.<ref name=\"doj\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Robert|title=Public Officers: Can State or Municipal Officers Hold Office under the United States?|journal=California Law Review|date=November 1941|volume=30|issue=1|pages=99\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n====Ineligibility Clause====\n{{main|Ineligibility Clause}}\n\nMembers of the [[United States Congress]]\u2014the legislative branch of the United States government\u2014are not \"officers of the United States\" and cannot simultaneously serve in Congress and as an officer of the United States under the \"Ineligibility Clause\" (also called the \"Incompatibility Clause\") of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2). This provision states:<ref name=\"doj\"/>\n\n<blockquote>No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.</blockquote>\n\nThe question of whether the Ineligibility Clause bars member of Congress or civil officers of the United States from simultaneously serving in the military (especially the [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|military reserves]]) has never been definitively resolved. A case involving the issue was litigated to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War]]'', but the Supreme Court decided the case on procedural grounds and did not address the Ineligibility Clause issue.<ref name=\"Brougher\">Cynthia Brougher, [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40634.pdf Service by a Member of Congress in the U.S. Armed Forces Reserves], [[Congressional Research Service]] (June 10, 2009).</ref> Congress has enacted legislation provided that \"a Reserve of the armed forces who is not on active duty or who is on active duty for training is deemed not an employee or an individual holding an office of trust or profit or discharging an official function under or in connection with the United States because of his appointment, oath, or status, or any duties or functions performed or pay or allowances received in that capacity.\" A 2009 [[Congressional Research Service]] report noted that \"Because Congress has the power to determine the qualifications of its own Members, the limitations that it has imposed on what constitutes an employee holding an office of the United States may be significant to courts considering the constitutional limitations.\"<ref name=\"Brougher\"/>\n\n====Creation and appointment====\nWith the exception of military officers and certain court- and [[Independent agencies of the United States government|board]]-appointed officers, the method for creating an officer of the United States generally follows a set procedure. First, the Constitution must describe the office, or the U.S. Congress must create the office through a statute (though the president may independently create offices when exercising his exclusive jurisdiction in the exercise of foreign affairs, generally meaning ambassadorships). Second, the president nominates a person to fill the office and then commissions that person at which time the appointee comes to occupy the office and is an officer of the United States. However, if the office is that of [[ambassador]], \"public minister\" (member of the [[Cabinet of the United States]]), judge of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], or if the office has not been specifically vested for filling \"in the President alone\" by the authorizing legislation, then an intermediate step is required before the commission can be issued, namely, the U.S. Senate must give its \"advise and consent\" which, in practice, means approval by vote of a simple majority.<ref>{{cite web|last1=England|first1=Trent|title=Commissions|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/99/commissions|website=heritage.org|publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn officer of the United States assumes his office's full authority upon the issuance of the commission.

To this is set the signatures of the president and the [[U.S. Secretary of State]] applied by [[autopen]]. The document is sealed with the [[Great Seal of the United States]]. Those who require confirmation of the Senate are issued fully engraved certificates (certificates completely hand-written by a calligrapher) on [[foolscap folio]] sized parchment. The President and Secretary of State usually hand-sign these certificates and, like others, they are sealed with the Great Seal of the United States.\n\nThe commissions of military officers are signed under the line \"for the President\" by the appropriate service secretary (e.g. the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]], or for the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]]), instead of the Secretary of State, and are sealed with their respective departmental seal (e.g. [[Seal and emblem of the United States Department of the Army|Army seal]]) instead of the Great Seal.\n\nThe presentation of commissions for civilian officers generally follows the following style, or some variation thereof:\n\n{{quote|To all who shall see these presents, greeting: Know Ye that, reposing special trust in the integrity, ability, and fidelity of John Dow, I have nominated and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, do appoint John Dow as [[Librarian of Congress]], and do authorize and empower him to execute and fulfill the duties of that office according to law, and to have and to hold said office, with all the powers, privileges, and emoluments to the same of right appertaining unto him, the said Librarian of Congress, for the term of ten years, unless the President of the United States, for the time being, should be pleased sooner to revoke this commission.

The term \"officer of the United States\" is not a title, but a term of classification for a certain type of official.\n\nWith a limited number of exceptions, all officers of the United States are appointed by the [[President of the United States|President]] and are subject to the approval of the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] unless it chooses not to require such approval. Civilian officers of the United States are entitled to preface their names with the honorific style \"the Honorable\" for life; though in practice, this rarely occurs.

Day-to-day administration of the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] was based on persons \"holding sovereign authority delegated from the King that enabled them in conducting the affairs of government to affect the people.\" This was an extension of the general [[common law|common-law]] rule that \"where one man hath to do with another's affairs against his will, and without his leave, that this is an office, and he who is in it, is an officer.\"<ref name=\"doj\"/>\n\nAccording to an April 2007 memorandum opinion by the [[United States Department of Justice]]'s [[Office of Legal Counsel]], addressed to the general counsels of the executive branch, defined \"officer of the United States\" as:<ref name=\"doj\">{{cite book|author=[[Steven G.

A person who would hold such a position must be properly made an 'officer of the United States' by being appointed pursuant to the procedures specified in the Appointments Clause.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Obama signing Kagan's commission.jpg|right|thumb|[[Barack Obama]] signs the commission document investing [[Elena Kagan]] as an officer of the United States in 2010, specifically as a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]].]]\n\nThe difference between an \"Officer of the United States\" and a mere \"Employee of the United States,\" therefore, ultimately rests on whether the office held has been explicitly delegated part of the \"sovereign power of the United States\". Delegation of \"sovereign power\" means possession of the authority to commit the federal government of the United States to some legal obligation, such as by signing a contract, executing a treaty, interpreting a law, or issuing military orders. A [[United States federal judge|federal judge]], for instance, has been delegated part of the \"sovereign power\" of the United States to exercise; while a [[letter carrier]] for the [[United States Postal Service]] has not. Some very prominent title-holders, including the [[White House Chief of Staff]], the [[White House Press Secretary]] and most other high-profile presidential staff assistants, are only employees of the United States as they have no authority to exercise the sovereign power of the federal government.<ref name=\"doj\"/><ref name=\"pitt\"/>\n\n====Military officers and secondary appointments====\nIn addition to civilian officers of the United States, persons who hold military commissions are also considered officers of the United States. While not explicitly defined as such in the Constitution, this fact is implicit in its structure. According to a 1996 opinion by then-[[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] [[Walter E. Dellinger III|Walter Dellinger]] of the [[U.S. Department of Justice|Justice Department]]'s [[Office of Legal Counsel]], \"even the lowest ranking military or naval officer is a potential commander of United States armed forces in combat&mdash;and, indeed, is in theory a commander of large military or naval units by presidential direction or in the event of catastrophic casualties among his or her superiors.\"<ref name=doj2>{{cite book|author=[[Walter Dellinger]]|title=The Constitutional Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress|date=7 May 1996|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]] [[Office of Legal Counsel]]|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/olc/opinions/1996/05/31/op-olc-v020-p0124_0.pdf|ref=doj2}} p. 144, n. 54.</ref> The officer's authority to command the forces of the United States draws its legitimacy from the president himself as \"Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States\"; the president cannot reasonably be expected to command every soldier, or any soldier, in the field and so delegates his authority to command to officers he commissions.<ref name=\"doj\"/>\n\nCommissioned officers of the seven [[uniformed services of the United States]]&mdash;the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], [[NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Corps]], and [[United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps|Public Health Service Commissioned Corps]]&mdash;are all officers of the United States. Under current law, the Senate does not require the commissions of all military officers to be confirmed, however, anyone being first promoted to [[major (rank)|major]] in the Army, Air Force, or Marine Corps, or [[lieutenant commander]] in the Navy, does require such confirmation. This results in several hundred promotions that annually must be confirmed by the Senate, though these are typically confirmed en masse without individual hearings.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Colton|title=Congress and Civil-Military Relations|date=2015|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=1626161801|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2ruBgAAQBAJ&dq=}}</ref><ref name=\"doj\"/>\n[[File:James Stockdale Formal Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Military officers are considered officers of the United States.]]\nFinally, some persons not appointed by the president but, instead, appointed by persons or bodies who are, themselves, appointed by the president may be officers of the United States if defined as such under the law. Examples include [[United States magistrate judge]]s, who are appointed by [[United States district court]]s, and the [[Postmaster General of the United States]], who is appointed by the [[Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service]], which, in turn, is appointed by the president.<ref name=\"doj\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chandler|first1=Robert|title=Public Officers: Can State or Municipal Officers Hold Office under the United States?|journal=California Law Review|date=November 1941|volume=30|issue=1|pages=99\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n====Ineligibility Clause====\n{{main|Ineligibility Clause}}\n\nMembers of the [[United States Congress]]\u2014the legislative branch of the United States government\u2014are not \"officers of the United States\" and cannot simultaneously serve in Congress and as an officer of the United States under the \"Ineligibility Clause\" (also called the \"Incompatibility Clause\") of the Constitution (Article 1, Section 6, Clause 2). This provision states:<ref name=\"doj\"/>\n\n<blockquote>No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been increased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.</blockquote>\n\nThe question of whether the Ineligibility Clause bars member of Congress or civil officers of the United States from simultaneously serving in the military (especially the [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|military reserves]]) has never been definitively resolved. A case involving the issue was litigated to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop the War]]'', but the Supreme Court decided the case on procedural grounds and did not address the Ineligibility Clause issue.<ref name=\"Brougher\">Cynthia Brougher, [https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40634.pdf Service by a Member of Congress in the U.S. Armed Forces Reserves], [[Congressional Research Service]] (June 10, 2009).</ref> Congress has enacted legislation provided that \"a Reserve of the armed forces who is not on active duty or who is on active duty for training is deemed not an employee or an individual holding an office of trust or profit or discharging an official function under or in connection with the United States because of his appointment, oath, or status, or any duties or functions performed or pay or allowances received in that capacity.\" A 2009 [[Congressional Research Service]] report noted that \"Because Congress has the power to determine the qualifications of its own Members, the limitations that it has imposed on what constitutes an employee holding an office of the United States may be significant to courts considering the constitutional limitations.\"<ref name=\"Brougher\"/>\n\n====Creation and appointment====\nWith the exception of military officers and certain court- and [[Independent agencies of the United States government|board]]-appointed officers, the method for creating an officer of the United States generally follows a set procedure. First, the Constitution must describe the office, or the U.S. Congress must create the office through a statute (though the president may independently create offices when exercising his exclusive jurisdiction in the exercise of foreign affairs, generally meaning ambassadorships). Second, the president nominates a person to fill the office and then commissions that person at which time the appointee comes to occupy the office and is an officer of the United States. However, if the office is that of [[ambassador]], \"public minister\" (member of the [[Cabinet of the United States]]), judge of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], or if the office has not been specifically vested for filling \"in the President alone\" by the authorizing legislation, then an intermediate step is required before the commission can be issued, namely, the U.S. Senate must give its \"advise and consent\" which, in practice, means approval by vote of a simple majority.<ref>{{cite web|last1=England|first1=Trent|title=Commissions|url=http://www.heritage.org/constitution/#!/articles/2/essays/99/commissions|website=heritage.org|publisher=[[Heritage Foundation]]|accessdate=28 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAn officer of the United States assumes his office's full authority upon the issuance of the commission.

Those who require confirmation of the Senate are issued fully engraved certificates (certificates completely hand-written by a calligrapher) on [[foolscap folio]] sized parchment. The President and Secretary of State usually hand-sign these certificates and, like others, they are sealed with the Great Seal of the United States.\n\nThe commissions of military officers are signed under the line \"for the President\" by the appropriate service secretary (e.g. the [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]], [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]], or for the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]], the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]]), instead of the Secretary of State, and are sealed with their respective departmental seal (e.g. [[Seal and emblem of the United States Department of the Army|Army seal]]) instead of the Great Seal.\n\nThe presentation of commissions for civilian officers generally follows the following style, or some variation thereof:\n\n{{quote|To all who shall see these presents, greeting: Know Ye that, reposing special trust in the integrity, ability, and fidelity of John Dow, I have nominated and, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, do appoint John Dow as [[Librarian of Congress]], and do authorize and empower him to execute and fulfill the duties of that office according to law, and to have and to hold said office, with all the powers, privileges, and emoluments to the same of right appertaining unto him, the said Librarian of Congress, for the term of ten years, unless the President of the United States, for the time being, should be pleased sooner to revoke this commission.

On September 4, 2003, in [[Paris]], these countries detailed the principles governing the PSI in a document titled the \"Statement of Interdiction Principles\". The document defines the activities which are to be undertaken by the initiative, specifically \"to establish a more coordinated and effective basis through which to impede and stop shipments of WMD, delivery systems, and related materials flowing to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern, consistent with national legal authorities and relevant international law and frameworks, including the UN Security Council circumstances in which such operations may be carried out (at sea, on land, or in the air) including, most importantly, the requirement that any action taken must be consistent with international law.\"<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/c27726.htm United States Department of State]</ref> Since the initial core group of 2003, PSI has expanded to include an \"Operational Experts Group\" (OEG) of 21 nations<ref>http://125.60.3.200/news.do?mode=detail&thiscode=eng030001&guid=51100</ref> as well as 84 other endorsing states. Key states who have endorsed the initiative since its initial founding include major actors in [[international trade]] such as Singapore and the [[United Arab Emirates]], as well as countries such as [[Turkey]] and the Republic of Korea, who are geographically close to states designated by [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s as proliferation threats.\n\nEleven nations have signed bilateral [[Mutual Shipboarding Agreements]] with the United States, allowing the mutual expedition of shipboarding requests for ships under those nations' flags.  The Eleven are the [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Liberia]], [[Malta]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Mongolia]], [[Panama]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. Each of these nations maintains a large number of commercial vessels on their registries, and are often considered [[flag of convenience]] states.<ref>For the text of these bilateral agreements, see [https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/isn/c12386.htm this U.S. Department of State web page]</ref><ref>For an academic analysis of shipboarding in the PSI context, see {{cite journal |author=Fabio Spadi|year=2006 |title=Bolstering the Proliferation Security Initiative at Sea: A Comparative Analysis of Ship-boarding as a Bilateral and Multilateral Implementing Mechanism |journal=Nordic Journal of International Law |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=249\u2013278 |doi=10.1163/157181006778666614}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, at a speech in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], newly inaugurated President [[Barack Obama]] announced that he planned to transform the PSI into a \"durable international institution\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/obama_nuclear_proliferation.html |title = Obama's Speech on Nuclear Proliferation &#124; RealClearPolitics}}</ref> indicating that US promotion of the initiative would remain non-partisan and cross over from the previous administration.  Indeed, Obama had made the strengthening of the PSI one of his campaign promises in the [[2008 United States presidential election|Presidential election of 2008]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/192/strengthen-the-proliferation-security-initiative/ |title = The Obameter: &#124; PolitiFact}}</ref> and continued to promote the PSI through the 2010 White House Nuclear Security Strategy.\n\nThe 2013 PSI High Level Political Meeting facilitated the adoption of a set of four Joint Statements, advancing cooperation among PSI endorsing states toward:\n-  Ensuring a Robust Initiative\n-  Enhancing Critical Interdiction Capabilities and Practices\n-  Strengthening Authorities for Action\n-  Expanding Strategic Communications\n\nProgress on implementation was reviewed at the PSI Mid-Level Political Meeting in January 2016, hosted in Washington, DC.  Another PSI High Level Political Meeting will be hosted in France in 2018.\n\nThe PSI has evolved considerably since 2003, embracing a much wider array of proliferation security issues, such as customs enforcement, export controls, proliferation finance, and intangible transfers of technology.  Given its broad and flexible mandate, the PSI now plays a vital role in advancing proliferation security norms and standards of practice.\n\n== Participation ==\n[[File:Map of Proliferation Security Initiative states.png|thumb|upright=2.0|alt=102 PSI-endorsing states as of April 2013.|PSI-endorsing states, as of 2013]]\nThe primary role of PSI participants is to abide by the '''Statement of Interdiction Principles''', with the primary purpose of interdicting subject weapons and materials.  Additionally, participants are recommended to enact legal statutes to facilitate effective interdiction and seizure of such items.  Finally, participants are to take measures to ensure that their national facilities are not utilized to transfer illicit weapon cargoes.\n\nThe PSI also supports the maintenance of an informal network of transgovernmental linkages that sustain cooperation outside of the formal PSI framework.\n\nIn the United States, the program is managed by the [[United States National Security Council#Staff|National Security Staff]] working out of the [[White House]], with the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]] playing lead roles; with other departments and agencies in supporting roles.\n\nParticipation in PSI activities generally include OEG meetings, live exercises, command post exercises, tabletop exercises, seminars, workshops, and other WMD Interdiction\ntraining.<ref>http://www.stratcom.mil/factsheets/Proliferation_Security_Initiative_Support_Cell/</ref> Current members include:<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/c27732.htm United States Department of State]</ref>\n\n*Afghanistan\n*Albania\n*Andorra\n*Angola\n*Antigua and Barbuda\n*Argentina\n*Armenia\n*Australia\n*Austria\n*Azerbaijan\n*Bahamas, The\n*Bahrain\n*Belarus\n*Belgium\n*Belize\n*Bosnia\n*Brunei Darussalam\n*Bulgaria\n*Cambodia\n*Canada\n*Chile\n*Colombia\n*Croatia\n*Cyprus\n*Czech Republic\n*Denmark\n*Djibouti\n*Dominica\n*Dominican Republic\n*El Salvador\n*Estonia\n*Fiji\n*Finland\n*France\n*Georgia\n*Germany\n*Greece\n*Holy See\n*Honduras\n*Hungary\n*Iceland\n*Iraq\n*Ireland\n*Israel\n*Italy\n*Japan\n*Jordan\n*Kazakhstan\n*Korea, Republic of<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/05/113_45671.html |title = S.

An ongoing effort, the CCP is organized into four elements:\n\nElement 1.  Prohibiting Proliferation-Related Conduct \u2013 Having in place appropriate legal authorities to prohibit and prevent proliferation activity within and across one\u2019s border\n\nElement 2. Inspection and Identification \u2013 The ability to effectively inspect air, land, and sea cargos and to identify proliferation-related materials\n\nElement 3. Seizure and Disposition \u2013 The ability to undertake appropriate actions to seize and dispose of interdiction-related materials\n\nElement 4. Rapid Decision Making \u2013 The development of decision-making practices that facilitate timely government responses to interdiction scenarios\n\nExamples of these capacity building tools include:\n\n\u2022 Model Legislation\n\n\u2022 Commodity identification guides and associated training\n\n\u2022 Legal analyses of UN Security Council Resolutions\n\n\u2022 Expert briefings on inspection methodologies\n\n\u2022 Best practices associated with information sharing and decision-making procedures\n\nThe CCP effort is advanced by the CCP Review Team, launched in 2015.  The Review Team seeks to enhance the resources available to PSI endorsing countries through compiling a library of tools and resources and through assisting in the coordination of capacity building events and exercises.  Review Team members include: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, and the United States.\n\n==Interdictions and Events==\nThe PSI has no central body or secretariat and is not a coordinator of real-world interdictions.  It is a political commitment, a flexible arrangement of international cooperation and is consistent with domestic and international legal authorities. Endorsing states seek a robust capacity to conduct interdictions that usually involve only two or three governments.\n \n* On December 9, 2002 the {{ship|SPS|Navarra}} intercepted and boarded the freighter ''So San'', several hundred miles southeast of Yemen at the request of the U.S. government as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. The ''So San'', sailing without a flag, attempted evasive action, so the ''Navarra'' after firing four warning shots into the water at the bow of the ship and rifle fire on the ship's hull, getting no answer, fired on a cable crossing the ''So San'' from bow to stern to remove obstacles and proceeded to approach it from a helicopter. The ship from North Korea was carrying a cargo of 15 [[Scud]] missiles, 15 conventional warheads with 250&nbsp;kg of high explosive, 23 fuel tanks of nitric acid and 85 drums of chemicals. Yemen subsequently reported that the cargo belonged to them and protested against interception, ordering the materials returned.<ref name=nyt-20021212>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/12/12/world/threats-responses-war-materiel-reluctant-us-gives-assent-for-missiles-go-yemen.html |title=THREATS AND RESPONSES: WAR MATERIEL; Reluctant U.S. Gives Assent For Missiles to Go to Yemen |author=David E.

The German government dispatched intelligence experts to Italy, who conducted an inspection of the ship in the Mediterranean with the support of the US Navy. The inspection revealed that the ship's container number was fabricated and the German government confiscated the nuclear-related equipment (aluminum tubes that can be converted into [[centrifuge]]s).<ref>http://www.mod.go.jp/e/publ/w_paper/pdf/2007/39Part3_Chap3_Sec3.pdf</ref> Although some sources cite this interdiction as an early success of the PSI, others dispute the initiative's relationship to this event.\n*In an embarrassing \"failure\" of the PSI, in April 2005 Germany authorized the export of a high-tech crane aboard the vessel Hual Africa that could be utilized in [[Iran]]'s [[Shahab-4]] missile program.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,353917,00.html |title = Germany's Iran Headache: Will a German Crane be Used by the Mullahs to Make Missiles? - DER SPIEGEL - International}}</ref>\n*In June 2009, the North Korean vessel Kang Nam believed to be headed to [[Myanmar]] turned around after being tracked by the US Navy.

The failure of the North Korean crew to comply with the orders of its flag arguably made it a \"stateless\" vessel under international maritime law, however the ship was allowed to return to North Korea. Although the materials were not \"interdicted\" or even inspected to verify a violation, the fact that the commodity never reached its planned target arguably made it a \"success\" for PSI.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://rolandsanjuan.blogspot.com/2011/06/maritime-counter-proliferation-case-of.html |title = Roland San Juan: Maritime Counter-proliferation: The Case of MV Light|date = 29 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Exercises==\nPSI activities include the regular holding of activities known as \"exercises,\" which aim to test the authorities and capabilities of endorsee nations to interdict WMD-related materials. Exercises can include \"live action\" events such as ship boardings or container searches, or be limited to \"tabletop\" activities where subject matter experts explore legal and operational interdiction questions related to a fictional scenario.

In particular, it's argued that Article 23 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) allows ships \"carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances\" the right of innocent passage through territorial seas.<ref>http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2505.html</ref> Opponents have asserted that the PSI gives states a license to carry out acts of \"piracy\" on the high seas.<ref>http://www.anti-imperialist.org/korea-piracy_9-16-03.html</ref> It has also been argued the PSI's intent to \"interdict nuclear materials and contraband\" is a broad enough charter to include any naval operation anywhere and for any actual purpose. There are concerns that such actions could lead to war.<ref>http://world.mediamonitors.net/Headlines/Proliferation-Security-Initiative-and-the-US-1-000-Ship-Navy-Control-of-the-World-s-Oceans-Prelude-to-War</ref> Indonesia's Foreign Minister [[Hassan Wirajuda]] argued that the PSI \"initiative was not initiated through a multilateral process, but only a group of nations that have a common goal to conduct a certain initiatives.\" He also believed that PSI violates the UNCLOS.

Several PSI-endorsee states have diplomatic and trade relationships with Iran, the DPRK, and other states suggested as likely targets.\n\n===Perception as a \"US-led\" initiative===\n\nThe preponderance of news sources and academic analysis on the initiative often describe PSI as being a \"US-led\" initiative.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-n-koreas-nuclear-test-south-korea-jo/466266/ | title=After N Korea's nuclear test, South Korea joins US-led PSI - Indian Express}}</ref><ref>http://aao.sinica.edu.tw/download/publication_list/en/99.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/North_Korea_Blasts_Seoul_Over_US_Led_Sea_Drills_999.html |title = North Korea Blasts Seoul over US-Led Sea Drills}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/13/stories/2004011301331300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Singapore joins U.S.-led security initiative | date=January 13, 2004}}</ref><ref>http://www.armscontrol.org/print/1586</ref>  Like the issue of whether PSI targets specific states, participants in the initiative itself explicitly deny that it is an effort \"led\" by the United States and that PSI is truly defined by the nonproliferation activities of endorsing nations.\n\nMuch early criticism of the initiative also explicitly linked PSI to other international activities of the globally controversial [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], including namely the [[War on Terror]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] to overthrow the [[Taliban]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]],  and a general international perception of US [[unilateralism]] outside of United Nations frameworks. Domestically in the United States, [[Progressivism in the United States|liberal]] critics referenced the PSI and its links to Under-Secretary Bolton as an extension of the Bush Administration's \"[[Coalition of the willing]].\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://antiwar.com/prather/?articleid=9686 | title=Bolton and the PSI Posse| date=12 September 2006}}</ref>  However, over time much of these criticisms have subsided as PSI activities grew to have large [[bipartisan]] support<ref>https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34327.pdf</ref> in the [[United States Congress]] and the PSI continued to be promoted under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama]].\n\nWith President Obama's continued promotion of the initiative and commitment to expand and institutionalize it, many initial opponents of the initiative have reduced their negative comments and begun efforts to explore joining the initiative in order to be recognized as a player in global non-proliferation efforts.<ref>http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=4919</ref>\n\n===Lack of transparency===\n\nSome criticism of PSI has been pointed towards the \"secretive\" nature of the initiative. It has been argued that \"the secretiveness surrounding PSI interdictions and the methods employed make it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness or its legitimacy,\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/forum/security/08043Valencia.html |title = Policy Forum 08-043: Put the Proliferation Security Initiative Under the UN|date = 29 May 2008}}</ref> and that the lack of formality and structure in the initiative are causes for concern.<ref>https://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/lrv_issues_v35n02_i01.pdf</ref>\n\nIn a June 2006 speech, then-Undersecretary of State [[Robert Joseph]] claimed that between April 2005 and April 2006 the United States had cooperated with other PSI participants on \"roughly two dozen\" occasions to prevent transfers of concern; and in May 2005 Ulrik Federspiel, [[Denmark]]\u2019s ambassador to the United States, asserted that \"the shipment of missiles has fallen significantly in the lifetime of PSI.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/PSI |title = The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) at a Glance &#124; Arms Control Association}}</ref>  However, references such as these provide no actual information on or evidence of interdictions which have occurred, leaving critics to remain skeptical of such numbers or of any \"metrics\" that prove the effectiveness of the initiative.\n\nWhile these criticisms persist, many PSI events, such as annual Operational Experts Group meetings, contain a very high degree of civil society participation.  Think tanks and industry representatives, for instance, participated in the 2016 Operational Experts Group meeting and were permitted to Tweet throughout.\n\n===Responses to criticism===\n\nMuch of the criticism about the PSI have been faced with counter-arguments, given the inaccurate or outdated nature of much of the information about the initiative. The most common negative portrayal of PSI represents it as an illegal, US-led effort to interdict third party vessels on the high seas. PSI proponents have countered that:\n\n*United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540|1540]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.un.org/sc/1540/ | title=1540 Committee}}</ref> places an international obligation on all Members of the UN to take action against the proliferation of WMD, and its language matches closely with the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles.\n*UNSCRs [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874|1874]] (on the DPRK's WMD program) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929|1929]] (on Iran's WMD program) explicitly call on or require UN Members to take interdiction and inspection actions against WMD-related materials that are consistent with PSI's principles. Thus inspection of such vessels are international mandates rather than \"piracy,\" as accused by DPRK and Iran.\n*Article 4 of the [[2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]] illegalize the illicit transfer of WMD-related materials by maritime vessel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.stimson.org/proliferation-security-initiative-/ |title = The Proliferation Security Initiative: Too Much, Too Soon \u2022 Stimson Center|date = 13 August 2007}}</ref>\n* The 2010 [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) \"[[Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation]]\" and \"[[Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]\" illegalize the illicit transfer of WMD-related materials by aircraft.<ref>http://www.icao.int/icao/en/jr/2011/6601_en.pdf</ref>\n*Contrary to comments that the PSI works \"outside\" of international frameworks such as the United Nations, UN officials including [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] have \"applaud[ed] the efforts of the Proliferation Security Initiative to fill a gap in our defenses.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://npsglobal.org/eng/component/content/article/147-articles/304-the-proliferation-security-initiative-psi-alberto-dojas-.html | title=The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), Alberto Dojas}}</ref>\n* In February 2004, the PSI was \"expanded\" beyond a military and intelligence effort to include greater cooperation with law enforcement entities.<ref>http://www.nti.org/e_research/source_docs/us/congress/congressional_research_service/88.pdf</ref> PSI has largely evolved from a focus on interdiction of ships at sea to [[Customs|inspection in ports]].<ref>http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/38north_SR_PSI.pdf</ref>\n* The vast majority of PSI exercises (see exercises section above) include activities involving customs services, law enforcement officials, and focus on cargo traveling by air and land as well as sea - including cargo transiting within a country's territory. This directly contradicts the common perceptions of PSI as military, maritime or [[International waters|high seas]]-focused.\n* As noted within the PSI principles, PSI is an \"activity, not an organization\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/PSI |title = The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) at a Glance &#124; Arms Control Association}}</ref> and grants no state any additional authorities to take action. All states are merely asked to take actions consistent with domestic and international law. Therefore, PSI as an initiative explicitly recommends only actions within international and domestic legal authorities.\n* A large portion of states which have been critical of PSI consider themselves part of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which indicates that while nominally claiming objections to the initiative for \"legal\" reasons, actual hesitation towards endorsement might be more aligned with political considerations, such as not wanting to be seen as supporting United States or \"[[Western world#Modern political|Western]]\" initiatives.\n*China's objections for supposed legal reasons also come into question, as it has been identified as a neighboring country which has supported transshipment of DPRK's WMD materials, and \"turns a blind eye to North Korea\u2019s proliferation whenever it can get away with it.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20110516_4732.php |title = Home Security Systems : My Home Security}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.freekorea.us/2011/06/14/another-north-korean-vessel-intercepted-turned-around/ |title = Another North Korean Vessel Intercepted, Turned Around|date = 14 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[http://www.biosecuritycommons.com/international/international-conventionslaws/proliferation-security-initiative]\n*[http://www.psi-online.info/ PSI Website (Hosted by Germany)]\n*[[Container Security Initiative]]\n*[[Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism]]\n*[[Nuclear proliferation]]\n*[[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]\n*[[Global Trade Exchange]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\nTimeline resources and general review of PSI at [http://biosecuritycommons.org/index.php?title=PSI '''Biosecurity Commons'''], A Wiki Database [http://biosecuritycommons.org/index.php?title=PSI]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.psi-online.info/ PSI website (hosted by Germany)]\n* Official United States Department of State [https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/c10390.htm PSI Homepage]\n* {{cite journal |journal=World Nuclear Fuel Cycle 2004 |title=The Nuclear Fuel Cycle and the Bush Nonproliferation Initiative |author=Thomas L.

On September 4, 2003, in [[Paris]], these countries detailed the principles governing the PSI in a document titled the \"Statement of Interdiction Principles\". The document defines the activities which are to be undertaken by the initiative, specifically \"to establish a more coordinated and effective basis through which to impede and stop shipments of WMD, delivery systems, and related materials flowing to and from states and non-state actors of proliferation concern, consistent with national legal authorities and relevant international law and frameworks, including the UN Security Council circumstances in which such operations may be carried out (at sea, on land, or in the air) including, most importantly, the requirement that any action taken must be consistent with international law.\"<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/c27726.htm United States Department of State]</ref> Since the initial core group of 2003, PSI has expanded to include an \"Operational Experts Group\" (OEG) of 21 nations<ref>http://125.60.3.200/news.do?mode=detail&thiscode=eng030001&guid=51100</ref> as well as 84 other endorsing states. Key states who have endorsed the initiative since its initial founding include major actors in [[international trade]] such as Singapore and the [[United Arab Emirates]], as well as countries such as [[Turkey]] and the Republic of Korea, who are geographically close to states designated by [[United Nations Security Council resolution]]s as proliferation threats.\n\nEleven nations have signed bilateral [[Mutual Shipboarding Agreements]] with the United States, allowing the mutual expedition of shipboarding requests for ships under those nations' flags.  The Eleven are the [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Bahamas]], [[Belize]], [[Croatia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Liberia]], [[Malta]], the [[Marshall Islands]], [[Mongolia]], [[Panama]] and [[St. Vincent and the Grenadines]]. Each of these nations maintains a large number of commercial vessels on their registries, and are often considered [[flag of convenience]] states.<ref>For the text of these bilateral agreements, see [https://2001-2009.state.gov/t/isn/c12386.htm this U.S. Department of State web page]</ref><ref>For an academic analysis of shipboarding in the PSI context, see {{cite journal |author=Fabio Spadi|year=2006 |title=Bolstering the Proliferation Security Initiative at Sea: A Comparative Analysis of Ship-boarding as a Bilateral and Multilateral Implementing Mechanism |journal=Nordic Journal of International Law |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=249\u2013278 |doi=10.1163/157181006778666614}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2009, at a speech in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]], newly inaugurated President [[Barack Obama]] announced that he planned to transform the PSI into a \"durable international institution\",<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/04/obama_nuclear_proliferation.html |title = Obama's Speech on Nuclear Proliferation &#124; RealClearPolitics}}</ref> indicating that US promotion of the initiative would remain non-partisan and cross over from the previous administration.  Indeed, Obama had made the strengthening of the PSI one of his campaign promises in the [[2008 United States presidential election|Presidential election of 2008]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/192/strengthen-the-proliferation-security-initiative/ |title = The Obameter: &#124; PolitiFact}}</ref> and continued to promote the PSI through the 2010 White House Nuclear Security Strategy.\n\nThe 2013 PSI High Level Political Meeting facilitated the adoption of a set of four Joint Statements, advancing cooperation among PSI endorsing states toward:\n-  Ensuring a Robust Initiative\n-  Enhancing Critical Interdiction Capabilities and Practices\n-  Strengthening Authorities for Action\n-  Expanding Strategic Communications\n\nProgress on implementation was reviewed at the PSI Mid-Level Political Meeting in January 2016, hosted in Washington, DC.  Another PSI High Level Political Meeting will be hosted in France in 2018.\n\nThe PSI has evolved considerably since 2003, embracing a much wider array of proliferation security issues, such as customs enforcement, export controls, proliferation finance, and intangible transfers of technology.  Given its broad and flexible mandate, the PSI now plays a vital role in advancing proliferation security norms and standards of practice.\n\n== Participation ==\n[[File:Map of Proliferation Security Initiative states.png|thumb|upright=2.0|alt=102 PSI-endorsing states as of April 2013.|PSI-endorsing states, as of 2013]]\nThe primary role of PSI participants is to abide by the '''Statement of Interdiction Principles''', with the primary purpose of interdicting subject weapons and materials.  Additionally, participants are recommended to enact legal statutes to facilitate effective interdiction and seizure of such items.  Finally, participants are to take measures to ensure that their national facilities are not utilized to transfer illicit weapon cargoes.\n\nThe PSI also supports the maintenance of an informal network of transgovernmental linkages that sustain cooperation outside of the formal PSI framework.\n\nIn the United States, the program is managed by the [[United States National Security Council#Staff|National Security Staff]] working out of the [[White House]], with the [[United States Department of State]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]] playing lead roles; with other departments and agencies in supporting roles.\n\nParticipation in PSI activities generally include OEG meetings, live exercises, command post exercises, tabletop exercises, seminars, workshops, and other WMD Interdiction\ntraining.<ref>http://www.stratcom.mil/factsheets/Proliferation_Security_Initiative_Support_Cell/</ref> Current members include:<ref>[https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/c27732.htm United States Department of State]</ref>\n\n*Afghanistan\n*Albania\n*Andorra\n*Angola\n*Antigua and Barbuda\n*Argentina\n*Armenia\n*Australia\n*Austria\n*Azerbaijan\n*Bahamas, The\n*Bahrain\n*Belarus\n*Belgium\n*Belize\n*Bosnia\n*Brunei Darussalam\n*Bulgaria\n*Cambodia\n*Canada\n*Chile\n*Colombia\n*Croatia\n*Cyprus\n*Czech Republic\n*Denmark\n*Djibouti\n*Dominica\n*Dominican Republic\n*El Salvador\n*Estonia\n*Fiji\n*Finland\n*France\n*Georgia\n*Germany\n*Greece\n*Holy See\n*Honduras\n*Hungary\n*Iceland\n*Iraq\n*Ireland\n*Israel\n*Italy\n*Japan\n*Jordan\n*Kazakhstan\n*Korea, Republic of<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/05/113_45671.html |title = S.

An ongoing effort, the CCP is organized into four elements:\n\nElement 1.  Prohibiting Proliferation-Related Conduct \u2013 Having in place appropriate legal authorities to prohibit and prevent proliferation activity within and across one\u2019s border\n\nElement 2. Inspection and Identification \u2013 The ability to effectively inspect air, land, and sea cargos and to identify proliferation-related materials\n\nElement 3. Seizure and Disposition \u2013 The ability to undertake appropriate actions to seize and dispose of interdiction-related materials\n\nElement 4. Rapid Decision Making \u2013 The development of decision-making practices that facilitate timely government responses to interdiction scenarios\n\nExamples of these capacity building tools include:\n\n\u2022 Model Legislation\n\n\u2022 Commodity identification guides and associated training\n\n\u2022 Legal analyses of UN Security Council Resolutions\n\n\u2022 Expert briefings on inspection methodologies\n\n\u2022 Best practices associated with information sharing and decision-making procedures\n\nThe CCP effort is advanced by the CCP Review Team, launched in 2015.  The Review Team seeks to enhance the resources available to PSI endorsing countries through compiling a library of tools and resources and through assisting in the coordination of capacity building events and exercises.  Review Team members include: Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Norway, Poland, Russia, and the United States.\n\n==Interdictions and Events==\nThe PSI has no central body or secretariat and is not a coordinator of real-world interdictions.  It is a political commitment, a flexible arrangement of international cooperation and is consistent with domestic and international legal authorities. Endorsing states seek a robust capacity to conduct interdictions that usually involve only two or three governments.\n \n* On December 9, 2002 the {{ship|SPS|Navarra}} intercepted and boarded the freighter ''So San'', several hundred miles southeast of Yemen at the request of the U.S. government as part of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]]. The ''So San'', sailing without a flag, attempted evasive action, so the ''Navarra'' after firing four warning shots into the water at the bow of the ship and rifle fire on the ship's hull, getting no answer, fired on a cable crossing the ''So San'' from bow to stern to remove obstacles and proceeded to approach it from a helicopter. The ship from North Korea was carrying a cargo of 15 [[Scud]] missiles, 15 conventional warheads with 250&nbsp;kg of high explosive, 23 fuel tanks of nitric acid and 85 drums of chemicals.

The failure of the North Korean crew to comply with the orders of its flag arguably made it a \"stateless\" vessel under international maritime law, however the ship was allowed to return to North Korea. Although the materials were not \"interdicted\" or even inspected to verify a violation, the fact that the commodity never reached its planned target arguably made it a \"success\" for PSI.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://rolandsanjuan.blogspot.com/2011/06/maritime-counter-proliferation-case-of.html |title = Roland San Juan: Maritime Counter-proliferation: The Case of MV Light|date = 29 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Exercises==\nPSI activities include the regular holding of activities known as \"exercises,\" which aim to test the authorities and capabilities of endorsee nations to interdict WMD-related materials. Exercises can include \"live action\" events such as ship boardings or container searches, or be limited to \"tabletop\" activities where subject matter experts explore legal and operational interdiction questions related to a fictional scenario.

In particular, it's argued that Article 23 of the [[United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]] (UNCLOS) allows ships \"carrying nuclear or other inherently dangerous or noxious substances\" the right of innocent passage through territorial seas.<ref>http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2505.html</ref> Opponents have asserted that the PSI gives states a license to carry out acts of \"piracy\" on the high seas.<ref>http://www.anti-imperialist.org/korea-piracy_9-16-03.html</ref> It has also been argued the PSI's intent to \"interdict nuclear materials and contraband\" is a broad enough charter to include any naval operation anywhere and for any actual purpose. There are concerns that such actions could lead to war.<ref>http://world.mediamonitors.net/Headlines/Proliferation-Security-Initiative-and-the-US-1-000-Ship-Navy-Control-of-the-World-s-Oceans-Prelude-to-War</ref> Indonesia's Foreign Minister [[Hassan Wirajuda]] argued that the PSI \"initiative was not initiated through a multilateral process, but only a group of nations that have a common goal to conduct a certain initiatives.\" He also believed that PSI violates the UNCLOS. (Xinhua News Agency, March 17, 2006). Other critics have argued that PSI activities violate international laws regarding self-defense, Articles 19 and 88 of UNCLOS.<ref>https://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/lrv_issues_v35n02_i01.pdf</ref> A large proportion of criticisms of the legality of PSI come from Indian news sources.<ref>http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers10%5Cpaper969.html</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.idsa.in/strategicanalysis/IndiasParticipationintheProliferationSecurityInitiative_avkumar_2009 | title=India's Participation in the Proliferation Security Initiative: Issues in Perspective &#124; Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-08-25/india/27993487_1_present-sanctuaries-terrorist-movements-counter-terrorism-measures | work=The Times Of India | title=India's fears of terror-via-sea real: US | date=August 25, 2007}}</ref> Criticism over the legality of PSI also focus around the fact that the initiative does not fall under any United Nations committee or body, and that doing so might legitimize it.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/forum/security/08043Valencia.html |title = Policy Forum 08-043: Put the Proliferation Security Initiative Under the UN|date = 29 May 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Targets specific states===\n\nMany of academic and news articles about the initiative state that the PSI is focused specifically on states such as Iran and the DPRK.<ref>http://www.nuclearfiles.org/menu/key-issues/nuclear-weapons/issues/governance/psi/BP53%5B1%5D.pdf</ref>  North Korea has stated that it feels the PSI is an instrument for an aggressive war planned by the United States against the DPRK under the pretext of blockading ships and planes.<ref>http://www.kcna.co.jp/item/2009/200905/news27/20090527-17ee.html</ref> Indian publications discouraging participation in PSI have defined PSI as being specifically directed towards Iran and have stated that \"India on no account should be a part of any anti-Iranian strategic initiative led by the United States.\"<ref>http://www.southasiaanalysis.org/%5Cpapers10%5Cpaper969.html</ref>  Other potential suggested targets of PSI have included [[Syria]], Myanmar, and Pakistan.\n\nDespite these accusations and perceptions, all official PSI documentation and press releases state that PSI does not target any particular state, and that individual nations within the initiative are able to make self-determinations on what shipments are targeted. Several PSI-endorsee states have diplomatic and trade relationships with Iran, the DPRK, and other states suggested as likely targets.\n\n===Perception as a \"US-led\" initiative===\n\nThe preponderance of news sources and academic analysis on the initiative often describe PSI as being a \"US-led\" initiative.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/after-n-koreas-nuclear-test-south-korea-jo/466266/ | title=After N Korea\ufffds nuclear test, South Korea joins US-led PSI - Indian Express}}</ref><ref>http://aao.sinica.edu.tw/download/publication_list/en/99.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/North_Korea_Blasts_Seoul_Over_US_Led_Sea_Drills_999.html |title = North Korea Blasts Seoul over US-Led Sea Drills}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/13/stories/2004011301331300.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Singapore joins U.S.-led security initiative | date=January 13, 2004}}</ref><ref>http://www.armscontrol.org/print/1586</ref>  Like the issue of whether PSI targets specific states, participants in the initiative itself explicitly deny that it is an effort \"led\" by the United States and that PSI is truly defined by the nonproliferation activities of endorsing nations.\n\nMuch early criticism of the initiative also explicitly linked PSI to other international activities of the globally controversial [[Presidency of George W. Bush|George W. Bush administration]], including namely the [[War on Terror]], [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] to overthrow the [[Taliban]], the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]],  and a general international perception of US [[unilateralism]] outside of United Nations frameworks. Domestically in the United States, [[Progressivism in the United States|liberal]] critics referenced the PSI and its links to Under-Secretary Bolton as an extension of the Bush Administration's \"[[Coalition of the willing]].\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://antiwar.com/prather/?articleid=9686 | title=Bolton and the PSI Posse| date=12 September 2006}}</ref>  However, over time much of these criticisms have subsided as PSI activities grew to have large [[bipartisan]] support<ref>https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34327.pdf</ref> in the [[United States Congress]] and the PSI continued to be promoted under the [[Presidency of Barack Obama]].\n\nWith President Obama's continued promotion of the initiative and commitment to expand and institutionalize it, many initial opponents of the initiative have reduced their negative comments and begun efforts to explore joining the initiative in order to be recognized as a player in global non-proliferation efforts.<ref>http://www.boloji.com/index.cfm?md=Content&sd=Articles&ArticleID=4919</ref>\n\n===Lack of transparency===\n\nSome criticism of PSI has been pointed towards the \"secretive\" nature of the initiative. It has been argued that \"the secretiveness surrounding PSI interdictions and the methods employed make it difficult to evaluate its effectiveness or its legitimacy,\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nautilus.org/publications/essays/napsnet/forum/security/08043Valencia.html |title = Policy Forum 08-043: Put the Proliferation Security Initiative Under the UN|date = 29 May 2008}}</ref> and that the lack of formality and structure in the initiative are causes for concern.<ref>https://law.hofstra.edu/pdf/lrv_issues_v35n02_i01.pdf</ref>\n\nIn a June 2006 speech, then-Undersecretary of State [[Robert Joseph]] claimed that between April 2005 and April 2006 the United States had cooperated with other PSI participants on \"roughly two dozen\" occasions to prevent transfers of concern; and in May 2005 Ulrik Federspiel, [[Denmark]]\u2019s ambassador to the United States, asserted that \"the shipment of missiles has fallen significantly in the lifetime of PSI.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/PSI |title = The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) at a Glance &#124; Arms Control Association}}</ref>  However, references such as these provide no actual information on or evidence of interdictions which have occurred, leaving critics to remain skeptical of such numbers or of any \"metrics\" that prove the effectiveness of the initiative.\n\nWhile these criticisms persist, many PSI events, such as annual Operational Experts Group meetings, contain a very high degree of civil society participation.  Think tanks and industry representatives, for instance, participated in the 2016 Operational Experts Group meeting and were permitted to Tweet throughout.\n\n===Responses to criticism===\n\nMuch of the criticism about the PSI have been faced with counter-arguments, given the inaccurate or outdated nature of much of the information about the initiative. The most common negative portrayal of PSI represents it as an illegal, US-led effort to interdict third party vessels on the high seas. PSI proponents have countered that:\n\n*United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1540|1540]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.un.org/sc/1540/ | title=1540 Committee}}</ref> places an international obligation on all Members of the UN to take action against the proliferation of WMD, and its language matches closely with the PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles.\n*UNSCRs [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874|1874]] (on the DPRK's WMD program) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929|1929]] (on Iran's WMD program) explicitly call on or require UN Members to take interdiction and inspection actions against WMD-related materials that are consistent with PSI's principles. Thus inspection of such vessels are international mandates rather than \"piracy,\" as accused by DPRK and Iran.\n*Article 4 of the [[2005 Protocol to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation]] illegalize the illicit transfer of WMD-related materials by maritime vessel.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.stimson.org/proliferation-security-initiative-/ |title = The Proliferation Security Initiative: Too Much, Too Soon \u2022 Stimson Center|date = 13 August 2007}}</ref>\n* The 2010 [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) \"[[Convention on the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Relating to International Civil Aviation]]\" and \"[[Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft]]\" illegalize the illicit transfer of WMD-related materials by aircraft.<ref>http://www.icao.int/icao/en/jr/2011/6601_en.pdf</ref>\n*Contrary to comments that the PSI works \"outside\" of international frameworks such as the United Nations, UN officials including [[United Nations Secretary General|Secretary General]] [[Kofi Annan]] have \"applaud[ed] the efforts of the Proliferation Security Initiative to fill a gap in our defenses.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://npsglobal.org/eng/component/content/article/147-articles/304-the-proliferation-security-initiative-psi-alberto-dojas-.html | title=The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), Alberto Dojas}}</ref>\n* In February 2004, the PSI was \"expanded\" beyond a military and intelligence effort to include greater cooperation with law enforcement entities.<ref>http://www.nti.org/e_research/source_docs/us/congress/congressional_research_service/88.pdf</ref> PSI has largely evolved from a focus on interdiction of ships at sea to [[Customs|inspection in ports]].<ref>http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/38north_SR_PSI.pdf</ref>\n* The vast majority of PSI exercises (see exercises section above) include activities involving customs services, law enforcement officials, and focus on cargo traveling by air and land as well as sea - including cargo transiting within a country's territory. This directly contradicts the common perceptions of PSI as military, maritime or [[International waters|high seas]]-focused.\n* As noted within the PSI principles, PSI is an \"activity, not an organization\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.armscontrol.org/factsheets/PSI |title = The Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI) at a Glance &#124; Arms Control Association}}</ref> and grants no state any additional authorities to take action. All states are merely asked to take actions consistent with domestic and international law. Therefore, PSI as an initiative explicitly recommends only actions within international and domestic legal authorities.\n* A large portion of states which have been critical of PSI consider themselves part of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which indicates that while nominally claiming objections to the initiative for \"legal\" reasons, actual hesitation towards endorsement might be more aligned with political considerations, such as not wanting to be seen as supporting United States or \"[[Western world#Modern political|Western]]\" initiatives.\n*China's objections for supposed legal reasons also come into question, as it has been identified as a neighboring country which has supported transshipment of DPRK's WMD materials, and \"turns a blind eye to North Korea\u2019s proliferation whenever it can get away with it.\"<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20110516_4732.php |title = Home Security Systems : My Home Security}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.freekorea.us/2011/06/14/another-north-korean-vessel-intercepted-turned-around/ |title = Another North Korean Vessel Intercepted, Turned Around|date = 14 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[http://www.biosecuritycommons.com/international/international-conventionslaws/proliferation-security-initiative]\n*[http://www.psi-online.info/ PSI Website (Hosted by Germany)]\n*[[Container Security Initiative]]\n*[[Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism]]\n*[[Nuclear proliferation]]\n*[[Chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear]]\n*[[Global Trade Exchange]]\n\n==Additional Resources==\nTimeline resources and general review of PSI at [http://biosecuritycommons.org/index.php?title=PSI '''Biosecurity Commons'''], A Wiki Database [http://biosecuritycommons.org/index.php?title=PSI]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.psi-online.info/ PSI website (hosted by Germany)]\n* Official United States Department of State [https://2009-2017.state.gov/t/isn/c10390.htm PSI Homepage]\n* {{cite journal |journal=World Nuclear Fuel Cycle 2004 |title=The Nuclear Fuel Cycle and the Bush Nonproliferation Initiative |author=Thomas L.

This was the last film produced by [[Imagi Animation Studios]] before the company shut down on February 5, 2010. The film was first released in Hong Kong on October 8, 2009, and in the United States on October 23, 2009. It received mixed reviews from film critics and was a [[box office bomb]], earning {{US$|42 million|long=no}} worldwide on a {{US$|65 million|long=no}} budget.\n\n==Plot==\nToby Tenma is a gifted 13-years-old teenager boy who lives in Metro City, a futuristic [[city-state]] that floats above the now-polluted surface of the earth. Toby's dad, [[Dr. Tenma]], is a famous [[roboticist]] and Minister of Science, but has a distant relationship with Toby. Dr. Tenma meets the city's obstructive corrupt leader President Stone to demonstrate a new, advanced defensive robot called the Peacekeeper, to be powered by Dr. Tenma's best friend [[Dr. Elefun]]'s newest creations, the Blue and Red Cores, two energy cores that emit respective opposing positive and negative energy. Against the scientists' warnings, Stone, desperate to win re-election, loads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper. This causes it to go berserk and Toby, who had snuck into the room, is accidentally disintegrated by the Peacekeeper before it can be shut down.\n\nA distraught-driven Tenma secretly constructs a robot replica of Toby, complete with all of Toby's memories, but with built-in defenses to protect him.  Powered by the Blue Core, the replica is activated and believes himself to be Toby, but although he has Toby's mind and a similar personality, it makes him become an unfortunate reminder to Tenma about Toby's death. The replica discovers his robot capabilities including the ability to understand non-talking robots and rocket-powered flight, but he flies away upon learning from Tenma about his origins and being rejected by him, much to Elefun's sadness. Stone has his forces pursue the replica, but the battle leads to him falling off the city edge onto the surface when Stone's flagship blasts him with missiles. Tenma escapes arrest by agreeing to deactivate the replica and give up the blue sphere.\n\nThe replica awakens in an enormous junkyard, created from the redundant robots dumped by Metro City. He meets a group of children, illiterate but smart Zane, twins Sludge and Widget, and the oldest Cora who has a grudge against Metro City, that are accompanied by a dog-like waste disposal robot named Trashcan. The replica also meets the members of the Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF), Sparx the brains, Robotsky the muscle, and Mike the Fridge, who wish to free robots from mankind's control, but they are very inept and bound by the Laws of Robots. However, they give the robot replica renamed \"Astro\". Astro departs with the children and finds people still live on the surface. He is taken in by robot repairman Hamegg, who also runs a robot fighting ring. The next day, Astro comes across an old, offline construction robot, Zog, whom he revives by sharing some of the Blue Core's energy. Hamegg accidentally scans Astro, finding out he is a robot and paralyzes him with his electrical blaster the next day to use him in the fighting ring.\n\nAstro reluctantly defeats Hamegg's fighters until Zog is deployed. He refuses to fight Zog and finds that Zog refuses to fight him. When Hamegg cruelly assaults them both, Zog, who predates the Laws of Robotics, fights back. However, Astro protects Hamegg. Stone's forces arrive to take Astro back to Metro City, and he willingly goes with them. Reuniting with Tenma and Elefun, Astro agrees to be deactivated, apologizing to his father for not being a satisfying way to replace Toby. Realizing that even though Astro isn't Toby, he's still his son, Dr. Tenma reactivates him and lets him escape. Furious, Stone reloads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper to send it after Astro, only for it to absorb him and take on his personality. The Peacekeeper then absorbs weapons and buildings, causing it to become as big as skyscrapers and terrorizes Metro City, prompting Astro to battle it. During the fight, as Astro's surface friends try to help him, Metro City's power station is destroyed, causing it to fall to the ground. Astro uses his superhuman strength to help it land safely.\n\nThe Peacekeeper tries absorbing Astro to obtain his core, but the connection of their cores causes them both pain before separating them. Dr. Tenma finds Astro and informs him if the two cores unite, they will be destroyed. When the children are captured, Astro selflessly flies into the Red Core, destroying the Peacekeeper. Stone survives but is arrested for his actions. Elefun and the children find Astro's broken body, mostly intact but lifeless. Zog however, revives Astro by sharing back the Blue Core energy that revived him. As Astro reunites with all his friends and his father, the city is suddenly attacked by a monstrous cycloptic extraterrestrial, and Astro immediately leaps into action.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Freddie Highmore]] as [[Astro Boy]] and Toby Tenma, Astro is a robot duplicate of Toby, Dr. Tenma's son.\n* [[Nicolas Cage]] as [[Doctor Tenma|Dr. Tenma]], Toby's dad, Astro's creator and the Minister of Science of Metro City.\n* [[Kristen Bell]] as Cora,<ref>{{cite news|last=Topel|first=Fred|title=Astro Boy's Kristen Bell ready to win more fanboy hearts as an anime urchin|url=http://blastr.com/2009/07/astro-boys-kristen-bell-o.php|accessdate=April 18, 2012|newspaper=Blastr|date=July 1, 2009}}</ref> a teenage girl who lives on the surface and befriends Astro.\n* [[Samuel L.

It received mixed reviews from film critics and was a [[box office bomb]], earning {{US$|42 million|long=no}} worldwide on a {{US$|65 million|long=no}} budget.\n\n==Plot==\nToby Tenma is a gifted 13-years-old teenager boy who lives in Metro City, a futuristic [[city-state]] that floats above the now-polluted surface of the earth. Toby's dad, [[Dr. Tenma]], is a famous [[roboticist]] and Minister of Science, but has a distant relationship with Toby. Dr. Tenma meets the city's obstructive corrupt leader President Stone to demonstrate a new, advanced defensive robot called the Peacekeeper, to be powered by Dr. Tenma's best friend [[Dr. Elefun]]'s newest creations, the Blue and Red Cores, two energy cores that emit respective opposing positive and negative energy. Against the scientists' warnings, Stone, desperate to win re-election, loads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper. This causes it to go berserk and Toby, who had snuck into the room, is accidentally disintegrated by the Peacekeeper before it can be shut down.\n\nA distraught-driven Tenma secretly constructs a robot replica of Toby, complete with all of Toby's memories, but with built-in defenses to protect him.  Powered by the Blue Core, the replica is activated and believes himself to be Toby, but although he has Toby's mind and a similar personality, it makes him become an unfortunate reminder to Tenma about Toby's death. The replica discovers his robot capabilities including the ability to understand non-talking robots and rocket-powered flight, but he flies away upon learning from Tenma about his origins and being rejected by him, much to Elefun's sadness. Stone has his forces pursue the replica, but the battle leads to him falling off the city edge onto the surface when Stone's flagship blasts him with missiles. Tenma escapes arrest by agreeing to deactivate the replica and give up the blue sphere.\n\nThe replica awakens in an enormous junkyard, created from the redundant robots dumped by Metro City. He meets a group of children, illiterate but smart Zane, twins Sludge and Widget, and the oldest Cora who has a grudge against Metro City, that are accompanied by a dog-like waste disposal robot named Trashcan. The replica also meets the members of the Robot Revolutionary Front (RRF), Sparx the brains, Robotsky the muscle, and Mike the Fridge, who wish to free robots from mankind's control, but they are very inept and bound by the Laws of Robots. However, they give the robot replica renamed \"Astro\". Astro departs with the children and finds people still live on the surface. He is taken in by robot repairman Hamegg, who also runs a robot fighting ring. The next day, Astro comes across an old, offline construction robot, Zog, whom he revives by sharing some of the Blue Core's energy. Hamegg accidentally scans Astro, finding out he is a robot and paralyzes him with his electrical blaster the next day to use him in the fighting ring.\n\nAstro reluctantly defeats Hamegg's fighters until Zog is deployed. He refuses to fight Zog and finds that Zog refuses to fight him. When Hamegg cruelly assaults them both, Zog, who predates the Laws of Robotics, fights back. However, Astro protects Hamegg. Stone's forces arrive to take Astro back to Metro City, and he willingly goes with them. Reuniting with Tenma and Elefun, Astro agrees to be deactivated, apologizing to his father for not being a satisfying way to replace Toby. Realizing that even though Astro isn't Toby, he's still his son, Dr. Tenma reactivates him and lets him escape. Furious, Stone reloads the Red Core into the Peacekeeper to send it after Astro, only for it to absorb him and take on his personality. The Peacekeeper then absorbs weapons and buildings, causing it to become as big as skyscrapers and terrorizes Metro City, prompting Astro to battle it. During the fight, as Astro's surface friends try to help him, Metro City's power station is destroyed, causing it to fall to the ground. Astro uses his superhuman strength to help it land safely.\n\nThe Peacekeeper tries absorbing Astro to obtain his core, but the connection of their cores causes them both pain before separating them. Dr. Tenma finds Astro and informs him if the two cores unite, they will be destroyed. When the children are captured, Astro selflessly flies into the Red Core, destroying the Peacekeeper. Stone survives but is arrested for his actions. Elefun and the children find Astro's broken body, mostly intact but lifeless.

He appears to be fine, despite Mick insisting they should take him to hospital. Linda later finds Ollie is not breathing, but successfully resuscitates him.

After a heist involving Mick, he is suspected of stealing the money and [[Aidan Maguire]] ([[Patrick Bergin]]) frightens Linda when he lets himself into The Queen Vic when he has hold of Ollie.

She gets on well with her father, [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]), and they go for a drink together, where Masood tells Carmel that Shabnam has a daughter that she abandoned seven years ago. Carmel is understanding and offers her support to Shabnam but this just angers Shabnam as it wasn't his place to tell anyone. Carmel visits frequently and Shabnam dislikes her interference with planning the wedding. She is delighted when Shabnam and Kush announce they are expecting. Carmel visits unannounced, distraught that Kush's father is selling her house and Shabnam begrudgingly allows her to stay with them but catches her in bed with Masood. After Kush learns that the baby is dead, Masood contacts Carmel and allows her to stay with him. Before returning to Essex, she and Masood help Kush and Shabnam reconcile for their stillborn son, [[Shabnam Masood#Stillbirth|Zaair]]'s, funeral. Carmel returns in November for the wedding and before they leave for their honeymoon, she promises to run Kush's stall in his absence. She also befriends [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]).\n\nShortly after Kush and Shabnam return, Carmel sees Kush and a pregnant [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) whispering and, after talking to Stacey, she realizes that Kush could be the baby's father. She confronts them but they persuade her not to tell Shabnam or [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]), insisting it is not the right time. Carmel agrees, but warns Stacey that Kush may want access to the baby if it is his.\n\nCarmel returns to the square in the spring, saying that her former husband, [[Umar Kazemi]] ([[Selva Rasalingam]]), is selling her house after all and that she has nowhere to live, so Kush allows her to move in with him and is joined by her youngest son, [[Shakil Kazemi|Shakil]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) a few weeks later. Shakil tells her that Umar wants to meet to discuss a possible reunion but it turns out that Shakil was lying, making Carmel feel unwanted but she and Shakil soon make up. Carmel is encouraged to apply for the job of market Inspector by Denise, and is overjoyed when she gets the job. She gets on the traders' nerves initially but soon learns to work with them. Carmel begins sleeping with Masood and she hopes that it will lead to a relationship but Masood leaves to travel the world, leaving Carmel devastated. She is later shocked to discover Denise is pregnant, telling her to book a scan and pressures her to tell her who the father is, infuriating Denise as the baby's father is [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). When she feels her flat is too crowded, she decides to rent No. 31 after [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) leaves the square. However, Martin opposes her as he wants the house for his family, so Carmel retracts her deposit and decides to rent No. 41, Masood's house instead. Whilst moving in, Masood returns unexpectedly, forcing them to share the house as she has already signed the contract. When [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]) begins a relationship with Masood, she doubts her motives and accuses her of only being with Masood for financial purposes, to save her debt ridden salon, \"Elysium\". However, Belinda leaves the square soon after. Carmel and Denise are later furious to discover that Masood is planning to move to Pakistan and accuses him of leaving to reunite with his former wife [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). They all reconciled before Masood leaves, telling him they'll always be there for him, and watch him leave. Carmel tries to talk Denise out of her decision to give her newborn son up for adoption, but eventually decides to support her, not wanting to end their friendship. Carmel tries to reason with market traders when they hear that the market be relocated. During the dispute, a bus crashes into the market and the viaduct. Carmel survives the crash and worries over Shakil's welfare when she learns he is on board, but is later relieved when he jumps off the top deck safely with the help of the others at the bottom.\n\nCarmel is shocked to discover that naked photos of Shakil have been sent around the school, and is angry to discover it was allegedly Shakil's former girlfriend, [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]) who sent them, although it was really [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]). Due to the tension between the Kazemis and the Fowlers, Martin and Stacey decide that Carmel should keep her distance from her grandson, which Carmel reacts badly to, and in the argument, she and Stacey physically fight after Carmel made a comment on Stacey's mental health.<ref name=\"9mar17pt2\"/> In April 2017, she becomes close to [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]), after he helps her make amends with Stacey, and also helps her with an interview for the Walford Council planning committee. Although she remains oblivious to Max's scheming. When Masood returns from travelling, he informs Carmel that he is not going to renew her tenancy contract. Although disappointed, Carmel asks Max whether they should find a home of their own, which slightly displeases him. Carmel is then delighted that the council has dropped the investigation and decides to make her a full-time employee. Shortly after having sex with Max, Carmel finds an engagement ring while tidying up the house and mistakenly believes Max wants to propose to her, when in fact it is intended for his secret girlfriend [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]). The following day Carmel still believes Max is going to propose to her and prepares to celebrate with him at The Queen Vic. However, when he walks into The Vic, he deliberately ignores her and kisses Fi, humiliating Carmel in front of everyone and finally revealing his scheme. Realising she has been used, Carmel upsettingly storms out of the pub. Carmel and Shakil then moves in with Kush and Denise. While Carmel is at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|the wedding]] of [[Prince Harry]] and [[Meghan Markle]], Shakil is stabbed in the back by a gang and the delay in finding him proves fatal. She rushes to the hospital to be told her son is dead. After hearing that Kush may still leave for Dubai, she feels helpless and tries to commit suicide but she is then strengthened by the discovery of Shakil's watch. She attends Shakil's memorial in the Square's gardens and makes amends with [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]). Shaki's best mate, [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris]]) takes her to where Shaki's killer, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Bruno|Bruno]], lives and offers to square things but Carmel warns him against and they have the police arrest Bruno; outside the police station, Carmel reveals herself to his mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Sophie|Sophie]] ([[Melanie Harris]]). When Carmel finds Keegan in possession of a knife, she anonymously hands it in and decides to campaign for a knife amnesty, where young people can hand in knives to a public knife bin and their identities remain secret. She then tries to start a youth club but fails. At Halloween, Keegan stabs a boy who disrespected Shakil and Carmel allows him to think that the boy died, Carmel and Karen have a heated row leading to Keegan finally being made to see sense. Carmel and Keegan make amends before she moves abroad.\n\nLangford was nominated for the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[Inside Soap Awards#2015|The Inside Soap Awards 2015]] for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref name=InsideSoapLonglist>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a658118/inside-soap-awards-2015-longlist-revealed-whos-in-line-for-best-actor-actress-and-newcomer.html#~pmHi8CWFSFhM6F|title=Inside Soap Awards 2015 longlist revealed: Who's in line for Best Actor, Actress and Newcomer?|work=Digital Spy|date=14 July 2015}}</ref> She also won the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[The British Soap Awards]] in 2016 for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/05/28/british-soap-awards-2016-emmerdale-wins-best-soap-for-the-first/|title=British Soap Awards 2016: Emmerdale wins Best Soap for the first time, Danny Miller and Lacey Turner win in acting categories \u2013 plus full list of winners|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 May 2016|last1=McAloon|first1=Jonathan}}</ref> In September 2016, Laura-Jane Tyler of ''Inside Soap'' described Carmel as the \"life and soul of Walford\" amid a time for the show when it was \"on a low gas\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hits & Misses!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=24\u201330 September 2016|issue=38|pages=98|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines International]]}}</ref> In July 2018, Langford was longlisted for the \"Best Actress\" accolade at [[Inside Soap Awards|The Inside Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a862268/inside-soap-awards-2018-full-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|title=Full list of nominations for the Inside Soap Awards 2018|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=24 July 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=26 July 2018}}</ref> She progressed to the viewer-voted shortlist in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a868513/coronation-street-inside-soap-awards-shortlist-2018/ |title=Inside Soap Awards 2018: Coronation Street tops the shortlist with 18 nominations |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Paul Coker==\n{{Main|Paul Coker (EastEnders)}}\n'''Paul Coker''', played by [[Jonny Labey]], made his first screen appearance on 1 June 2015.

Stacey worries that Arthur could die and tells Bex about the possibility of Arthur having the syndrome. A doctor assures Stacey that the chance of Arthur displaying symptoms at a young age is small. Arthur undergoes an ECG and Stacey, Kush and Martin are told by the specialist that Arthur is at high risk at having the condition, but cannot have an operation or tests like Kush due to his age. Stacey is anxious that Arthur having a cardiac arrest is a sign of the condition and his parents are told about equipment that is not available on the NHS. Stacey is angry with Martin that he asked Kush for money to buy the equipment. Stacey and Martin panic when Arthur will not wake up, and when they receive Arthur's medical records at the hospital, Stacey and Martin are told that Arthur has swallowed Stacey's bipolar medication. Carmel is horrified when she finds bruises on Arthur's arms, and expresses her concerns to Kush that Stacey is unwell, while Stacey tells [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Jenna Russell]]) that he gained the bruises in hospital. However, Lily tells Carmel that Stacey was responsible, so Carmel reports it to social services, but tries to retract what she said after realising it was a mistake. Social services visit Stacey and Martin and tell them they received a report about Arthur. Arthur and Lily are placed in Carmel's care until social services have investigated. Arthur is looked over by a doctor, who has no concerns and Stacey and Martin can have Arthur and Lily back.

Martin keeps the children inside, away from Stacey, though the pair support each other briefly when Lily holds Hope by the upstairs window, asking for Stacey.

Martin decides to go for custody and when Kush and Carmel find out, Carmel wants Kush to get custody of Arthur, but Kush attempts to get them to resolve their problems. Martin sees Stacey, offering her contact, but Stacey contacts Lily's father, [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]), to help her and a locksmith changes the locks, devastating Martin. An unknown relative of Arthur's, [[Hayley Slater]] ([[Katie Jarvis]]), distracts Martin when he is looking after Hope and after finding out who she is, Stacey contacts Hayley again and when Martin is looking after Hope and Arthur, Hayley encourages Martin to take the children to a stay and play, buy them some tea and eat ice cream, disobeying Stacey's instructions.

Later that night, while he and his wife, [[Pam Coker]] ([[Lin Blakley]]), are celebrating their wedding anniversary, Les gets a text from Claudette, thanking him for her necklace. Claudette and Les meet again a week later at the park, with Claudette later arriving for her foster daughter [[Donna Yates]]' ([[Lisa Hammond (actress)|Lisa Hammond]]) birthday celebrations as arranged by Pam. It's revealed that she knows Les and Pam from when the latter worked as a social worker and placed Donna in Claudette's care. Weeks later, it's revealed that both Claudette and Les are in [[Gran Canaria]] on business. Donna ironically suggests that the two should meet up. Claudette reappears when her son [[Vincent Hubbard]] ([[Richard Blackwood]]) introduces her to her new granddaughter [[#Pearl Fox-Hubbard|Pearl]], and his wife [[Kim Fox-Hubbard]] ([[Tameka Empson]]). Claudette is angry that she had to wait so long to meet Pearl. She is hostile towards Kim, her sister [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]) and their family friend [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]), as she believes that they have stolen Vincent from her. When Les' grandson, [[Paul Coker (EastEnders)|Paul Coker]] ([[Jonny Labey]]), arrives in Walford, he reveals that he knows Les and Claudette are having an affair.

Les attempts to dissuade Claudette from coming to the Coker and Sons centenary party but she goes anyway and tells Les that Vincent is aware of their meetings. Meanwhile, at home, Paul tells Pam about the affair. Claudette later realises that Pam knows while seeing her freak out at her face with her and Les in the newspaper photo. She makes plans to have dinner with Les, declining Pam's invitation to dinner on the way there. When Pam notes how Claudette used exactly the same words as Les did, Claudette sends Les home.

The next day, she helps Pam and Les prepare for their \"meeting\" with Christine, and tells Pam that \"seeing\" Christine for the first time will be easier than she thinks.

She moves in with Vincent, Kim and Pearl when he buys a large house on Albert Square.\n\nClaudette starts working in The Albert and meets Phil's aunt, [[Aunt Sal|Sal]] ([[Anna Karen]]), who is visiting the Mitchells. Sal reveals that Claudette used to work at a bar nearby and has known the Mitchell family for decades.

It is revealed that Claudette's husband, Henry, was an associate of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]), [[Ted Hills]] ([[Brian Croucher]]), [[Gavin Sullivan]] ([[Paul Nicholas]]) and Eric Mitchell, Phil's father. Vincent was told by Claudette that Henry was killed by Eric 34 years previously on Christmas Eve after a confrontation when Vincent was a child. A drunken Phil kidnaps Pearl which leads to an altercation between Vincent and Phil. Vincent says that Eric killed his father but Phil says Henry just left Walford.

She gets on well with her father, [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]), and they go for a drink together, where Masood tells Carmel that Shabnam has a daughter that she abandoned seven years ago. Carmel is understanding and offers her support to Shabnam but this just angers Shabnam as it wasn't his place to tell anyone. Carmel visits frequently and Shabnam dislikes her interference with planning the wedding. She is delighted when Shabnam and Kush announce they are expecting. Carmel visits unannounced, distraught that Kush's father is selling her house and Shabnam begrudgingly allows her to stay with them but catches her in bed with Masood. After Kush learns that the baby is dead, Masood contacts Carmel and allows her to stay with him. Before returning to Essex, she and Masood help Kush and Shabnam reconcile for their stillborn son, [[Shabnam Masood#Stillbirth|Zaair]]'s, funeral. Carmel returns in November for the wedding and before they leave for their honeymoon, she promises to run Kush's stall in his absence. She also befriends [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]).\n\nShortly after Kush and Shabnam return, Carmel sees Kush and a pregnant [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) whispering and, after talking to Stacey, she realizes that Kush could be the baby's father. She confronts them but they persuade her not to tell Shabnam or [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]), insisting it is not the right time. Carmel agrees, but warns Stacey that Kush may want access to the baby if it is his.\n\nCarmel returns to the square in the spring, saying that her former husband, [[Umar Kazemi]] ([[Selva Rasalingam]]), is selling her house after all and that she has nowhere to live, so Kush allows her to move in with him and is joined by her youngest son, [[Shakil Kazemi|Shakil]] ([[Shaheen Jafargholi]]) a few weeks later. Shakil tells her that Umar wants to meet to discuss a possible reunion but it turns out that Shakil was lying, making Carmel feel unwanted but she and Shakil soon make up. Carmel is encouraged to apply for the job of market Inspector by Denise, and is overjoyed when she gets the job. She gets on the traders' nerves initially but soon learns to work with them. Carmel begins sleeping with Masood and she hopes that it will lead to a relationship but Masood leaves to travel the world, leaving Carmel devastated. She is later shocked to discover Denise is pregnant, telling her to book a scan and pressures her to tell her who the father is, infuriating Denise as the baby's father is [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). When she feels her flat is too crowded, she decides to rent No. 31 after [[Sonia Fowler]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) leaves the square. However, Martin opposes her as he wants the house for his family, so Carmel retracts her deposit and decides to rent No. 41, Masood's house instead. Whilst moving in, Masood returns unexpectedly, forcing them to share the house as she has already signed the contract. When [[Belinda Peacock]] ([[Carli Norris]]) begins a relationship with Masood, she doubts her motives and accuses her of only being with Masood for financial purposes, to save her debt ridden salon, \"Elysium\". However, Belinda leaves the square soon after. Carmel and Denise are later furious to discover that Masood is planning to move to Pakistan and accuses him of leaving to reunite with his former wife [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). They all reconciled before Masood leaves, telling him they'll always be there for him, and watch him leave. Carmel tries to talk Denise out of her decision to give her newborn son up for adoption, but eventually decides to support her, not wanting to end their friendship. Carmel tries to reason with market traders when they hear that the market be relocated. During the dispute, a bus crashes into the market and the viaduct. Carmel survives the crash and worries over Shakil's welfare when she learns he is on board, but is later relieved when he jumps off the top deck safely with the help of the others at the bottom.\n\nCarmel is shocked to discover that naked photos of Shakil have been sent around the school, and is angry to discover it was allegedly Shakil's former girlfriend, [[Bex Fowler]] ([[Jasmine Armfield]]) who sent them, although it was really [[Louise Mitchell]] ([[Tilly Keeper]]). Due to the tension between the Kazemis and the Fowlers, Martin and Stacey decide that Carmel should keep her distance from her grandson, which Carmel reacts badly to, and in the argument, she and Stacey physically fight after Carmel made a comment on Stacey's mental health.<ref name=\"9mar17pt2\"/> In April 2017, she becomes close to [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]), after he helps her make amends with Stacey, and also helps her with an interview for the Walford Council planning committee. Although she remains oblivious to Max's scheming. When Masood returns from travelling, he informs Carmel that he is not going to renew her tenancy contract. Although disappointed, Carmel asks Max whether they should find a home of their own, which slightly displeases him. Carmel is then delighted that the council has dropped the investigation and decides to make her a full-time employee. Shortly after having sex with Max, Carmel finds an engagement ring while tidying up the house and mistakenly believes Max wants to propose to her, when in fact it is intended for his secret girlfriend [[Fi Browning]] ([[Lisa Faulkner]]). The following day Carmel still believes Max is going to propose to her and prepares to celebrate with him at The Queen Vic. However, when he walks into The Vic, he deliberately ignores her and kisses Fi, humiliating Carmel in front of everyone and finally revealing his scheme. Realising she has been used, Carmel upsettingly storms out of the pub. Carmel and Shakil then moves in with Kush and Denise. While Carmel is at [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for [[Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle|the wedding]] of [[Prince Harry]] and [[Meghan Markle]], Shakil is stabbed in the back by a gang and the delay in finding him proves fatal. She rushes to the hospital to be told her son is dead. After hearing that Kush may still leave for Dubai, she feels helpless and tries to commit suicide but she is then strengthened by the discovery of Shakil's watch. She attends Shakil's memorial in the Square's gardens and makes amends with [[Karen Taylor (EastEnders)|Karen Taylor]] ([[Lorraine Stanley]]). Shaki's best mate, [[Keegan Baker]] ([[Zack Morris]]) takes her to where Shaki's killer, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Bruno|Bruno]], lives and offers to square things but Carmel warns him against and they have the police arrest Bruno; outside the police station, Carmel reveals herself to his mother, [[List of EastEnders characters (2018)#Sophie|Sophie]] ([[Melanie Harris]]). When Carmel finds Keegan in possession of a knife, she anonymously hands it in and decides to campaign for a knife amnesty, where young people can hand in knives to a public knife bin and their identities remain secret. She then tries to start a youth club but fails. At Halloween, Keegan stabs a boy who disrespected Shakil and Carmel allows him to think that the boy died, Carmel and Karen have a heated row leading to Keegan finally being made to see sense. Carmel and Keegan make amends before she moves abroad.\n\nLangford was nominated for the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[Inside Soap Awards#2015|The Inside Soap Awards 2015]] for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref name=InsideSoapLonglist>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a658118/inside-soap-awards-2015-longlist-revealed-whos-in-line-for-best-actor-actress-and-newcomer.html#~pmHi8CWFSFhM6F|title=Inside Soap Awards 2015 longlist revealed: Who's in line for Best Actor, Actress and Newcomer?|work=Digital Spy|date=14 July 2015}}</ref> She also won the \"Best Newcomer\" award at [[The British Soap Awards]] in 2016 for her portrayal of Carmel.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/05/28/british-soap-awards-2016-emmerdale-wins-best-soap-for-the-first/|title=British Soap Awards 2016: Emmerdale wins Best Soap for the first time, Danny Miller and Lacey Turner win in acting categories \u2013 plus full list of winners|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 May 2016|last1=McAloon|first1=Jonathan}}</ref> In September 2016, Laura-Jane Tyler of ''Inside Soap'' described Carmel as the \"life and soul of Walford\" amid a time for the show when it was \"on a low gas\".<ref>{{cite journal|title=Hits & Misses!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=24\u201330 September 2016|issue=38|pages=98|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines International]]}}</ref> In July 2018, Langford was longlisted for the \"Best Actress\" accolade at [[Inside Soap Awards|The Inside Soap Awards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a862268/inside-soap-awards-2018-full-longlist-coronation-street-eastenders-emmerdale-hollyoaks/|title=Full list of nominations for the Inside Soap Awards 2018|last=Davies|first=Megan|date=24 July 2018|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=26 July 2018}}</ref> She progressed to the viewer-voted shortlist in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a868513/coronation-street-inside-soap-awards-shortlist-2018/ |title=Inside Soap Awards 2018: Coronation Street tops the shortlist with 18 nominations |last=Kilkelly |first=Daniel |date=16 October 2018 |work=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=17 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Paul Coker==\n{{Main|Paul Coker (EastEnders)}}\n'''Paul Coker''', played by [[Jonny Labey]], made his first screen appearance on 1 June 2015.
