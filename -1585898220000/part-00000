While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued killing prisoners via mass shooting, starvation, torture, etc.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Borkin|title=The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben|url=https://archive.org/details/crimepunishmento0000bork|url-access=registration|location=New York City|publisher=Free Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-02-904630-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Gassings ===\n{{See also|The Holocaust#Gas chambers|Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Use of gas chambers}}\nSS ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Kurt Gerstein]], of the Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS, told a Swedish diplomat during the war of life in a death camp.

They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\".

The mechanical means of mass killing at Jasenovac initially included the use of gas vans and later Zyklon B in stationary gas chambers. The Jasenovac guards were also reported to have cremated living inmates in the crematorium. A notable difference with the Usta\u0161e camps as compared to the German ''SS'' camps was the widespread use of manual methods in the mass killings. These involved instruments such as mallets and agricultural knives which were often used in a manner where victims were thrown off the end of a ramp into the Sava River while they were still alive .\n\nThe estimates for the [[Jadovno concentration camp]] generally offer a range of 10,000 \u2013 72,000 deaths at the camp over a period of 122 days (May to August 1941).<ref name=\"USHMM-J\">[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Jasenovac] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030802193350/http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/online/jasenovac/ |date=2 August 2003 }}</ref> Most commonly Jadovno victims were bound together in a line and the first few victims were murdered with rifle butts or other objects.

Despite the lethal effects of carbon monoxide, this was seen as unsuitable for use in the East due to the cost of transporting the carbon monoxide in cylinders.<ref name = \"warning\"/>\n\nEach extermination camp operated differently, yet each had designs for quick and efficient industrialized killing. While H\u00f6ss was away on an official journey in late August 1941 his deputy, [[Karl Fritzsch]], tested out an idea. At Auschwitz clothes infested with lice were treated with crystallised prussic acid. The crystals were made to order by the [[IG Farben]] chemicals company for which the brand name was Zyklon-B. Once released from their container, Zyklon-B crystals in the air released a lethal cyanide gas. Fritzsch tried out the effect of [[Zyklon B]] on Soviet POWs, who were locked up in cells in the basement of the bunker for this experiment. H\u00f6ss on his return was briefed and impressed with the results and this became the camp strategy for extermination as it was also to be at Majdanek. Besides gassing, the camp guards continued killing prisoners via mass shooting, starvation, torture, etc.<ref>{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Borkin|title=The Crime and Punishment of IG Farben|url=https://archive.org/details/crimepunishmento0000bork|url-access=registration|location=New York City|publisher=Free Press|year=1978|isbn=978-0-02-904630-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Gassings ===\n{{See also|The Holocaust#Gas chambers|Gas chamber#Nazi Germany|Criticism of Holocaust denial#Use of gas chambers}}\nSS ''[[Obersturmf\u00fchrer]]'' [[Kurt Gerstein]], of the Institute for Hygiene of the Waffen-SS, told a Swedish diplomat during the war of life in a death camp.

The \"difficult\" prisoners were led to a site out of view to be killed off discreetly.\n\nA prisoner ''[[Sonderkommando]]'' (Special Detachment) effected in the processes of extermination; they encouraged the Jews to undress without a hint of what was about to happen. They accompanied them into the gas chambers outfitted to appear as shower rooms (with nonworking water nozzles, and tile walls); and remained with the victims until just before the chamber door closed. To psychologically maintain the \"calming effect\" of the delousing deception, an SS man stood at the door until the end. The ''Sonderkommando'' talked to the victims about life in the camp to pacify the suspicious ones, and hurried them inside; to that effect, they also assisted the aged and the very young in undressing.<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 321\u2013322.</ref>\n\nTo further persuade the prisoners that nothing harmful was happening, the ''Sonderkommando'' deceived them with small talk about friends or relations who had arrived in earlier transports. Many young mothers hid their infants beneath their piled clothes fearing that the delousing \"disinfectant\" might harm them. Camp Commandant H\u00f6ss reported that the \"men of the Special Detachment were particularly on the look-out for this\", and encouraged the women to take their children into the \"shower room\". Likewise, the ''Sonderkommando'' comforted older children who might cry \"because of the strangeness of being undressed in this fashion\".<ref>H\u00f6ss, pp. 164\u2013165, 322\u2013323.</ref>\n\nYet, not every prisoner was deceived by such [[psychological warfare|psychological]] tactics; Commandant H\u00f6ss spoke of Jews \"who either guessed, or knew, what awaited them, nevertheless&nbsp;... [they] found the courage to joke with the children, to encourage them, despite the mortal terror visible in their own eyes\".

The region includes the provinces of [[Mersin Province|Mersin]], [[Adana Province|Adana]], [[Osmaniye Province|Osmaniye]] and [[Hatay Province|Hatay]]. Adding the large population centers surrounding Cilicia, more than 10 million people reside within 2-hours drive from the Adana city center.\n\nThroughout the history, Adana were a market town at the Cilicia plain and one of the gateways from Europe to the Middle East, as it provided the only access on the wide Seyhan river. The city turned into a power house of Cilicia with the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkic]] takeover in 1359. The city remained as the capital of the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] until 1608, and then the regional administrative center for the [[Ottoman Empire]], [[Turkey]], and shortly for the [[Cilicia#French Cilicia|French Cilicia]]. Economically a modest town until 1861 with a population of roughly 15000, the city boomed with the breakdown of the [[American Civil War]], as becoming a new center for supplying cotton and cotton related products to Europe. Traditionally a town populated by Armenians and Turks; influx of [[Armenians]], Turks, [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Alawites]] at this period, made the city one of the most diverse cities of [[Anatolia]]. Economic, social and cultural growth were halted by the [[Adana massacre]], the [[Armenian Genocide]] and the [[Greco-Turkish population exchange]]<ref name=\"HrantAdana\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/attachments/article/1398/Adana_Raporu_new.pdf|title=Ermeni K\u00fclt\u00fcr Varl\u0131klar\u0131yla Adana|publisher=HDV Yay\u0131nlar\u0131|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>, all devastated the city in the early 20th century. After the eviction of Armenians and Greeks, most of the city's private properties were confiscated in 1923 and were granted to the Muslim/Turks who recently had migrated into the city.  After a standstill period, city's economy again boomed in 1950s with the construction of the [[Seyhan Dam]], though unsustainable and at the expense of the city's socioculture, as the new possessors of the properties did not have the management attributes like the owners before the confiscations.<ref name=\"Hrant\">{{cite web|url=https://hrantdink.org/tr/faaliyetler/projeler/kulturel-miras/1477-adana-arastirmasi-ve-saha-calismasi|title=Adana ara\u015ft\u0131rmas\u0131 ve saha \u00e7al\u0131\u015fmas\u0131|publisher=Hrant Dink Foundation|accessdate=12 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nAdana in the 21st century, are a center for regional trade, healthcare, public and private services. Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west.

It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]],  Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s.  According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in  [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in  83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434.

In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana in 746. [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine  after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Khorasan]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city. Adana was rebuilt and remained a part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain. Most Armenians residing in Adana, fled to [[Cyprus]] and to [[Kozan|Sis]].\n\n===Turkish era=== \n[[File:Adana Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] forces entering the city. Adana Castle and the city walls seen behind were demolished by them in 1836.]]\nThe Mamluks built garrisons in Tarsus, [[Yumurtal\u0131k|Ayas]] port and [[Sarvandikar]], and left the administration of Adana plain to [[Oghuz Turks|Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks]] who already formed a Mamluk authorized ''T\u00fcrkmen Emirate'' in [[Camili, Y\u00fcre\u011fir|Camili]] area in 1352, just southeast of Adana. The [[Amir]], Ramazan Beg, designated Adana as the capital, and led the Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks to settle in the city. The emirate which later on known as the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], played a key role in the 15th-century Ottoman-Mamluk relations by being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk\u2013Turkmen frontier|Mamluk al-'Awasim]]. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the new Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608.\n\n[[File:Adana Armenian Quarter.jpg|thumb|Armenian Quarter in the late 19th century]]\n[[File:The City of Adana.svg|thumb|left|Adana in 1909]]\n[[File:Adana from the river in 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|River mansions]]\n[[File:Adana Armenian Protestant Church.jpg|thumb|right|Protestant Church founded by American missioanaries (demolished in 1970s)]]\n[[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] ended the Ramadanid administration of Adana sanjak in 1608, and ruled it directly from Constantinople then after. The autonomous sanjak was then split from the [[Aleppo Eyalet]] and established as a new province under the name of [[Adana Eyalet]]. A governor was appointed to administer the province. In late 1832, [[Egypt Eyalet|Eyalet of Egypt]] [[wali|Vali]] [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] invaded [[Syria]], and reached Cilicia. The [[Convention of K\u00fctahya]] that was signed on 14 May 1833, ceded Cilicia to the ''de facto'' independent [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]. At the time of ceding, the Adana population of 13,000 hardly received any urban services.

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]]. The quarter is next to the Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc stone bridge, situated on a hill which gave its name Tepeba\u011f (Garden on the hill). The city administration has launched a campaign to preserve the heritage of this area, particularly the Ottoman houses. Atat\u00fcrk stayed in one of these houses on Seyhan Caddesi which now houses the [[Atat\u00fcrk Museum (Adana)|Atat\u00fcrk Museum]].\n\nSeveral bridges cross the Seyhan river within the city, the most notable among them is the [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]], a 2nd-century [[Roman bridge]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.adanakultur.gov.tr/BelgeGoster.aspx?F6E10F8892433CFFB0ED0AA5232E402F59FCBAD67E463149| title = Adana Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Stone Bridge)| author=| publisher=Governship of Adana Tourism and Culture Department| accessdate=}}</ref> Currently used by pedestrians and cyclists, it was the oldest bridge in the world to be open to motorized vehicles until 2007.

[[\u015ealgam]] and pickle juice are the drinks of the winter and a\u015flama ([[licorice]] juice) is the choice of drink in summer.\n\nOne of the famous sweets of Turkey called \"Sweet Sausage\" originated from Adana. It was invented by Sir Duran O. during the First World War, around 1915 [[Seker Sucugu]].\n\nVegetable dishes are also popular in the city.

In the 1960s, rapid industrialization brought more men to pavyons not only from the city, but from a wide region including Istanbul and Ankara, thus Adana was named ''Pavyon Capital of Turkey''. Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards.

Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all.

The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for

Agriculture and logistics are significant sectors of the city. Economic decline caused by national policies and de-industrialization since 1990s is reversing, as the city is gaining momentum with the fairs, festivals and entertainment life. Though not competing at the top level, the rivalry between the city's football clubs, [[Adanaspor]] and [[Adana Demirspor]], is getting national attraction as being the [[Adana football derby|only citywide derby]] of [[Turkey]] that is rooted in socio-economic divisions.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Adana1.jpg|thumb|Eskibaraj Dam Lake on [[Seyhan River]].]]\n\nAdana is located at the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, where it serves as the gateway to the Cilicia plain. This large stretch of flat, fertile land lies southeast of the [[Taurus Mountains]].\n\nFrom Adana, crossing the Cilicia westwards, the road from Tarsus enters the foothills of the Taurus Mountains, eventually reaching an altitude of nearly {{convert|4000|ft|m}}. It goes through the famous [[Cilician Gates]], the rocky pass through which armies have coursed since the dawn of history, and continues to the Anatolian plain.\n\nThe north of the city is surrounded by the Seyhan reservoir. The Seyhan Dam, completed in 1956, was constructed for hydroelectric power and to irrigate the lower \u00c7ukurova plain. Two irrigation channels in the city flow to the plain, passing through the city center from east to west. There is another canal for irrigating the Y\u00fcre\u011fir plain to the southeast of the city.\n\nThe [[37th parallel north]] passes through the city.\n\n===Climate===\nAdana has a hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under both the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification, and a dry-hot summer subtropical climate (Csa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Winters are mild and wet. Summers are long, hot, humid and dry. The highest recorded temperature was on 8 July 1978 at {{convert|45.6|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}.

It is considered to be the oldest city of Cilicia. A place called ''Adana'' is mentioned by name in a [[Sumer]]ian epic, the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], but the geography of this work is too imprecise to identify its location.\n\n===Ancient times===\nFirst known people living in Adana and area were the [[Luwians]]. They controlled the Mediterranean coasts of Anatolia roughly from 3000BC to around 1600BC. [[Hittites]] took over the region which came to be known as [[Kizzuwatna]]. Inhabited by Luwians and [[Hurrians]],  Kizzuwatna had an autonomous governance under the Hittites protection, but they had a brief independent period from 1500s to 1420s.  According to the [[Hittite language|Hittite]] inscription of [[Kava]], found in [[Hattusa]] ([[Bo\u011fazkale]]), [[Kizzuwatna]] was the kingdom that ruled Adana, under the protection of the Hittites by 1335 BC. At that time, the name of the city was ''Uru Adaniyya'', and the inhabitants were called [[Denyen|Danuna]]. Beginning with the collapse of the [[Hittite Empire]] c. 1191\u20131189 BC, relatively unknown [[Sea Peoples]] took control of the plain until around 900BC. Then after, [[Syro-Hittite states|Neo-Hittite States]] founded in the region and Adana was the center of [[Quw\u00ea]] state. Quw\u00ea and other states were protected by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]], though they had independent periods. After the Greek migration to Cilicia in the 8th century BC, the region was unified under the rule of the dynasty of [[Mopsus|Mopsos]]<ref name=\"Fox-211ff\">Fox, Robin Lane (2009) ''Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer'' Alfred A. Knopf, , New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9k8Frkhiq_MC&pg=PA211 pages 211-224], {{ISBN|978-0-679-44431-2}}</ref> and Adana was established as the capital. Bilingual inscriptions of the ninth and eighth centuries founded in  [[Mopsuestia]] were written both in Indo-European [[hieroglyphic Luwian]] and West Semitic [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. Assyrians took the control of the regions several times until their collapse in 612BC. The region appeared in Assyrian inscriptions as ''Hilikku'', in which the Cilicia name derived from. Cilicians founded the [[Kingdom of Cilicia (ancient)|Kingdom of Cilicia]] by the efforts of [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis I]]. The kingdom were independent until the invasion of [[Achaemenid Empire]] in 549, then after became an autonomous [[satrapy]] of Achaemenids and [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonians]]. After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s death, for a time, Adana fell under [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic dominion]], but finally came to the [[Seleucid Empire]]. Seleucids ruled Adana until the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]] made Cilicia their vassal state in  83BC.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era===\n[[Pompey]] took over entire Cilicia and organized it as a [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province]] in 64BC. Adana was of relatively minor importance during the [[Roman Empire|Roman]]'s influential period, while nearby Tarsus was the [[metropolis]] of the area. During the era of [[Pompey]], the city was used as a prison for the pirates of Cilicia. The [[Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] was built in the early 2nd century, and for several centuries thereafter, the city was a [[wikt:way station|waystation]] on a Roman military road leading to the East. After the permanent split of the [[Roman Empire]] in 395 AD, the area became a part of the [[Byzantine Empire]], and was probably developed during the time of [[Julian the Apostate]]. With the construction of large bridges, roads, government buildings, irrigation and plantation, Adana and Cilicia became the most developed and important trade centers of the region. \n\nAdana was a Christian [[bishopric]], a [[suffragan]] of the [[metropolitan see]] of Tarsus, but was raised to the rank of autocephalous archdiocese after 680, the year in which its bishop appeared as a simple bishop at the [[Third Council of Constantinople]], but before its listing in a 10th-century ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' as an archdiocese.The Bishop Paulinus participated in the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325. Piso was among the [[Arianism]]-inclined bishops at the [[Council of Sardica]] (344) who withdrew and set up their own council at Philippopolis; he later returned to [[Eastern Orthodox Church|orthodoxy]] and signed the profession of [[Nicene Creed|Nicene faith]] at a synod in Antioch in 363. Cyriacus was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381. Anatolius is mentioned in a letter of Saint [[John Chrysostom]]. Cyrillus was at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431 and at a synod in Tarsus in 434.

In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine V]] took control of Adana in 746. [[Abbasid Caliphate]] took over the rule of the region from Byzantine  after [[Al-Mansur]]'s inauguration to caliph in 756. With the Abbasid rule, Muslims for the first time started settling in Cilicia. Abandoned for more than 50 years, Adana was garrisoned and re-built from 758 to 760. To form a [[Al-Awasim|Thugh\u016br]] on the Byzantine frontier, Cilicia was colonized with the Turkic Say\u0101bija tribe from [[Khorasan]].

The city became part of the [[Seleucia (theme)|Seleucia theme]]. After the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071, the emperor [[Romanos IV Diogenes]] was removed from reign by a coup. He then gathered a troop to regain his power, though got defeated and had to retreat his troop to Adana. He was forced to surrender by the Garrison in Adana upon receiving assurances of his personal safety. [[Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], the founder of the [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] annexed Adana, in his campaign in 1084. The city remained under Turkish rule until it was captured by the forces of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Armenian Principality of Cilicia]] in 1132, under its king, [[Leo I of Armenia|Leo I]]. It was taken by [[Byzantine]] forces in 1137, but the Armenians regained it around 1170. In 1268, a [[1268 Cilicia earthquake|devastating earthquake]] destroyed much of the city. Adana was rebuilt and remained a part of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia until 1359, when the city was ceded to the T\u00fcrkmen supported [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] who marched into Cilicia and captured the plain. Most Armenians residing in Adana, fled to [[Cyprus]] and to [[Kozan|Sis]].\n\n===Turkish era=== \n[[File:Adana Castle.jpg|thumb|[[Muhammad Ali of Egypt]] forces entering the city. Adana Castle and the city walls seen behind were demolished by them in 1836.]]\nThe Mamluks built garrisons in Tarsus, [[Yumurtal\u0131k|Ayas]] port and [[Sarvandikar]], and left the administration of Adana plain to [[Oghuz Turks|Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks]] who already formed a Mamluk authorized ''T\u00fcrkmen Emirate'' in [[Camili, Y\u00fcre\u011fir|Camili]] area in 1352, just southeast of Adana. The [[Amir]], Ramazan Beg, designated Adana as the capital, and led the Y\u00fcre\u011fir Turks to settle in the city. The emirate which later on known as the [[Ramadanid Emirate]], played a key role in the 15th-century Ottoman-Mamluk relations by being a [[Al-Awasim#Mamluk\u2013Turkmen frontier|Mamluk al-'Awasim]]. In 1517, Selim I incorporated the beylik into the Ottoman Empire after his conquest of the Mamluk state. The beys of Ramadanids held the administration of the new Ottoman sanjak of Adana in a hereditary manner until 1608.\n\n[[File:Adana Armenian Quarter.jpg|thumb|Armenian Quarter in the late 19th century]]\n[[File:The City of Adana.svg|thumb|left|Adana in 1909]]\n[[File:Adana from the river in 1920s.jpg|thumb|left|River mansions]]\n[[File:Adana Armenian Protestant Church.jpg|thumb|right|Protestant Church founded by American missioanaries (demolished in 1970s)]]\n[[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] ended the Ramadanid administration of Adana sanjak in 1608, and ruled it directly from Constantinople then after. The autonomous sanjak was then split from the [[Aleppo Eyalet]] and established as a new province under the name of [[Adana Eyalet]]. A governor was appointed to administer the province. In late 1832, [[Egypt Eyalet|Eyalet of Egypt]] [[wali|Vali]] [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]] invaded [[Syria]], and reached Cilicia. The [[Convention of K\u00fctahya]] that was signed on 14 May 1833, ceded Cilicia to the ''de facto'' independent [[Egypt Eyalet|Egypt]]. At the time of ceding, the Adana population of 13,000 hardly received any urban services.

A mid-size trading city until the mid-1800s, the city attracted European traders after the United States, a major cotton supplier, was embroiled with its [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. \u00c7ukurova farmers exported agricultural products for the first time and thus started building capital. By the start of the 20th century, factories almost all processing cotton, began to operate in the region. Factories were shut down and the economy almost came to a standstill in 1915, after the genocide of Armenians who ran most of the businesses in the city. Foundation of the republic, again accelerated the growth of industrialization by re-activation of closed plants and opening of state-owned ones. With the construction of [[Seyhan Dam]] and improvements in agricultural techniques, there was an explosive growth in agricultural production during the 1950s. Large-scale industries were built along D-400 state road and Karata\u015f road.

The city grew rapidly during that period with many new neighborhoods being built. Most of the historical landmarks of Adana were built during this period, thus [[Mamluk architecture|Mamluk]] and [[Seljuqid]] architecture are dominant in Adana's architectural history. [[Stone Bridge (Adana)|Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc]] is the only remaining landmark from the Roman-Byzantine era, and few public buildings were built during Ottoman rule. Adana is home to modern Turkey's historic Armenian architecture, which can be found behind the city's central modern buildings.\n\nThe first traces of settlement in the quarter of [[Tepeba\u011f]], can be traced to the [[neolithic age]].

Many popular singers took the stage at and owe their fame to the pavyons of Adana.\n\nPavyons led the way to Western-style pubs and night clubs by the late 1980s with the socio-economic changes in Adana. The traditional entertainment district is Sular, near Central Station, but the pubs and clubs nowadays are spread throughout the city. The bigger clubs such as Life Legend, Uptown, Casara and Lava host world star singers at their elegant locations, mostly along the river and the lake. There are still two active pavyons, Afrodit and Maksim, but adult entertainment is directed mostly to what is known locally as tele-bars. Tele-bars are licensed as regular pubs, but function as places where bargirls entertain customers and usually hook with them afterwards. There are around 20 tele-bars mainly in the city center and around the old dam.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sabah.com.tr/fotohaber/yasam/adana_artik_pavyonla_anilmiyor?tc=36&albumId=29729&page=12 | title = Tele-bar Furyas\u0131 (Turkish)|author=\u0130brahim Altay|publisher=Sabah Gazetesi}}</ref>\n\nA hundred-year-long tradition of [[Adana Kebab|kebab]], liver and [[rak\u0131]] in the Kazanc\u0131lar Bazaar, with street music and dances, turned into a festival since 2010, with all-night entertainment.

Coach companies that serve transportation to cities west of Adana, depart from '''Central Coach Terminal''', whereas the buses that serve cities east of Adana depart from '''Y\u00fcre\u011fir Coach Terminal'''. A shuttle service is provided between the two terminals. Regional bus services from Adana to other places in \u00c7ukurova are plentiful and carried by bus and minibus co-operatives. Seasonal bus services to the high plains of Tekir, B\u00fcr\u00fccek and K\u0131z\u0131lda\u011f run in summer, due to high demand of Adana residents escaping the heat of the city.\n\nThere is an extensive [[List of highways in Turkey#Motorways|motorway network (O50-O59)]] in the region, connecting Adana to as far as [[Erdemli]] in the west, [[Ni\u011fde]] in the north, [[\u015eanl\u0131urfa]] in the east and [[Iskenderun]] in the south.

Payment is collected by Kentkart Smartcard system. Six Bus Co-operatives (known as Can buses) serve the city with 411 buses. Kentkart and cash are accepted at these buses. 18 [[Dolmu\u015f]] Co-operatives, with a total of 1,086 minibuses, provide service even to secondary streets. The only form of payment is by cash.\n\n===Cycling and walkability===\nThe city of Adana is mostly flat and the warm weather makes it convenient for all year cycling and walking. The square shape of the city, city center's location right at the center of the square and the river running straight north\u2013south in the middle of the city create further advantage for cycling as a means of transportation. Compact urban form due to dominance of high-rise buildings that are closely built, especially in Seyhan and \u00c7ukurova districts, make cycling from any end of the city to the city center to take less than 40 minutes. Despite all the advantages, car-oriented urban planning since the 1950s caused cycling to take a minor part in commuting to work or school. There are no bike lanes, but there are two bike paths, one along Fuzuli Street, the other along M. Kemalpa\u015fa Boulevard\u2014the latter not used by cyclists at all. Bicycles for commuting are currently only used by residents of low-income neighborhoods. [[Utility cycling|Bicycle use for transportation]] is low all over Turkey,<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.imo.org.tr/resimler/dosya_ekler/613d551d4160a60_ek.pdf?dergi=166 |title=Kenti\u00e7i ula\u015f\u0131mda bisiklet |author=Volkan Emre Uz, Mustafa Kara\u015fahin |journal=T\u00fcrkiye M\u00fchendislik Haberleri |volume=429 2004/1|pages=41\u201346 |year=2004 }}</ref> but when compared to cities like \u0130zmir, [[Konya]] and [[Eski\u015fehir]], Adana is less bicycle friendly.\n\nCar-oriented urban planning became even more extreme since the 1980s, pedestrians seeing part of the sidewalks of the city's popular streets being converted into car-parking spots. The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on the sidewalks. The city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Ta\u015fk\u00f6pr\u00fc to squares and widen the sidewalks in the old town where it is difficult to walk at the peddler-invaded narrow sidewalks. By far the most [[Walkability|pedestrian friendly]] street of the city is Turgut \u00d6zal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in \u00c7ukurova district are also very convenient for walking.\n\n==International relations==\nAdana is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|\nEurope\n*{{flagicon|ESP}} [[C\u00f3rdoba, Andalusia]], Spain\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia\n*{{flagicon|RUS}} [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Livorno]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[Debrecen]], Hungary<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/adana-ve-debrecen-kardes-sehir-oldu-40929419|title=Adana ve Debrecen karde\u015f \u015fehir oldu|website=H\u00fcrriyet}}</ref>\n|\nAsia\n*{{flagicon|ISR}} [[Beersheba]], Israel<ref name=\"muni-sister\">{{cite web|title=International Relations of the City of Beersheba |url=http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |publisher=Beersheba Municipality |accessdate=6 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209131035/http://www.beer-sheva.muni.il/ArimTeomot.asp |archivedate=9 December 2008 |url-status=dead |language=he }}</ref>\n*{{flagicon|KAZ}} [[Shymkent]], Kazakhstan\n*{{flagicon|JPN}} [[Sapporo]], Japan\n*{{flagicon|MNG}} [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 2213.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Side view\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 844.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard\nFile:Adana Yeni Camii 8573.jpg|Adana Yeni Camii (New Mosque) Entrance to courtyard's backside\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3570.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3636.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Courtyard\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 3638.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Mihrab and minber\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque 5720.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque3645.jpg|Adana Hasan A\u011fa mosque Woodwork under balcony\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7586.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From west\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7588.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami From east\nFile:Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami 7589.jpg|Adana Tahtal\u0131 Cami Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4990.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4995.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Interior\nFile:Adana A\u011fca Mescit 4993.jpg|Adana A\u011fca Mescit Decorative stonework\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4989.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Exterior\nFile:Adana Yesil Mescit 4988.jpg|Adana Yesil Mescit Window decoration\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 1625.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Exterior\nFile:Adana Alidede Mosque 3591.jpg|Adana Alidede Mosque Interior\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Turkey}}\n*[[List of people from Adana]]\n*[[List of twin towns and sister cities in Turkey]]\n*[[List of mayors of Adana]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Helsinki Atlas of the Near East in the Neo-Assyrian Period |ISBN=951-45-9050-3|first1=Simo|last= Parpola|author-link1=Simo Parpola |first2= Michael|last2= Porter|author-link2=Michael Porter|publisher=[[Gazetteer]]|location=Helsinki, Finland|year=2001}}\n*{{Cite book|title = The Turks Today|ISBN=1-58567-756-6|first=Andrew |last=Mango|author-link=Andrew Mango|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = [[Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World]] |ISBN=0-691-03169-X |first=Richard |last=Talbert|author-link=Richard Talbert|publisher=The Overlook Press|location=New York City|year=2004}}\n*{{Cite book|title = \u0531\u057f\u0561\u0576\u0561\u0575\u056b \u0540\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u054a\u0561\u057f\u0574\u0578\u0582\u0569\u056b\u0582\u0576 |trans-title=The History of the Armenians of Adana|first=Puzant |last=Yeghiayan |location= Beirut |publisher=Union of Armenian Compatriots of Adana|year=1970|language=hy}}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikivoyage|Adana}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n* [http://adana.gov.tr/ Governorship of Adana]\n* [http://adana.bel.tr Adana Metropolitan Municipality]\n* [http://www.adana-to.org.tr Adana Trade and Industry Chamber]\n\n{{City of Adana |state=collapsed}}\n{{Districts of Turkey|provname=Adana}}\n{{Metropolitan centers in Turkey}}\n{{Syro-Hittite states}}\n{{Largest cities in Turkey}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Adana| ]]\n[[Category:Cities in Turkey]]\n[[Category:Districts of Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places in Adana Province]]\n[[Category:Populated places along the Silk Road]]\n[[Category:Archaeological sites in the Mediterranean Region, Turkey]]\n[[Category:Hittite cities]]\n[[Category:Roman sites in Turkey]]\n", "name_user": "Seyhan668", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoman-Byzantine, Islamic and Armenian era", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adana"}

Coppola cited the 1966 film ''[[Blowup]]'' as a key influence. However, since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, he felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. \n''The Conversation'' has won critical acclaim <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f92ODOjfukM 'The Conversation'|Critics' Picks|The New York Times on YouTube]</ref> and multiple accolades, including the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix du Festival International du Film]], the highest honor at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] in 1974 and lost [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', another Francis Ford Coppola film. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nHarry Caul ([[Gene Hackman]]) is a [[surveillance]] expert who runs his own company in San Francisco. Caul is obsessed with his own privacy; his apartment is almost bare behind its triple-locked door and burglar alarm, he uses [[Payphone|pay phones]] to make calls, claims to have no home telephone and his office is enclosed in wire mesh in a corner of a much larger warehouse. He has no friends, his mistress Amy knows nothing about him, and his one hobby is playing along to [[jazz]] records on a [[tenor saxophone]] in the privacy of his apartment.\n\nCaul insists that he is not responsible for the actual content of the conversations he records or the use to which his clients put his surveillance activities. However, he is racked by guilt over a past wiretap job which resulted in the murder of three people. This sense of guilt is amplified by his devout [[Catholicism]]. \n\nCaul, his colleague Stan and some freelance associates have taken on the task of bugging the conversation of a couple as they walk through crowded [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] in [[San Francisco]], surrounded by a cacophony of background noise. Amid the small-talk, the couple discuss fears that they are being watched, and mention a discreet meeting at a hotel room in a few days. The challenging task of recording this conversation is accomplished by multiple surveillance operatives located in different positions around the square. After Caul has merged and filtered the different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves are clear, but their meaning remains ambiguous.\n\nWhen the client is not in his office, Caul refuses to leave the tape with the client's assistant. The assistant warns him not to get involved, telling him that the tapes are \"dangerous.\" Caul feels increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape. He plays the tape again and again, gradually refining the recording. Using a [[Filter (signal processing)|filter]], he reveals a key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd kill us if he got the chance.\"\n\nCaul avoids handing in the tape to the aide of the man who commissioned the surveillance. Afterward, he finds himself under increasing pressure from the client's aide and is himself followed, tricked, and bugged. The tape of the conversation is eventually stolen from him in a moment when his guard is down. He goes to the client (\"the Director\", played by [[Robert Duvall]]) to find he has received the tapes, and learns that the woman in the recording is the client's wife, apparently having an affair with the other man in the tapes. \n\nCaul books a hotel room next to one mentioned in the recording of the conversation. He uses equipment to overhear the client in a heated argument with his wife. When he goes to the balcony to watch the events through the windows out of curiosity, he sees what he believes to be the wife being murdered and retreats in shock.\n\nCaul later attempts to confront the client, but the client is absent. While departing, Caul catches sight of the wife, alive and unharmed, in a limo.

Coppola cited the 1966 film ''[[Blowup]]'' as a key influence. However, since the film was released to theaters just a few months before [[Richard Nixon]] resigned as President, he felt that audiences interpreted the film to be a reaction to the [[Watergate scandal]]. \n''The Conversation'' has won critical acclaim <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f92ODOjfukM 'The Conversation'|Critics' Picks|The New York Times on YouTube]</ref> and multiple accolades, including the [[Palme d'Or|Grand Prix du Festival International du Film]], the highest honor at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]]. It was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]] in 1974 and lost [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] to ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', another Francis Ford Coppola film. In 1995, it was selected for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n==Plot==\nHarry Caul ([[Gene Hackman]]) is a [[surveillance]] expert who runs his own company in San Francisco. Caul is obsessed with his own privacy; his apartment is almost bare behind its triple-locked door and burglar alarm, he uses [[Payphone|pay phones]] to make calls, claims to have no home telephone and his office is enclosed in wire mesh in a corner of a much larger warehouse. He has no friends, his mistress Amy knows nothing about him, and his one hobby is playing along to [[jazz]] records on a [[tenor saxophone]] in the privacy of his apartment.\n\nCaul insists that he is not responsible for the actual content of the conversations he records or the use to which his clients put his surveillance activities. However, he is racked by guilt over a past wiretap job which resulted in the murder of three people. This sense of guilt is amplified by his devout [[Catholicism]]. \n\nCaul, his colleague Stan and some freelance associates have taken on the task of bugging the conversation of a couple as they walk through crowded [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]] in [[San Francisco]], surrounded by a cacophony of background noise. Amid the small-talk, the couple discuss fears that they are being watched, and mention a discreet meeting at a hotel room in a few days. The challenging task of recording this conversation is accomplished by multiple surveillance operatives located in different positions around the square. After Caul has merged and filtered the different tapes, the final result is a sound recording in which the words themselves are crystal clear, but their meaning remains ambiguous.\n\nCaul feels increasingly uneasy about what may happen to the couple once the client hears the tape. He plays the tape again and again, gradually refining its accuracy. He concentrates on one key phrase hidden under the sound of a street musician: \"He'd kill us if he got the chance.\" Caul constantly reinterprets the speakers' subtle emphasis on particular words in this phrase, trying to figure out their meaning in the light of what he suspects and subsequently discovers.\n\nCaul avoids handing in the tape to the aide of the man who commissioned the surveillance. Afterward, he finds himself under increasing pressure from the client's aide and is himself followed, tricked, and bugged. The tape of the conversation is eventually stolen from him in a moment when his guard is down. He goes to the client (\"the Director\", played by [[Robert Duvall]]) to find he has received the tapes, and learns that the woman in the recording is the client's wife, apparently having an affair with the other man in the tapes. \n\nCaul books a hotel room next to one mentioned in the recording of the conversation. He uses equipment to overhear the client in a heated argument with his wife. When he goes to the balcony to watch the events through the windows out of curiosity, he sees what he believes to be the wife being murdered and retreats in shock.\n\nCaul later attempts to confront the client, but the client is absent. While departing, Caul catches sight of the wife, alive and unharmed, in a limo. He learns that his client was killed in an \"accident,\" and discovers the truth: the couple were talking about killing the woman's husband, and the murder Caul witnessed was actually that of his client and not the wife. Caul gets a phone call from his client's assistant, who tells him not to look any further into the matter, and says, \"We'll be listening to you.\" Caul goes on a frantic search for a listening device, tearing up his apartment to no avail. He sits amid the wreckage, playing the only thing in his apartment left intact: his saxophone.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n*[[Gene Hackman]] as Harry Caul\n*[[John Cazale]] as Stan\n*[[Allen Garfield]] as William P. \"Bernie\" Moran\n*[[Cindy Williams]] as Ann\n*[[Frederic Forrest]] as Mark\n*[[Harrison Ford]] as Martin Stett\n*[[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]] as Paul\n*[[Elizabeth MacRae]] as Meredith\n*[[Teri Garr]] as Amy Fredericks\n*Mark Wheeler as Receptionist\n*[[Shields and Yarnell|Robert Shields]] as The Mime\n*Phoebe Alexander as Lurleen\n*[[Robert Duvall]] as The Director<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2002/02/26/the_conversation_1974_review.shtml |title=The Conversation (1974) |last=Hilditch |first=Nick |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=11 June 2017 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production==\nCoppola has cited [[Michelangelo Antonioni]]'s ''[[Blowup]]'' (1966) as a key influence on his conceptualization of the film's themes, such as surveillance versus participation, and perception versus reality. \"Francis had seen [it] a year or two before, and had the idea to fuse the concept of ''Blowup'' with the world of audio surveillance.\"{{sfn|Ondaatje|2002|p=152}}\n\nOn the [[DVD]] commentary, Coppola says he was shocked to learn that the film utilized the very same surveillance and wire-tapping equipment that members of the [[Nixon Administration]] used to spy on political opponents prior to the [[Watergate scandal]].

Coppola also notes on the commentary that Hackman considers this one of his favorite performances.\n\n''The Conversation'' features a piano score composed and performed by [[David Shire]].
