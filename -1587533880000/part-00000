It is one of the largest municipalities in the country. Its geographic position makes it possible to make good connections with other centers of Kosovo and the region. Around the town of Gjilan lis the Hill of Martyrs (Popovica), Gllama, Dheu i Bardh\u00eb, the area of Malisheva (Gjilan), Zabeli of Sahit Ag\u00ebs and Bregu i That\u00eb. There are three small rivers, [[Bina\u010dka Morava|Mirusha]], Banja and Stanishori, which join and flow to [[Bina\u010dka Morava]], west of the Uglara village. \n\nGjilan is 46km from [[Pristina]], 27 km from [[Kamenica, Kosovo|Kamenica]], 22 km from [[Vitina]], and 25 km from [[Novo Brdo]].

In the [[Puranas]], Shesha is said to hold all the planets of the universe on his hoods and to constantly sing the glories of the God [[Vishnu]] from all his mouths. He is sometimes referred to as '''Ananta Shesha''', which translates as endless-Shesha or '''Adishesha''' \"first Shesha\". It is said that when Adishesa uncoils, time moves forward and creation takes place; when he coils back, the universe ceases to exist. \n\nVishnu is often depicted as resting on Shesha. Shesha is considered a servant and a manifestation of Vishnu. He is said to have descended to Earth in three human forms or avatars: [[Lakshmana]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Rama]] during Tretayuga, and as [[Balarama]], brother of Vishnu's avatar [[Krishna]] during Dwaparayuga and Ramanujacharya, the proponent of Vishishtadvaita school of Vedanta during Kaliyuga.\n\n\"Shesha\" in Sanskrit texts, especially those relating to mathematical calculation, implies the \"remainder\"\u2014that which remains when all else ceases to exist.\n\n==Form==\n[[File:Sheshashayi - Laxminarayan by DHURANDHAR MV.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Vishnu]] resting on Ananta-Shesha, with his consort [[Lakshmi]] massaging his feet]]\n[[File:Vishnu reclining on Shesha, as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.).jpg|right|thumb|Vishnu reclining on Shesha,as Brahma is born on a lotus from his navel (palace of Bir Singh Dev, Orchha, early 17th c.)]]\n\nShesha is generally depicted with a massive form that floats coiled in space, or on the [[Kshir Sagar|ocean of bliss]], to form the bed on which Vishnu lies. Sometimes he is shown as five-headed or seven-headed, but more commonly as a many thousand-headed [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]], sometimes with each head wearing an ornate crown.\n\nHis name means \"that which remains\", from the [[Sanskrit]] [[root (linguistics)|root]] ''\u015bi\u1e63'', because when the world is destroyed at the end of the [[Kalpa (aeon)|kalpa]], Shesha remains as he is.\n\nIn the [[Bhagavadgita]] of Chapter 10, verse 29, Shri [[Krishna]] while describing 75 of his common manifestations, declares, {{IAST|\"ananta\u015b ca asmi n\u0101g\u0101n\u0101\u1e41\"}}: Of the nagas, I am Ananta.\n\nAs per the [[Mahabharata]], Shesha was born to sage [[Kashyap]] and his wife [[Kadru]]. Kadru gave birth to a thousand snakes, of which Shesha was the eldest. After Shesha, [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], [[Airavata]] and [[Takshaka]] were born, in order. A lot of Shesha's brothers were cruel and were bent upon inflicting harm on others. They were even unkind to Garuda, who was Kashyapa's son through Vinatha, sister of Kadru. (Kadru and Vinatha were daughters of Daksha).\n\nShesha, disgusted by the cruel acts of his brothers, left his mother and kin, and took to austere penances. He lived on air and meditated in places including Gandhamadhana, Badrikashrama, Gokarna, Pushkara and Himalayas. His penances were so severe that his flesh, skin and muscles dried up and merged with his frame. [[Brahma]], convinced of his Shesha's will, asked Shesha to request a boon. Shesha asked that he be able to keep his mind under control so that he could continue to perform ascetic penances. Brahma gladly accepted the request. [[Brahma]] then asked a favour of Shesha: to go beneath the unstable earth and stabilize it. Shesha agreed and went to the netherworld and stabilized her with his hood. He is known to support her even today, thus making Patala his perennial residence.<ref>''Mbh'', Adi Parva</ref>\n\n===Maha Vishnu and Sankarshana===\n\nShesha is also depicted as floating in the ocean of the changing world, forming the bed of Maha Vishnu. Since he is known as Adishesha (the foremost of snakes) and because he is Anantashesha or simply [[Ananta (infinite)|Ananta]] (endless, as He is known to remain in existence even after the end of the Kalpa, when the whole universe is destroyed).\n\nIn the [[Bhagavata Purana]] Shesha is named '''Sankarshana''', the [[tamasic]] energy of Lord [[Narayana]] himself, and is said to live deep within the inner layers of [[patala]], where there are many serpents with gems on their heads and where Sankarshana is the ruler. He is said to live since before the creation of the universe. When the universe is towards its end, he creates 11 [[Rudras]] from Them to destroy the universe for a new one to be created.\n\nSankarshana is also one of the four [[vyuha]] forms of Vishnu or [[Krishna]], the other three being [[V\u0101sudeva]], [[Pradyumna]] and [[Aniruddha]].\n\nSankarshana expands himself as Garbhodakshayi-Vishnu in the beginning of the universe to create [[Brahma]]. In other words, Lord Sankarshana is Lord Narayana himself.\n\nIn previous chapters of the [[Purana]] it is also said that Lord Sankarshana spoke the Bhagavata to the [[Four Kumaras]], who in their turn passed this message of the Bhagavata. At some point the message was passed to sage [[Maitreya]] who in his turn spoke it to [[Vidura]].\n\n==Other details==\n[[File:Raja Ravi Varma, Seshanarayana (Oleographic print).jpg|thumb|250px|Sheshanarayana by [[Raja Ravi Varma]].]]\n\n[[Lakshmana]] and [[Balarama]] are considered avatara of Sheshanaga (or vice versa).\n\nIt is considered in Vaishnavism, that Lord Balarama is the first manifestation from Lord Krishna, and that Lord Balarama then incarnates into Sesha to serve Krishna as Vishnu.\n\nIn a story from the [[Purana]]s, Shesha's younger brother [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]] loosens [[Mount Mandara]], to enable it to be used in the churning of the ocean by the [[deva (Hinduism)|deva]]s and [[asura]]s.\n\nAccording to the [[Mahabharata]] (Adi Parva), his father was [[Kashyapa]] and his mother [[Kadru]].\n\nThe city of [[Thiruvananthapuram]] is named after him as the \"City of Lord Anantapadmanabha.\"\n\n==Quotations==\n[[File:Vishnu with Shesha Naga - Bronze - Showcase 11-1 - Bronze Gallery - Government Museum - Mathura 2013-02-24 6635.JPG|thumb|Vishnu with Shesha Naga-ancient Bronze artefact in Government Museum Mathura]]\n* \"The foremost manifestation of Lord Vishnu is Sankar\u1e63ana, who is known as Ananta.

He with Kim Hee Hoon of [[South Korea]] successfully completed a same new skill then\u2014now officially named the '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Kim''''' on vault, or Yurchenko (a vault platform entry skill with RO\u2013BH approach upon vaulting table\u2014naming credit given to former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnast [[Natalia Yurchenko]] at a 1982 [[Moscow]] competition) triple twist or TTY\u2014automatically qualifying it to adopt both the gymnasts\u2019 names. Shirai and Tuan Dat Nguyen of [[Vietnam]] likewise successfully completed another same new skill too on floor\u2014the '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Nguyen''''' on floor, or quadruple-twisting back layout. Both skills took the names of two athletes officially, but each skill also evolved separately to have its name shortened over time by many in practice to only the '''''Shirai''''', owing a lot to Shirai first qualifying for these two individual apparatus finals, and then also finishing well in them\u2014neither Kim nor Nguyen qualified for their own finals. Shirai became relevant quickly at senior international elite circuit competitions due to his constant presence, continual participation, friendly disposition, and likeability. Shirai did successfully originate still one more skill on his own here in [[Antwerp]] to now officially bear only his name\u2013the '''''Shirai 2''''' on floor, or layout triple twist forwards. D-scores awarded the '''''Shirai''''' (or '''''Shirai-Kim''''') on vault, plus '''''Shirai''''' (or '''''Shirai-Nguyen''''') and '''''Shirai 2''''' on floor exercise were 6.0, plus '''F''' (0.6) and '''F''' (0.6) respectively in that quad\u2019s 2013\u20132016 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]]. The difficulty values for Shirai\u2019s floor skills have held up, but his vault has since been readjusted lower to 5.6 in the next 2017\u20132020 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]].\n\nNo team event was held at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]] because it has become the custom to omit team event at any WC, which immediately follow the Olympic Games since 2005. As Shirai did qualify for his very first individual floor and vault event finals here, he subsequently became the youngest male gold medal winner too at [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|these 2013 WC]]. In the individual floor event final, Shirai secured his first world title with a \u201chistoric\u201d routine that consisted of 22\u00bc twists and a 7.4 D-score\u2014highest among the finalists. Shirai\u2019s passes: 1) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd\u2013punch double full, 2) front full\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 3) RO\u2013whip back\u2013punch triple full, 4) RO\u2013BH\u20132\u00bd\u2013punch 2\u00bd, 5) RO\u2013side flip full, plus 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai'''''. Compatriot [[K\u014dhei Uchimura]] captured the bronze with a total score of 15.500, and highest execution score (E-score) of 9.100 in the final. Posting a 16.000 total score, Shirai\u2019s 0.4 victory margin over American silver medallist [[Jacob Dalton]], who totalled a 15.600 score, was widest among top individual finalist pairs. Due to Shirai\u2019s demonstrated clean execution of this extremely difficult routine in qualifying, it gave American gold-medallist-turned-commentator [[Tim Daggett]] enough confidence to declare on live TV that \u201cthere is no way Shirai doesn\u2019t win this\u201d right before Shirai started his final routine, which Shirai twisted his way to a gold medal.<ref>{{Citation|last=Universal Sports Network|title=Kenzo Shirai becomes Floor Champ \u2013 Universal Sports|date=2013-10-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OevKut6Ylro|accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nIn the individual vault event final, Shirai's was given a 0.1-point penalty on the first vault for stepping out-of-bounds, finishing him fourth (15.133) place instead of tying for third highest combined score. The two skills Shirai completed were the '''''Shirai''''' (or '''''Shirai-Kim''''') and '''''Driggs''''' (Tsukahara 2\u00bd twist\u2014originated by [[Abel Driggs Santos]] of [[Cuba]] in the 2000s), and they had D-score values of 6.0 and 5.6 respectively in the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]\u2019s then most recent 2013\u20132016 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] for MAG. These vaulting numbers were separately 15.266 and 14.900. The defending 2011 world titlist and 2012 Olympic champion on vault, [[Yang Hak Seon]] of [[South Korea]] (15.533), had captured the gold medal with [[Steven Legendre]] of the [[United States]] (15.249) and [[Kristian Thomas]] of [[Great Britain]] (15.233) managing to secure the respective silver and bronze medals.\n\n===2014 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Nanning, China===\n\nIn October 2014, Shirai competed at the [[2014 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2014 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Nanning]], [[China]]. In the team event finals, his solid contribution was on two events, floor and vault, helping team [[Japan]] win silver with a final score of 273.269 behind team [[China]] with 273.369\u2014just 0.1 short of tie for gold (e.g. one small step). Shirai had the second highest numbers on both events in the team final with scores of 15.766 on floor behind the 15.900 posted by [[Jacob Dalton]] of the [[United States]], who Shirai had relegated into second place in the individual floor event final the year before, plus 15.400 on vault behind the 15.566 posted by [[S\u00e9rgio Sasaki]] of [[Brazil]].\n\nIn the individual event finals, Shirai qualified again for floor exercise and vault. After qualifying first on a familiar routine with a D-score of 7.4 for floor exercise, he was not able to defend his title, capturing silver instead with a final score of 15.733. Shirai was said to be working on improving his routine\u2019s E-score mark after a technical error, stepping out-of-bounds on his third pass, cost him a 0.1-point penalty from the overall score and was enough to lose him the gold\u2014finishing second and behind the surprised [[Denis Ablyazin]] of [[Russia]] (15.750), who himself took bronze on floor with a top 7.1 difficulty and longer routine at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]]. Despite expectations of him defending his world floor title, some have also duly noted that even with far greater D-scores comparatively, Shirai\u2019s routines consisted of compositions derived only from \u201csingle somersault\u201d (one revolution) skills until then, which were quite uncommon plus limiting too, made harder entirely by completing them before and/or after in combination as different combos using various twisting/bounding skills. In addition to an anticipation of what else we could expect of Shirai in the not-too-distant future, British commentary has reported that he was working towards the ability to complete a quintuple-twisting (back layout) somersault soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3xx5f8Euw|title=Kenzo Shirai. 2014 World Gymnastics Championships. EF FX 15.733|first=|last=GutsuFan|date=11 October 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn the individual vault event final, Shirai finished in fourth place again with an average combined score of 15.062 despite having one of the two top E-scores (9.466) in the final, but he unfortunately had a comparatively weak second vault with a D-score of only 5.6, which was the only vault that final scoring below 6.0 and significantly lower than all of his other vaults executed in that final, and ended any chance of him seriously challenging his rivals. In contrast, the eventual gold medallist had a 6.4 difficulty value on both of his vaults, which resulted in a 0.8-point deficit just on Shirai\u2019s second vault alone right from the beginning even before the event final started. [[Ri Se Gwang]] of [[North Korea]] (15.416) had won the gold medal with [[Igor Radivilov]] of [[Ukraine]] (15.333) and [[Jacob Dalton|Dalton]] (15.199) securing their respective silver and bronze. [[South Korea]]\u2019s top-qualifying two-time defending champion, [[Yang Hak Seon]], placed seventh as he sat on both final vaults where they had the top D-score of 6.4\u2014the then new '''''Yang Hak Seon 2''''' (Tsukahara 3\u00bd twist) and '''''Yang Hak Seon''''' (front handspring triple full). Winner [[Ri Se Gwang|Ri]] competed both of his 6.4 difficulty vaults too, the '''''Ri Se Gwang''''' (full-twisting double Tsukahara) and '''''Ri Se Gwang 2''''' (front handspring double piked with half turn, more commonly called the \u201c'''''Dr\u0103gulescu''''' piked\u201d in practice).\n\n===2015 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland===\n\nIn October 2015, Shirai competed at the [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. In the team event finals, he made contributions on the same two apparatuses again, floor exercise and vault, and helped [[Japan]] secure the team gold medal this year with a total combined score of 270.818, outscoring the silver medal team from [[Great Britain]] by nearly half a point. Shirai\u2019s score of 16.325 on floor exercise in this final was the highest among all athletes, and its only score posted above 16 with the second highest at over half a point lower. His vault score of 15.533 was also the team event final\u2019s second highest posted on that apparatus behind the 15.700 posted by [[Russia]]\u2019s [[Denis Ablyazin]], the athlete who also narrowly defeated Shirai for the gold medal in the 2014 individual floor exercise event final.\n\nShirai also made the individual floor and vault event finals again. On October 31, 2015, Shirai secured his second world floor title. In the individual floor event final, he successfully performed another extremely difficult routine and scored a 16.233\u2014ahead of Briton [[Max Whitlock]] and [[Rayderley Zapata]] of [[Spain]]. Shirai\u2019s victory margin from [[Max Whitlock|Whitlock]] in the final was 0.667, the widest among the men\u2019s finals across [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|these 2015 WC]], outscoring even that gold-medal-performance\u2019s winning margin Shirai achieved in the 2013 individual floor event final. His latest routine\u2019s more extreme difficulty of 7.6 in start value was again the highest among the finalists. Shirai\u2019s floor routines until then only consisted of \u201csingle somersault\u201d (one revolution) elements, but there at this event was when Shirai began showing off the additional abilities to consistently complete \u201cdouble somersault\u201d (two revolutions) skills like the '''''Ri Jong Song''''' on floor exercise (triple-twisting double back [tucked] somersault\u2014originated by [[Ri Jong-song|Ri Jong Song]] of [[North Korea]] in the 2000s) with a high difficulty value of '''G''' (0.7), the second highest possible D-score that could be assigned then to any individual skill in [[artistic gymnastics]] except on vault, as his floor routine\u2019s second pass. So, Shirai needed to change the existing second pass of \u201cfront full twist\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2'''''\u201d to come third and eliminate his routine\u2019s original third pass of \u201cRO\u2013whip back\u2013punch triple twist\u201d entirely. The order of all passes\u20141) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd twist\u2013punch double full, 2) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Ri Jong Song''''', 3) front full twist\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 4) RO\u2013BH\u20132\u00bd twist\u2013punch 2\u00bd twist, 5) RO\u2013side somersault full twist, and 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai''''' to end.\n\nIn the individual vault event final, Shirai placed seventh with the average combined score of 14.516. He had posted competitive E-scores among the finalists, but both Shirai\u2019s vaults had the lower D-scores of 5.6 and 5.2 for 2015, lacking then the higher numbers necessary to achieve the bigger average combined score needed and realistically challenge the world's top vaulters for a spot on the podium when every other vault completed in the individual final had a score of 6.0 in difficulty or above. One detail to note here of Shirai\u2019s worst vault final result since his debut at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]]\u2014he started both his two planned vaults normally, but due to his poor landing position of the \u201cYurchenko\u201d first vault, '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Kim''''' (3 twists) with 6.0 difficulty, judges downgraded it to the '''''[[Amanar|Shewfelt]]''''' or '''''[[Amanar]]''''' (2\u00bd twists) with 5.6 difficulty for incomplete twisting, and it resulted in Shirai\u2019s team electing to simplify his \u201cTsukahara\u201d next/second vault from the '''''Driggs''''' (2\u00bd twists) with 5.6 difficulty to '''''Akopian''''' (2 twists\u2014originated by [[Artur Akopyan|Artur Akopian]] of the former [[Soviet Union]] at the WC earlier in the 1980s) with 5.2 difficulty just as Shirai\u2019s chances of medalling at this point of the competition had then suddenly become mathematically extremely unlikely in an instant, effectively due to the initial difficulty loss of 0.4 on his higher-scoring vault. His numbers of 5.6 and 5.2 also happen to correspond now perfectly to this current quad\u2019s actual revised scores in the '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Kim''''', and '''''Driggs''''' respectively. [[Ri Se Gwang]] of [[North Korea]] (15.450) defended his gold, [[Romania]]\u2019s [[Marian Dr\u0103gulescu]] (15.400) won silver, and American [[Donnell Whittenburg]] (15.350) won bronze.\n\n===2015 Toyota International Gymnastics Competition in Toyota City, Japan===\n\nOn December 12\u201313, 2015, Shirai\u2014representing previously his childhood home club, Tsurumi Junior Gymnastics Club, he currently competes out of his university as new home club [[Nippon Sport Science University]] ([[Nippon Sport Science University|NSSU]])\u2014competed at the lower-profile but respectable 2015 Toyota International Gymnastics Competition in [[Toyota City]], [[Japan]]. Even though not an [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]-organised international competition, they had a good pool of gymnasts on their roster, and were of some importance because he had successfully completed his third original skill, one of the currently two most difficult skills on floor in MAG. Via petition, the skill has since taken Shirai\u2019s name, and been officially named the '''''Shirai 3''''' on floor. In practice, that is the '''''Ri Jong Song''''' in layout on floor, triple-twisting double layout, the '''I''' (0.9) second \u201cdouble somersault\u201d (two revolutions) skill incorporated into the existing floor routines after that after he swapped the '''''Shirai 3''''' into starting position for his first pass with the '''''Ri Jong Song''''' to stay as his second pass executed immediately after. The rest of his floor routine has been adjusted accordingly too, to reflect the increased difficulty in this change. All passes: 1) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai 3''''', 2) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Ri Jong Song''''', 3) RO\u2013BH\u20132\u00bd\u2013punch 2\u00bd, 4) front full\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 5) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd\u2013punch full, and 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai'''''.\n\nAt this individual-apparatus-only competition, Shirai had won the gold in the individual floor and vault event finals, achieving scores of 15.700 and 15.225 respectively. Due to his current top D-score nature of the '''''Shirai 3''''' on floor, he also achieved a very rare honour of sharing with [[Andreas Bretschneider]] of [[Germany]], [[Valeri Liukin]] of the former [[USSR|Soviet Union]], and [[Donnell Whittenburg]] of the [[United States]] to own one, until just quite recently, of only four longstanding most difficult and highest-scoring competition-verified original skills in all of MAG to receive the previous official top score assignment of '''H''' (0.8) difficulty from the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]. At present, [[Andreas Bretschneider|Bretschneider]], [[Valeri Liukin|Liukin]] and [[Donnell Whittenburg|Whittenburg]] successfully competed the '''''Bretschneider''''' on high bar (or '''''Kovac''''' [high bar release skill with one full twist integrated into its somersault portion of the skill\u2014originated by [[P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs (gymnast)|P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs]] of [[Hungary]] at the 1979 European Championships] double full), '''''Liukin''''' on floor (or triple tucked back), and '''''Whittenburg''''' on rings (or triple piked back dismount) respectively. The [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]] had once highly expected [[Andreas Bretschneider|Bretschneider]] to progress his very own skill into the layout position\u2014already named it the '''''Bretschneider 2''''' on high bar, suggesting it could be given MAG\u2019s new top difficulty of '''I''' (0.9) to mirror [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]]\u2019s only existing top level floor skill\u2014but he could not do so. This [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]]\u2019s only top '''I''' (0.9) level skill then\u2014the '''''Moors''''' on floor, or double-twisting double back layout, by [[Victoria Moors]] of [[Canada]], who originated it at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]].\n\n===2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil===\n\nOn August 6, 2016, at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], team [[Japan]] qualified first for the team all-around (AA) event finals, after successes at the [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 WC]]. They then solidified their victory two days later at the [[Rio Olympic Arena]] with a final combined score of 274.094. Shirai contributed to the gold medal win in the [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's artistic team all-around|team event finals]] with top scores of 16.133 and 15.633 on floor and vault. He did not compete anymore in finals on remaining individual events at [[2016 Summer Olympics|these Olympics]]. This team from [[Japan]] ended up winning their gold medals ahead of teams from [[Russia]] and [[China]]\u2014they finished with respective score totals of 271.453 and 271.122.\n\nShirai looked in good form to compete, qualifying for both individual floor and vault finals. As a twice/reigning floor world champion with routine D-score of 7.6, he was the favourite for gold, but placed a disappointing fourth (15.366) with landing troubles in 3 of 6 passes. His team final floor score could have beaten winner by \u00bd point. [[Max Whitlock]] of [[Great Britain]] (15.633), the gymnast who Shirai had readily beaten only a year ago in the individual floor final at the [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 WC]] by a wide score margin, won the gold medal, and [[Diego Hyp\u00f3lito]] (15.533) and [[Arthur Mariano]] (15.433)\u2014both from host country of [[Brazil]]\u2014captured the silver and bronze medals respectively. In the individual vault event final the day after, Shirai posted an average combined total of 15.449 (15.833 and 15.066 on each respective vault\u2014the former becoming the highest-scoring vault of that final), and tied the legendary [[Marian Dr\u0103gulescu]] of [[Romania]] for the third highest numeric score in the event final. The tie-breaker had worked in Shirai\u2019s favour this time, to win him the bronze medal, edging out [[Marian Dr\u0103gulescu|Dr\u0103gulescu]], who had ended up with the identical average combined score too but missed achieving this all-important deciding factor for breaking a tie then, of a medal\u2014it was the single highest numeric E-score on any vault that had already been executed. With the defending Olympic champion, [[South Korea]]\u2019s [[Yang Hak Seon]], out injured, [[North Korea]]\u2019s [[Ri Se Gwang]] (15.691), whose [[artistic gymnastics]] team was banned from competition in 2012 amidst continual age falsification violations by their female athletes, won the gold while [[Russia]]\u2019s [[Denis Ablyazin]] (15.516) defended his silver.\n\nIn [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio]], Shirai also successfully originated a second vault, now officially named the '''''Shirai 2''''' (3\u00bd-twisting Yurchenko), which was assigned the second highest D-score of 6.4 in the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]\u2019s existing 2013\u20132016 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] with the top 7.0 difficulty assessed in advance for the '''''Radivilov''''' (front handspring triple [tucked] somersault) originated by the 2012 Olympic vault bronze medallist, specialist [[Igor Radivilov]] of [[Ukraine]]. Naming credit was given despite him sitting it down in the individual vault final, only for it to be totally banned from competition and removed from the next [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] due to a high risk of injury when competing/training the skill. Thus, Shirai now shares honour of owning at least one of only five official top 6.0 difficulty skills named after them with the 2012 and 2016 Olympic vault champions, [[Yang Hak Seon|Yang]] and [[Ri Se Gwang|Ri]], both owning two each. All vaults again with the top difficulty of 6.0 in their relevant 2017\u20132020 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] are the '''''Shirai 2''''', '''''Yang Hak Seon''''', '''''Yang Hak Seon 2''''', '''''Ri Se Gwang''''' and '''''Ri Se Gwang 2'''''. In two out of the aforementioned five most difficult vaults, the former two\u2014the '''''Shirai 2''''' plus '''''Yang Hak Seon'''''\u2014only their originators have ever successfully completed them at a major competition. Since Shirai originated the '''''Shirai 2''''' on vault in the individual event finals, he had no plans soon to compete it again after [[2016 Summer Olympics|these Olympics]].\n\n===2017 Melbourne World Cup in Melbourne, Australia===\n\nOn February 22\u201325, 2017, Shirai\u2014still riding on some of that momentum from his preparation for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]\u2014competed abroad in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], at the [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|2017 Melbourne World Cup]], an individual apparatus-only competition, with an expanded programme including more events, which added the horizontal bar (HB), still rings (SR) plus parallel bars (PB) to his seasoned routines/skills on floor and vault. In still rings qualifications, he placed tenth in last place with a low E-score\u2014reduced combined total\u2014did not qualify for the event final. In parallel bars qualifications, Shirai placed third, and thus qualified for this event final. Despite falling in his routine during the horizontal bar qualifications, Shirai finished in fourth place due to errors made by his rivals, and also ended up in its event final. In both floor and vault qualifications, he had finished both on top, qualifying him for two extra individual finals. In the individual parallel bars event final, he won a silver medal by getting the second highest E-score of 8.433 with a combined score of 14.433. A Chinese gymnast, [[Zou Jingyuan]] (15.166), won the gold medal while [[Ferhat Arican]] of [[Turkey]] (13.566) captured the bronze medal. In the individual horizontal bar event final, Shirai managed to secure the gold medal with the combined score of 13.933, thanks to another of his second highest E-scores of 8.333, plus more mistakes made by other competitors in this final. Mitchell Morgans of [[Australia]] (13.400), and another one of Shirai\u2019s fellow Japanese Yusuke Saito (13.333) won the silver and bronze medals respectively. In this individual floor event final, Shirai easily won the gold with his extreme score of 14.700 largely because of his routine\u2019s highest score number of 7.2 in difficulty\u2014the second highest only 6.5 among all the finalists. Mu Jile of [[China]] (14.466) captured the silver, and [[Ferhat Arican|Arican]] (14.033) won his second bronze down under. Lastly, in the final of their individual vault event, Shirai won the second gold medal of the competition with the average combined score of 14.916 because of the two highest execution numbers of 9.500 and 9.533 he posted in this event final. [[Christopher Remkes]] of [[Australia]] (14.883) won the silver medal with another of Shirai\u2019s countryman Wataru Tanigawa (14.566) securing the bronze medal.\n\nLike in [[Toyota City]], that early lower-profile [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup]] competition also holds some significance because in [[Melbourne]], Shirai had successfully completed still yet one more original element\u2014his sixth in total\u2014to then be officially named the '''''Shirai 3''''' on vault automatically. Thus, he currently has more skills bearing his name than any other male gymnast in history, and second only to [[Svetlana Khorkina]] of [[Russia]], who holds the all-time record of having nine original skills adopt her name across all four apparatuses in [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]]. The '''''Shirai 3''''' on vault (or aka \u201cfull on\u2013double full off\u201d in practice) was given a D-score of 5.4 in the 2017\u20132020 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]]. The vault technically has a RO\u2013full-twisting BH (Scherbo\u2014vault platform entry skill; originated by [[Vitaly Scherbo]] of the former [[Soviet Union]], then [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]], and finally [[Belarus]] early in the 1990s) entry onto platform and then into back layout double twist off it\u2014rare but skill can be called a double-twisting Scherbo too. Still to be realized, our next skill in that progression\u2014RO\u2013full-twisting BH onto platform into 2\u00bd twist off it, or \u201cfull on\u20132\u00bd off\u201d\u2014was earlier assessed in advance, giving it a difficulty value of 5.8, which many think it to be too low since the '''''Li Xiao Peng''''' on vault (or aka \u201c\u00bd on\u20132\u00bd off\u201d in practice; originated by the great Chinese gymnast [[Li Xiaopeng (gymnast)|Li Xiao Peng]] in the 2000s) has already been long given a D-score of 5.8 too. \u201cFull on\u20132\u00bd off\u201d has by nature more twists, and thus is more complex/harder to execute\u2014should have a higher D-score.\n\n===2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Montreal, Canada===\n\nIn October 2017, Shirai showed he retained more of the Olympic form when he competed at the [[2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]]. No team events were held, as it is customary since 2005 at the WC in the year right after the Olympics. Shirai would eventually win three medals on a full competition programme that included owning a routine on his last holdout event of pommel horse (PH). He had then become eligible for the individual AA competition in [[Montreal]], winning the first world AA medal (bronze) behind [[Xiao Ruoteng]] (86.933) and [[Lin Chaopan]] (86.488), both of [[China]].<ref>https://mtl2017gymcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/C73G_Results_MenSenC2.pdf</ref> Shirai\u2019s combined total of 86.431 has 15.733 on floor, 13.433 on pommel horse, 13.666 on still rings, 15.000 on vault, 14.633 on parallel bars, and 13.966 on high bar. With the top numbers on floor and vault among AA finalists, Shirai had also easily defended the individual world floor title from two years ago when the WC were last held with a final score of 15.633,<ref>https://mtl2017gymcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/C73I_Floor-Exercise_Results_MenSenC3.pdf</ref> out-tumbling the silver medallist, [[Artem Dolgopyat]] of [[Israel]]\u2014just managing a score of 14.533\u2014by over a point. Shirai\u2019s final unassailable victory margin of 1.1 became their widest one yet at the WC, outdistancing himself from his rivals even more than the 2015 performance did. His passes stayed consistent after originating the '''''Shirai 3''''' on floor.\n\nShirai also qualified second for the vault\u2019s individual event finals with an average combined total of 14.949 but subsequently won his first world vault title by putting up the highest average combined scores of 14.900, 15.200 and 14.600 for his first and second numbers respectively,<ref>https://mtl2017gymcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/C73J_Both_Vault_Results_MenSenC3.pdf</ref> in a very exciting/close last round of competition. Shirai did manage to win with the absolute slimmest of victory margin by just 0.001 after the 2012 Olympic bronze medallist on vault, event specialist [[Igor Radivilov]] of [[Ukraine]], came up short and finished with the closest possible second highest average combined score of 14.899. Shirai did also get a little help when the top qualifier and 2012 Olympic champion on vault, [[South Korea]]\u2019s [[Yang Hak Seon]], withdrew with a hamstring injury after outscoring Shirai by a significant margin of 0.334 with the average combined score of 15.283 in qualifying, which was three times more than the margin of any two other qualifiers. These score differences were only about 0.1.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Shirai has executed two identical vaults as he has done since this event debut at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]] on every individual vault event, even though he has successfully completed more difficult and higher-scoring vaults in competition\u2014specifically the '''''Shirai 2''''' and '''''Shirai 3''''' with the former heavily contributing to his bronze medal win at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and latter slightly less his gold in the individual vault event final at the [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|2017 Melbourne World Cup]]. Like D-scores of other selected vaults across the board, the ones for the '''''Shirai 2''''' and '''''Shirai 3''''' were also adjusted to 5.6 and 5.2 respectively in this 2017\u20132020 quad. Also, Hidetaka Miyachi of [[Japan]] took advantage of injuries on German [[Andreas Bretschneider]], who was beaten to the punch here in 2017, originating the first double-twisting layout '''''Kovac''''', or now officially named the '''''Miyachi''''' on high bar\u2014only skill then given the new top level '''I''' (0.9) D-score value, and created in advance specially for it by the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]\u2014successfully first on home soil at the All-[[Japan]] Apparatus Championships in [[Takasaki]], [[Japan]], before he petitioned governing body to officially verify skill completion and name adoption. '''I''' (0.9), the new top D-score, was created then to assist an existing MAG scoring system more accurately reflect the very extreme D-score of the '''''Miyachi''''' on high bar, which was verified here at [[2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships|these 2017 WC]] then\u2014as a result, it did also update the MAG scoring system levels again mirror [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]].\n\n===2018 American Cup in Hoffman Estates, United States\u20132018 Tokyo World Cup and NHK Trophy in Tokyo, Japan===\n\nOn March 3, 2018, Shirai started this competition season for 2018 when he accepted the invitation to participate in the [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|American Cup FIG Individual All-Around World Cup 2018]] or [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|2018 American Cup]] in [[Hoffman Estates, Illinois|Hoffman Estates]] (suburb of [[Chicago]]), [[United States]]. In the individual AA-only competition, he placed sixth, achieving a combined total of 81.498 despite posting top floor and vault scores, the signature apparatuses, of 15.066 and 14.966 respectively, and second highest tying [[Yul Moldauer]] of the [[United States]] on parallel bars with 14.500 behind leader [[Petro Pakhnyuk|Petro Pakhniuk]] of [[Ukraine]] with 14.933. Each of Shirai\u2019s scores, in particular on pommel horse, was relatively weaker when compared to all other finalists. Hovering sufficiently lower, Shirai\u2019s numbers on each of the apparatuses were a 11.100 on pommel horse (lowest on that apparatus with top number posted nearly three full points higher), 13.700 on still rings, and 12.166 on the horizontal bar. As defending, and eventual, champion of the competition, [[Yul Moldauer|Moldauer]] scored an 85.964, outscoring Shirai by a fair margin of almost 4\u00bd points because [[Yul Moldauer|Moldauer]] was able to achieve one of the top three scores on every apparatus\u2014the highest scorer on still rings, third highest on vault, tie for the second highest on parallel bars, plus second highest on his remaining apparatuses.\n\nOn April 14, 2018, Shirai competed at this spring\u2019s last [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]-sanctioned [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup]] competition with home advantage at the [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|FIG Individual All-Around World Cup 2018]] or [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|2018 Tokyo World Cup]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. In this group of competing gymnasts at different experience levels from many countries across several world continents of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]], Shirai won gold on the individual all-around event, his very first all-around gold medal at an [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]] competition with a combined score of 86.064. Scores from each apparatus were 15.200 on floor, 13.533 on pommel horse, 13.766 on still rings, 14.966 on vault, 14.466 on parallel bars, and 14.133 on the horizontal bar. Among all his scores, Shirai posted one of the top three values on all apparatuses too with the highest numbers on floor, pommel horse and vault, plus second highest on parallel bars and the horizontal bar behind the values of 14.533 posted by [[Russia]]\u2019s [[Artur Dalaloyan]] on parallel bars and 14.500 by [[Sam Mikulak]] of the [[United States]] on the horizontal bar, plus third highest too on rings behind those scores of 14.366 and 14.300 posted by [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]] and Wataru Tanigawa of [[Japan]]. In the end, familiar efforts by Tanigawa and [[Sam Mikulak|Mikulak]] had managed to capture the silver and bronze medals too with respective combined scores of 84.399 and 84.098.\n\nOn May 19\u201320, 2018, Shirai competed at the lower-profile non-[[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] individual all-around-only event, also at home\u2014primarily for the Japanese coaches to help assess the level of fitness and preparation of each local gymnast hoping to be included onto the national team for namely the WC\u2014at the 2018 NHK Trophy in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Although it is not an event organised by the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]], [[Japan]] still requires participation with favourable results at the competition as a prerequisite in order to be considered for the Japanese team at the next WC. If an athlete had to miss the event but still want represent [[Japan]] then, he or she must secure a waiver, which is rarely granted. Shirai won the silver medal here with a combined score of 257.895 including floor's top score of 15.433 as well as third highest of 14.833 on vault, just behind Takumi Sato\u2014only competed on floor, rings and vault\u2014and vault specialist Hidenobu Yonekura\u2014only competed on his specialty event. For Shirai\u2019s other apparatuses, those scores were 13.600 on pommel horse, 13.366 on rings, 14.433 on parallel bars, and 14.066 on high bar respectively. Gold medal went to the legend [[K\u014dhei Uchimura]], who had come from behind to win with the combined score of 258.629\u2014it would include the top score of 14.966 on high bar, and second highest of 14.633 on floor.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kyodo News|title=Gymnastics: Kohei Uchimura bounces back to win his 10th straight NHK Cup|date=2018-05-20|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/05/f447edb87662-gymnastics-uchimura-bounces-back-to-win-his-10th-straight-nhk-cup.html|accessdate=2018-07-29}}</ref>\n\n===2018 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Doha, Qatar===\n\nOn October 25\u2013November 3, 2018, Shirai competed at the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]]\u2014the first ever WC held in the Middle East. Although he lost some form in competition and was thus less successful this year than he was in 2017, his limited preparation still got him one silver and two bronzes. Shirai contributed to the bronze medal win for the Japanese team event on three apparatuses\u2014floor exercise, vault and the horizontal bar where he scored a 14.933, 14.966 and 13.966 respectively. Shirai qualified for the individual finals too on the all-around, floor exercise and vault. During the individual all-around final, Shirai was unable to replicate a comparable level of success as his 2017 bronze medal win, and he finally managed to only place seventh from a total combined score of 84.531.\n\nIn the individual floor exercise and vault event finals, Shirai was likewise unable to defend the 2017 gold medals he won in them, and had to respectively settle for the silver and bronze medals instead. In the individual floor exercise event final, he scored a 14.866 behind a much-improved, and 2018\u2019s individual all-around event gold medallist [[Artur Dalaloyan]] of [[Russia]], who marginally outscored Shirai with a 14.900 in a cleanly executed routine. Shirai\u2019s floor routine\u2019s D-score of 6.8 was a bit lower than usual, though still higher than [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]]\u2019s 6.2, but [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]] was able to post a sufficiently high E-score too of 8.700 to Shirai\u2019s 8.066, and overtake Shirai in the final combined total. Known mostly for his uncanny abilities as a \u201ctwister\u201d, Shirai regularly performed floor routines with D-scores above 7.0, using almost only twisting skills or combinations. In the individual vault event final, Shirai scored a lower combined average of 14.675 because of the lower D-score values assigned to all vaults he completed, particularly the second, behind eventual silver medallist [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]] (14.883), plus gold medallist [[Ri Se Gwang]] of [[North Korea]] (14.933), who is the 2016 Olympic vault champion. Both of Shirai\u2019s vaults had lower D-scores then by good significance (5.6 and 5.2) if compared to 2018\u2019s gold-medal-winning duo of 6.0 each.\n\nIt may be appropriate to point out that Shirai did complete a substantially simplified routine, at times was even seemingly assembled in a rush, for his standards in the individual floor exercise event final. D-scores of Shirai\u2019s floor routines had always consistently valued around 7.4 in the past, but at this event, it was decreased to 6.8. Although this D-score was still the highest among all finalists, the opening loss of about 0.6 from his routine\u2019s combined total was sufficient to effectively lose the gold, but won him silver instead this year since [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]], the eventual winner\u2014whose routine in comparison had a lower D-score of 6.2\u2014did outscore Shirai in execution, even if just barely, and only by 0.034 in the end. The routine of his did not particularly feel as well organised as his previous ones. Shirai\u2019s passes were 1) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Ri Jong Song''''', 2) front full twist\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 3) RO\u2013BH\u20131\u00bd twist\u2013punch 1\u00bd twist, 4) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai''''', 5) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd twist\u2013punch full twist, and 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013triple full. It is also worth noting again that Shirai always competed his two same exact vaults\u2014first a \u201cYurchenko\u201d\u2013then forward-entry \u201cTsukahara\u201d\u2014in the individual vault event finals at all of the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]\u2019s major competitions but one in 2013\u20132018 (WC but not [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he won the bronze after advancing to the '''''Shirai 2''''' on vault, or 3\u00bd-twisting Yurchenko, for his backward-entry skill), competing better generally from one year to his next. Although his vaults\u2019 D-scores have since been lowered from 6.0 and 5.6 (2013\u20132015) in the last 2013\u20132016 quad to 5.6 and 5.2 (2017\u20132018) in the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]\u2019s next 2017\u20132020 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]], he continued to improve his standings in the individual vault finals every year. In 2013\u20132015, Shirai placed fourth, fourth and seventh, and in 2017\u20132018, he won gold and bronze respectively.\n\n===2019 Tokyo World Cup and All-Japan All-Around Championships in Tokyo, Japan===\n\nOn April 7, 2019, Shirai began his season competing at the [[2019 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|FIG Individual All-Around World Cup 2019]] or [[2019 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|2019 Tokyo World Cup]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Like in 2018, Shirai was supposed to start competition at the [[2019 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|2019 American Cup]], but withdrew to treat a left ankle injury,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/03/03/more-sports/gymnastics/mai-murakami-finishes-third-american-cup/#.XLkTfy_Mzys|title=Mai Murakami finishes third at American Cup|date=3 March 2019|publisher=|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref> which he sustained about a week before he started travelling. Due to the injury, Shirai simplified certain skills in his routines for the competition here in [[Tokyo]], which became especially noticeable when he performed on floor\u2014his strongest signature event\u2014as he recycled, using portions of his past routines. Changes included starting his floor routine with a RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd twist\u2013punch double twist opening pass instead of the '''''Shirai 3''''', one of two hardest floor skills in MAG, and ending with only a triple twist last pass instead of the '''''Shirai''''', his infamous quad twist. In the end, Shirai failed to defend his gold medal from last year, but managed to capture bronze with the combined score of 82.964, despite still recovering from injury. The 2018 bronze medallist, [[Sam Mikulak]] of the [[United States]] (86.599), improved his standings, and won gold. [[Japan]]\u2019s Wataru Tanigawa (85.665) defended his silver. Sport analyst [[Tim Daggett]] opined Shirai as \u201cman, myth, legend\u2014capable of doing...many things...people thought were...literally impossible before...\u201d in gymnastics.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gin\u00e1stica Brasil|title=Men's All-Around World Cup \u2013 Tokyo 2019|date=2019-04-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_UALsRaa8|accessdate=2019-06-17}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26\u201328, 2019, Shirai competed at the 2019 All-[[Japan]] AA Championships, one of two closely held AA-only events in [[Chofu]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Shirai had qualified for event finals in 22nd place, finishing in 30th. Shirai also managed only one score in the top three on any apparatus, second highest on floor (14.533) behind Kazuki Minami (14.633), who just competed on floor. This event\u2019s respective gold, silver and bronze medallists\u2014Kakeru Tanigawa with a combined score of 84.699, Kazuma Kaya with a combined score of 84.664, and Kazuyuki Takeda with a combined score of 84.498\u2014had Tanigawa managing the second highest score for pommel horse while Takeda had achieved the third highest for still rings too. After assessing their winning scores, it shows there is much to be desired in being able to post numbers that are above average for every apparatus. Shirai\u2019s remaining scores in that final\u201412.900 on pommel horse, 12.800 on still rings, 14.166 on vault, 13.733 on parallel bars, 11.300 on the horizontal bar, and 79.432 for the total AA combined score. Injury had persisted to adversely affect the recent competition performances, and thus reflected in the results. Event number differences between top apparatus scores and Shirai\u2019s were particularly wide on pommel horse, still rings and the horizontal bar.\n\n===2019 NHK Trophy in Chofu and All-Japan Apparatus Championships in Takasaki, Japan===\n\nOn May 18\u201319, 2019, Shirai competed at the 2019 NHK Trophy, also in [[Chofu]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]\u2014repeating his 2018 participation at this AA-only event. Due to lingering injury issues with the left ankle, he was unable to perform as well in the competition in comparison to most others, which would also include his performance here last year. Shirai placed 23rd with a 243.794 combined score. He was unable to achieve a top three score on any of the apparatuses, not even on his signatures of floor or vault. Shirai\u2019s scores on each respective apparatus were 14.500 on floor, 12.533 on pommel horse, 12.800 on still rings, 14.566 on vault, 14.066 on parallel bars, and 13.066 on high bar. Kakeru Tanigawa (254.363), Wataru Tanigawa (254.128) and Kazuma Kaya (254.126), who won their gold, silver and bronze,<ref>{{Citation|last=The Gymternet|title=2019 NHK Trophy Men\u2019s Results|date=2019-07-28|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/22/2019-nhk-trophy-mens-results/|accessdate=2019-07-27}}</ref> were unable too to score, if at all, more than only one of the top three numbers on any apparatus, which may also indicate that none of their 2019 gymnasts was able to do particularly well this year at this competition\u2014Kakeru Tanigawa was only able to score the second highest number (14.733) on floor, Wataru Tanigawa was also just able to make the third highest (14.866) on vault, and just like Shirai, Kazuma Kaya was likewise not able to post a top three number on any one of the apparatuses at this event too.\n\nOn June 21\u201323, 2019, Shirai competed at the 2019 All-[[Japan]] Apparatus Championships in [[Takasaki]], [[Japan]], hoping he would do well enough to secure a spot on the Japanese national team, and compete at the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. It was ultimately not meant to be his year though. Shirai had qualified into the individual event finals specifically on floor exercise, vault and the horizontal bar in second, fourth and sixth respectively. In these finals, he had finished in third (14.900), fifth (14.433) and eighth (11.200) place, respectively for each of these three apparatuses too. Finishing ahead of Shirai on floor exercise were Kazuki Minami with a total score of 15.033, and Naoto Hayasaka with a total score of 15.000. Their top finisher on vault was Keitoro Okubo, posting the average combined score of 15.233, and the winner of the horizontal bar was Hirohito Kahama with a total score of 14.766. Shirai\u2019s floor D-score numbers had remained on top among all the finalists. However, his execution needed some additional work, and could have been cleaner, which was thus reflected on the routine\u2019s E-score. Shirai\u2019s vault D-score values were comparatively lesser\u2014only one with the lowest 5.2\u2014and needed higher base numbers before he could seriously challenge the top vaulters.\n\n===2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany\u20132020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan===\n\nFor the first time since Shirai\u2019s international debut at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|WC in 2013]], he had failed to qualify for the Japanese national [[artistic gymnastics]] team, and participate in the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], which was held on October 4\u201313, 2019. Shirai\u2019s performance was slowed for most of the 2019 season by a very stubborn injury to the left ankle, and thus unable to perform/compete his best at the 2019 All-[[Japan]] Apparatus Championships\u2014results there and at the 2019 NHK Trophy determined gymnasts\u2019 eligibility to join team [[Japan]] at the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 WC]]. Shirai\u2019s best chance was to secure one of two spots available for individual event specialists\u2014namely on his two signature apparatuses of floor exercise and vault. However, he was just able to place third on floor exercise, plus fifth on vault to miss qualifying for [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|these WC]], resulting in his inability to defend 2018\u2019s team bronze, and individual silver on floor and bronze on vault. As Shirai was not the only high-profile absentee, [[Japan]] had sent a fairly inexperienced men\u2019s team with their most decorated member, [[K\u014dhei Uchimura]], also missing from the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 WC]] due to injury. [[K\u014dhei Uchimura|Uchimura]] was struggling and attempting then still a return to past winning ways since he tore his, also left ankle, ligaments in qualifying on AA\u2019s vault at the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 WC]].\n\nWithout [[Japan]]\u2019s full team in [[Stuttgart]], the men\u2019s competition was dominated mostly by gymnasts from [[Russia]] or other [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet states]] with an odd individual final being won by an athlete from another country. The defending champion for their men\u2019s individual AA was [[Artur Dalaloyan]] of [[Russia]], who finished second here behind countryman [[Nikita Nagornyy]] in individual AA and vault finals. Led by [[Simone Biles]], the women\u2019s field was dominated by Americans. [[Japan]]\u2019s top female gymnast, [[Mai Murakami]], was unable to defend the 2018 individual AA silver and floor bronze she won after she missed a prerequisite meet, 2019 NHK Trophy, due to a back injury.\n\nDue to far-reaching effects of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[Japan]]\u2019s prime minister, [[Shinz\u014d Abe]], announced in March 2020 together through a joint statement that the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], would not take place on the original dates of July 24\u2013August 9, 2020, citing public health concerns, and have been postponed a year to now start in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/sports/olympics/coronavirus-olympics-postponed-2021.html|title=Tokyo Olympics Organizers Considering July 2021 for Opening Ceremony|date=28 March 2020|publisher=|via=The New York Times}}</ref> The [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] also updated that all gymnastics would proceed on July 23\u2013August 8, 2021. As of this time, no one knows for sure if the national teams of [[Japan]] or any country could still send teams consisting of familiar people a year later. Athletes train hard to accurately manage peaks in their performances following four-year-cycle timetables while targeting specific periods for the Olympics too, but because of this delay, unlike Shirai, more senior gymnasts, namely [[Simone Biles|Biles]] and [[K\u014dhei Uchimura|Uchimura]] who are already widely considered by many the greatest gymnasts of all time, may just simply retire. The Japanese men\u2019s national [[artistic gymnastics]] team previously qualified the full four-member squad for the team AA event by winning team bronze at the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 WC]] where Shirai contributed three scores in team total\u2014floor, vault and high bar.

He with Kim Hee Hoon of [[South Korea]] successfully completed a same new skill then\u2014now officially named the '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Kim''''' on vault, or Yurchenko (a vault platform entry skill with RO\u2013BH approach upon vaulting table\u2014naming credit given to former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] gymnast [[Natalia Yurchenko]] at a 1982 [[Moscow]] competition) triple twist or TTY\u2014automatically qualifying it to adopt both the gymnasts\u2019 names. Shirai and Tuan Dat Nguyen of [[Vietnam]] likewise successfully completed another same new skill too on floor\u2014the '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Nguyen''''' on floor, or quadruple-twisting back layout. Both skills took the names of two athletes officially, but each skill also evolved separately to have its name shortened over time by many in practice to only the '''''Shirai''''', owing a lot to Shirai first qualifying for these two individual apparatus finals, and then also finishing well in them\u2014neither Kim nor Nguyen qualified for their own finals. Shirai became relevant quickly at senior international elite circuit competitions due to his constant presence, continual participation, friendly disposition, and likeability. Shirai did successfully originate still one more skill on his own here in [[Antwerp]] to now officially bear only his name\u2013the '''''Shirai 2''''' on floor, or layout triple twist forwards. D-scores awarded the '''''Shirai''''' (or '''''Shirai-Kim''''') on vault, plus '''''Shirai''''' (or '''''Shirai-Nguyen''''') and '''''Shirai 2''''' on floor exercise were 6.0, plus '''F''' (0.6) and '''F''' (0.6) respectively in that quad\u2019s 2013\u20132016 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]]. The difficulty values for Shirai\u2019s floor skills have held up, but his vault has since been readjusted lower to 5.6 in the next 2017\u20132020 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]].\n\nNo team event was held at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]] because it has become the custom to omit team event at any WC, which immediately follow the Olympic Games since 2005. As Shirai did qualify for his very first individual floor and vault event finals here, he subsequently became the youngest male gold medal winner too at [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|these 2013 WC]]. In the individual floor event final, Shirai secured his first world title with a \u201chistoric\u201d routine that consisted of 22\u00bc twists and a 7.4 D-score\u2014highest among the finalists. Shirai\u2019s passes: 1) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd\u2013punch double full, 2) front full\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 3) RO\u2013whip back\u2013punch triple full, 4) RO\u2013BH\u20132\u00bd\u2013punch 2\u00bd, 5) RO\u2013side flip full, plus 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai'''''. Compatriot [[K\u014dhei Uchimura]] captured the bronze with a total score of 15.500, and highest execution score (E-score) of 9.100 in the final. Posting a 16.000 total score, Shirai\u2019s 0.4 victory margin over American silver medallist [[Jacob Dalton]], who totalled a 15.600 score, was widest among top individual finalist pairs. Due to Shirai\u2019s demonstrated clean execution of this extremely difficult routine in qualifying, it gave American gold-medallist-turned-commentator [[Tim Daggett]] enough confidence to declare on live TV that \u201cthere is no way Shirai doesn\u2019t win this\u201d right before Shirai started his final routine, which Shirai twisted his way to a gold medal.<ref>{{Citation|last=Universal Sports Network|title=Kenzo Shirai becomes Floor Champ \u2013 Universal Sports|date=2013-10-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OevKut6Ylro|accessdate=2019-06-18}}</ref>\n\nIn the individual vault event final, Shirai's was given a 0.1-point penalty on the first vault for stepping out-of-bounds, finishing him fourth (15.133) place instead of tying for third highest combined score. The two skills Shirai completed were the '''''Shirai''''' (or '''''Shirai-Kim''''') and '''''Driggs''''' (Tsukahara 2\u00bd twist\u2014originated by [[Abel Driggs Santos]] of [[Cuba]] in the 2000s), and they had D-score values of 6.0 and 5.6 respectively in the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]\u2019s then most recent 2013\u20132016 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] for MAG. These vaulting numbers were separately 15.266 and 14.900. The defending 2011 world titlist and 2012 Olympic champion on vault, [[Yang Hak Seon]] of [[South Korea]] (15.533), had captured the gold medal with [[Steven Legendre]] of the [[United States]] (15.249) and [[Kristian Thomas]] of [[Great Britain]] (15.233) managing to secure the respective silver and bronze medals.\n\n===2014 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Nanning, China===\n\nIn October 2014, Shirai competed at the [[2014 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2014 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Nanning]], [[China]]. In the team event finals, his solid contribution was on two events, floor and vault, helping team [[Japan]] win silver with a final score of 273.269 behind team [[China]] with 273.369\u2014just 0.1 short of tie for gold (e.g. one small step). Shirai had the second highest numbers on both events in the team final with scores of 15.766 on floor behind the 15.900 posted by [[Jacob Dalton]] of the [[United States]], who Shirai had relegated into second place in the individual floor event final the year before, plus 15.400 on vault behind the 15.566 posted by [[S\u00e9rgio Sasaki]] of [[Brazil]].\n\nIn the individual event finals, Shirai qualified again for floor exercise and vault. After qualifying first on a familiar routine with a D-score of 7.4 for floor exercise, he was not able to defend his title, capturing silver instead with a final score of 15.733. Shirai was said to be working on improving his routine\u2019s E-score mark after a technical error, stepping out-of-bounds on his third pass, cost him a 0.1-point penalty from the overall score and was enough to lose him the gold\u2014finishing second and behind the surprised [[Denis Ablyazin]] of [[Russia]] (15.750), who himself took bronze on floor with a top 7.1 difficulty and longer routine at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]]. Despite expectations of him defending his world floor title, some have also duly noted that even with far greater D-scores comparatively, Shirai\u2019s routines consisted of compositions derived only from \u201csingle somersault\u201d (one revolution) skills until then, which were quite uncommon plus limiting too, made harder entirely by completing them before and/or after in combination as different combos using various twisting/bounding skills. In addition to an anticipation of what else we could expect of Shirai in the not-too-distant future, British commentary has reported that he was working towards the ability to complete a quintuple-twisting (back layout) somersault soon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nl3xx5f8Euw|title=Kenzo Shirai. 2014 World Gymnastics Championships. EF FX 15.733|first=|last=GutsuFan|date=11 October 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn the individual vault event final, Shirai finished in fourth place again with an average combined score of 15.062 despite having one of the two top E-scores (9.466) in the final, but he unfortunately had a comparatively weak second vault with a D-score of only 5.6, which was the only vault that final scoring below 6.0 and significantly lower than all of his other vaults executed in that final, and ended any chance of him seriously challenging his rivals. In contrast, the eventual gold medallist had a 6.4 difficulty value on both of his vaults, which resulted in a 0.8-point deficit just on Shirai\u2019s second vault alone right from the beginning even before the event final started. [[Ri Se Gwang]] of [[North Korea]] (15.416) had won the gold medal with [[Igor Radivilov]] of [[Ukraine]] (15.333) and [[Jacob Dalton|Dalton]] (15.199) securing their respective silver and bronze. [[South Korea]]\u2019s top-qualifying two-time defending champion, [[Yang Hak Seon]], placed seventh as he sat on both final vaults where they had the top D-score of 6.4\u2014the then new '''''Yang Hak Seon 2''''' (Tsukahara 3\u00bd twist) and '''''Yang Hak Seon''''' (front handspring triple full). Winner [[Ri Se Gwang|Ri]] competed both of his 6.4 difficulty vaults too, the '''''Ri Se Gwang''''' (full-twisting double Tsukahara) and '''''Ri Se Gwang 2''''' (front handspring double piked with half turn, more commonly called the \u201c'''''Dr\u0103gulescu''''' piked\u201d in practice).\n\n===2015 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Glasgow, Scotland===\n\nIn October 2015, Shirai competed at the [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]]. In the team event finals, he made contributions on the same two apparatuses again, floor exercise and vault, and helped [[Japan]] secure the team gold medal this year with a total combined score of 270.818, outscoring the silver medal team from [[Great Britain]] by nearly half a point. Shirai\u2019s score of 16.325 on floor exercise in this final was the highest among all athletes, and its only score posted above 16 with the second highest at over half a point lower. His vault score of 15.533 was also the team event final\u2019s second highest posted on that apparatus behind the 15.700 posted by [[Russia]]\u2019s [[Denis Ablyazin]], the athlete who also narrowly defeated Shirai for the gold medal in the 2014 individual floor exercise event final.\n\nShirai also made the individual floor and vault event finals again. On October 31, 2015, Shirai secured his second world floor title. In the individual floor event final, he successfully performed another extremely difficult routine and scored a 16.233\u2014ahead of Briton [[Max Whitlock]] and [[Rayderley Zapata]] of [[Spain]]. Shirai\u2019s victory margin from [[Max Whitlock|Whitlock]] in the final was 0.667, the widest among the men\u2019s finals across [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|these 2015 WC]], outscoring even that gold-medal-performance\u2019s winning margin Shirai achieved in the 2013 individual floor event final. His latest routine\u2019s more extreme difficulty of 7.6 in start value was again the highest among the finalists. Shirai\u2019s floor routines until then only consisted of \u201csingle somersault\u201d (one revolution) elements, but there at this event was when Shirai began showing off the additional abilities to consistently complete \u201cdouble somersault\u201d (two revolutions) skills like the '''''Ri Jong Song''''' on floor exercise (triple-twisting double back [tucked] somersault\u2014originated by [[Ri Jong-song|Ri Jong Song]] of [[North Korea]] in the 2000s) with a high difficulty value of '''G''' (0.7), the second highest possible D-score that could be assigned then to any individual skill in [[artistic gymnastics]] except on vault, as his floor routine\u2019s second pass. So, Shirai needed to change the existing second pass of \u201cfront full twist\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2'''''\u201d to come third and eliminate his routine\u2019s original third pass of \u201cRO\u2013whip back\u2013punch triple twist\u201d entirely. The order of all passes\u20141) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd twist\u2013punch double full, 2) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Ri Jong Song''''', 3) front full twist\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 4) RO\u2013BH\u20132\u00bd twist\u2013punch 2\u00bd twist, 5) RO\u2013side somersault full twist, and 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai''''' to end.\n\nIn the individual vault event final, Shirai placed seventh with the average combined score of 14.516. He had posted competitive E-scores among the finalists, but both Shirai\u2019s vaults had the lower D-scores of 5.6 and 5.2 for 2015, lacking then the higher numbers necessary to achieve the bigger average combined score needed and realistically challenge the world's top vaulters for a spot on the podium when every other vault completed in the individual final had a score of 6.0 in difficulty or above. One detail to note here of Shirai\u2019s worst vault final result since his debut at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]]\u2014he started both his two planned vaults normally, but due to his poor landing position of the \u201cYurchenko\u201d first vault, '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Kim''''' (3 twists) with 6.0 difficulty, judges downgraded it to the '''''[[Amanar|Shewfelt]]''''' or '''''[[Amanar]]''''' (2\u00bd twists) with 5.6 difficulty for incomplete twisting, and it resulted in Shirai\u2019s team electing to simplify his \u201cTsukahara\u201d next/second vault from the '''''Driggs''''' (2\u00bd twists) with 5.6 difficulty to '''''Akopian''''' (2 twists\u2014originated by [[Artur Akopyan|Artur Akopian]] of the former [[Soviet Union]] at the WC earlier in the 1980s) with 5.2 difficulty just as Shirai\u2019s chances of medalling at this point of the competition had then suddenly become mathematically extremely unlikely in an instant, effectively due to the initial difficulty loss of 0.4 on his higher-scoring vault. His numbers of 5.6 and 5.2 also happen to correspond now perfectly to this current quad\u2019s actual revised scores in the '''''Shirai''''' or '''''Shirai-Kim''''', and '''''Driggs''''' respectively. [[Ri Se Gwang]] of [[North Korea]] (15.450) defended his gold, [[Romania]]\u2019s [[Marian Dr\u0103gulescu]] (15.400) won silver, and American [[Donnell Whittenburg]] (15.350) won bronze.\n\n===2015 Toyota International Gymnastics Competition in Toyota City, Japan===\n\nOn December 12\u201313, 2015, Shirai\u2014representing previously his childhood home club, Tsurumi Junior Gymnastics Club, he currently competes out of his university as new home club [[Nippon Sport Science University]] ([[Nippon Sport Science University|NSSU]])\u2014competed at the lower-profile but respectable 2015 Toyota International Gymnastics Competition in [[Toyota City]], [[Japan]]. Even though not an [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]-organised international competition, they had a good pool of gymnasts on their roster, and were of some importance because he had successfully completed his third original skill, one of the currently two most difficult skills on floor in MAG. Via petition, the skill has since taken Shirai\u2019s name, and been officially named the '''''Shirai 3''''' on floor. In practice, that is the '''''Ri Jong Song''''' in layout on floor, triple-twisting double layout, the '''I''' (0.9) second \u201cdouble somersault\u201d (two revolutions) skill incorporated into the existing floor routines after that after he swapped the '''''Shirai 3''''' into starting position for his first pass with the '''''Ri Jong Song''''' to stay as his second pass executed immediately after. The rest of his floor routine has been adjusted accordingly too, to reflect the increased difficulty in this change. All passes: 1) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai 3''''', 2) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Ri Jong Song''''', 3) RO\u2013BH\u20132\u00bd\u2013punch 2\u00bd, 4) front full\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 5) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd\u2013punch full, and 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai'''''.\n\nAt this individual-apparatus-only competition, Shirai had won the gold in the individual floor and vault event finals, achieving scores of 15.700 and 15.225 respectively. Due to his current top D-score nature of the '''''Shirai 3''''' on floor, he also achieved a very rare honour of sharing with [[Andreas Bretschneider]] of [[Germany]], [[Valeri Liukin]] of the former [[USSR|Soviet Union]], and [[Donnell Whittenburg]] of the [[United States]] to own one, until just quite recently, of only four longstanding most difficult and highest-scoring competition-verified original skills in all of MAG to receive the previous official top score assignment of '''H''' (0.8) difficulty from the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]. At present, [[Andreas Bretschneider|Bretschneider]], [[Valeri Liukin|Liukin]] and [[Donnell Whittenburg|Whittenburg]] successfully competed the '''''Bretschneider''''' on high bar (or '''''Kovac''''' [high bar release skill with one full twist integrated into its somersault portion of the skill\u2014originated by [[P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs (gymnast)|P\u00e9ter Kov\u00e1cs]] of [[Hungary]] at the 1979 European Championships] double full), '''''Liukin''''' on floor (or triple tucked back), and '''''Whittenburg''''' on rings (or triple piked back dismount) respectively. The [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]] had once highly expected [[Andreas Bretschneider|Bretschneider]] to progress his very own skill into the layout position\u2014already named it the '''''Bretschneider 2''''' on high bar, suggesting it could be given MAG\u2019s new top difficulty of '''I''' (0.9) to mirror [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]]\u2019s only existing top level floor skill\u2014but he could not do so. This [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]]\u2019s only top '''I''' (0.9) level skill then\u2014the '''''Moors''''' on floor, or double-twisting double back layout, by [[Victoria Moors]] of [[Canada]], who originated it at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]].\n\n===2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil===\n\nOn August 6, 2016, at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]], team [[Japan]] qualified first for the team all-around (AA) event finals, after successes at the [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 WC]]. They then solidified their victory two days later at the [[Rio Olympic Arena]] with a final combined score of 274.094. Shirai contributed to the gold medal win in the [[Gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's artistic team all-around|team event finals]] with floor and vault scores of 16.133 and 15.633. He had not competed in more individual finals on other apparatuses though at [[2016 Summer Olympics|these Olympics]]. This team from [[Japan]] ended up winning their gold medals ahead of teams from [[Russia]] and [[China]]\u2014they finished with respective score totals of 271.453 and 271.122.\n\nShirai appeared to be in good competition form, qualifying for both individual floor and vault apparatus finals. As a twice and reigning world champion on floor, he was the overwhelming favourite to win gold, but only managed to finish a disappointing fourth, scoring a 15.366, after having trouble on landings in three out of six passes. [[Max Whitlock]] of [[Great Britain]] (15.633), the gymnast who Shirai had readily beaten only a year ago in the individual floor final at the [[2015 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2015 WC]] by a wide score margin, won the gold medal, and [[Diego Hyp\u00f3lito]] (15.533) and [[Arthur Mariano]] (15.433)\u2014both from host country of [[Brazil]]\u2014captured the silver and bronze medals respectively. In the individual vault event final the day after, Shirai posted an average combined total of 15.449 (15.833 and 15.066 on each respective vault\u2014the former becoming the highest-scoring vault of that final), and tied the legendary [[Marian Dr\u0103gulescu]] of [[Romania]] for the third highest numeric score in the event final. The tie-breaker had worked in Shirai\u2019s favour this time, to win him the bronze medal, edging out [[Marian Dr\u0103gulescu|Dr\u0103gulescu]], who had ended up with the identical average combined score too but missed achieving this all-important deciding factor for breaking a tie then, of a medal\u2014it was the single highest numeric E-score on any vault that had already been executed. With the defending Olympic champion, [[South Korea]]\u2019s [[Yang Hak Seon]], out injured, [[North Korea]]\u2019s [[Ri Se Gwang]] (15.691), whose [[artistic gymnastics]] team was banned from competition in 2012 amidst continual age falsification violations by their female athletes, won the gold while [[Russia]]\u2019s [[Denis Ablyazin]] (15.516) defended his silver.\n\nIn [[2016 Summer Olympics|Rio]], Shirai also successfully originated a second vault, now officially named the '''''Shirai 2''''' (3\u00bd-twisting Yurchenko), which was assigned the second highest D-score of 6.4 in the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]\u2019s existing 2013\u20132016 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] with the top 7.0 difficulty assessed in advance for the '''''Radivilov''''' (front handspring triple [tucked] somersault) originated by the 2012 Olympic vault bronze medallist, specialist [[Igor Radivilov]] of [[Ukraine]]. Naming credit was given despite him sitting it down in the individual vault final, only for it to be totally banned from competition and removed from the next [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] due to a high risk of injury when competing/training the skill. Thus, Shirai now shares honour of owning at least one of only five official top 6.0 difficulty skills named after them with the 2012 and 2016 Olympic vault champions, [[Yang Hak Seon|Yang]] and [[Ri Se Gwang|Ri]], both owning two each. All vaults again with the top difficulty of 6.0 in their relevant 2017\u20132020 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]] are the '''''Shirai 2''''', '''''Yang Hak Seon''''', '''''Yang Hak Seon 2''''', '''''Ri Se Gwang''''' and '''''Ri Se Gwang 2'''''. In two out of the aforementioned five most difficult vaults, the former two\u2014the '''''Shirai 2''''' plus '''''Yang Hak Seon'''''\u2014only their originators have ever successfully completed them at a major competition. Since Shirai originated the '''''Shirai 2''''' on vault in the individual event finals, he had no plans soon to compete it again after [[2016 Summer Olympics|these Olympics]].\n\n===2017 Melbourne World Cup in Melbourne, Australia===\n\nOn February 22\u201325, 2017, Shirai\u2014still riding on some of that momentum from his preparation for the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]]\u2014competed abroad in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], at the [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|2017 Melbourne World Cup]], an individual apparatus-only competition, with an expanded programme including more events, which added the horizontal bar (HB), still rings (SR) plus parallel bars (PB) to his seasoned routines/skills on floor and vault. In still rings qualifications, he placed tenth in last place with a low E-score\u2014reduced combined total\u2014did not qualify for the event final. In parallel bars qualifications, Shirai placed third, and thus qualified for this event final. Despite falling in his routine during the horizontal bar qualifications, Shirai finished in fourth place due to errors made by his rivals, and also ended up in its event final. In both floor and vault qualifications, he had finished both on top, qualifying him for two extra individual finals. In the individual parallel bars event final, he won a silver medal by getting the second highest E-score of 8.433 with a combined score of 14.433. A Chinese gymnast, [[Zou Jingyuan]] (15.166), won the gold medal while [[Ferhat Arican]] of [[Turkey]] (13.566) captured the bronze medal. In the individual horizontal bar event final, Shirai managed to secure the gold medal with the combined score of 13.933, thanks to another of his second highest E-scores of 8.333, plus more mistakes made by other competitors in this final. Mitchell Morgans of [[Australia]] (13.400), and another one of Shirai\u2019s fellow Japanese Yusuke Saito (13.333) won the silver and bronze medals respectively. In this individual floor event final, Shirai easily won the gold with his extreme score of 14.700 largely because of his routine\u2019s highest score number of 7.2 in difficulty\u2014the second highest only 6.5 among all the finalists. Mu Jile of [[China]] (14.466) captured the silver, and [[Ferhat Arican|Arican]] (14.033) won his second bronze down under. Lastly, in the final of their individual vault event, Shirai won the second gold medal of the competition with the average combined score of 14.916 because of the two highest execution numbers of 9.500 and 9.533 he posted in this event final. [[Christopher Remkes]] of [[Australia]] (14.883) won the silver medal with another of Shirai\u2019s countryman Wataru Tanigawa (14.566) securing the bronze medal.\n\nLike in [[Toyota City]], that early lower-profile [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup]] competition also holds some significance because in [[Melbourne]], Shirai had successfully completed still yet one more original element\u2014his sixth in total\u2014to then be officially named the '''''Shirai 3''''' on vault automatically. Thus, he currently has more skills bearing his name than any other male gymnast in history, and second only to [[Svetlana Khorkina]] of [[Russia]], who holds the all-time record of having nine original skills adopt her name across all four apparatuses in [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]]. The '''''Shirai 3''''' on vault \u2014 a.k.a. \u201cfull on\u2013double full off\u201d in practice \u2014 was given a D-score of 5.4 in the 2017\u20132020 quad. The vault technically has a RO\u2013full-twisting BH (Scherbo [vault platform entry skill]\u2014originated by [[Vitaly Scherbo]] of the former [[Soviet Union]], then [[Unified Team at the Olympics|Unified Team]] and finally [[Belarus]] early in the 1990s) entry onto platform and then into back layout double twist off it\u2014rare but skill can be called a double-twisting Scherbo too. Still to be realized, our next skill in that progression\u2014RO\u2013full-twisting BH onto platform into 2\u00bd twist off it, or \u201cfull on\u20132\u00bd off\u201d\u2014was earlier assessed in advance, giving it a difficulty value of 5.8, which many think it to be too low since the '''''Li Xiao Peng''''' on vault (or \u201c\u00bd on\u20132\u00bd off\u201d in practice; originated by the great Chinese gymnast [[Li Xiaopeng (gymnast)|Li Xiao Peng]] in the 2000s) has already been long given a D-score of 5.8 too. \u201cFull on\u20132\u00bd off\u201d has by nature more twists, and thus is more complex/harder to execute\u2014should have a higher D-score.\n\n===2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Montreal, Canada===\n\nIn October 2017, Shirai showed he retained more of the Olympic form when he competed at the [[2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Montreal]], [[Canada]]. No team events were held, as it is customary since 2005 at the WC in the year right after the Olympics. Shirai would eventually win three medals on a full competition programme that included owning a routine on his last holdout event of pommel horse (PH). He had then become eligible for the individual AA competition in [[Montreal]], winning the first world AA medal (bronze) behind [[Xiao Ruoteng]] (86.933) and [[Lin Chaopan]] (86.488), both of [[China]].<ref>https://mtl2017gymcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/C73G_Results_MenSenC2.pdf</ref> Shirai\u2019s combined total of 86.431 has 15.733 on floor, 13.433 on pommel horse, 13.666 on still rings, 15.000 on vault, 14.633 on parallel bars, and 13.966 on high bar. With the top numbers on floor and vault among AA finalists, Shirai had also easily defended the individual world floor title from two years ago when the WC were last held with a final score of 15.633,<ref>https://mtl2017gymcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/C73I_Floor-Exercise_Results_MenSenC3.pdf</ref> out-tumbling the silver medallist, [[Artem Dolgopyat]] of [[Israel]]\u2014just managing a score of 14.533\u2014by over a point. Shirai\u2019s final unassailable victory margin of 1.1 became their widest one yet at the WC, outdistancing himself from his rivals even more than the 2015 performance did. His passes stayed consistent after originating the '''''Shirai 3''''' on floor.\n\nShirai also qualified second for the vault\u2019s individual event finals with an average combined total of 14.949 but subsequently won his first world vault title by putting up the highest average combined scores of 14.900, 15.200 and 14.600 for his first and second numbers respectively,<ref>https://mtl2017gymcan.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/C73J_Both_Vault_Results_MenSenC3.pdf</ref> in a very exciting/close last round of competition. Shirai did manage to win with the absolute slimmest of victory margin by just 0.001 after the 2012 Olympic bronze medallist on vault, event specialist [[Igor Radivilov]] of [[Ukraine]], came up short and finished with the closest possible second highest average combined score of 14.899. Shirai did also get a little help when the top qualifier and 2012 Olympic champion on vault, [[South Korea]]\u2019s [[Yang Hak Seon]], withdrew with a hamstring injury after outscoring Shirai by a significant margin of 0.334 with the average combined score of 15.283 in qualifying, which was three times more than the margin of any two other qualifiers. These score differences were only about 0.1.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Shirai has executed two identical vaults as he has done since this event debut at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2013 WC]] on every individual vault event, even though he has successfully completed more difficult and higher-scoring vaults in competition\u2014specifically the '''''Shirai 2''''' and '''''Shirai 3''''' with the former heavily contributing to his bronze medal win at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], and latter slightly less his gold in the individual vault event final at the [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|2017 Melbourne World Cup]]. Like D-scores of other selected vaults across the board, the ones for the '''''Shirai 2''''' and '''''Shirai 3''''' were also adjusted to 5.6 and 5.2 respectively in this 2017\u20132020 quad. Also, Hidetaka Miyachi of [[Japan]] took advantage of injuries on German [[Andreas Bretschneider]], who was beaten to the punch here in 2017, originating the first double-twisting layout '''''Kovac''''', or now officially named the '''''Miyachi''''' on high bar\u2014only skill then given the new top level '''I''' (0.9) D-score value, and created in advance specially for it by the [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]\u2014successfully first on home soil at the All-[[Japan]] Apparatus Championships in [[Takasaki]], [[Japan]], before he petitioned governing body to officially verify skill completion and name adoption. '''I''' (0.9), the new top D-score, was created then to assist an existing MAG scoring system more accurately reflect the very extreme D-score of the '''''Miyachi''''' on high bar, which was verified here at [[2017 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships|these 2017 WC]] then\u2014as a result, it did also update the MAG scoring system levels again mirror [[women's artistic gymnastics|WAG]].\n\n===2018 American Cup in Hoffman Estates, United States\u20132018 Tokyo World Cup and NHK Trophy in Tokyo, Japan===\n\nOn March 3, 2018, Shirai started this competition season for 2018 when he accepted the invitation to participate in the [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|American Cup FIG Individual All-Around World Cup 2018]] or [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|2018 American Cup]] in [[Hoffman Estates, Illinois|Hoffman Estates]] (suburb of [[Chicago]]), [[United States]]. In the individual AA-only competition, he placed sixth, achieving a combined total of 81.498 despite posting top floor and vault scores, the signature apparatuses, of 15.066 and 14.966 respectively, and second highest tying [[Yul Moldauer]] of the [[United States]] on parallel bars with 14.500 behind leader [[Petro Pakhnyuk|Petro Pakhniuk]] of [[Ukraine]] with 14.933. Each of Shirai\u2019s scores, in particular on pommel horse, was relatively weaker when compared to all other finalists. Hovering sufficiently lower, Shirai\u2019s numbers on each of the apparatuses were a 11.100 on pommel horse (lowest on that apparatus with top number posted nearly three full points higher), 13.700 on still rings, and 12.166 on the horizontal bar. As defending, and eventual, champion of the competition, [[Yul Moldauer|Moldauer]] scored an 85.964, outscoring Shirai by a fair margin of almost 4\u00bd points because [[Yul Moldauer|Moldauer]] was able to achieve one of the top three scores on every apparatus\u2014the highest scorer on still rings, third highest on vault, tie for the second highest on parallel bars, plus second highest on his remaining apparatuses.\n\nOn April 14, 2018, Shirai competed at this spring\u2019s last [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]]-sanctioned [[Artistic Gymnastics World Cup|World Cup]] competition with home advantage at the [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|FIG Individual All-Around World Cup 2018]] or [[2018 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup Series|2018 Tokyo World Cup]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. In this group of competing gymnasts at different experience levels from many countries across several world continents of [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Americas]], Shirai won gold on the individual all-around event, his very first all-around gold medal at an [[International Federation of Gymnastics|FIG]] competition with a combined score of 86.064. Scores from each apparatus were 15.200 on floor, 13.533 on pommel horse, 13.766 on still rings, 14.966 on vault, 14.466 on parallel bars, and 14.133 on the horizontal bar. Among all his scores, Shirai posted one of the top three values on all apparatuses too with the highest numbers on floor, pommel horse and vault, plus second highest on parallel bars and the horizontal bar behind the values of 14.533 posted by [[Russia]]\u2019s [[Artur Dalaloyan]] on parallel bars and 14.500 by [[Sam Mikulak]] of the [[United States]] on the horizontal bar, plus third highest too on rings behind those scores of 14.366 and 14.300 posted by [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]] and Wataru Tanigawa of [[Japan]]. In the end, familiar efforts by Tanigawa and [[Sam Mikulak|Mikulak]] had managed to capture the silver and bronze medals too with respective combined scores of 84.399 and 84.098.\n\nOn May 19\u201320, 2018, Shirai competed at the lower-profile non-[[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] individual all-around-only event, also at home\u2014primarily for the Japanese coaches to help assess the level of fitness and preparation of each local gymnast hoping to be included onto the national team for namely the WC\u2014at the 2018 NHK Trophy in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Although it is not an event organised by the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]], [[Japan]] still requires participation with favourable results at the competition as a prerequisite in order to be considered for the Japanese team at the next WC. If an athlete had to miss the event but still want represent [[Japan]] then, he or she must secure a waiver, which is rarely granted. Shirai won the silver medal here with a combined score of 257.895 including floor's top score of 15.433 as well as third highest of 14.833 on vault, just behind Takumi Sato\u2014only competed on floor, rings and vault\u2014and vault specialist Hidenobu Yonekura\u2014only competed on his specialty event. For Shirai\u2019s other apparatuses, those scores were 13.600 on pommel horse, 13.366 on rings, 14.433 on parallel bars, and 14.066 on high bar respectively. Gold medal went to the legend [[K\u014dhei Uchimura]], who had come from behind to win with the combined score of 258.629\u2014it would include the top score of 14.966 on high bar, and second highest of 14.633 on floor.<ref>{{Citation|last=Kyodo News|title=Gymnastics: Kohei Uchimura bounces back to win his 10th straight NHK Cup|date=2018-05-20|url=https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2018/05/f447edb87662-gymnastics-uchimura-bounces-back-to-win-his-10th-straight-nhk-cup.html|accessdate=2018-07-29}}</ref>\n\n===2018 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Doha, Qatar===\n\nOn October 25\u2013November 3, 2018, Shirai competed at the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Doha]], [[Qatar]]\u2014the first ever WC held in the Middle East. Although he lost some form in competition and was thus less successful this year than he was in 2017, his limited preparation still got him one silver and two bronzes. Shirai contributed to the bronze medal win for the Japanese team event on three apparatuses\u2014floor exercise, vault and the horizontal bar where he scored a 14.933, 14.966 and 13.966 respectively. Shirai qualified for the individual finals too on the all-around, floor exercise and vault. During the individual all-around final, Shirai was unable to replicate a comparable level of success as his 2017 bronze medal win, and he finally managed to only place seventh from a total combined score of 84.531.\n\nIn the individual floor exercise and vault event finals, Shirai was likewise unable to defend the 2017 gold medals he won in them, and had to respectively settle for the silver and bronze medals instead. In the individual floor exercise event final, he scored a 14.866 behind a much-improved, and 2018\u2019s individual all-around event gold medallist [[Artur Dalaloyan]] of [[Russia]], who marginally outscored Shirai with a 14.900 in a cleanly executed routine. Shirai\u2019s floor routine\u2019s D-score of 6.8 was a bit lower than usual, though still higher than [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]]\u2019s 6.2, but [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]] was able to post a sufficiently high E-score too of 8.700 to Shirai\u2019s 8.066, and overtake Shirai in the final combined total. Known mostly for his uncanny abilities as a \u201ctwister\u201d, Shirai regularly performed floor routines with D-scores above 7.0, using almost only twisting skills or combinations. In the individual vault event final, Shirai scored a lower combined average of 14.675 because of the lower D-score values assigned to all vaults he completed, particularly the second, behind eventual silver medallist [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]] (14.883), plus gold medallist [[Ri Se Gwang]] of [[North Korea]] (14.933), who is the 2016 Olympic vault champion. Both of Shirai\u2019s vaults had lower D-scores then by good significance (5.6 and 5.2) if compared to 2018\u2019s gold-medal-winning duo of 6.0 each.\n\nIt may be appropriate to point out that Shirai did complete a substantially simplified routine, at times was even seemingly assembled in a rush, for his standards in the individual floor exercise event final. D-scores of Shirai\u2019s floor routines had always consistently valued around 7.4 in the past, but at this event, it was decreased to 6.8. Although this D-score was still the highest among all finalists, the opening loss of about 0.6 from his routine\u2019s combined total was sufficient to effectively lose the gold, but won him silver instead this year since [[Artur Dalaloyan|Dalaloyan]], the eventual winner\u2014whose routine in comparison had a lower D-score of 6.2\u2014did outscore Shirai in execution, even if just barely, and only by 0.034 in the end. The routine of his did not particularly feel as well organised as his previous ones. Shirai\u2019s passes were 1) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Ri Jong Song''''', 2) front full twist\u2013punch '''''Shirai 2''''', 3) RO\u2013BH\u20131\u00bd twist\u2013punch 1\u00bd twist, 4) RO\u2013BH\u2013'''''Shirai''''', 5) RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd twist\u2013punch full twist, and 6) RO\u2013BH\u2013triple full. It is also worth noting again that Shirai always competed his two same exact vaults\u2014first a \u201cYurchenko\u201d\u2013then forward-entry \u201cTsukahara\u201d\u2014in the individual vault event finals at all of the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]\u2019s major competitions but one in 2013\u20132018 (WC but not [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he won the bronze after advancing to the '''''Shirai 2''''' on vault, or 3\u00bd-twisting Yurchenko, for his backward-entry skill), competing better generally from one year to his next. Although his vaults\u2019 D-scores have since been lowered from 6.0 and 5.6 (2013\u20132015) in the last 2013\u20132016 quad to 5.6 and 5.2 (2017\u20132018) in the [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]]\u2019s next 2017\u20132020 [[Code of Points (artistic gymnastics)|CoP]], he continued to improve his standings in the individual vault finals every year. In 2013\u20132015, Shirai placed fourth, fourth and seventh, and in 2017\u20132018, he won gold and bronze respectively.\n\n===2019 Tokyo World Cup and All-Japan All-Around Championships in Tokyo, Japan===\n\nOn April 7, 2019, Shirai began his season competing at the [[2019 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|FIG Individual All-Around World Cup 2019]] or [[2019 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|2019 Tokyo World Cup]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Like in 2018, Shirai was supposed to start competition at the [[2019 FIG Artistic Gymnastics World Cup series|2019 American Cup]], but withdrew to treat a left ankle injury,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2019/03/03/more-sports/gymnastics/mai-murakami-finishes-third-american-cup/#.XLkTfy_Mzys|title=Mai Murakami finishes third at American Cup|date=3 March 2019|publisher=|via=Japan Times Online}}</ref> which he sustained about a week before he started travelling. Due to the injury, Shirai simplified certain skills in his routines for the competition here in [[Tokyo]], which became especially noticeable when he performed on floor\u2014his strongest signature event\u2014as he recycled, using portions of his past routines. Changes included starting his floor routine with a RO\u2013BH\u20133\u00bd twist\u2013punch double twist opening pass instead of the '''''Shirai 3''''', one of two hardest floor skills in MAG, and ending with only a triple twist last pass instead of the '''''Shirai''''', his infamous quad twist. In the end, Shirai failed to defend his gold medal from last year, but managed to capture bronze with the combined score of 82.964, despite still recovering from injury. The 2018 bronze medallist, [[Sam Mikulak]] of the [[United States]] (86.599), improved his standings, and won gold. [[Japan]]\u2019s Wataru Tanigawa (85.665) defended his silver. Sport analyst [[Tim Daggett]] opined Shirai as \u201cman, myth, legend\u2014capable of doing...many things...people thought were...literally impossible before...\u201d in gymnastics.<ref>{{Citation|last=Gin\u00e1stica Brasil|title=Men's All-Around World Cup \u2013 Tokyo 2019|date=2019-04-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0_UALsRaa8|accessdate=2019-06-17}}</ref>\n\nOn April 26\u201328, 2019, Shirai competed at the 2019 All-[[Japan]] AA Championships, one of two closely held AA-only events in [[Chofu]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Shirai had qualified for event finals in 22nd place, finishing in 30th. Shirai also managed only one score in the top three on any apparatus, second highest on floor (14.533) behind Kazuki Minami (14.633), who just competed on floor. This event\u2019s respective gold, silver and bronze medallists\u2014Kakeru Tanigawa with a combined score of 84.699, Kazuma Kaya with a combined score of 84.664, and Kazuyuki Takeda with a combined score of 84.498\u2014had Tanigawa managing the second highest score for pommel horse while Takeda had achieved the third highest for still rings too. After assessing their winning scores, it shows there is much to be desired in being able to post numbers that are above average for every apparatus. Shirai\u2019s remaining scores in that final\u201412.900 on pommel horse, 12.800 on still rings, 14.166 on vault, 13.733 on parallel bars, 11.300 on the horizontal bar, and 79.432 for the total AA combined score. Injury had persisted to adversely affect the recent competition performances, and thus reflected in the results. Event number differences between top apparatus scores and Shirai\u2019s were particularly wide on pommel horse, still rings and the horizontal bar.\n\n===2019 NHK Trophy in Chofu and All-Japan Apparatus Championships in Takasaki, Japan===\n\nOn May 18\u201319, 2019, Shirai competed at the 2019 NHK Trophy, also in [[Chofu]], [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]]\u2014repeating his 2018 participation at this AA-only event. Due to lingering injury issues with the left ankle, he was unable to perform as well in the competition in comparison to most others, which would also include his performance here last year. Shirai placed 23rd with a 243.794 combined score. He was unable to achieve a top three score on any of the apparatuses, not even on his signatures of floor or vault. Shirai\u2019s scores on each respective apparatus were 14.500 on floor, 12.533 on pommel horse, 12.800 on still rings, 14.566 on vault, 14.066 on parallel bars, and 13.066 on high bar. Kakeru Tanigawa (254.363), Wataru Tanigawa (254.128) and Kazuma Kaya (254.126), who won their gold, silver and bronze,<ref>{{Citation|last=The Gymternet|title=2019 NHK Trophy Men\u2019s Results|date=2019-07-28|url=https://thegymter.net/2019/05/22/2019-nhk-trophy-mens-results/|accessdate=2019-07-27}}</ref> were unable too to score, if at all, more than only one of the top three numbers on any apparatus, which may also indicate that none of their 2019 gymnasts was able to do particularly well this year at this competition\u2014Kakeru Tanigawa was only able to score the second highest number (14.733) on floor, Wataru Tanigawa was also just able to make the third highest (14.866) on vault, and just like Shirai, Kazuma Kaya was likewise not able to post a top three number on any one of the apparatuses at this event too.\n\nOn June 21\u201323, 2019, Shirai competed at the 2019 All-[[Japan]] Apparatus Championships in [[Takasaki]], [[Japan]], hoping he would do well enough to secure a spot on the Japanese national team, and compete at the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]]. It was ultimately not meant to be his year though. Shirai had qualified into the individual event finals specifically on floor exercise, vault and the horizontal bar in second, fourth and sixth respectively. In these finals, he had finished in third (14.900), fifth (14.433) and eighth (11.200) place, respectively for each of these three apparatuses too. Finishing ahead of Shirai on floor exercise were Kazuki Minami with a total score of 15.033, and Naoto Hayasaka with a total score of 15.000. Their top finisher on vault was Keitoro Okubo, posting the average combined score of 15.233, and the winner of the horizontal bar was Hirohito Kahama with a total score of 14.766. Shirai\u2019s floor D-score numbers had remained on top among all the finalists. However, his execution needed some additional work, and could have been cleaner, which was thus reflected on the routine\u2019s E-score. Shirai\u2019s vault D-score values were comparatively lesser\u2014only one with the lowest 5.2\u2014and needed higher base numbers before he could seriously challenge the top vaulters.\n\n===2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships in Stuttgart, Germany\u20132020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan===\n\nFor the first time since Shirai\u2019s international debut at the [[2013 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|WC in 2013]], he had failed to qualify for the Japanese national [[artistic gymnastics]] team, and participate in the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 Artistic Gymnastics World Championships]] in [[Stuttgart]], [[Germany]], which was held on October 4\u201313, 2019. Shirai\u2019s performance was slowed for most of the 2019 season by a very stubborn injury to the left ankle, and thus unable to perform/compete his best at the 2019 All-[[Japan]] Apparatus Championships\u2014results there and at the 2019 NHK Trophy determined gymnasts\u2019 eligibility to join team [[Japan]] at the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 WC]]. Shirai\u2019s best chance was to secure one of two spots available for individual event specialists\u2014namely on his two signature apparatuses of floor exercise and vault. However, he was just able to place third on floor exercise, plus fifth on vault to miss qualifying for [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|these WC]], resulting in his inability to defend 2018\u2019s team bronze, and individual silver on floor and bronze on vault. As Shirai was not the only high-profile absentee, [[Japan]] had sent a fairly inexperienced men\u2019s team with their most decorated member, [[K\u014dhei Uchimura]], also missing from the [[2019 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2019 WC]] due to injury. [[K\u014dhei Uchimura|Uchimura]] was struggling and attempting then still a return to past winning ways since he tore his, also left ankle, ligaments in qualifying on AA\u2019s vault at the [[2017 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2017 WC]].\n\nWithout [[Japan]]\u2019s full team in [[Stuttgart]], the men\u2019s competition was dominated mostly by gymnasts from [[Russia]] or other [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet states]] with an odd individual final being won by an athlete from another country. The defending champion for their men\u2019s individual AA was [[Artur Dalaloyan]] of [[Russia]], who finished second here behind countryman [[Nikita Nagornyy]] in individual AA and vault finals. Led by [[Simone Biles]], the women\u2019s field was dominated by Americans. [[Japan]]\u2019s top female gymnast, [[Mai Murakami]], was unable to defend the 2018 individual AA silver and floor bronze she won after she missed a prerequisite meet, 2019 NHK Trophy, due to a back injury.\n\nDue to far-reaching effects of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the [[International Olympic Committee]] and [[Japan]]\u2019s prime minister, [[Shinz\u014d Abe]], announced in March 2020 together through a joint statement that the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], would not take place on the original dates of July 24\u2013August 9, 2020, citing public health concerns, and have been postponed a year to now start in 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/sports/olympics/coronavirus-olympics-postponed-2021.html|title=Tokyo Olympics Organizers Considering July 2021 for Opening Ceremony|date=28 March 2020|publisher=|via=The New York Times}}</ref> The [[International Gymnastics Federation|FIG]] also updated that all gymnastics would proceed on July 23\u2013August 8, 2021. As of this time, no one knows for sure if the national teams of [[Japan]] or any country could still send teams consisting of familiar people a year later. Athletes train hard to accurately manage peaks in their performances following four-year-cycle timetables while targeting specific periods for the Olympics too, but because of this delay, unlike Shirai, more senior gymnasts, namely [[Simone Biles|Biles]] and [[K\u014dhei Uchimura|Uchimura]] who are already widely considered by many the greatest gymnasts of all time, may just simply retire. The Japanese men\u2019s national [[artistic gymnastics]] team previously qualified the full four-member squad for the team AA event by winning team bronze at the [[2018 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|2018 WC]] where Shirai contributed three scores in team total\u2014floor, vault and high bar.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai.

It runs parallel to Naushad Ali Road (previously [[Carter Road Promenade|Carter Road]]), a popular sea-front and promenade. Both roads are situated in Mumbai's [[Bandra]] (West) suburb (H-West Ward).\n\nSituated mainly on rolling hills with alternate steep and shallow sides, it garnered the name Pali Hill, although more than one hill is present. The main route of the road was smoothed and paved. The buildings and bungalows are set within the \"valleys\" and \"crests\" of the hills. Nearby localities include [[Pali Village]] and [[Pali Naka]].\n\n==History==\nUntil the 1950s, the area was mainly forested with dense undergrowth. Over the years, it was converted  to grow fruits and crops. At one time, the sea was plainly visible from the foothills.\n\nA few buildings were constructed by entrepreneurs and builders. However, most people lived in cottages or bungalows. Construction of apartment buildings commenced in the mid to late 1960s, including Nibbana Apartments.\n\nCottage dwellers slowly sold their homes to real estate developers and Pali Hill grew into an affluent neighbourhood.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n\n''[[K. Street Pali Hill]]'' (2004\u20132006), a thriller television soap on [[StarPlus]], produced by [[Ekta Kapoor]] ([[Balaji Telefilms]]) was set in the suburb.\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nPali Hill has an expanse of trees that form arches over the roads. Originally an area of orchards, fields and untamed forests, from 1980-2020 it was deforested and made suitable for residential habitation. A few giant trees remain in building compounds, bungalow gardens and on the roads. The most widely seen tree is the [[Delonix regia|gulmohar tree]]. Large (and rare in Mumbai) [[banyan trees]], [[peepul tree]]s, [[mango trees]], [[ashoka tree]]s, wild [[almond trees]], wild [[neem tree]]s as well as a variety of shrubs, grasses, bamboos and trees, like those of the [[papaya]], [[jackfruit]], [[custard-apple]], and [[guava]]<nowiki/>are abundant.\n\nFlowering shrubs are cultivated and sometimes grow wild. Most abundant are [[bougainvillea]], [[jasmine]]s, [[Bird of paradise (flower)|birds of paradise flowers]] and other wild, indigenous varieties.\n\nPali Hill is frequented by migratory birds, present during different seasons. Although the native species are sparrows, [[Asian koel]]s, cuckoos, wrens, pigeons, crows and ravens; rare birds (from other parts of Mumbai/India) are present. Bai Avabai Framji Petit Girls High School sees egrets, storks, owls and other rare birds. Ashy dorus, kites, kestrels, hummingbirds, woodpeckers as well as seagulls and kingfishers (both \u2013 the small blue kingfisher as well as the more colourful variant) are present. Ornithologist [[Salim Ali]] was known to walk around Pali Hill with his binoculars and a notebook taking notes and listening to or making bird calls.\n\nMammals such as dogs (from street strays to pedigrees), cats and small bats are abundant.\n\n==Landmarks==\nPali Hill's landmarks are its buildings and bungalows. At the southern end is Rajendra Kumar Junction (Chowk). Its four roads lead west to Carter Road (via Pali Mala Road), north to Pali Hill, east to [[Pali Naka]] and south to the Auxilium Convent High School. At the northern end is Union Park, another crossing and the area around it. Candies eatery is another local landmark.\n\nThe road diverges downhill on the East side \u2013 the Zig Zag Road (named after its steep incline and acute curves). At this junction was the Anand Bungalow (owned by [[Dev Anand]]). Also at this junction is the bungalow of the Narangs, hoteliers, and owners of the Croissants patisserie and the Ambassador Flight kitchen. On Nargis Dutt road, further down on the west side is the House Of Sushil Kumar Shinde (former Chief Minister of Maharashtra & former Home Minister Of The Govt of India). On the other side residence of the late Rajni Patel ( Rajni Patel was a lawyer, trade union leader and politician \u2013 and much more \u2013 who dominated the political landscape of Bombay in the 1970s. He was a close associate and adviser of Indira Gandhi. A Cambridge-educated lawyer, he had been on the watch list of British authorities during his days in Britain and upon his return to India, got involved in cooperative movements and public life in general. His legal battles in the courts are legendary)Rajni Patel's widow Bakul Patel was a former Sheriff of Mumbai.

Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 199\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n==American comic books==\n{{main|American comic book}}\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M.

The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"[[small press]]\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"[[minicomic]]s\" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055024/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].\n\n===Graphic novels===\n[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]\n{{Main|Graphic novel}}\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger.

Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974.

(See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\n\n===Advertisements===\n[[Advertising in comic books|Comic book advertisement]]s were a common feature in American comic books from the 1950s to the 1980s. They were typically grouped together on the inside back cover in, displayed in black and white with an illustration of the product. As these advertisements were directed at young people, many made sensational claims and sold the products for a few dollars to be sent to a post office box. Products offered included novelty items and toys.\n\n===History of Race in Comic Books===\n{{Cleanup section|reason=re-write to make less reliant on quotes, better fit WP's style|date=July 2019}}\nMany early iterations of black characters in comics  \"became variations on the 'single stereotypical image of Sambo'.\"<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodall|first=Lowery Anderson|date=2010|title=The Secret Identity of Race: Exploring Ethnic and Racial Portrayals in Superhero Comic Book|url=http://aquila.usm.edu/dissertations/478}}</ref> Sambo was closely related to the coon stereotype but had some subtle differences.

There was a comic created about the 99th squadron, also known as the Tuskegee Airmen, an all black air force unit. Instead of making the comic about their story the comic the comic was about Hop Harrigan. A white pilot who captures a Nazi, shows him videos of the 99th squadron defeating his man and then reveals to the Nazi that his men were defeated by African Americans which infuriated him as he sees them as a less superior race and can't believe they bested his men.\"...[The] Tuskegee Airmen, and images of black aviators appear in just three of the fifty three panels...[the] pilots of the 99th squadron have no dialogue and interact with neither Hop Harrigan nor his Nazi captive.\"<ref name=\":1\" /> During this time, they also used black characters in comic books as a means to invalidate the militant black groups that were fighting for equality within America. \"Spider-Man 'made it clear that militant black power was not the remedy for racial injustice'.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> \"The Falcon openly criticized black behavior stating' maybe it's important fo[sic] us to cool things down-so we can protect the rights we been fightin' for'.\"<ref name=\":02\" /> This poor portrayal and character development of black characters can be partially blamed on the fact that, during this time, \"there had rarely been a black artist or writer allowed in a major comics company\"<ref name=\":02\" />\n\nAsian characters faced some of the same treatment in comics as black characters did.

The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunts the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones.

Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvi\u00e8me art'' (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, the authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\n===British comics===\n{{Main|British comics}}\n\n[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|upright|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.<ref>Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), \"Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero\", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished.

Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972.

The repackaging of European material has occurred less frequently, although ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]'' serials have been successfully translated and repackaged in softcover books.\n\nIn the 1980s, a resurgence of British writers and artists gained prominence in mainstream comic books, which was dubbed the \"[[British Invasion (comics)|British Invasion]]\" in comic book history.<ref>{{cite journal| url= http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion| title= Comics Unmasked: The British invasion| author= | journal= | issue= | volume= | publisher= Art Fund| accessdate= 2014-07-26| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151104004957/http://www.artfund.org/news/2014/05/01/comics-unmasked-the-british-invasion| archive-date= 4 November 2015| url-status=live| df= dmy-all}}</ref> These writers and artists brought with them their own mature themes and philosophy such as anarchy, controversy and politics common in British media.

The magazine ''[[TBO (comics)|TBO]]'' was influential in popularizing the medium.

Authors largely focus on the frame of the page, size, orientation, and panel positions. These characteristic aspects of comic books are necessary in conveying the content and messages of the author. The key elements of comic books include panels, balloons (speech bubbles), text (lines), and characters. Balloons are usually convex spatial containers of information that are related to a character using a [[tail element]]. The tail has an origin, path, tip, and pointed direction. Key tasks in the creation of comic books are writing, drawing, and coloring. There are many technological formulas used to create comic books, including directions, axes, data, and metrics. Following these key formatting procedures is the writing, drawing, and coloring.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Knowledge-driven understanding of images in comic books|last = Rigaud|first = Christophe|date = 2015|journal = International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition|doi = 10.1007/s10032-015-0243-1|pmid = |access-date = |volume = 18|issue = 3|pages = 199\u2013221}}</ref>\n\n==American comic books==\n{{main|American comic book}}\nComics as a print medium have existed in America since the printing of ''[[Histoire de M.

The first such comics included the anthology series ''[[Star Reach]]'', published by comic book writer [[Mike Friedrich]] from 1974 to 1979, and [[Harvey Pekar]]'s ''[[American Splendor]]'', which continued sporadic publication into the 21st century and which [[Shari Springer Berman]] and [[Robert Pulcini]] adapted into a [[American Splendor (film)|2003 film]]. Some independent comics continued in the tradition of underground comics. While their content generally remained less explicit, others resembled the output of mainstream publishers in format and genre but were published by smaller artist-owned companies or by single artists. A few (notably ''[[RAW (magazine)|RAW]]'') represented experimental attempts to bring comics closer to the status of [[fine art]].\n\nDuring the 1970s the \"[[small press]]\" culture grew and diversified. By the 1980s, several independent publishers \u2013 such as [[Pacific Comics|Pacific]], [[Eclipse Comics|Eclipse]], [[First Comics|First]], [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico]], and [[Fantagraphics]] \u2013 had started releasing a wide range of styles and formats\u2014from color-superhero, [[detective]], and science-fiction comic books to black-and-white magazine-format stories of [[Latin American]] [[magical realism]].\n\nA number of small publishers in the 1990s changed the format and distribution of their comics to more closely resemble non-comics publishing. The \"[[minicomic]]s\" form, an extremely informal version of [[self-publishing]], arose in the 1980s and became increasingly popular among artists in the 1990s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|title=americancomics|website=www.ocf.berkeley.edu|access-date=2017-01-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202055024/https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~sap/decal/americancomics|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> despite reaching an even more limited audience than the small press.\n\nSmall publishers regularly releasing titles include [[Avatar Comics]], [[Hyperwerks]], Raytoons, and [[Terminal Press]], buoyed by such advances in printing technology as digital [[print on demand|print-on-demand]].\n\n===Graphic novels===\n[[File:The_Junior_Disease_Detectives_-_Operation_Outbreak.pdf|thumb|The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] published this instructional graphic novel in 2018 to keep youth from spreading infectious diseases]]\n{{Main|Graphic novel}}\nIn 1964, Richard Kyle coined the term \"graphic novel\".{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} Precursors of the form existed by the 1920s, which saw a revival of the [[medieval]] [[woodcut]] tradition by Belgian [[Frans Masereel]],<ref>Sabin, Roger.

Initially, comic books were marketed by publishers to children because comic books were perceived as children's entertainment. However, with increasing recognition of comics as an art form and the growing pop culture presence of [[comic book convention]]s, they are now embraced by many adults.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nComic book collectors are often lifelong enthusiasts of the comic book stories, and they usually focus on particular heroes and attempt to assemble the entire run of a title.  Comics are published with a sequential number. The first issue of a long-running comic book series is commonly the rarest and most desirable to collectors. The first appearance of a specific character, however, might be in a pre-existing title.  For example, [[Spider-Man]]'s first appearance was in ''[[Amazing Fantasy]]'' #15.  New characters were often introduced this way and did not receive their own titles until there was a proven audience for the hero. As a result, comics that feature the first appearance of an important character will sometimes be even harder to find than the first issue of a character's own title.\n\nSome rare comic books include copies of the unreleased ''[[Motion Picture Funnies Weekly]]'' #1 from 1939. Eight copies, plus one without a cover, emerged in the estate of the deceased publisher in 1974.

(See [[Recalled comics]] for more pulped, recalled, and erroneous comics.)\n\nIn 2000, a company named [[Comics Guaranty]] (CGC) began to \"slab\" comics, encasing them in thick plastic and giving them a numeric grade. Since then, other grading companies have arisen. Because condition is important to the value of rare comics, the idea of grading by a company that does not buy or sell comics seems like a good one. However, there is some controversy about whether this grading service is worth the high cost, and whether it is a positive development for collectors, or if it primarily services speculators who wish to make a quick profit trading in comics as one might trade in stocks or fine art. Comic grading has created valuation standards that online price guides such as GoCollect and GPAnalysis have used to report on real-time market values.\n\nThe original artwork pages from comic books are also collected, and these are perhaps the rarest of all comic book collector's items, as there is only one unique page of artwork for each page that was printed and published.  These were created by a writer, who created the story; a pencil artist, who laid out the sequential panels on the page; an ink artist, who went over the pencil with pen and black ink; a letterer, who provided the dialogue and narration of the story by hand lettering each word; and finally a colorist, who added color as the last step before the finished pages went to the printer.\n\nWhen the original pages of artwork are returned by the printer, they are typically given back to the artists, who sometimes sell them at comic book conventions, or in galleries and art shows related to comic book art.  The original pages of the first appearances of such legendary characters as Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and Spider-Man are considered priceless.\n\n===Advertisements===\n[[Advertising in comic books|Comic book advertisement]]s were a common feature in American comic books from the 1950s to the 1980s. They were typically grouped together on the inside back cover in, displayed in black and white with an illustration of the product. As these advertisements were directed at young people, many made sensational claims and sold the products for a few dollars to be sent to a post office box.

The manhwa industry has suffered through two crashes and strict censorship since its early beginnings as a result of the Japanese occupation of the peninsula which stunts the growth of the industry but has now started to flourish thanks in part to the internet and new ways to read manhwa whether on computers or through smartphones. In the past manhwa would be marketed as manga outside the country in order to make sure they would sell well but now that is no longer needed since more people are now more knowledgeable about the industry and Korean culture.\n\n===Webtoons===\n{{Main|Webtoons}}\n\nWebtoons have become popular in South Korea as a new way to read comics. Thanks in part to different censorship rules, color and unique visual effects, and optimization for easier reading on smartphones and computers. More [[manhwa]] have made the switch from traditional print manhwa to online webtoons thanks to better pay and more freedom than traditional print manhwa. The webtoon format has also expanded to other countries outside of Korea like China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Western countries. Major webtoon distributors include [[Lezhin]], [[Naver]], and [[Kakao]].\n\n===Chinese manhua===\n{{Main|Manhua}}\n\n==European comics==\n{{Main|European comics}}\n\n===Franco-Belgian comics===\n\n{{Main|Franco-Belgian comics}}\n[[File:Ren\u00e9 Goscinny.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Ren\u00e9 Goscinny]] (1926\u20131977), writer of the ''[[Ast\u00e9rix]]'' comic book series.]] \nFrance and [[Belgium]] have a long tradition in comics and comic books, called ''[[Franco-Belgian comics|BDs]]'' (an abbreviation of ''bande dessin\u00e9es'') in French and ''strips'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. Belgian comic books originally written in Dutch show the influence of the Francophone \"Franco-Belgian\" comics but have their own distinct style.\n\nThe name ''bande dessin\u00e9e'' derives from the original description of the art form as drawn strips (the phrase literally translates as \"the drawn strip\"), analogous to the sequence of images in a film strip. As in its English equivalent, the word \"bande\" can be applied to both film and comics. Significantly, the French-language term contains no indication of subject-matter, unlike the American terms \"comics\" and \"funnies\", which imply an art form not to be taken seriously. The distinction of comics as ''le neuvi\u00e8me art'' (literally, \"the ninth art\") is prevalent in French scholarship on the form, as is the concept of comics criticism and scholarship itself. Relative to the respective size of their populations, the innumerable authors in France and Belgium publish a high volume of comic books. In North America, the more serious Franco-Belgian comics are often seen as equivalent to graphic novels, but whether they are long or short, bound or in magazine format, in Europe there is no need for a more sophisticated term, as the art's name does not itself imply something frivolous.\n\nIn France, the authors control the publication of most comics. The author works within a self-appointed time-frame, and it is common for readers to wait six months or as long as two years between installments. Most books first appear in print as a hardcover book, typically with 48, 56, or 64 pages.\n\n===British comics===\n{{Main|British comics}}\n\n[[File:Ally Sloper's Half Holiday (front cover - 27 December 1884).png|thumb|upright|200px|Cover to 27 December 1884 edition of ''[[Ally Sloper's Half Holiday]]''.

The stock media phrase \"real 'Roy of the Rovers' stuff\" is often used by football writers, commentators and fans when describing displays of great skill, or surprising results that go against the odds, in reference to the dramatic storylines that were the strip's trademark.<ref>Tomlinson, Alan; Young, Christopher (2000), \"Golden Boys and Golden Memories: Fiction, Ideology, and Reality in Roy of the Rovers and the Death of the Hero\", in Jones, Dudley; Watkins, Tony, A Necessary Fantasy?: the Heroic Figure in Children's Popular Culture: Vol 18, Garland Publishing. pp. 190\u2013191</ref> Other comic books such as ''[[Eagle (comic)|Eagle]]'', ''[[Valiant (comics)|Valiant]]'', ''[[Warrior (comics)|Warrior]]'', ''[[Viz (comics)|Viz]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]'' also flourished.

Although on a smaller scale than similar investigations in the US, such concerns led to a moderation of content published within British comics. Such moderation never became formalized to the extent of promulgating a code, nor did it last long. The UK has also established a healthy market in the reprinting and repackaging of material, notably material originating in the US. The lack of reliable supplies of American comic books led to a variety of black-and-white reprints, including Marvel's monster comics of the 1950s, Fawcett's [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and other characters such as [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle|Sheena]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], and [[the Phantom]]. Several reprint companies became involved in repackaging American material for the British market, notably the importer and distributor Thorpe & Porter. Marvel Comics established a UK office in 1972.

There have been 36 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, then became twice again since 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|\u7b4b\u8089\u756a\u4ed8|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.<ref>Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html \"Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'\"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.</ref> After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS has renamed the show once again, to '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition. TBS changed the show's logo for the 36th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 37 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]<ref>[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007</ref> in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,<ref>\"Yuuji Urushihara does it again\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011</ref> and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st competition (2015).\n\n===Popularity===\nThe popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.<ref>Levin, Gary.

December 7, 2010.</ref> As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), [[Ninja Warrior Germany|Germany]] ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) in 2018. An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.\n\n==Competitors==\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Sasuke All-Stars===\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe six consisted of:\n*'''Kazuhiko Akiyama''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist. He is known for being the first contestant to ever achieve total victory.

He is considered one of the most promising of recent competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} This skilled trampolinist, who is called \"Prince of the Trampoline\", has won several medals in the Trampoline World Cups and Doha Asian Games. He made his debut in ''Sasuke'' 14. He is the first to be called one of the \"Shin Sedai\" in ''Sasuke'' 17, however, he made his first Final Stage appearance in ''Sasuke'' 17 in 19 years, the second youngest to reach the Final Stage. He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33.

He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27, at age 19, and cleared the First Stage. But in the Second Stage, the Metal Spin was his downfall. He made his best run on ''Sasuke'' 29, at age 21. In that tournament, he cleared the First Stage with 9.69 seconds left. He got revenge on the Second Stage, clearing with a slim 0.81 seconds left. In the Third Stage, despite almost failing the Iron Paddler, he cleared it and became the first person ever to beat the Crazy Cliffhanger. He almost made it to the Final Stage, but fell inches short on the Pipe Slider. He went further than everybody else that tournament and earned himself the #1 seat of Japan for the ''Sasuke'' ASEAN Open Cup.

He made it to the Final Stage after his own Kanzenseiha, with the Salmon Ladder 15 rungs added, he had a lot of trouble in completing the obstacle in a fast time and would eventually timed out 5 meters up the Tsuna Nobori in ''Sasuke'' 35. In ''Sasuke'' 36, he made it to the Final Stage and attempt it in front of a live crowd on New Year's Eve, due to his small error in the Salmon Ladder and strong winds that make the rope of the Tsuna Nobori to move out of his reach. He was left hanging for several precious seconds. He wasn't able to ascend the rope as fast he had hoped, he kept climbing but ultimately ran out of time 0.5m away from victory.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Morimoto's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| '''Competition'''\n|| '''Start position'''\n|| '''Obstacle'''\n|| '''Stage'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 18th\n|| 91\n|| Failed Jumping Spider\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 19th\n|| 71\n|| Failed Half-Pipe Attack\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 20th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 52\n|| Failed Jumping Spider\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\n|| 27\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 23rd\u201326th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 27th\n|| 84\n|| Failed Metal Spin\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n|| 79\n|| Failed Pipe Slider\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 3000\n|| Failed Wall Lifting (time out)\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 91\n|| '''Kanzenseiha (2.59 seconds to spare)'''\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 100\n|| Failed Flying Bar\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Vertical Limit Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Tsuna Nobori\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Tsuna Nobori\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|}\n\n*'''Jun Sato''', a parkour instructor.

athletes, including Olympians, have attempted ''Sasuke'':\n\n====Japanese athletes====\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage's Rolling Escargot.\n\nSprinter [[Hisatsugu Suzuki]], who competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], appeared in the 13th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Cross Bridge.\n\nAnother competitor from the 1992 Olympics, gymnast [[Yoshiaki Hatakeda]], competed in the 6th tournament, making it all the way to Stage 3 before falling on the Cliff Hanger.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nPole Vaulter [[Seito Yamamoto]], who competed in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], [[2016 Summer Olympics]], and also [[2018 Asian Games]], appeared in the 35th and 36th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Dragon Glider twice.\n\n====American athletes====\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&nbsp;\u2013 in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\n[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\n[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger. In the 21st competition, he failed the Salmon Ladder in the Second Stage; in the 22nd, he failed the new Slider Jump; in the 23rd, he made it back to the Third Stage but failed the Shin-Cliffhanger again. He missed the 24th competition but returned for the 25th, where he failed the first obstacle of the Second Stage, the Slider Drop. However, he couldn't compete in the 26th competition after breaking his wrist while participating in ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', a televised professional parkour tournament.\n\nLevi did not compete in ''American Ninja Warrior'' 3 to try to earn a spot for ''Sasuke'' 27 because of a big movie scene that came up for him during the time of the tryouts.\n\nLevi however did compete ''American Ninja Warrior'' 4, however he failed the Quad Steps (Godantobi in Japanese), the very first obstacle. It was clear he was very tired as he had flown in from the Philippines hours beforehand and tried to rush.\n\nHe has not competed in ''American Ninja Warrior'' ever since. It is known that he stopped free running altogether, and became a farmer instead.<ref>{{cite web |title=About - Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |url=https://realeyeshomestead.com/about/ |website=Realeyes Permaculture Homestead |accessdate=2 July 2018}}</ref>\n \nIn the four times he completed the First Stage, he had the fastest time out of everyone who finished Stage 1.\n\n=====Results=====\n*''Note: Does not include American Ninja Warrior results''\n*'''[[Morgan Hamm]]''', US Olympic Gymnast\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Hamm's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||14th\n||81\n||Failed Tarzan Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||15th\n||93\n||Failed Curtain Cling\n||Third\n|}\n\n*'''[[Paul Hamm]]''', US Olympic Gymnast\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Hamm's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||14th\n||82\n||Failed Wall Lift<sup>\u2020</sup>\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||15th\n||92\n||Failed Warped Wall\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||16th\n||94\n||Failed Metal Spin\n||Second\n|}\n\n\u2020&nbsp;- Hamm cleared the Second Stage with 0.1 seconds left, but walked through the gates without hitting the buzzer and as a result, was disqualified.\n\n*'''[[Paul Terek]]''', US Olympic Decathlete\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Terek's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||17th\n||86\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||18th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||19th\n||98\n||Failed Jumping Spider\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||20th\u201321st\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||22nd\n||98\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||24th\n||82\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|}\n\n*'''Levi Meeuwenberg''', an American [[freerunning|freerunner]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Meeuwenberg's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||20th\n||1989\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||21st\n||99\n||Failed Salmon Ladder\n||Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||22nd\n||91\n||Failed Slider Jump\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n||95\n||Failed Shin-Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||24th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||25th\n||48\n||Failed Slider Drop\n||Second\n|-\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||26th\u201336th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|}\n\n\u2020&nbsp;- Levi was supposed to compete in the 26th tournament, having earned a spot in the ''American Ninja Warrior'' preliminaries, but was ultimately unable to do so after breaking his wrist on ''[[Jump City: Seattle]]'', which occurred prior to the 26th tournament.

He also participated in ''American Ninja Challenge'' and then became an ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' stalwart once NBC and G4/Esquire created an entire American-based ''Sasuke'' competition. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 30 (reaching the Third Stage), after he won the ''Sasuke'' Asean Open Cup 2013 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (where he achieved a gold medal in overall stages) and ''ANW'' Season 7 and 8 (where he is to compete in the Vegas Finals) in the space of a calendar year. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 31 and failed the Crazy Cliffhanger. He made his fourth appearance in ''Sasuke'' 32; he is the first person ever to beat the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger and the third American to clear the Japanese Cliffhanger, after Travis Allen Schroeder in ''Sasuke'' 4 and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8, but he failed the next obstacle Vertical Limit Kai. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he failed the second trial on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, due to timing problems on the moving ledge. He fell at the same place just like the last tournament in ''Sasuke'' 34.

Previously a pole vaulter in college, she initially competed in multiple seasons of ''American Ninja Warrior'', becoming the first woman to complete Stage 1 in Las Vegas in 2016. In 2017, she became both the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') and Stage 2 at the original Mt. Midoriyama (''Sasuke'' 34). In Stage 3, she went out on the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger at the first transition, but not before earning an invitation to the next tournament.\n*'''[[Kacy Catanzaro]]''', the first woman in the world to clear the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder while competing in ''American Ninja Warrior'' (''ANW'' 6 in 2014, during the Dallas qualifiers).

During that competition he reached the Final Stage but became the first competitor to suffer a 15-second timeout on the initial Spider Climb portion, falling when it spread apart. Rain and a two-second late start also hurt his performance. He made it to the Third Stage three more times in competitions 12, 14, and 16, failing the Cliffhanger each time. He competed in the 15th competition but failed the Warped Wall in the First Stage. He later came back to compete in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he failed the Warped Wall again. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 23, where he managed to pass all of the other obstacles but sadly timed out on the final rope ladder.\n\n=====Results=====\n\n*'''[[Jordan Jovtchev]]'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Jovtchev's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||8th\n||59\n||Failed Spider Climb\n||Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||9th\u201311th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||12th\n||99\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||13th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||14th\n||91\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||15th\n||97\n||Failed Warped Wall\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||16th\n||95\n||Failed Cliffhanger\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||17th\u201319th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||20th\n||1993\n||Failed Warped Wall\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||21st\u201322nd\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n||23rd\n||79\n||Failed Rope Ladder\n||First\n|}\n\n====Korean athletes====\nSouth Korean gymnast [[Yeo Hong-chul]], silver medalist in the men's vault at the [[1996 Olympic Games]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. He competed four times but has never gotten past the First Stage. In the 7th competition, he was unable to beat the Rolling Log; In the 8th, he failed the Quintuple Step; In the 11th, he timed out on the Warped Wall. And in the 12th, he timed out on the Rope Climb.\n\n====Spanish athletes====\nSpanish gymnast [[Gervasio Deferr]], 2000 and 2004 Olympic Champion in the vault and 2008 silver medalist in the floor exercise, competed in the 10th competition but timed out a few feet from the buzzer on the First Stage's Rope Climb.\n\n====Taiwanese athletes====\n*'''Lee En-Chih''' (who was incorrectly listed as ''Lee Yen Chi'' in the US version and was mistakenly called ''Lee Enchi'' or ''Li En Zhi'' for years), is a professional rock climber from Taiwan. In his first attempt in ''Sasuke'' 17, he cleared the First Stage but failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 18, he failed the Jumping Spider in the First Stage. After a two-tournament absence, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 21 and was one of only nine competitors to make it to the Second Stage, timing out on Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he was one of four people to make it to the Third Stage, ultimately failing the Shin-Cliffhanger. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he failed the Second Stage's Metal Spin. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he made it to the Final Stage for the first time but timed out 19 meters away. Li became the third foreigner to reach the Final Stage since [[Yordan Yovchev]] and [[Kane Kosugi]] in ''Sasuke'' 8. In ''Sasuke'' 25, he went to the Third Stage, but he failed the Ultimate Cliffhanger. He made it back to the Ultimate Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 26, but again failed there.  In ''Sasuke'' 25 and 26, Li finished first overall, becoming the only foreigner to have progressed further than any competitor in consecutive tournaments. After making it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger two times, it looked as if Li would go all the way in ''Sasuke'' 27. However, he shocked many when he failed the Step Slider in Stage 1. This was his earliest defeat ever, and first time failing Stage 1 since ''Sasuke'' 18. He failed the First Stage yet again in ''Sasuke'' 28, on the Spinning Bridge. He finally cleared the First Stage again in ''Sasuke'' 29, but timed out on the Passing Wall, on the Second Stage. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He decided to retire from ''Sasuke'' due to replacement by Taiwan representatives. Since ''Sasuke'' 31, his fellow Liao Long Zhun fully ruled the Taiwan representatives.

Kane made the Third Stage in the 1st, 4th and 6th competitions, failing on the Pole Bridge, Cliffhanger and Body Prop, respectively. In the 7th competition, he made the Second Stage but failed the Spider Walk, his earliest exit from a competition.

Nakamura made it to the Third Stage in the 2nd competition, failing there on the Pipe Slider, but in the 6th competition he was eliminated by the First Stage's Jump Hang. Morohoshi debuted in the 20th tournament but failed the Log Grip in the First Stage. Ishimaru has never made it past the First Stage; his two closest attempts, in the 16th and 17th competitions, timed out on the Rope Climb. [[Sh\u014dei]] competed three times. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 6, and failed the Jump Hang when he tried to go under using only his arms. He timed out on the Rope Climb in Stage 1 in ''Sasuke'' 7.

He never completed the First Stage, failing in Jump Hang Kai in ''Sasuke'' 30. In ''Sasuke'' 31 he did slightly worse by failing the Orug\u014dru (also known as the Music Box) before he could reach the Jump Hang Kai again.\n\n[[Voice acting in Japan|Voice actress]] [[Tomoko Kaneda]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 31. She failed the Rolling Hill on the First Stage. Her husband, [[Wataru Mori]], an actor, also competed in several competitions. Mori has competed since ''Sasuke'' 16; he failed Rolling Log. Then he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 21 and failed Jumping Spider. After an eight-year hiatus, he competed again in ''Sasuke'' 32; he timed out on the Lumberjack Climb. He competed again in ''Sasuke'' 33, where he completed the First Stage, and timed out at the Reverse Conveyor.

In ''Sasuke'' 36, when he reach the Reverse Conveyor, he used his legs to support himself on the sides of the Conveyor. This is something which is against the rules and thus he was disqualified.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Mori's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 16th\n|| 64\n|| Failed Rolling Log\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 17th\u201320th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 11\n|| Failed Jumping Spider\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\u201331st\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 82\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 83\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 90\n|| Failed Quad Steps\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 71\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 76\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyer (disqualified)\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 10\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|}\n\n[[Golden Bomber]] members Kenji Darvish and Yutaka Kyan also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31.

Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&nbsp;\u2013 for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st\u20133rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26\u201328), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman Masumi Yagi was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} Wakky competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n===Other notable competitors===\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n46-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\n===Women in ''Sasuke''===\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.<ref>In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.</ref> She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.\n\n[[:jp:\u904a\u4f50\u96c5\u7f8e|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as \"Miyabi\" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a \"Warrior Wipeout\" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.\n\nAll three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4\u20136)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times \u2013 the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.\n* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.\n* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.\n\nAmerican gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] \u2013 the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') \u2013 was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament. She did not return until Sasuke 37, however, but she went on to clear stage 1 and 2 again, becoming the only woman to reach stage 3 twice. She failed the first flip of the Cliffhanger Dimension, in the same place as Sasuke 34. '''''(insert list of runs here)'''''\n\nA Shinkin Bank employee who has been competed on ''Kunoichi'', Ayano Oshima, She first completed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Her run was digested, but it was shown that she had timed out as she was getting up the Warped Wall. Ayano once again returned for ''Sasuke'' 36. She was the first Japanese woman to ever clear the Dragon Glider. Although, she became to tired after finishing the tackle, and timed out at the Warped Wall.\n\n===American Ninja Challenges===\n{{Main|American Ninja Challenge}}\nIn fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28\u201330 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&nbsp;\u2013 the first woman to qualify&nbsp;\u2013 of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\n==Results==\n{{main|List of Sasuke competitions}}\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1\u2013100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory). In the 10th competition the number system ran from 901 to 1000 to indicate that 1000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and then ran from 1901 to 2000 in the 20th competition to indicate that 2000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and from 2901 to 3000 during the 30th competition to indicate roughly 3000 attempts on ''Sasuke''. All air dates are of the Japanese broadcast on TBS.\n\n=== ''Sasuke'' 1 ===\n{{See also|List of Sasuke competitions#1st competition}}\nAired: September 27, 1997\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible

The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.\n\n{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names \"{{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0}}\"(Free Climbing) and \"{{lang|ja|\ufffd?\u767b\u308a}}\"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the \"Mountain Climb\" in subtitles.\n\n{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later be replaced with the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.\n\n{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Prism See-Saw\" is called the \"Prism Tilt\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Prism See-Saw.\"\n\n{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Cross Bridge\" is called the \"Bridge of Blades\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Cross Bridge.\"\n\n{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the \"Rope Hang,\" but that name is erroneous.\n\n{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.\n\n{{note|8|8}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Double Pendulum\" is called the \"Tic Toc\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.\n\n{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Rolling Escargot\" is called the \"Rolling Snail\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|12|12}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Tackle\" is called the \"Triple Tackle\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|13|13}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"TIE Fighter\" is called the \"Prop Slider\" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] to use the name associated with the Star Wars fighter after which the obstacle was named.\n\n===Stage 2===\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. ''Sasuke''\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

\u2014 This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af}}\" (Spider Walk), \"{{lang|ja|\u52d5\u304f\u58c1}}\" (Moving Walls) and \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0}}\" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it \"Spider Walk\".\n\n{{note|2|2}} The onscreen Japanese graphics \"{{lang|ja|\u4e94\u9023\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}\" reveal this obstacle's official name as \"Five Continuous Hammers\". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.\n\n{{note|3|3}} In those competitions there are two \"Moving Walls\" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.\n\n{{note|4|4}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.\n\n{{note|5|5}} The Rolling Log appeared in SASUKE 37 as the original first obstacle of Stage 2, but due to rain, it did not function correctly. The judges decided to start Stage 2 at the Salmon Ladder Ascent with a lowered time limit of 100 seconds.\n\n</div>\n\n===Third Stage===\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|\u5b8c\u5168\u5236\u8987}}), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15-meter (49&nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20-meter (66&nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5-meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18\u201324 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7\u201317 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (\u7db1\u767b\u308a) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35-second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage.

Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\" As of 2019, new episodes have not been shown on U.S. airwaves, and the 27th competition remains the most recent one to be aired in America.\n\n====''American Ninja Warrior''====\n\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior}}\nThe popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 2)|second season]] was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe [[American Ninja Warrior (season 3)|third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'']] debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 4)|fourth season]] of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&nbsp;\u2013 regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 5)|fifth season]] on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 6)|sixth season]] on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|seventh season]] in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff \u2013 ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube</ref>) The network has renewed the show once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|eighth season]] in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|ninth season]] in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 10)|tenth season]] of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 11)|eleventh season]] began airing on May 29, 2019 with two new cities ([[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Cincinnati]]), a chance to go directly to Las Vegas with the Speed Pass in the Power Tower duel between the two fastest players, and a new co-host, [[Zuri Hall]]. In addition, Drew Drechsel became the third person to achieve Total Victory at the end of the season.\n\n=====''USA vs Japan''=====\n{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}\n\nIn 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&nbsp;\u2013 one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6\u20130 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\n=====''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja''=====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja}}\n\nWith the success of ''American Ninja Warrior'', Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called ''Team Ninja Warrior'' on October 9, 2015.

(\u30b5\u30b9\u30b1; stylized in Japan as '''''SASUKE''''') is a Japanese [[sports entertainment]] [[television special]] in which 100 competitors attempt to complete a four-stage [[obstacle course]]. An edited version, named '''''Ninja Warrior''''', is screened in at least 18 other countries.\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Development==\nRecorded on location at a [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|Midoriyama]] studio in [[Yokohama]], it airs on [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] between [[Japanese television drama]] seasons. The show's name ''Sasuke'' is named after [[Sarutobi Sasuke]], a fictitious character in Japanese storytelling.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jamison|first1=Leslie|title=The Great American Obstacle Course|url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-great-american-obstacle-course|accessdate=19 August 2017|publisher=The New Yorker|date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Each three-hour special (with the exceptions of ''Sasuke'' 24 and 36 which lasted 5 {{frac|1|2}} hours and 6 hours respectively) covers an entire competition; there are normally 100 participants. There have been 36 specials produced, approximately one new special per year (twice per year before Monster9's bankruptcy, now reduced to once per year since 2012, then became twice again since 2017). The show is produced by [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]] and is one of the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-offs]] of {{Nihongo|''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Muscle Ranking]]''|\u7b4b\u8089\u756a\u4ed8|Kinniku Banzuke}}, another sports entertainment competition, which aired on [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] under the name ''[[Kinniku Banzuke|Unbeatable Banzuke]]''. Until the 10th competition, ''Sasuke'' was broadcast as a special part of ''Muscle Ranking'', but it became an independent program when ''Muscle Ranking'' was discontinued. The first competition was held indoors, marking the only time ''Sasuke'' did not take place outside. Competitions generally start in the daytime and continue until completed regardless of weather or darkness.<ref>Corkill, Edan, [http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20110930r1.html \"Average Joes become champions on 'Sasuke'\"]. ''[[Japan Times]]''. September 30, 2011. p. 15.</ref> After Monster9's bankruptcy in November 2011, all rights to the show fell completely into the hands of its broadcaster, Tokyo Broadcasting System. Following their acquisition of all rights to ''Sasuke'', TBS renamed the show '''''Sasuke Rising''''' for the 28th, 29th and 30th editions, but have since reverted to the original name. TBS has renamed the show once again, to '''''Sasuke Ninja Warrior''''' since the 35th edition. TBS changed the show's logo for the 36th edition.\n\nApplicants are interviewed or auditioned and trial rounds are held to test their physical ability until the field is narrowed to 100 competitors. ''Sasuke'' consists of four stages of increasing difficulty; competitors must complete a stage to advance. Before the 18th tournament, a 1,200-meter run was held in order to determine the competitors' starting positions. Each competition is taped prior to the air date, edited for time, and broadcast as a three-hour show. Exceptions may be made as in ''Sasuke'' 24's case should TBS decide the broadcast should go over three hours, but this is a rare exception.\n\nIn its 37 seasons, all four stages of the course were only completed a total of five times, by four different competitors. These were [[:ja:\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66|Kazuhiko Akiyama]]<ref>[http://www.neatorama.com/2007/01/16/makoto-nagano/] April 7, 2007</ref> in the 4th competition (1999), [[Makoto Nagano]] in the 17th competition (2006), [[Yuuji Urushihara]] in the 24th (2010) and 27th (2011) competitions,<ref>\"Yuuji Urushihara does it again\" [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrWdY38IfTE] ''Youtube'', 11/6/2011</ref> and [[Yusuke Morimoto]] in the 31st competition (2015).\n\n===Popularity===\nThe popularity of ''Sasuke'' has led to the creation of a number of spin-off shows and international versions of the show. ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'', perhaps the most well-known spin-off, is a version of ''Sasuke'' restricted to female competitors with an emphasis on speed, balance, and stability.\n\n''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' is the United States version of the show. Originally integrated with ''Sasuke'' (with American finalists participating on the ''Sasuke'' course in Japan), it was at one point the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network's highest rated show.<ref>Levin, Gary.

December 7, 2010.</ref> As of season 4, ''American Ninja Warrior'''s popularity has allowed it to move to the [[NBC]] network and expand as a stand-alone spin-off with a full replica course in Las Vegas, although Americans have continued to enter ''Sasuke'' even after the inception of ''ANW''.\n\nOther international versions of the format have aired in India, Singapore, Malaysia, Turkey, Sweden, Denmark, [[Ninja Warrior UK|United Kingdom]], Bahrain, China, [[Sasuke Ninja Warrior Indonesia|Indonesia]], Russia and Vietnam, with versions also launching in France ([[TF1]]), [[Ninja Warrior Germany|Germany]] ([[RTL Television|RTL]]), Italy (NOVE of [[Discovery Networks]]) in 2016, and Israel ([[Keshet Media Group]]) in 2018. An [[Australian Ninja Warrior|Australian version]] launched on [[Nine Network]] in July 2017. [[Netflix]] also started airing ''[[Ultimate Beastmaster]]'', broadcast in six different languages in 2017, a ''Sasuke'' inspired show.\n\n==Competitors==\nThe show hosts a broad spectrum of participants. While most are from Japan, national television personalities and Olympians from other countries, including the US, [[Bulgaria]], China and Korea, have taken part in the competition. Some of the more enthusiastic competitors dress up in costumes, bring props to the starting stage, or show off some of their talents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Sasuke All-Stars===\nThe Sasuke All-Stars were a group of six favored competitors, established by the TBS network, originally thought to be the most likely to clear all four stages. It included two of the men to complete the ''Sasuke'' course, Kazuhiko Akiyama (1999, 4th tournament) and Makoto Nagano (2006, 17th tournament). The membership of the All-Stars has remained unchanged despite other successful competitors in later tournaments, notably, Yuuji Urushihara who completed the course in the 24th and 27th tournaments. The All-Stars were officially 'retired' in the 28th tournament. Two of them continue to compete independently, and are now referred to as 'former All-Stars'.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe six consisted of:\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Kazuhiko Akiyama|ja|3=\u79cb\u5c71\u548c\u5f66}}''', a crab fisherman and massage therapist.

Overall, he has competed 20 times and has been officially retired since ''Sasuke'' 28 in 2012.

There was a brief hiatus before the term was re-popularized in ''Sasuke'' 22 when Yuuji and Kanno made it to the Third Stage.  Membership in the New Stars has included the following:\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Shunsuke Nagasaki|ja|3=\u9577\u5d0e\u5cfb\u4f91}}''', a trampolinist.

He is the first to be called one of the \"Shin Sedai\" in ''Sasuke'' 17, however, he made his first Final Stage appearance in ''Sasuke'' 17 in 19 years, the second youngest to reach the Final Stage. He failed the First Stage in ''Sasuke'' 19; after that he didn't compete for six years. In 2012 he retired from athletics. He made his comeback on ''Sasuke'' 29, however he timed out on the Passing Wall. He failed the Crazy Cliffhanger in ''Sasuke'' 30. He timed out in the Lumberjack Climb in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was all cut. He failed the Flying Bar in ''Sasuke'' 32 and failed it again in ''Sasuke'' 33. Surprisingly, he failed the Spider Walk in ''Sasuke'' 34. He failed the Spider Drop in ''Sasuke'' 35, the first time he failed the Second Stage for the two consecutive times. This meant that Nagasaki was eliminated at the Second Stage in consecutive tournaments for the first time. He failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 36.

In ''Sasuke'' 29, he failed the Backstream. In ''Sasuke'' 30, he timed out on the Wall Lifting. In ''Sasuke'' 31, he took more time to clear the Tackle and timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe. In ''Sasuke'' 32, he was one of the notable competitors who failed on the new obstacle Double Pendulum when he failed the transition to the red sandbag. In ''Sasuke'' 33, he surprisingly failed Rolling Hill. He made a good transition from Quad Steps to the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance in the middle of the Rolling Hill. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he declared that if he failed the First Stage again, he would retire. Then the results show that he cleared the First Stage, but he struggled in Reverse Conveyor and timed out there. In ''Sasuke'' 35, he cleared the first few obstacles with ease, including the new Dragon Glider, but eventually timed out on the Soritatsu Kabe due to the reduced time limit and exhaustion. He finally made it to the Third Stage after 6 years in ''Sasuke'' 36, cleared the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger, being the oldest to clear it, and also the oldest to attempt the next obstacle, the Vertical Limit, where he made it to the 3rd ledge before his grip gave out.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Urushihara's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| '''Competition'''\n|| '''Start position'''\n|| '''Obstacle'''\n|| '''Stage'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 21st\n|| 72\n|| Failed Flying Chute\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 22nd\n|| 77\n|| Failed G-Rope\n|| Final\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 23rd\n|| 99\n|| Failed Unstable Bridge\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 24th\n|| 93\n|| '''Kanzenseiha (3.57 seconds to spare)'''\n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| 25th\n| 100\n|| Failed Double Salmon Ladder\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 26th\n|| 100\n|| Failed Half-Pipe Attack\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 27th\n|| 99 \n|| '''Kanzenseiha (6.71 seconds to spare)''' \n|| '''Final'''\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 88 \n|| Failed Crazy Cliffhanger\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Backstream\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2993\n|| Failed Wall Lifting\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 99\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Double Pendulum\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 89\n|| Failed Rolling Hill\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 99\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 95\n|| Failed Vertical Limit Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Pipe Slider\n|| Third\n|}\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hitoshi Kanno|ja|3=\u83c5\u91ce\u4ec1\u5fd7}}''', a janitorial worker/jewelry designer.

He competed five times. He competed since ''Sasuke'' 16 but his run was all cut. After a seven-year hiatus, he competed in ''Sasuke'' 28, he failed the Spin Bridge and the second wall of the Ni Ren Soritatsu Kabe in ''Sasuke'' 30. He also competed in ''Sasuke'' 31 but his run was completely cut. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 32 wearing number 66, and completed the First Stage for the first time with just 2.12 seconds remaining. He then went on to clear the Second Stage, becoming one of eight to do so, with 9.59 seconds remaining. However, his first attempt on the Third Stage was a struggle. On the first transition of the Drum Hopper he slipped and nearly fell, and only just managed to reposition himself, while the other transitions showed signs of unease. His strength was sapped for the next obstacle, the Flying Bar, where he failed the first transition after the bar did not reach the second set of rungs. In his fluff piece for ''Sasuke'' 32, it was falsely stated that he had failed the First Stage four times, when in fact he had competed for the first time in four tournaments beforehand. In ''Sasuke'' 33, his run was digested but he failed the Double Pendulum. In ''Sasuke'' 34, he failed the Sidewinder Kai. He was unable to repeat his performance from the previous tournament as he had a surprising fall on the Fish Bone in ''Sasuke'' 35. He managed to clear the Warped Wall but he timed out on the top of the wall before reaching the button in ''Sasuke'' 36.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Suzuki's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 16th\n|| ?\n||Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 17th\u201327th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 24\n||Failed Spin Bridge\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2943\n||Failed Double Warped Wall (time out)\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 65\n||Failed Orugoru\n||First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 66\n||Failed Flying Bar\n||Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 93\n|| Failed Double Pendulum\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 84\n|| Failed Sidewinder Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 94\n|| Failed Fishbone\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 82\n|| Failed Warped Wall (time out)\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 75\n|| Failed Spider Walk\n|| Second\n|}\n\n*'''{{Interlanguage link multi|Hiroyuki Asaoka|ja|3=\u671d\u5ca1\u5f18\u884c}}''', a former elementary school teacher turned illustrator.

athletes====\n\nSeveral Japanese athletes have competed in ''Sasuke'' over the years, including professional team [[Team handball|handball]] player [[Daisuke Miyazaki]], who was featured in the 20th, 21st, 22nd and 26th competitions. In his debut, the 20th competition, he failed on the Halfpipe Attack. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 21, where he made it all the way to the Third Stage Devil Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 22, he timed out on the Net Climb in Stage 1, and in ''Sasuke'' 26, he failed the First Stage's Rolling Escargot.\n\nSprinter [[Hisatsugu Suzuki]], who competed in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], appeared in the 13th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Cross Bridge.\n\nAnother competitor from the 1992 Olympics, gymnast [[Yoshiaki Hatakeda]], competed in the 6th tournament, making it all the way to Stage 3 before falling on the Cliff Hanger.\n\nAfter the 27th competition, three Japanese Olympians competed: [[Tomoko Hagiwara]], [[Koki Sakamoto]], and [[Daisuke Nakano]]. Hagiwara competed in the 28th competition, but she failed the Quintuple Step. She also competed in the 29th competition, but she failed the Hedgehog. Sakamoto competed in the 28th competition, wearing #95 (the highest number for non all-stars that tournament), but he timed out on the second Warped Wall. Nakano competed in the 29th competition, but he failed the Jump Hang Kai, while trying to grab both nets.\n\nPole Vaulter [[Seito Yamamoto]], who competed in the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], [[2016 Summer Olympics]], and also [[2018 Asian Games]], appeared in the 35th and 36th competition where he fell in Stage 1 on the Dragon Glider twice.\n\n====American athletes====\nVarious American athletes, including Olympic [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] (and twin brothers) [[Paul Hamm|Paul]] and [[Morgan Hamm]], have competed in ''Sasuke''. Paul made it to the Second Stage in the 14th and 16th competitions but failed to make it further&nbsp;\u2013 in the 14th, he cleared Wall Lifting but forgot to hit the button at the end before time ran out, and in the 16th, he was eliminated by the Metal Spin. He competed in the 15th competition as well, but he failed to make it past the First Stage's Warped Wall. Morgan timed out in the First Stage before he could attempt the Rope Climb in the 14th competition, but he made it to the Third Stage in the 15th, failing on the Curtain Cling. In the 16th competition, he failed the First Stage's Warped Wall.\n\n[[Decathlon|Decathlete]] [[Paul Terek]] competed four times in total. He first appeared in the 17th competition, making it to the Third Stage before failing the Cliffhanger. The announcer pointed to his immense size (6 foot 3 and 215 pounds) as a barrier to his advancement. After earning the title of ''Pro Sportsman No. 1'' in 2007, Terek appeared in the 19th competition but failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider. He helped G4 oversee the 2nd ''American Ninja Challenge'' competition in early 2008, but he did not compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th competition due to his training for the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing (though he eventually had to drop out of the running for the Olympics after suffering a torn meniscus in his left knee). He made his return to ''Sasuke'' in the 22nd competition but failed on a new obstacle in the First Stage, the Slider Jump. He failed the same obstacle in ''Sasuke'' 24. In 2010, Paul Terek announced his retirement from international competition, so it is likely he will never compete again.\n\n[[Henry Cejudo]], gold medal-winning [[freestyle wrestling|wrestler]] at the [[2008 Olympic Games]] in Beijing, competed in the 21st competition, but failed the First Stage's Halfpipe Attack.\n\nLevi Meeuwenberg, a [[Freerunning|free runner]] from G4's ''American Ninja Challenge 2'', first competed in ''Sasuke'' 20, where he was one of only three people to clear the First Stage and the only person to clear the Second Stage. He cleared Stage 2 with a record time of 38.5 seconds left. He failed the Third Stage's Shin-Cliffhanger.

In ''Sasuke'' 32, Kyan did better on the Rolling Hill, but he lost his balance on the new obstacle Tie Fighter. Darvish failed at the Tie Fighter when he lost his balance. In ''Sasuke'' 33, Darvish almost cleared the First Stage but shockingly failed the Lumberjack Climb with only several centimeters to finish the obstacle. Kyan failed Quad Steps. In ''Sasuke'' 34, Darvish made it to the 2nd Stage, but he struggled in the Reverse Conveyor. He made it to the Second Stage, he professed slightly further, timing out after lifting the first wall of the Wall Lifting, while Kyan failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 35. Darvish finally made to the Third Stage, he failed the transition to the Sidewinder Kai while Kyan failed the Dragon Glider in ''Sasuke'' 36.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|+Darvish's results\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!Competition\n!Start position\n!Obstacle\n!Stage\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 28th\n|| 31\n|| Failed Rolling Escargot\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 29th\n| colspan=\"3\" | Did not compete\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 30th\n|| 2979\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 31st\n|| 82\n|| Failed Cross Slider\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 32nd\n|| 91\n|| Failed Tie Fighter\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 33rd\n|| 82\n|| Failed Lumberjack Climb\n|| First\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 34th\n|| 89\n|| Failed Reverse Conveyor\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 35th\n|| 96\n|| Failed Wall Lifting (time out)\n|| Second\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 36th\n|| 98\n|| Failed Sidewinder Kai\n|| Third\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|| 37th\n|| 97\n|| Failed Dragon Glider\n|| First\n|}\n\n[[Model (person)|Model]] [[Shimon Okura]] competed in ''Sasuke'' 30.

Most of these compete for entertainment value and do not represent serious challenges&nbsp;\u2013 for example, Choshu's only accomplishment was being the first person to clear the Rope Glider in the 18th competition. However, some have seen success. Omori made it to the Final Stage three times in a row (1st\u20133rd competitions), a record that is shared with ''Sasuke'' all-star [[Makoto Nagano]], but since then he has not been able to clear the First Stage. Nakayama made it to the Second Stage in the 9th and 11th competitions; in the 9th, Nakayama failed the Spider Walk, and in the 11th, he missed hitting the Second Stage's final button by a split-second. He competed in ''Sasuke'' 27. He had footage showing himself training for the new course. He wore #30, and despite his training, he failed the Rolling Escargot when he could not get enough momentum to get the structure spinning, and fell into the water when trying to restart the obstacle. He got revenge on it in the 28th tournament, but timed out on the second Warped Wall. In the 29th tournament, he almost cleared the First Stage for the first time in 10 years, but ultimately, timed out at the top of the Rope Ladder. Recent comedians include [[Yoshio Kojima]], who competed in five competitions (22, 24, 26\u201328), where he failed at the Log Grip twice, Hazard Swing, Step Slider, and Rolling Escargot respectively. Funnyman [[Masumi Yagi]] was featured in the 26th competition but failed on the Step Slider. Cocky comedian [[Eiko Kano]] (aka \"Mr. Narcissus\") was featured in the 25th competition and failed at the Dome Steps, but got past the first obstacle in the 26th competition and failed at the Rolling Escargot.\n\nPenalty comedian{{clarify|reason=In English, penalties aren't funny.|date=June 2018}} {{Interlanguage link multi|Wakky|ja|3=\u30ef\u30c3\u30ad\u30fc}} competed nine times in ''Sasuke''. He debuted in ''Sasuke'' 20 and failed the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 21 and 22, he failed the Jumping Spider. In ''Sasuke'' 23, he got revenge on both the Jumping Spider and the Halfpipe Attack, only to fail the Slider Jump. In ''Sasuke'' 24, he failed the Halfpipe Attack again. He returned for ''Sasuke'' 27 and cleared the First Stage for the first time. In the Second Stage, he failed the Double Salmon Ladder. In ''Sasuke'' 28, he timed out on the Rope Ladder. He advanced to the Second Stage in ''Sasuke'' 29 and 30, but failed the Swap Salmon Ladder.\n\n===Other notable competitors===\n65-year-old Minoru Kuramochi, known as \"the Octopus\" because he usually brings an octopus with him, is the owner of the Edokko Izakaya octopus bar in Tokyo and is one of the oldest competitors. He has competed several times, never making it very far into the First Stage. Despite this, he seems to be a fan favorite. In the 20th competition's preview special, he welcomed the G4 American Ninja Challengers to his bar, served them his special octopus meal, and showed off his physical skills to them. He is No. 4 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll. His best performance was in ''Sasuke'' 26, where he managed to make it to the Rolling Escargot. He got further than in ''Sasuke'' 19, when he timed out on the Pole Maze.\n\nToyohisa Ijima, a martial arts dance instructor and former member of the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]], competed in the first several tournaments. He is known as the \"Japanese Bruce Lee\" because of his resemblance to the [[Bruce Lee|late action star]], which extends to dressing and acting like him. He has only made it past the First Stage in the 1st tournament; in the 11th tournament, he missed hitting the final button on the Rope Climb by a split second because he had wasted time posing for the crowd after completing each obstacle. He is No. 3 on G4's Craziest Contestant poll.\n\n46-year-old Katsuhide Torisawa is a former weightlifter who has competed in every single Shin-''Sasuke'' tournament (except ''Sasuke'' 22), starting with ''Sasuke'' 18. He always displays his strength before his run; he has brought a barbell and lifted it over his head multiple times, ripped off his shirt, and crushed an apple and full cans of beer with one hand, and also snapped a baseball bat in half. He has never cleared the First Stage.\n\n===Women in ''Sasuke''===\nThe first woman to have completed the First Stage is former ''[[Super Sentai]]'' stuntwoman [[Chie Tanabe|Chie Nishimura]], who did so in the 2nd tournament.<ref>In that tournament, her last name was listed as Tanabe because at the time she was single.</ref> She attempted the Second Stage's Spider Walk in a non-optimal fashion, because her legs were too short to reach across the obstacle the proper way, and failed. She also competed in ''Sasuke'' 3 but failed the Rolling Log. She hasn't competed in ''Sasuke'' since.\n\n[[:jp:\u904a\u4f50\u96c5\u7f8e|Masami Yusa]] (G4 mislists her first name as \"Miyabi\" in some tournaments), a [[Beach Flags (sport)|beach flags]] champion, has competed eight times. She debuted in ''Sasuke'' 6, but failed the Barrel Climb. In the ''Sasuke'' 13 trials, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang, although she timed out there. During the actual competition, she was able to grab on to the redesigned Jump Hang, but she misjudged her jump, slammed face-first onto the platform, and fell into the water; this failure earned her a \"Warrior Wipeout\" during G4's broadcasting of this tournament. In ''Sasuke'' 14, she became the first woman to beat the Jump Hang and the Crooked Wall in competition, but she ultimately timed out on the Warped Wall.\n\nAll three women who achieved ''kanzenseiha'' on ''[[Kunoichi (TV series)|Kunoichi]]'' ''(Women of Ninja Warrior)'', the female equivalent of ''Sasuke'', have also competed in ''Sasuke'' itself, though none have cleared Stage 1. All are also acrobats who worked with Muscle Musical.\n\n* Ayako Miyake, who achieved ''Kunoichi'' total victory three straight times ''(Kunoichi 4\u20136)'', has also competed in ''Sasuke'' twice, going out in Stage 1 both times \u2013 the Sandan Rolling Maruta in ''Sasuke'' 17 and the Jumping Spider in ''Sasuke'' 18.\n* ''Kunoichi 8'' champion Rie Komiya, who is a broadcaster and model as well as an acrobat, has competed several times. She first competed in ''Sasuke'' 22, where she was disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling into the safety mat just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in ''Sasuke'' 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In ''Sasuke'' 24, she surprised many by failing the Log Grip. She did not compete in ''Sasuke'' 25, but did compete in ''Sasuke'' 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in ''Sasuke'' 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.\n* Satomi Kadoi, the other ''Kunoichi 8'' champion, competed in ''Sasuke'' 27 and failed the Halfpipe Attack.\n\nAmerican gymnast [[Kacy Catanzaro]], who famously became the first woman in the world to clear both the Warped Wall and the Salmon Ladder during ''[[American Ninja Warrior]]'' qualifiers in Dallas in 2014, traveled to the original Mt. Midoriyama for ''Sasuke'' 32 and cleared the Warped Wall at the second attempt before narrowly timing out.\n\nAnother American woman and ''American Ninja Warrior'' standout, stuntwoman [[Jessie Graff]] \u2013 the first woman to complete Stage 2 in Las Vegas (''ANW All-Stars'') \u2013 was one of the two invited US entrants including Drew Drechsel in ''Sasuke'' 34 the next year. She became only the second woman in ''Sasuke'' history after Nishimura to complete the First Stage, doing so with 14.5 seconds left on the clock (which would have been under the limit set for the male competitors as well; the female competitors were given an extra 10 seconds.) She then surprised everyone once again when she managed to complete Stage 2 with 4.4 seconds left on the clock, becoming the very first woman to ever clear the Second Stage in ''Sasuke''. In Stage 3, Graff started strongly, completing the first three obstacles in good form. However, despite her determination, she failed the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she attempted the first jump from the first to the second ledge and was unable to hold on. However, having impressed the onlookers, she was invited back for the following tournament. She did not return until Sasuke 37, however, but she went on to clear stage 1 and 2 again, becoming the only woman to reach stage 3 twice. She failed the first flip of the Cliffhanger Dimension, in the same place as Sasuke 34. '''''(insert list of runs here)'''''\n\nA Shinkin Bank employee who has been competed on ''Kunoichi'', {{Interlanguage link multi|Ayano Oshima|ja|3=\u5927\u5d8b\u3042\u3084\u306e}}, She first completed in ''Sasuke'' 31. Her run was digested, but it was shown that she had timed out as she was getting up the Warped Wall. Ayano once again returned for ''Sasuke'' 36. She was the first Japanese woman to ever clear the Dragon Glider. Although, she became to tired after finishing the tackle, and timed out at the Warped Wall.\n\n===American Ninja Challenges===\n{{Main|American Ninja Challenge}}\nIn fall 2007, the [[G4 (U.S. TV channel)|G4]] network held a contest called the ''American Ninja Challenge'', whose grand prize was a trip to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 19th competition. Ten semifinalist videos were selected on August 3 via internet poll to determine three finalists who would appear on G4's ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'' on August 28\u201330 to demonstrate their ''Ninja Warrior'' skills. On August 31, [[Michigan State University]] Economics student Colin Bell and the runner-up, [[Greenville, South Carolina]] native Brett Sims, were both selected, and they became the subjects of an hour-long G4 special on November 14 during G4's ''Ninjafest''. Ultimately, both Colin and Brett qualified for the course thanks to their impressive physical abilities, but they both failed the Jumping Spider.\n\nThe second contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 2'' on May 18, 2008. Levi Meeuwenberg of [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] and Brian Orosco of San Francisco, California were both chosen to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 20th tournament; both are [[Parkour|free runners]]. They competed alongside surprise guest Brett Sims, who was given the opportunity to return by G4. Sims failed the First Stage's Warped Wall, while Orosco failed the Flying Chute. Meeuwenberg, however, made it to the Third Stage before he ultimately failed the Shin-Cliffhanger. In that tournament, he was the last man standing.\n\nThe third contest by G4 wrapped up in August 2008 and aired as part of G4's ''Ninjafest 3'' on November 12, 2008. Viewers voted for their favorite competitors, the top three of whom would be flown to Japan to compete in ''Sasuke''{{'s}} 21st tournament. The winners were Brian Orosco (who qualified with a different video), gymnast Mark Witmer of [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], and free runner/stuntwoman Luci Romberg&nbsp;\u2013 the first woman to qualify&nbsp;\u2013 of [[Valley Village, California]]. They joined ''American Ninja Challenge'' 2 winner Levi Meeuwenberg and both hosts from ''[[Attack of the Show!]]'', [[Olivia Munn]] and [[Kevin Pereira]], to compete in ''Sasuke'' 21. In that tournament, Munn failed the Sextuple Step, while Pereira's run ended after his feet hit the water on the Log Grip; on the TBS broadcast, Munn's run was shown only in part while Pereira's run was cut completely. Romberg failed the Halfpipe Attack, while Witmer failed the Log Grip due to a severe [[ulnar nerve]] injury that he suffered while warming up. Orosco completed the First Stage with just 0.6 seconds left on the clock but failed the Second Stage's Salmon Ladder. Meeuwenberg cleared Stage 1 with the fastest time, with 21.5 seconds remaining, but similarly failed the Salmon Ladder.\n\nThe fourth contest by G4 wrapped up in March 2009 and aired on June 21, 2009 on G4 as part of ''Ninjafest 4''. The competitors' videos were judged by ''Attack of the Show''{{'s}} Olivia Munn. The winner, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], was joined by Munn and previous competitors Levi Meeuwenberg and Luci Romberg. Munn failed the new Circle Hammer in the First Stage; Romberg failed the First Stage's Jumping Spider; Campbell timed out on the final First Stage obstacle, the Rope Ladder, and later told the sideline reporter that he \"underestimated the cardio\" involved in the course. Meeuwenberg failed a new First Stage obstacle, the Slider Jump.\n\nIn the summer of 2017 [[Jessie Graff]] went on to compete in ''Sasuke'' 34, wearing number #87. She made an impressive mark becoming the second woman in the show's history to clear Stage 1. She also kept the streak going when she became the first woman ever to clear Stage 2. During her Stage 3 run she showed great upper body strength on the course, getting through the first three obstacles, she made it to the Ultra Crazy Cliffhanger when she failed the jump from the first ledge to the second ledge.\n\n==Results==\n{{main|List of Sasuke competitions}}\nThe following is a list of available information of people who achieved the best results in each competition and also the number of competitors who failed in the lower stages. Under each competition, the results are listed in order of best performance. Their names are listed along with their number (1\u2013100) from the competition, and the stage/obstacle they failed to complete (or Total Victory). In the 10th competition the number system ran from 901 to 1000 to indicate that 1000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and then ran from 1901 to 2000 in the 20th competition to indicate that 2000 competitors had attempted the First Stage, and from 2901 to 3000 during the 30th competition to indicate roughly 3000 attempts on ''Sasuke''. All air dates are of the Japanese broadcast on TBS.\n\n=== ''Sasuke'' 1 ===\n{{See also|List of Sasuke competitions#1st competition}}\nAired: September 27, 1997\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible

The object is to hit the [[buzzer]] at the end of the course before the allotted time expires. If a competitor goes out of bounds or comes into contact with the water in any of the pits below the course, he or she is disqualified from the competition.\n\nTypically, 85 to 90 of the 100 original entrants are eliminated in this stage. However, in the 4th competition, a record 37 of the original 100 competitors made it past the First Stage. After the 4th, 17th, 24th, and 27th competition, the First Stage was thoroughly redesigned to be much more difficult and prevent large numbers of people from moving on. In fact, a G4 special inside the making of the 18th ''Sasuke'' competition revealed that the redesign of the First Stage for the 18th competition was done with the intention of seeing all 100 challengers fail it. This did not happen, however, and that has only spurred the production team on to make this and all stages to follow even harder.\n\nThat goal was almost met in the 19th competition, where much to everyone's surprise, only two competitors cleared the First Stage (neither of the two being ''Sasuke'' All-Stars), a record in ''Sasuke'' history. (The only time something similar has happened was in the first ''Kunoichi'', where again, only two competitors cleared the First Stage.) Executive producer Ushio Higuchi said in interviews later that even he was surprised at the results, anticipating that around 10 to 12 people would survive in spite of the production team's attempts at making the First Stage unbeatable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} Although the names of the obstacles were different from the second tournament, the obstacles were still the same.\n\n{{note|2|2}} TBS officially considers that they are two different obstacles as their two names \"{{lang|ja|\u30d5\u30ea\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30df\u30f3\u30b0}}\"(Free Climbing) and \"{{lang|ja|\ufffd?\u767b\u308a}}\"(Wall Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. However, ''Ninja Warrior'' has referred to the Free Climbing/Wall Climb combination as the \"Mountain Climb\" in subtitles.\n\n{{note|3|3}} This Hill Climb is completely different from the one that would later be replaced with the Warped Wall after the 4th competition.\n\n{{note|4|4}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Prism See-Saw\" is called the \"Prism Tilt\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Prism See-Saw.\"\n\n{{note|5|5}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Cross Bridge\" is called the \"Bridge of Blades\" in subtitles. The Japanese announcer calls it the \"Cross Bridge.\"\n\n{{note|6|6}} Although referred to as the Jump Hang, the obstacle in the 13th competition consisted of many ropes hanging vertically, completely different from the rope net used in all other competitions. Some call it the \"Rope Hang,\" but that name is erroneous.\n\n{{note|7|7}} The Rope Ladder's name and obstacle symbol was not shown in ''Ninja Warrior's'' obstacle chart in the 18th due to lack of room for TV screening. However, in the 19th they had the Rope Ladder and NOT the Tarzan Rope. The Japanese announcer still calls the last two obstacles by their official names.\n\n{{note|8|8}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Double Pendulum\" is called the \"Tic Toc\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|9|9}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', The X-Bridge is called the ''Bridge of Blades'' in subtitles just like the Cross Bridge.\n\n{{note|10|10}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Rolling Escargot\" is called the \"Rolling Snail\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|12|12}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"Tackle\" is called the \"Triple Tackle\" in the UK English dub.\n\n{{note|13|13}} On ''Ninja Warrior'', the \"TIE Fighter\" is called the \"Prop Slider\" in the UK English dub due to not having the rights from [[Lucasfilm Ltd.|Lucasfilm]] to use the name associated with the Star Wars fighter after which the obstacle was named.\n\n===Stage 2===\nThose with enough skill to complete Stage One then take on an even more grueling set of obstacles in Stage Two. 283 competitors have reached the Second Stage. Like Stage One, the obstacles alter throughout the competitions, but all hold to the same principle: if the competitor makes a single mistake they fall into the water below. The obstacles determine the time limit, and it is usually between 50 and 100 seconds.\n\nUnlike the First Stage, which has always required the competitors to hit a buzzer at the end of the course to stop the clock and pass the course, the Second Stage did not have a buzzer at its end until the 8th competition. Before then, the competitors simply walked through an open gate to stop the clock.  From the 8th competition onward, the buzzer opens the gate. If the competitor breaks the gate open without hitting the button, they are disqualified. In addition, the course judges can hold the gates closed if a competitor committed a foul earlier in the Second Stage that would result in their disqualification, such as using the Chain Reaction gloves on the Spider Walk as \"Mr. ''Sasuke''\" Katsumi Yamada had done in the 12th competition.\n\nOn average, 10 to 15 competitors attempt the Second Stage on each competition. A record 37 competitors attempted the Second Stage during the 4th competition. Also during the 4th competition, a record 11 competitors cleared the Second Stage. During the 5th competition, however, only three men made it to the Second Stage due to new, tougher obstacles in the First Stage. In the 19th competition, neither of the two qualified competitors cleared the circuit (a fall and a timeout on the Salmon Ladder), marking the earliest end of a ''Sasuke'' competition.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

\u2014 This obstacle is an immediate successor to the previous obstacle, without any way to recuperate between them.\n\n<div class=\"references-small;\">\n{{note|1|1}} The Moving Walls and Spider Climb are actually included in the Spider Walk, but TBS officially considers that they are three different areas as their three names \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30af}}\" (Spider Walk), \"{{lang|ja|\u52d5\u304f\u58c1}}\" (Moving Walls) and \"{{lang|ja|\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0}}\" (Spider Climb) are separately shown on the screen in the Japanese version (''Sasuke'' #1) and also in the Sasuke Mania Official Site. ''Ninja Warrior'' just sees them as a single obstacle and calls it \"Spider Walk\".\n\n{{note|2|2}} The onscreen Japanese graphics \"{{lang|ja|\u4e94\u9023\u30cf\u30f3\u30de\u30fc}}\" reveal this obstacle's official name as \"Five Continuous Hammers\". On ''Ninja Warrior'', this obstacle is referred to as the Hammer Dodge.\n\n{{note|3|3}} In those competitions there are two \"Moving Walls\" in the Spider Walk, but TBS does not officially call them independent obstacles, and just considered the whole Spider Walk as one obstacle only.\n\n{{note|4|4}} After the 27th tournament, there was one bridge (with four chains) instead of two.\n\n{{note|5|5}} The Rolling Log appeared in SASUKE 37 as the original first obstacle of Stage 2, but due to rain, it did not function correctly. The judges decided to start Stage 2 at the Salmon Ladder Ascent with a lowered time limit of 100 seconds.\n\n</div>\n\n===Third Stage===\nThe Third Stage has no time limit, allowing contestants to go at their own pace. Contestants are allowed a few seconds of rest between obstacles during which they can apply \"sticky spray\" to improve their grip. While the first two stages focus on speed and agility, this course almost exclusively tests one's upper body strength and stamina.\n\nOut of 3,000 total competitors and 283 Second Stage competitors, 139 have attempted the Third Stage. The Third Stage is so grueling that, on average, someone passes it only every other competition. Only 22 individuals have ever passed it, and only six have passed it more than once, namely Akira Omori, Shingo Yamamoto, Makoto Nagano, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, and Yusuke Morimoto.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each of these share a single, common goal: to scale the tower and reach the button at the top before time expires. If the competitor does not reach the top platform in time, the rope is cut and the competitor falls (they are caught by a safety line). Starting from the 18th competition, the rope is no longer cut. Reaching the top is referred to as ''kanzenseiha'' ({{lang|ja|\u5b8c\u5168\u5236\u8987}}), translated roughly as \"complete domination\", and rendered on ''Ninja Warrior'' as \"total victory\". The Final Stage's time limit is between 30 and 45 seconds.\n\nOf all the competitors to attempt to claim victory, only 24 have been admitted to the Final Stage, and only six of them have gotten there more than once (Akira Omori in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd competitions, Shingo Yamamoto in the 3rd and 7th, Makoto Nagano in the 11th, 12th, 13th, his victory in the 17th competition and in the 23rd competition, Yuuji Urushihara in the 22nd and his victories in the 24th competition and 27th, Ryo Matachi in the 27th competition and 30th, Yusuke Morimoto's victory in the 31st competition and in the 35th competition). Currently there are only four victors: Kazuhiko Akiyama defeated ''Sasuke'' in the 4th competition, Makoto Nagano in the 17th, Yuuji Urushihara in the 24th and in the 27th, and Yusuke Morimoto in the 31st.\n\nThe original Final Stage consisted of climbing a 15-meter (49&nbsp;ft) rope. The contestant must start climbing from a seated position.\n\nThe second version of the Final Stage was unveiled in the 7th competition, when Shingo Yamamoto became the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was increased to {{convert|22.5|m|ft}}.  It consists of a {{convert|12.5|m|ft}} Spider Climb followed by a {{convert|10|m|ft}} Rope Climb.  After 15 seconds, the walls of the Spider Climb spread apart. This ensnared [[Yordan Yovtchev]] during the 8th competition, when he failed to complete the Spider Climb before it began spreading, and fell off the tower.\n\nThe third version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 22nd competition, when Yuuji Urushihara was the first to try it. The height of the tower remained mostly the same as the second version of the Final Stage, but two new obstacles were used: a {{convert|13|m|ft|adj=on}} \"Heavenly Ladder\" and a {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} \"G Rope.\" The time limit was increased to 45 seconds, then reduced to 40 seconds in the 23rd competition. Competitors are not dropped due to the Heavenly Ladder being in the way.\n\nThe fourth version of the Final Stage was revealed in the 27th competition, when Ryo Matachi was the first to attempt it. The height of the tower was reduced to 20 meters and consisted of a 20-meter (66&nbsp;ft) Rope Climb similar to the first version of the Final Stage, but with a 5-meter height difference. The time limit stayed at 40 seconds. Unlike the first version of the Final Stage, competitors started at a standing position instead of a seated position.\n\nThe fifth version of the Final Stage was briefly seen in Stage 3 and in a trailer of ''Sasuke Rising''. Its design was similar to that of the fourth version of the Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb. Unlike its predecessor, this version is 4&nbsp;m taller, and the competitors would have likely climbed up the rope in a seated position. The time limit would have likely been 35 seconds, as Urushihara may have cleared this particular version with one second left. It was used for only one tournament.\n\nFor the sixth version, with the removal of the previous version of the Final Stage, it was not unusual to see a change similar to that of the 18\u201324 version from the Metal Ladder to the Heavenly Ladder. The previous Final Stage consisting of a Rope Climb was thrown out all together and the return of the 7\u201317 Final Stage took its place. The Spider Walls seem to take up less space this time, and the Rope Climb appears to take up more. Nevertheless, the height of the tower has once again increased, this time to 24&nbsp;m. The Spider Climb (\u30b9\u30d1\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30e9\u30a4\u30e0) appears to be the same as its predecessor, at 12.5&nbsp;m, while the Rope Climb (\u7db1\u767b\u308a) was slightly modified in length at 11.5&nbsp;m from that of its original predecessor, at 10&nbsp;m. The time limit is likely to stay the same at 30 seconds, though a 35-second Final Stage is not out of the question.\n\nThe prize for completing the Final Stage was [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]2,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|2000000|JPN}}). The prize has now increased to [[Japanese yen|\u00a5]]4,000,000 (about [[United States dollar|US$]]{{toUSD|4000000|JPN}}) since the completion of the 17th tournament. In the 24th tournament a [[Nissan Fuga]] was also a prize if anyone could complete the Final Stage.\n\nTypically, only one or two people make it to the Final Stage, if any make it at all. However, both the 3rd and 24th competitions saw a record five competitors attempt the Final Stage. After the 4th competition, though, the Final Stage was only achieved on average every other tournament.\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n|-\n!

Each episode now lasts thirty minutes and it also includes some minor changes in the on-screen graphics. Throughout the episode, there's the \"Ninja Killer\" (for the obstacle that took out the most competitors) and \"Warrior Wipeout\" (honors the best wipeout) segments. The Japanese [[play-by-play]] commentary and interviews with the competitors have English [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]], while the competitor profiles, [[Instant replay|replays]], and introductions were [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by [[voice actor]] [[Dave Wittenberg]].\n\nThe show became the highest rated program on the network since its debut. Aside from a few sporadic occurrences, reruns of ''Ninja Warrior'' stopped airing regularly sometime in December 2012 in wake of G4 slated to be rebranded as the [[Esquire Network]] on September 23, 2013. The last four episodes to air on G4 appeared as a two-hour block on April 10, 2013. It is unknown if ''Ninja Warrior'' would return to the network's schedule or if some other channel would acquire the series. Commercials on G4 show ''American Ninja Warrior'' to air on G4 in July, marking it the last program being advertised on the network as a G4 program, and not an Esquire channel presentation.\n\nAs of August 3, 2016, an article released by ''USA Today'' says that \"Esquire has obtained rights to 27 Ninja Warrior tournaments...along with all eight Kunoichi spinoff contests that feature only women contestants.\" and that they \"...will return as a 63 hour Labor Day weekend marathon (Sept. 3, 7 a.m. ET/PT) in Japanese, with English subtitles.\" Whether this is referring to the original broadcasts or the G4 broadcasts is unknown right now due to little notice, but it seems to lean toward the G4 broadcasts. They also stated that \"Additional newer tournaments of the series, never seen in the U.S., will debut next year.\" As of 2019, new episodes have not been shown on U.S. airwaves, and the 27th competition remains the most recent one to be aired in America.\n\n====''American Ninja Warrior''====\n\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior}}\nThe popularity of the ''American Ninja Challenge'' has led G4 to produce a version of the series featuring American contestants called ''American Ninja Warrior'', which is produced by Pilgrim Films and Television, Inc and is currently hosted by [[Akbar Gbaja-Biamila]] and [[Matt Iseman]]. Auditions on G4's website ended on August 18, 2009. Open tryouts were held in Los Angeles on August 29 and 30, 2009, and were taped for the show, with ten finalists competing on the 23rd tournament of the original Ninja Warrior course in Japan in September 2009. The eight-episode series began airing on December 12, 2009.\n\nThe qualifying round consists of over 300 competitors, running an obstacle course strongly influenced by ''Sasuke''{{'s}} First Stage. The course consists of the Quintuple Step, a Rope Swing, the Jumping Spider, a modified version of the Pipe Slider, and a much smaller Warped Wall. The preliminaries used a leader board, and the 30 fastest times moved on to the semi-finals, which included the preliminary course plus three obstacles, the Tarzan Jump, the Jumping Bars, and a Net Climb.\n\n''American Ninja Warrior'' aired only the American finalists during the ''Sasuke'' obstacle course. The Japanese competitors were later aired on April 10, 2010.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 2)|second season]] was cast on G4's website as of April 10, 2010 and aired in hour long specials starting December 8, 2010. The top 10 contestants would participate in ''Sasuke'' 26. Three episodes were run for the first two weeks. The first three episodes covered the opening round of the competition; the fourth covered the semifinals.  This was followed by four days of a \"boot camp\" where the fifteen winners of the semifinals were divided into three five-man teams and put through several different Pressure Challenges, with the losing team having to complete a punishment while the other two teams got extra training time on models of some of the ''Sasuke'' obstacles (The Warped Wall, Double Salmon Ladder, Balance Tank, and Circle Slider).  The teams would then run through a grouping of the obstacles with some sort of hindrance (usually carrying something heavy between obstacles). The teams with the worst time would be forced to send two members to an elimination challenge, with the losing person forced to leave.\n\nAfter boot camp, the ten final winners traveled to the ''Sasuke'' course to compete. Once again, only the American competitors were aired during the special, with the rest of the ''Sasuke'' competition to air later. The most successful of the American competitors in the past, Levi Meeuwenberg, withdrew from the competition due to a fractured wrist, giving his spot to Adam LaPlante. Five members failed in the First Stage: Patrick Cusic and former ''[[American Gladiators (1989 TV series)|American Gladiators]]'' champion and gladiator [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]] both fell from the new Rolling Escargot obstacle, LaPlante fell on the Halfpipe Attack and Adam Truesdell fell from the Giant Swing, a new variation of the Jump Hang, the only one out of all 100 competitors to do so in the whole tournament. In addition, veteran Shane Daniels once again timed out on the Cargo Net. In the Second Stage, four of the remaining five cleared, while Travis Furlanic fell on the Balance Tank, an obstacle he struggled on during boot camp. In the Third Stage, Paul Kasemir failed the Doorknob Grasper. Brent Steffensen made it to the Ultimate Cliffhanger before falling into the water. [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]], despite having the fastest times of all the competitors to compete (finishing the Second Stage with over 24 seconds left) failed at the Ultimate Cliffhanger as well. Brian Orosco fell at the very first obstacle, the Roulette Cylinder, which he had passed easily in the previous competition. While the $250,000 prize went unclaimed, ''Sasuke'' 26 was the start of a successful showing by a collection of American competitors.\n\nThe [[American Ninja Warrior (season 3)|third season of ''American Ninja Warrior'']] debuted on July 31 on G4, again with 300 competitors at the tryouts in Venice Beach. While many top competitors were absent including Levi Meeuwenberg, Rich King and Luci Romberg, a talented crop of new competitors took their place including Denver Broncos wide receiver Matt Willis, who finished the course but did not qualify for boot camp. Other notable competitors who failed to advance to boot camp included two-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Shane Daniels, season two veterans [[Evan Dollard|Evan \"Rocket\" Dollard]], Adam Truesdell, Adam LaPlante and Patrick Cusic, top first round qualifiers from the previous season Trevor Vaughn and David Money, and former world freerunning champion Tim Shieff. In addition, professional freerunner and ''[[Survivor: China]]'' competitor Michael \"Frosti\" Zernow ranked in the top fifteen and was invited to boot camp, but injured himself and was replaced with fellow ''Jump City: Seattle'' competitor Jake Smith. Other competitors from ''Jump City'' who advanced to boot camp also included Brian Orasco, Drew Dreschel and David \"Young Flip\" Rodriguez. The level of competition in boot camp was noticeably higher in the third season, as competitors were only given one attempt at each obstacle in challenges, leading to a large increase in time penalties. Promising competitors Dustin Rocho, Brandon Douglass, Alan {{Not a typo|Connealy}}, second-seeded qualifier Chris Wilczewski and five-time ''Sasuke'' veteran Brian Orosco all saw their ''Sasuke'' dreams come to an end at boot camp.\n\nOf the ten who advanced to ''Sasuke'', nine easily cleared the First Stage. The only exception was Dreschel, who injured his knee landing on the Halfpipe Attack, and despite a valiant attempt at the Warped Wall, was unable to put any weight on his leg and stated on his Facebook that he will not be available for ''Sasuke'' 28. The high hopes of the remaining nine took a major hit in the Second Stage, as five more were eliminated including Rodriguez on the Slider Drop, Smith on the Double Salmon Ladder, and newcomer Travis Rosen and veterans Travis Furlanic and Brent Steffensen on the Metal Spin. The remaining four competitors made it to the Third Stage only to be outdone by the Ultimate Cliffhanger. Ryan Stratis failed to make the fourth ledge while James McGrath and fan favorite Paul Kasemir failed the transition to the fifth ledge. The last competitor, [[David Campbell (Ninja Warrior)|David Campbell]] almost made it through the entire obstacle but on the final ledge his grip gave out. Even though no one earned a $500,000 [[K-Swiss]] Endorsement Deal, the competitors at ''Sasuke'' 27 were by far the strongest group of Americans to date. The final episode of the third season aired on NBC on August 29, 2011 as a two-hour special in prime-time.\n\nA [[American Ninja Warrior (season 4)|fourth season]] of the program began airing on May 20, 2012 and the show aired on both G4 and NBC for the Regionals and the Championship with the grand prize of $500,000 and the coveted ''American Ninja Warrior'' title. The entire format was changed as well&nbsp;\u2013 regional qualifiers in different parts of the country were aired and the Mt. Midoriyama course was recreated just off the Las Vegas Strip for the national finals. The regional qualifiers would narrow its selections down to 30 contestants who finished its qualifying course in the fastest time as well as the contestants who finished the furthest the fastest. Qualifying obstacles would include common Stage 1 obstacles such as the Quintuple Steps and the Warped Wall, but its contents would change from city to city. The 30 contestants were then cut in half in the regional finals where the course would extend to include common Stage 2 and Stage 3 obstacles such as the Salmon Ladder, Cliffhanger and Body Prop. The 90 contestants who qualified (including wild cards) earned tickets to Las Vegas to challenge Mt. Midoriyama.\n\nThe show returned for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 5)|fifth season]] on July 1, 2013 in the same format. This season, if a contestant were to finish the course, that player would be guaranteed a spot in the next round. The show returned once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 6)|sixth season]] on May 25, 2014 on both NBC and [[Esquire Network]] with the same rules as in previous seasons. NBC has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 7)|seventh season]] in 2015 with the grand prize now doubled to $1,000,000. So far, it has produced, among other things, the endorsement of Makoto Nagano, the first American to complete the Ultimate Cliffhanger (Brent Steffensen in 2012), the first woman to complete the Salmon Ladder (Kacy Catanzaro in 2014), the first woman to complete the Jumping Spider (Meagan Martin, also in 2014), the first two Americans to achieve Total Victory (Isaac Caldiero and Geoff Britten on the same night in 2015) and the first female to complete Stage 1 of Mt. Midoriyama in Las Vegas (Jessie Graff in 2016, who also became the first female to complete Stage 2 of the original Mt. Midoriyama in 2017 during ''Sasuke'' 34.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sirsvk1OSg Jessie Graff \u2013 ''Sasuke'' 34 Stage 2] YouTube</ref>) The network has renewed the show once again for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 8)|eighth season]] in 2016 with new qualifying cities including [[Los Angeles]] and [[Oklahoma City]]. The network has renewed the show for its [[American Ninja Warrior (season 9)|ninth season]] in 2017 with three new cities: [[San Antonio]], [[Daytona Beach]], and [[Cleveland]]. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 10)|tenth season]] of the show began airing on May 30, 2018 with returning cities and a $10,000 bonus for finishing the Mega Warped Wall. The [[American Ninja Warrior (season 11)|eleventh season]] began airing on May 29, 2019 with two new cities ([[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Cincinnati]]), a chance to go directly to Las Vegas with the Speed Pass in the Power Tower duel between the two fastest players, and a new co-host, [[Zuri Hall]]. In addition, Drew Drechsel became the third person to achieve Total Victory at the end of the season.\n\n=====''USA vs Japan''=====\n{{hatnote|Full details in the [[American Ninja Warrior#USA vs Japan|American Ninja Warrior]] article}}\n\nIn 2014, the first ''Sasuke''-based team competition was started, pitting five ''Sasuke'' All-Stars and New Stars representing Japan against five ''American Ninja Warrior'' stars representing the United States in what was dubbed by some as the inaugural ''Sasuke''/''Ninja Warrior'' world championship. The first meeting took place at the Mt. Midoriyama reconstruction in Las Vegas and was first broadcast in America on January 13, 2014 on NBC, with a second meeting already scheduled for the original Mt. Midoriyama in [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba-ku]] in 2015.\n\nAt the first match in Las Vegas, Team Japan was composed of Shingo Yamamoto, Yuuji Urushihara, Ryo Matachi, Hitoshi Kanno and Kazuma Asa from ''Sasuke'', while Team USA was composed of Brent Steffensen, Paul Kasemir, James McGrath, Travis Rosen and Brian Arnold from ''American Ninja Warrior''. The match was composed of four rounds&nbsp;\u2013 one on each stage, with each round being a best-of-five of one-on-one races and each competitor running once per stage until the stage outcome was decided. Stage 1 was worth one point, Stage 2 worth two points and Stage 3 worth three, with the tiebreaker being the Final Stage tower. Despite the Japanese boasting superior experience and pedigrees (no Team USA member had completed Stage 3, either in Yokohama or Las Vegas), the Americans pulled off a stunning 6\u20130 win that included only one Japanese one-on-one race win (Matachi against Arnold on Stage 3.)\n\n=====''American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja''=====\n{{main|American Ninja Warrior: Ninja vs. Ninja}}\n\nWith the success of ''American Ninja Warrior'', Esquire Network announced a spin-off to the series called ''Team Ninja Warrior'' on October 9, 2015.

In the fourth UK series, aired in 2011, Jim North took over as the voice-over.
