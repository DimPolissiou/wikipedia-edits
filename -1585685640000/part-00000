In subsequent years, he won two [[classic cycle races|monument races]]: in 1985, at 23, he won the storm ridden [[1985 Tour of Flanders|edition of the Tour of Flanders]], and in 1987 he won [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]]. In the Tour de France, his participation in the 1985 edition was a strong one, beating the later winner [[Bernard Hinault]] in a time trial stage. The following year, he won the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|green jersey]].\n\nAfter 1988, his career went in decline and, despite his talent, he failed to win major races. He certainly had considerable talent as a time trial racer, but as a climber in the mountains his talent was limited. Perhaps, he was partly a victim of the high expectations the Belgian public had to get a successor for [[Eddy Merckx]], a cyclist who was very versatile in winning both classic races and big stage races.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nAfter his active career, Vanderaerden has led a few semi-professional racing teams and was also assistant-manager of a professional Belgo-Italian team. He became a [[directeur sportif]] with the [[DFL-Cyclingnews-Litespeed]] team in August 2006.<ref>{{cite

racing|road cyclist]] from the town of [[Lummen]], [[Belgium]].\n\nHe was a considerable talent, winning the prologue time trial of both the [[Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]] and the [[Tour de France]] in his professional debut year 1983. In subsequent years, he won two [[classic cycle races|monument races]]: in 1985, at 23, he won the storm ridden [[1985 Tour of Flanders|edition of the Tour of Flanders]], and in 1987 he won [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]]. In the Tour de France, his participation in the 1985 edition was a strong one, beating the later winner [[Bernard Hinault]] in a time trial stage. The following year, he won the [[Points classification in the Tour de France|green jersey]].\n\nAfter 1988, his career went in decline and, despite his talent, he failed to win major races. He certainly had considerable talent as a time trial racer, but as a climber in the mountains his talent was limited. Perhaps, he was partly a victim of the high expectations the Belgian public had to get a successor for [[Eddy Merckx]], a cyclist who was very versatile in winning both classic races and big stage races.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}\n\nAfter his active career, Vanderaerden has led a few semi-professional racing teams and was also assistant-manager of a professional Belgo-Italian team.

Depending on this differentiation, tumour cells may resemble mature fibroblasts (spindle-shaped), secreting [[collagen]], with rare mitoses. These cells are arranged in short fascicles which split and merge, giving the appearance of \"fish bone\" known as a herringbone pattern.

Many groups among the indigenous were nomads and explored the Cerrado by hunting and collecting. Others practiced coivara agriculture, an itinerant type of slash-and-burn agriculture. The mixing of indigenous, quilombola maroon communities, extractivists, geraizeiros (living in the drier regions), riverbank dwellers and vazanteiros (who live on floodplains) shaped a diverse local population that relies heavily on the resources of their environment.<ref>http://www.ispn.org.br/english/peoples-of-the-cerrado/brazilian-mix/</ref>\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities in the Cerrado were very limited, directed mainly at the extensive production of [[beef cattle]] for subsistence of the local market,<ref name=ratter /> since cerrado soils are naturally infertile for agricultural production. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to [[Bras\u00edlia]] has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region. From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental programs have been launched with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region, through subsidies for agriculture.<ref name=jenson /> As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production.\n\nOn the other hand, the urban pressure and the rapid establishment of agricultural activities in the region have been rapidly reducing the biodiversity of the ecosystems, and the population in the Cerrado region more than doubled from 1970 to 2010, going from 35.8 million to 76 million.<ref>Development for Sustainable Agriculture: The Brazilian Cerrado https://books.google.ca/books?id=HVzeCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=cerrado+population&source=bl&ots=sIxHN3fc3U&sig=uji_f4hIzqhUQERvaC9Ccu_X5iA&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=cerrado%20population&f=false</ref>\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nThe Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, [[Embrapa]], discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tons of lime per hectare. This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area. Researchers also developed tropical varieties of [[soybean]]s, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main [[soybean|soyabeans]] exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.<ref>The Economist.

When land is being cleared to make more land for agriculture, the tree's trunks and roots are often used in the production of charcoal, helping to make money for the clearing. The Brazilian steel industry has traditionally always used the trunks and roots from the Cerrado for charcoal but now that the steel mills in the state of [[Minas Gerais]] are the world's largest, it has taken a much higher toll on the Cerrado.<ref name=herringer /> However, recently because of the conservation efforts and the diminishing vegetation in the Cerrado, they now are receiving some charcoal from the [[eucalyptus]] plantations and these efforts are growing.<ref name=herringer />\n\n==Rivers==\nThe Cerrado biome is strategic for the water resources of Brazil.  The biome contains the headwaters and the largest portion of South American watersheds (the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay, Araguaia-Tocantins, and S\u00e3o Francisco river basins) and the upper catchments of large Amazon tributaries, such as the Xingu and Tapaj\u00f3s.

Many groups among the indigenous were nomads and explored the Cerrado by hunting and collecting. Others practiced coivara agriculture, an itinerant type of slash-and-burn agriculture. The mixing of indigenous, quilombola maroon communities, extractivists, geraizeiros (living in the drier regions), riverbank dwellers and vazanteiros (who live on floodplains) shaped a diverse local population that relies heavily on the resources of their environment.<ref>http://www.ispn.org.br/english/peoples-of-the-cerrado/brazilian-mix/</ref>\n\nUntil the mid-1960s, [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities in the Cerrado were very limited, directed mainly at the extensive production of [[beef cattle]] for subsistence of the local market,<ref name=ratter /> since cerrado soils are naturally infertile for agricultural production. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to [[Bras\u00edlia]] has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region. From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental programs have been launched with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region, through subsidies for agriculture.<ref name=jenson /> As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production.\n\nOn the other hand, the urban pressure and the rapid establishment of agricultural activities in the region have been rapidly reducing the biodiversity of the ecosystems, and the population in the Cerrado region more than doubled from 1970 to 2010, going from 35.8 million to 76 million.<ref>Development for Sustainable Agriculture: The Brazilian Cerrado https://books.google.ca/books?id=HVzeCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA100&lpg=PA100&dq=cerrado+population&source=bl&ots=sIxHN3fc3U&sig=uji_f4hIzqhUQERvaC9Ccu_X5iA&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=cerrado%20population&f=false</ref>\n\n==Agriculture==\n\nThe Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, [[Embrapa]], discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tons of lime per hectare. This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area. Researchers also developed tropical varieties of [[soybean]]s, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main [[soybean|soyabeans]] exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.<ref>The Economist.

When land is being cleared to make more land for agriculture, the tree's trunks and roots are often used in the production of charcoal, helping to make money for the clearing. The Brazilian steel industry has traditionally always used the trunks and roots from the Cerrado for charcoal but now that the steel mills in the state of [[Minas Gerais]] are the world's largest, it has taken a much higher toll on the Cerrado.<ref name=herringer /> However, recently because of the conservation efforts and the diminishing vegetation in the Cerrado, they now are receiving some charcoal from the [[eucalyptus]] plantations and these efforts are growing.<ref name=herringer />\n\n==Rivers==\nThe Cerrado biome is strategic for the water resources of Brazil.  The biome contains the headwaters and the largest portion of South American watersheds (the Paran\u00e1-Paraguay, Araguaia-Tocantins, and S\u00e3o Francisco river basins) and the upper catchments of large Amazon tributaries, such as the Xingu and Tapaj\u00f3s.
