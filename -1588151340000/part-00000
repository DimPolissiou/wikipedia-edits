Some have proposed that individuals on the autism spectrum may be better represented as a single diagnostic category. Within this category, the DSM-5 has proposed a framework of differentiating each individual by dimensions of severity, as well as associated features (i.e., known genetic disorders, and intellectual disability).\n\nAnother change to the DSM includes collapsing social and communication deficits into one domain. Thus, an individual with an ASD diagnosis will be described in terms of severity of social communication symptoms, severity of fixated or restricted behaviors or interests, hyper- or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli, and associated features.

In order to be diagnosed with ASD, a child must have at least two of the following behaviors:<ref name=\"DSM5\" /><ref name=\"Lancet2018\" />\n\n*Stereotyped behaviors\u2013 Most children with autism perform repetitive behaviors such as rocking, hand flapping, finger flicking, head banging, or repeating phrases or sounds.<ref name=\":6\" /> These behaviors may occur constantly or only when the child gets stressed, anxious or upset.\n*Resistance to change\u2013 Children with autism spectrum also tend to have routines and rituals that they must follow, like eating certain foods in a specific order, or taking the same path to school every day.<ref name=\":6\" /> The child may have a meltdown if there is any change or disruption to his routine.\n*Restricted interests\u2013 Children may become excessively interested in a particular thing or topic, and devote all their attention to it. For example, young children might completely focus on things that spin and ignore everything else. Older children might try to learn everything about a single topic, such as the weather or sports, and talk about it constantly.<ref name=\":6\" />\n*Oversensitivity\u2013 Many people with autism are overly sensitive to loud sounds, bright lights, strong smells, or being touched.\n\n==== Self-injury ====\nFollowing are theories about the cause of self-injurious behavior in autistic individuals:<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n* Frequency and/or continuation of self-injurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors e.g. reward in return for halting self-injurious behavior. However this theory is not applicable to younger children with autism. There is some evidence that frequency of self-injurious behavior can be reduced by removing or modifying environmental factors that reinforce this behavior.\n* Higher rates of self-injury are also noted in social isolated individuals with autism\n* Self-injury could be a response to modulate pain perception when chronic pain or other health problems that cause pain are present\n* An abnormal basal ganglia connectivity may predispose to self-injurious behavior\n\n==Causes==\n{{Main|Causes of autism}}\nWhile specific causes of autism spectrum disorders have yet to be found, many risk factors identified in the research literature may contribute to their development. These risk factors include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors, neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors. It is possible to identify general risk factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific factors. Given the current state of knowledge, prediction can only be of a global nature and therefore requires the use of general markers.<ref name=\"Tager-Flusberg 2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tager-Flusberg H | title = The origins of social impairments in autism spectrum disorder: studies of infants at risk | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 23 | issue = 8\u20139 | pages = 1072\u20136 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20800990 | pmc = 2956843 | doi = 10.1016/j.neunet.2010.07.008 }}</ref>\n\n===Genetic risk factors===\nAs of 2018, understanding of genetic risk factors had shifted from a focus on a few alleles, to an understanding that genetic involvement in ASD is probably diffuse, depending on a large number of variants, some of which are common and have a small effect, and some of which are rare and have a large effect. The most common gene disrupted with large effect rare variants appeared to be ''[[CHD8]]'', but less than 0.5% of people with ASD have such a mutation.  Some ASD is associated with clearly genetic conditions, like [[fragile X syndrome]]; however only around 2% of people with ASD have fragile X.<ref name=Lancet2018/>\n\nCurrent research suggests that genes that increase susceptibility to ASD are ones that control protein synthesis in neuronal cells in response to cell needs, activity and adhesion of neuronal cells, and synapse formation and remodeling. Therefore despite up to 1000 different genes thought to contribute to increased risk of ASD, all of them eventually affect normal neural development and connectivity between different functional areas of the brain in a similar manner that is characteristic of an ASD brain (see Figure 2). Some of these genes are knows to modulate production of the GABA neurotransmitter which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. These GABA related genes are underexpressed in an ASD brain. On the other hand genes controlling expression of glial and immune cells in the brain e.g. astrocytes and microglia, respectively, are overexpressed which correlates with increased number of glial and immune cells found in postmortem ASD brains. Some genes under investigation in ASD pathophysiology are those that affect the [[mTOR]] signaling pathway which supports cell growth and survival.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jason A.|last2=Pe\u00f1agarikano|first2=Olga|last3=Belgard|first3=T.

One study has identified 64 SNVs and 5 indels de novo on average. By performing an analysis of these variants, comparing cases and controls, considering SNVs and indels in 179 genes associated with autism or close to them, studies observed that the relative risk of missense mutations or variants in promoter regions and UTR (untranslated region), increases versus controls.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe identification of SVs has been very useful too, since structural alterations in the chromosomes are able to rearrange the genome, altering its functionality, depending on the size and the region they affect.\n\nAfter the analysis, 98,785 SVs were identified, with an average of 5,843 variants per individual: 171 SVs were ''de novo'', more frequent in the germ line. Some of these variants affected genes associated with autism, such as the GRIN2B gene, balanced translocation, or the deletion of exons 8, 9, and 10 of the CHD2 gene.\n\nNo significant differences were observed regarding the size of certain rearrangements in cases and controls, though a slight increase in number was observed for cases relative to controls.\n\nAll these genetic variants contribute to the development of the autistic spectrum, however, it can not be guaranteed that they are determinants for the development.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Werling DM, Brand H, An JY, Stone MR, Zhu L, Glessner JT, Collins RL, Dong S, Layer RM, Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E, Farrell A, Schwartz GB, Wang HZ, Currall BB, Zhao X, Dea J, Duhn C, Erdman CA, Gilson MC, Yadav R, Handsaker RE, Kashin S, Klei L, Mandell JD, Nowakowski TJ, Liu Y, Pochareddy S, Smith L, Walker MF, Waterman MJ, He X, Kriegstein AR, Rubenstein JL, Sestan N, McCarroll SA, Neale BM, Coon H, Willsey AJ, Buxbaum JD, Daly MJ, State MW, Quinlan AR, Marth GT, Roeder K, Devlin B, Talkowski ME, Sanders SJ | display-authors = 6 | title = An analytical framework for whole-genome sequence association studies and its implications for autism spectrum disorder | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 727\u2013736 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29700473 | pmc = 5961723 | doi = 10.1038/s41588-018-0107-y }}</ref>\n\n===Prenatal and perinatal risk factors===\nSeveral prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism.

Connectivity between different regions of the brain ('long-range' connectivity) is important for integration and global processing of information and comparing incoming sensory information with the existing model of the world within the brain. Connections within each specialized regions ('short-range' connections) are important for processing individual details and modifying the existing model of the world within the brain to more closely reflect incoming sensory information. In infancy, children at high risk for autism that were later diagnosed with autism were observed to have abnormally high long-range connectivity which then decreased through childhood to eventual long-range ''under''connectivity by adulthood.<ref name=\":12\" />\n* Abnormal lateralization to the left hemisphere of the brain vs. lateralization to right hemisphere in neurotypical individuals. The left hemisphere is associated with processing information related to details whereas the right hemisphere is associated with processing information in a more global and integrated sense that is essential for pattern recognition. For example, visual information like face recognition is normally processed by the right hemisphere which tends to integrate all information from an incoming sensory signal, whereas an ASD brain preferentially processes visual information in the left hemisphere where information tends to be processed for local details of the face rather than the overall configuration of the face. This left lateralization negatively impacts both facial recognition and spatial skills.<ref name=\":12\" />\n* Increased functional connectivity within the left hemisphere which directly correlates with severity of autism.

Some have proposed that individuals on the autism spectrum may be better represented as a single diagnostic category. Within this category, the DSM-5 has proposed a framework of differentiating each individual by dimensions of severity, as well as associated features (i.e., known genetic disorders, and intellectual disability).\n\nAnother change to the DSM includes collapsing social and communication deficits into one domain. Thus, an individual with an ASD diagnosis will be described in terms of severity of social communication symptoms, severity of fixated or restricted behaviors or interests, hyper- or hyposensitivity to sensory stimuli, and associated features. The restricting of onset age has also been loosened from 3 years of age to \"early developmental period\", with a note that symptoms may manifest later when social demands exceed capabilities.<ref name=\"IACC\">{{cite web|title=DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria|url=https://iacc.hhs.gov/about-iacc/subcommittees/resources/dsm5-diagnostic-criteria.shtml#autism-spectrum-disorder|website=U.S. Department of Health & Human Services [[Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee]]|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nAutism forms the core of the autism spectrum disorders.

Similarly, they have trouble recognizing subtle expressions of emotion and identifying what various emotions mean for the conversation. They struggle with understanding the context and subtext of conversational or printed situations, and have trouble forming resulting conclusions about the content.

Some of these include behavioral characteristics which widely range from slow development of social and learning skills to difficulties creating connections with other people. They may develop these difficulties of creating connections due to anxiety or depression, which people with autism are more likely to experience, and as a result isolate themselves.<ref>{{cite web |title=Engaging people on the autism spectrum |date=7 October 2013 |publisher=Autism Spectrum Australia | url = https://www.autismspectrum.org.au/about-aspect/diversity-inclusion/engaging-people-on-the-autism-spectrum }}</ref> Other behavioral characteristics include abnormal responses to sensations including sights, sounds, touch, and smell, and problems keeping a consistent speech rhythm. The latter problem influences an individual's social skills, leading to potential problems in how they are understood by communication partners. Behavioral characteristics displayed by those with autism spectrum disorder typically influence development, language, and social competence. Behavioral characteristics of those with autism spectrum disorder can be observed as perceptual disturbances, disturbances of development rate, relating, speech and language, and motility.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Shaughnessy Hinerman |first1=Paige | name-list-format = vanc |title=Teaching Autistic Children to Communicate |date=1983 |publisher=Aspens System Corporation |location=Rockville, Maryland |isbn=978-0-89443-884-4 |page=180 }}</ref>\n\nThe second core symptom of Autism spectrum is a pattern of restricted and repetitive behaviors, activities, and interests. In order to be diagnosed with ASD, a child must have at least two of the following behaviors:<ref name=\"DSM5\" /><ref name=\"Lancet2018\" />\n\n*Stereotyped behaviors\u2013 Most children with autism perform repetitive behaviors such as rocking, hand flapping, finger flicking, head banging, or repeating phrases or sounds.<ref name=\":6\" /> These behaviors may occur constantly or only when the child gets stressed, anxious or upset.\n*Resistance to change\u2013 Children with autism spectrum also tend to have routines and rituals that they must follow, like eating certain foods in a specific order, or taking the same path to school every day.<ref name=\":6\" /> The child may have a meltdown if there is any change or disruption to his routine.\n*Restricted interests\u2013 Children may become excessively interested in a particular thing or topic, and devote all their attention to it. For example, young children might completely focus on things that spin and ignore everything else. Older children might try to learn everything about a single topic, such as the weather or sports, and talk about it constantly.<ref name=\":6\" />\n*Oversensitivity\u2013 Many people with autism are overly sensitive to loud sounds, bright lights, strong smells, or being touched.\n\n==== Self-injury ====\nFollowing are theories about the cause of self-injurious behavior in autistic individuals:<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n* Frequency and/or continuation of self-injurious behavior can be influenced by environmental factors e.g. reward in return for halting self-injurious behavior. However this theory is not applicable to younger children with autism. There is some evidence that frequency of self-injurious behavior can be reduced by removing or modifying environmental factors that reinforce this behavior.\n* Higher rates of self-injury are also noted in social isolated individuals with autism\n* Self-injury could be a response to modulate pain perception when chronic pain or other health problems that cause pain are present\n* An abnormal basal ganglia connectivity may predispose to self-injurious behavior\n\n==Causes==\n{{Main|Causes of autism}}\nWhile specific causes of autism spectrum disorders have yet to be found, many risk factors identified in the research literature may contribute to their development. These risk factors include genetics, prenatal and perinatal factors, neuroanatomical abnormalities, and environmental factors. It is possible to identify general risk factors, but much more difficult to pinpoint specific factors. Given the current state of knowledge, prediction can only be of a global nature and therefore requires the use of general markers.<ref name=\"Tager-Flusberg 2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Tager-Flusberg H | title = The origins of social impairments in autism spectrum disorder: studies of infants at risk | journal = Neural Networks | volume = 23 | issue = 8\u20139 | pages = 1072\u20136 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20800990 | pmc = 2956843 | doi = 10.1016/j.neunet.2010.07.008 }}</ref>\n\n===Genetic risk factors===\nAs of 2018, understanding of genetic risk factors had shifted from a focus on a few alleles, to an understanding that genetic involvement in ASD is probably diffuse, depending on a large number of variants, some of which are common and have a small effect, and some of which are rare and have a large effect. The most common gene disrupted with large effect rare variants appeared to be ''[[CHD8]]'', but less than 0.5% of people with ASD have such a mutation.  Some ASD is associated with clearly genetic conditions, like [[fragile X syndrome]]; however only around 2% of people with ASD have fragile X.<ref name=Lancet2018/>\n\nCurrent research suggests that genes that increase susceptibility to ASD are ones that control protein synthesis in neuronal cells in response to cell needs, activity and adhesion of neuronal cells, and synapse formation and remodeling. Therefore despite up to 1000 different genes thought to contribute to increased risk of ASD, all of them eventually affect normal neural development and connectivity between different functional areas of the brain in a similar manner that is characteristic of an ASD brain (see Figure 2). Some of these genes are knows to modulate production of the GABA neurotransmitter which is the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the nervous system. These GABA related genes are underexpressed in an ASD brain. On the other hand genes controlling expression of glial and immune cells in the brain e.g. astrocytes and microglia, respectively, are overexpressed which correlates with increased number of glial and immune cells found in postmortem ASD brains. Some genes under investigation in ASD pathophysiology are those that affect the [[mTOR]] signaling pathway which supports cell growth and survival.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Jason A.|last2=Pe\u00f1agarikano|first2=Olga|last3=Belgard|first3=T.

These associations have been identified through whole-genome studies, such as WGS (whole-genome sequencing) and GWAS (genome-wide analysis association studies).\n\nIn early onset disorders, such as autism, de novo mutations have been identified as risk factors. One study has identified 64 SNVs and 5 indels de novo on average. By performing an analysis of these variants, comparing cases and controls, considering SNVs and indels in 179 genes associated with autism or close to them, studies observed that the relative risk of missense mutations or variants in promoter regions and UTR (untranslated region), increases versus controls.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nThe identification of SVs has been very useful too, since structural alterations in the chromosomes are able to rearrange the genome, altering its functionality, depending on the size and the region they affect.\n\nAfter the analysis, 98,785 SVs were identified, with an average of 5,843 variants per individual: 171 SVs were ''de novo'', more frequent in the germ line. Some of these variants affected genes associated with autism, such as the GRIN2B gene, balanced translocation, or the deletion of exons 8, 9, and 10 of the CHD2 gene.\n\nNo significant differences were observed regarding the size of certain rearrangements in cases and controls, though a slight increase in number was observed for cases relative to controls.\n\nAll these genetic variants contribute to the development of the autistic spectrum, however, it can not be guaranteed that they are determinants for the development.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Werling DM, Brand H, An JY, Stone MR, Zhu L, Glessner JT, Collins RL, Dong S, Layer RM, Markenscoff-Papadimitriou E, Farrell A, Schwartz GB, Wang HZ, Currall BB, Zhao X, Dea J, Duhn C, Erdman CA, Gilson MC, Yadav R, Handsaker RE, Kashin S, Klei L, Mandell JD, Nowakowski TJ, Liu Y, Pochareddy S, Smith L, Walker MF, Waterman MJ, He X, Kriegstein AR, Rubenstein JL, Sestan N, McCarroll SA, Neale BM, Coon H, Willsey AJ, Buxbaum JD, Daly MJ, State MW, Quinlan AR, Marth GT, Roeder K, Devlin B, Talkowski ME, Sanders SJ | display-authors = 6 | title = An analytical framework for whole-genome sequence association studies and its implications for autism spectrum disorder | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 50 | issue = 5 | pages = 727\u2013736 | date = April 2018 | pmid = 29700473 | pmc = 5961723 | doi = 10.1038/s41588-018-0107-y }}</ref>\n\n===Prenatal and perinatal risk factors===\nSeveral prenatal and perinatal complications have been reported as possible risk factors for autism.

Connectivity between different regions of the brain ('long-range' connectivity) is important for integration and global processing of information and comparing incoming sensory information with the existing model of the world within the brain. Connections within each specialized regions ('short-range' connections) are important for processing individual details and modifying the existing model of the world within the brain to more closely reflect incoming sensory information.

For example, visual information like face recognition is normally processed by the right hemisphere which tends to integrate all information from an incoming sensory signal, whereas an ASD brain preferentially processes visual information in the left hemisphere where information tends to be processed for local details of the face rather than the overall configuration of the face. This left lateralization negatively impacts both facial recognition and spatial skills.<ref name=\":12\" />\n* Increased functional connectivity within the left hemisphere which directly correlates with severity of autism.

{"title_page": "List of cities in China by population", "text_new": "{{Short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n\nChina is the [[list of countries and dependencies by population|world's most populous country]]. According to the Demographic research group in 2017, there are 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in the \"urban area\", as defined by the group's methodology.<ref name=\"demographia\">{{cite news|title=More than 100 Chinese cities now above 1 million people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/20/china-100-cities-populations-bigger-liverpool|publisher=Guardian|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and classification==\nAccording to the [[administrative divisions of China]], there are three levels of cities, namely [[direct-administered municipalities of China|direct-administered municipalities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02}}), [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02}}), and [[county-level city|county-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e02}}). The [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a}}) of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and the [[free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] are not included in this administrative classification.\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a \"city\" in the strictest sense of the term, but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, both an urban core (''a city in the strict sense'') and surrounding [[rural area|rural]] or less-urbanized areas usually many times the size of the central, built-up core.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=L.|last2=Zhao|first2=Simon X.

To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (''city in the strict sense''), the term \"{{lang|zh-hans|\u5e02\u533a}}\" (''sh\u00ec q\u016b''; \"urban area\") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|-3}}, sometimes only the urban core whereas the agglomeration overtake the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ec q\u016b or urban area\" would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== List of major cities by

The [[special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u7279\u522b\u884c\u653f\u533a}}) of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and the [[free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China (Taiwan)]] are not included in this administrative classification.\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a \"city\" in the strictest sense of the term, but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, both an urban core (''a city in the strict sense'') and surrounding [[rural area|rural]] or less-urbanized areas usually many times the size of the central, built-up core.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=L.|last2=Zhao|first2=Simon X.

To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (''city in the strict sense''), the term \"{{lang|zh-hans|\u5e02\u533a}}\" (''sh\u00ec q\u016b''; \"urban area\") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|-3}}, sometimes only the urban core whereas the agglomeration overtake the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ec q\u016b or urban area\" would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== List of major cities by

Today, the Mudi is bred for work, sport, companionship, and [[conformation show|show]].  They continue to be used in herding, as well as participating in a variety of [[dog sports]]. They are often said to be the \"barkiest dog breed\" and are not recommended for the typical dog owner.\n\n==History== \nThe Mudi was first discovered as a breed in 1936 by Dr. Dezso Fenyes in Hungary, where it became known as the \"driver dog.\" Mudis nearly disappeared shortly after their recognition, as many were killed during World War II. The breed became recognized by The Federation Cynologique Internationale in 1966, followed by the United Kennel Club in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#history|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>   In the American Kennel Club, Mudi are in the Miscellaneous Class.<ref>{{cite web |title=Miscellaneous Class |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miscellaneous-class/}}</ref> The Mudi still actively herds in Hungary with Hungarian shepherds and with flocks of up to 500 sheep. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/mudi/detail/|title=Mudi History & Training/Temperament|website=Akc.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n=== Appearance ===\n[[Image:Mudi fawn.JPG|thumb|left|A fawn Mudi]]\nMudi usually weigh {{convert|18|to|29|lb|kg}} and stand {{convert|15|to|19|in|cm}} high at the [[withers]].

Mudis are born with various lengths of tails from bobtails to long full length tails. Dogs born with short or natural bobtail will be indicated on the FCI pedigree. The Mudi standard indicates other characteristics of the breed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mudi Club of America |url=https://www.mudi.us/breedstandard.html |website=www.mudi.us}}</ref>\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Mudi is a versatile farm dog that can hunt, exterminate [[rodent]]s, and act as a capable [[herding dog]] and flock guardian. They are great for alerting and protecting their home and family. They have a high pitched bark and are often very loud.There are three herding dogs native to Hungary: the Puli, Pumi and Mudi, all having similar characteristics. The Mudi is a clever, keen, active dog who becomes very attached to its owner and family. They are often aloof with strangers and early socialization is recommended. The Mudi is often talked about as being \"the barkiest breed\".\nThe Mudi is not recommended for the typical dog owner due to not only its high energy but also that many in the breed have temperament issues and struggle with fearfulness and reactivity.\n\n=== Exercise and activities ===\nThe Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on a daily, long, brisk walks or jogs. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Rally obedience]], [[Schutzhund]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[herding]] events. [[Herding]] instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.<ref name=\"Hartnagle-Taylor and Ty Taylor\">{{cite book|first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010|title=Stockdog Savvy|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn=978-1-57779-106-5|pages=|chapter=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mudi blue merle.jpg|thumb|right|A [[merle (dog coat)|blue merle]] Mudi]]\n\n=== Health problems ===\nThe Mudi is a generally healthy breed. Some health problems that have been seen in the Mudi include, hip dysplasia, epilepsy, cataracts, elbow dysplasia and patellar luxation. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#health|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> \n\n=== Living conditions ===\nThe Mudi can live in an apartment if it is sufficiently exercised. However, they need space to run and play and are more suited to a larger space. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least a large yard.\n\n=== Life expectancy ===\nAbout 13\u201314 years.  Although, two Mudis in Canada lived to 17.5 years of age{{citation-needed|date=November 2017}}.\n\n=== Grooming ===\nWith its short coat, the Mudi is generally easy to groom. The Mudi's coat sheds dirt and hair, however, does not require frequent bathing. A weekly brushing is sufficient and their coat does not need trimming. The Mudi sheds in the spring and does not fully regain his coat until the end of summer. Their nails should be cut every few weeks as needed, along with basic care. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#grooming|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://www.mudi-canada.ca/ Mudi Association of Canada]\n*{{cite web|url=http://en.mimi.hu/dog/mudi.html|title=* Mudi (Dog) - Definition,meaning - Online Encyclopedia|website=En.mimi.hu|accessdate=11 December 2017}}\n*[http://www.americanmudiassociation.org American Mudi Association]\n*[http://www.mudi.us/index.html?0.6719322441588322 Mudi Club of America]\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/mudi/|title=Mudi Dog Breed Information|website=Akc.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#overview|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}\n\n{{Hungarian dogs}}\n{{Pastoral dogs}}\n{{coord missing|Nepal}}\n\n[[Category:FCI breeds]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Herding dogs]]\n[[Category:Rare dog breeds]]\n", "text_old": "{{about||the village in Iran|Mudi, Iran|the town in Nepal|Mudi, Nepal|the language|Koda language}}\n{{distinguish|Mudie}}\n{{Refimprove|date=October 2010}}\n<!-- Begin Infobox Dogbreed.

The breed became recognized by The Federation Cynologique Internationale in 1966, followed by the United Kennel Club in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#history|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>   In the American Kennel Club, Mudi are in the Miscellaneous Class.<ref>{{cite web |title=Miscellaneous Class |url=https://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/miscellaneous-class/}}</ref> The Mudi still actively herds in Hungary with Hungarian shepherds and with flocks of up to 500 sheep. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/mudi/detail/|title=Mudi History & Training/Temperament|website=Akc.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Description ==\n=== Appearance ===\n[[Image:Mudi fawn.JPG|thumb|left|A fawn Mudi]]\nMudi usually weigh {{convert|18|to|29|lb|kg}} and stand {{convert|15|to|19|in|cm}} high at the [[withers]].

Mudis are born with various lengths of tails from bobtails to long full length tails. Dogs born with short or natural bobtail will be indicated on the FCI pedigree. The Mudi standard indicates other characteristics of the breed.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mudi Club of America |url=https://www.mudi.us/breedstandard.html |website=www.mudi.us}}</ref>\n\n=== Temperament ===\nThe Mudi is a versatile farm dog that can hunt, exterminate [[rodent]]s, and act as a capable [[herding dog]] and flock guardian. They are great for alerting and protecting their home and family. They have a high pitched bark and are often very loud.There are three herding dogs native to Hungary: the Puli, Pumi and Mudi, all having similar characteristics. The Mudi is a clever, keen, active dog who becomes very attached to its owner and family. They are often aloof with strangers and early socialization is recommended. The Mudi is often talked about as being \"the barkiest breed\".\nThe Mudi is not recommended for the typical dog owner due to not only its high energy but also that many in the breed have temperament issues and struggle with fearfulness and reactivity.\n\n=== Exercise and activities ===\nThe Mudi is a very active breed. They need to be taken on a daily, long, brisk walks or jogs. In addition, they will benefit from a large safe area where they can run free. They need a lot of running and other exercises to be in good condition. They love to play and will excel in all kinds of dog sports such as Frisbee. The Mudi can compete in [[dog agility]] trials, [[obedience training|obedience]], [[Rally obedience]], [[Schutzhund]], [[Dog showmanship|showmanship]], [[flyball]], [[tracking (dog)|tracking]], and [[herding]] events. [[Herding]] instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Mudi that exhibit basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.<ref name=\"Hartnagle-Taylor and Ty Taylor\">{{cite book|first1 = Jeanne Joy | last1 = Hartnagle-Taylor | first2 = Ty | last2 = Taylor |year = 2010|title=Stockdog Savvy|publisher=Alpine Publications|isbn=978-1-57779-106-5|pages=|chapter=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mudi blue merle.jpg|thumb|right|A [[merle (dog coat)|blue merle]] Mudi]]\n\n=== Health problems ===\nThe Mudi is a generally healthy breed.

However, they need space to run and play and are more suited to a larger space. They are moderately active indoors and will do best with at least a large yard.\n\n=== Life expectancy ===\nAbout 13\u201314 years.  Although, two Mudis in Canada lived to 17.5 years of age{{citation-needed|date=November 2017}}.\n\n=== Grooming ===\nWith its short coat, the Mudi is generally easy to groom. The Mudi's coat sheds dirt and hair, however, does not require frequent bathing. A weekly brushing is sufficient and their coat does not need trimming. The Mudi sheds in the spring and does not fully regain his coat until the end of summer. Their nails should be cut every few weeks as needed, along with basic care. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#grooming|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}</ref> \n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links==\n{{commons}}\n*[http://www.mudi-canada.ca/ Mudi Association of Canada]\n*{{cite web|url=http://en.mimi.hu/dog/mudi.html|title=* Mudi (Dog) - Definition,meaning - Online Encyclopedia|website=En.mimi.hu|accessdate=11 December 2017}}\n*[http://www.americanmudiassociation.org American Mudi Association]\n*[http://www.mudi.us/index.html?0.6719322441588322 Mudi Club of America]\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/dog-breeds/mudi/|title=Mudi Dog Breed Information|website=Akc.org|accessdate=11 December 2017}}\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.vetstreet.com/dogs/mudi#overview|title=Mudi Breed Information|website=Vetstreet.com|accessdate=11 December 2017}}\n\n{{Hungarian dogs}}\n{{Pastoral dogs}}\n{{coord missing|Nepal}}\n\n[[Category:FCI breeds]]\n[[Category:Dog breeds originating in Hungary]]\n[[Category:Herding dogs]]\n[[Category:Rare dog breeds]]\n", "name_user": "41.58.181.18", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudi"}

General [[theory of relativity|relativity]] generalizes [[special relativity]] and refines [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]], or [[spacetime]]. In particular, the ''{{vanchor|[[curvature]] of spacetime|Spacetime curvature|curvature of spacetime}}'' is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\nSome predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of [[classical physics]], especially concerning the passage of time, the [[geometry]] of space, the motion of bodies in [[free fall]], and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational lens]]ing, the [[gravitational redshift]] of light, and the [[Shapiro delay|gravitational time delay]]. The predictions of general relativity in relation to classical physics have been [[tests of general relativity|confirmed]] in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity is [[Alternatives to general relativity|not the only relativistic theory of gravity]], it is the [[Occam's razor|simplest theory]] that is consistent with [[experimental data]]. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of [[quantum gravity]].\n\nEinstein's theory has important [[astrophysical]] implications. For example, it implies the existence of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape\u2014as an end-state for [[massive star]]s. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes. For example, [[microquasar]]s and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] result from the presence of [[stellar black hole]]s and [[supermassive black hole]]s, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of [[gravitational wave]]s, which have since been [[List of gravitational wave observations|observed directly]] by the physics collaboration [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory|LIGO]]. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of a consistently [[Metric expansion of space|expanding universe]].\n\n<!-- Before any further attempt of deleting the following claim, please, note its sources in the History-section, and the conclusive consensus on the TP. -->\nWidely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of general relativity|Classical theories of gravitation}}\n\nSoon after publishing the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate [[gravity]] into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple [[thought experiment]] involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the [[Prussian Academy of Science]] in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations.<ref>O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.

Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the [[Schwarzschild metric]]. This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to [[electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], now associated with [[charged black hole|electrically charged black holes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916a}}, {{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916b}} and {{Harvnb|Reissner|1916}} (later complemented in {{Harvnb|Nordstr\u00f6m|1918}})</ref> In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the [[universe]] as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology.

This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]] in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre]] used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the [[Big Bang]] models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state.<ref>Hubble's original article is {{Harvnb|Hubble|1929}}; an accessible overview is given in {{Harvnb|Singh|2004|loc=ch. 2\u20134}}</ref> Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.<ref>As reported in {{Harvnb|Gamow|1970}}. Einstein's condemnation would prove to be premature, cf. the section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]], below</ref>\n\nDuring that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to [[Newtonian gravity]], being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous perihelion advance]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] without any arbitrary parameters (\"[[wikt:fudge factor|fudge factors]]\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|pp=253\u2013254}}</ref> Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]] confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennefick|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Kennefick|2007}}</ref> making Einstein instantly famous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 16}}</ref> Yet the theory entered the mainstream of [[theoretical physics]] and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the [[History of general relativity#More about GR history|golden age of general relativity]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The future of theoretical physics and cosmology: celebrating Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday |first1=Kip |last1=Thorne |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-82081-3 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC|ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC&pg=PA74 Extract of page 74]</ref> Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify [[quasar]]s as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987|loc=ch. 7.8\u20137.10}}, {{Harvnb|Thorne|1994|loc=ch. 3\u20139}}</ref> Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power,<ref>Sections [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|Orbital effects and the relativity of direction]], [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]] and [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|Light deflection and gravitational time delay]], and references therein</ref> and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.<ref>Section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]] and references therein; the historical development is in {{Harvnb|Overbye|1999}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, general relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty.<ref name=\":0\">{{Harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1975|loc=p. 228}} \"...the ''general theory of relativity''...was established by Einstein, and represents probably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=p. 3}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rovelli|2015|loc=pp. 1\u20136}} \"General relativity is not just an extraordinarily beautiful physical theory providing the best description of the gravitational interaction we have so far.

It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time ''versus'' matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent. Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1984|loc=p. 6}}</ref> Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity, symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Engler|2002}}</ref>\n\n==From classical mechanics to general relativity==\nGeneral relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.<ref>The following exposition re-traces that of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1}}</ref>\n\n===Geometry of Newtonian gravity<!--'Einstein's elevator experiment' redirects here-->===\n[[File:Elevator gravity.svg|thumb|According to general relativity, objects in a gravitational field behave similarly to objects within an accelerating enclosure. For example, an observer will see a ball fall the same way in a rocket (left) as it does on Earth (right), provided that the acceleration of the rocket is equal to 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth).]]\nAt the base of [[classical mechanics]] is the notion that a [[physical body|body]]'s motion can be described as a combination of free (or [[inertia]]l) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second [[Newton's laws of motion|law of motion]], which states that the net [[force]] acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) [[mass]] multiplied by its [[acceleration]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1989|loc=ch. 1}}</ref> The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard [[frame of reference|reference frames]] of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are [[geodesic]]s, straight [[world lines]] in curved spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=5f}}</ref>\n\nConversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[friction]]), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time [[coordinate]]. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]] and its successors (see [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak [[equivalence principle]], or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a [[test body]] in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 2.4}}, {{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 2}}</ref> A simplified version of this is embodied in '''Einstein's elevator experiment'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}</ref>\n\nGiven the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time\u2014in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] which depends on the [[gradient]] of the [[gravitational potential]]. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. However, space''time'' as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not [[integrable systems|integrable]]. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting [[Newton\u2013Cartan theory]] is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors#Informal usage|covariant]] concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.2}}, {{Harvnb|Havas|1964}}, {{Harvnb|K\u00fcnzle|1972}}. The simple thought experiment in question was first described in {{Harvnb|Heckmann|Sch\u00fccking|1959}}</ref> In this geometric description, [[tidal effect]]s\u2014the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall\u2014are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=10f}}</ref>\n\n===Relativistic generalization===\n[[File:Light cone.svg|thumb|left|upright|[[Light cone]]]]\nAs intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a [[limiting case (philosophy of science)|limiting case]] of (special) relativistic mechanics.<ref>Good introductions are, in order of increasing presupposed knowledge of mathematics, {{Harvnb|Giulini|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005}}, and {{Harvnb|Rindler|1991}}; for accounts of precision experiments, cf. part IV of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|L\u00e4mmerzahl|2006}}</ref> In the language of [[symmetry]]: where gravity can be neglected, physics is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] as in special relativity rather than [[Galilean invariance|Galilei invariant]] as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the [[speed of light]], and with high-energy phenomena.<ref>An in-depth comparison between the two symmetry groups can be found in {{Harvnb|Giulini|2006}}</ref>\n\nWith Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. They are defined by the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each [[event (relativity)|event]] {{math|A}}, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by {{math|A}} via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event {{math|B}} in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event {{math|C}} in the image). These sets are observer-independent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|1991|loc=sec. 22}}, {{Harvnb|Synge|1972|loc=ch. 1 and 2}}</ref> In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space\u2013time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a [[conformal structure]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 2.3}}</ref> or conformal geometry.\n\nSpecial relativity is defined in the absence of gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global [[inertial frame]]s. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight [[time-like]] lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}}, {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 5.1}}</ref>\n\nA priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold\u2014that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|below]]). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=17ff}}; a derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005|loc=ch. 12}}. For the experimental evidence, cf. the section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]], below</ref> The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the [[Equivalence Principle#The Einstein equivalence principle|Einstein equivalence principle]], a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 1.13}}; for an elementary account, see {{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}; there are, however, some differences between the modern version and Einstein's original concept used in the historical derivation of general relativity, cf. {{Harvnb|Norton|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field\u2014[[proper time]], to give the technical term\u2014does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the [[Minkowski metric]]. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] that defines the geometry\u2014in particular, how lengths and angles are measured\u2014is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or [[pseudo-Riemannian]] metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable [[Local reference frame|locally inertial coordinates]], the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}} for the experimental evidence, see once more section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]]. Choosing a different connection with non-zero [[torsion tensor|torsion]] leads to a modified theory known as [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]]</ref>\n\n===Einstein's equations===\n{{Main|Einstein field equations|Mathematics of general relativity}}\n\nHaving formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the [[energy\u2013momentum tensor]], which includes both [[energy density|energy]] and momentum [[density|densities]] as well as [[stress (physics)|stress]]: [[pressure]] and shear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|p=16}}, {{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.2}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 2.8}}</ref> Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the [[field equation]] for gravity relates this tensor and the [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]], which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, [[conservation of energy]]\u2013momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy\u2013momentum tensor is [[divergence]]-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-[[manifold]] counterparts, [[covariant derivative]]s studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition\u2014the covariant divergence of the energy\u2013momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero\u2014 the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Einstein's field equations'''\n|equation=<math>G_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - {\\textstyle 1 \\over 2}R\\,g_{\\mu\\nu} = {8 \\pi G \\over c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = #50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nOn the left-hand side is the [[Einstein tensor]], a symmetric, divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor <math>R_{\\mu\\nu}</math> and the metric. In particular,\n\n:<math>R=g^{\\mu\\nu}R_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math>\n\nis the curvature scalar. The Ricci tensor itself is related to the more general [[Riemann curvature tensor]] as\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu}={R^\\alpha}_{\\mu\\alpha\\nu}.\\,</math>\n\nOn the right-hand side, ''<math>T_{\\mu\\nu}</math>'' is the energy\u2013momentum tensor. All tensors are written in [[abstract index notation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=19\u201322}}; for similar derivations, see sections 1 and 2 of ch. 7 in {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}. The Einstein tensor is the only divergence-free tensor that is a function of the metric coefficients, their first and second derivatives at most, and allows the spacetime of special relativity as a solution in the absence of sources of gravity, cf. {{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}. The tensors on both side are of second rank, that is, they can each be thought of as 4\u00d74 matrices, each of which contains ten independent terms; hence, the above represents ten coupled equations. The fact that, as a consequence of geometric relations known as [[Bianchi identities]], the Einstein tensor satisfies a further four identities reduces these to six independent equations, e.g. {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 8.3}}</ref> Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics, the proportionality constant can be fixed as <math>\\kappa = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]] and <math>c</math> the speed of light in vacuum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.4}}</ref> When there is no matter present, so that the energy\u2013momentum tensor vanishes, the results are the vacuum Einstein equations,\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu}=0.\\,</math>\n\nIn general relativity, the [[world line]] of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force is a particular type of geodesic in curved spacetime. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.\n\nThe [[Geodesics in general relativity|'''geodesic equation''']] is:\n:<math> {d^2 x^\\mu \\over ds^2}+\\Gamma^\\mu {}_{\\alpha \\beta}{d x^\\alpha \\over ds}{d x^\\beta \\over ds}=0,</math>\nwhere <math>s</math> is a scalar parameter of motion (e.g. the [[proper time]]), and <math> \\Gamma^\\mu {}_{\\alpha \\beta}</math> are [[Christoffel symbols]] (sometimes called the [[affine connection]] coefficients or [[Levi-Civita connection]] coefficients) which is symmetric in the two lower indices. Greek indices may take the values: 0, 1, 2, 3 and the [[summation convention]] is used for repeated indices <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>. The quantity on the left-hand-side of this equation is the acceleration of a particle, and so this equation is analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion]] which likewise provide formulae for the acceleration of a particle. This equation of motion employs the [[Einstein notation]], meaning that repeated indices are summed (i.e. from zero to three). The Christoffel symbols are functions of the four space-time coordinates, and so are independent of the velocity or acceleration or other characteristics of a [[test particle]] whose motion is described by the geodesic equation.\n\n===Alternatives to general relativity===\n{{Main|Alternatives to general relativity}}\nThere are [[alternatives to general relativity]] built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations. Examples are [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]], [[Brans\u2013Dicke theory]], [[teleparallelism]], [[f(R) gravity|''f''(''R'') gravity]] and [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brans|Dicke|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 3 in ch. 7}}, {{Harvnb|Goenner|2004|loc=sec. 7.2}}, and {{Harvnb|Trautman|2006}}, respectively</ref>\n\n==Definition and basic applications==\n{{See also|Mathematics of general relativity|Physical theories modified by general relativity}}\n\nThe derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory can be used for model-building.\n\n===Definition and basic properties===\nGeneral relativity is a [[metric (general relativity)|metric]] theory of gravitation. At its core are [[Einstein's equations]], which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] representing spacetime, and the [[Stress\u2013energy tensor|energy\u2013momentum]] contained in that spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 4}},\n{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=ch. 7}} or, in fact, any other textbook on general relativity</ref> Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as [[free-fall]], orbital motion, and [[spacecraft]] [[Trajectory|trajectories]]), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow.<ref>At least approximately, cf. {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}</ref> The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy\u2013momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist [[John Archibald Wheeler]], spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|p=xi}}</ref>\n\nWhile general relativity replaces the [[scalar field|scalar]] gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|rank]]-two [[tensor]], the latter reduces to the former in certain [[Correspondence principle#Other scientific theories|limiting cases]]. For [[weak-field approximation|weak gravitational fields]] and [[slow-motion approximation|slow speed]] relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of Newton's law of universal gravitation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 4.4}}</ref>\n\nAs it is constructed using tensors, general relativity exhibits [[general covariance]]: its laws\u2014and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework\u2014take on the same form in all [[coordinate system]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 4.1}}</ref> Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is [[Background independence|background independent]]. It thus satisfies a more stringent [[general principle of relativity]], namely that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are the same for all observers.<ref>For the (conceptual and historical) difficulties in defining a general principle of relativity and separating it from the notion of general covariance, see {{Harvnb|Giulini|2007}}</ref> [[Local spacetime structure|Locally]], as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is [[Minkowski space|Minkowskian]], and the laws of physics exhibit [[local Lorentz invariance]].<ref>section 5 in ch. 12 of {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}</ref>\n\n===Model-building===\nThe core concept of general-relativistic model-building is that of a [[solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of Einstein's equations]]. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy\u2013momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.<ref>Introductory chapters of {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}</ref>\n\nEinstein's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly.<ref>A review showing Einstein's equation in the broader context of other PDEs with physical significance is {{Harvnb|Geroch|1996}}</ref> Nevertheless, a number of [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] are known, although only a few have direct physical applications.<ref>For background information and a list of solutions, cf. {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}; a more recent review can be found in {{Harvnb|MacCallum|2006}}</ref> The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the [[Schwarzschild solution]], the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution and the [[Kerr metric]], each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3,5,6}}</ref> and the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker]] and [[de Sitter universe]]s, each describing an expanding cosmos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=ch. 4, sec. 3.3}}</ref> Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del universe]] (which opens up the intriguing possibility of [[time travel]] in curved spacetimes), the [[Taub-NUT solution]] (a model universe that is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], but [[anisotropic]]), and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the [[Maldacena conjecture]]).<ref>Brief descriptions of these and further interesting solutions can be found in {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 5}}</ref>\n\nGiven the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by [[numerical integration]] on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of [[numerical relativity]], powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lehner|2002}}</ref> In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as [[naked singularity|naked singularities]]. Approximate solutions may also be found by [[perturbation theory|perturbation theories]] such as [[linearized gravity]]<ref>For instance {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 4.4}}</ref> and its generalization, the [[post-Newtonian expansion]], both of which were developed by Einstein. The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 4.1 and 4.2}}</ref> An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 3.2}}, {{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=ch. 4}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences of Einstein's theory==\nGeneral relativity has a number of physical consequences.

A more exact mathematical description distinguishes several kinds of horizon, notably event horizons and [[apparent horizon]]s cf. {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|pp=312\u2013320}} or {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 12.2}}; there are also more intuitive definitions for isolated systems that do not require knowledge of spacetime properties at infinity, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Krishnan|2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|left|The ergosphere of a rotating black hole, which plays a key role when it comes to extracting energy from such a black hole]]\nEarly studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a [[Static spacetime|static]] black hole) and the axisymmetric [[Kerr solution]] (used to describe a rotating, [[Stationary spacetime|stationary]] black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. With time they become rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying: electric charge, mass-energy, [[linear momentum]], [[angular momentum]], and location at a specified time. This is stated by the [[no hair theorem|black hole uniqueness theorem]]: \"black holes have no hair\", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.<ref>For first steps, cf. {{Harvnb|Israel|1971}}; see {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 9.3}} or {{Harvnb|Heusler|1996|loc=ch. 9 and 10}} for a derivation, and {{Harvnb|Heusler|1998}} as well as {{Harvnb|Beig|Chru\u015bciel|2006}} as overviews of more recent results</ref>\n\nEven more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as [[black hole mechanics]], which is analogous to the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the [[entropy]] of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the [[Penrose process]]).<ref>The laws of black hole mechanics were first described in {{Harvnb|Bardeen|Carter|Hawking|1973}}; a more pedagogical presentation can be found in {{Harvnb|Carter|1979}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 2}}. A thorough, book-length introduction including an introduction to the necessary mathematics {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}. For the Penrose process, see {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}</ref> There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1973}}, {{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1974}}</ref> This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease\u2014as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit [[thermal radiation]]. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in [[Planck's law]]. This radiation is known as [[Hawking radiation]] (cf. the [[General relativity#Quantum field theory in curved spacetime|quantum theory section]], below).<ref>The fact that black holes radiate, quantum mechanically, was first derived in {{Harvnb|Hawking|1975}}; a more thorough derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Wald|1975}}. A review is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\nThere are other types of horizons. In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed (\"[[particle horizon]]\"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon).<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=sec. 4.4.4, 4.4.5}}</ref> Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer ([[Rindler space]]), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as [[Unruh effect|Unruh radiation]].<ref>Horizons: cf. {{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 12.4}}. Unruh effect: {{Harvnb|Unruh|1976}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\n===Singularities===\n{{Main|Spacetime singularity}}\nAnother general feature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities. Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesics\u2014all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel. But some solutions of Einstein's equations have \"ragged edges\"\u2014regions known as [[spacetime singularity|spacetime singularities]], where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined. In the more interesting cases, these are \"curvature singularities\", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the [[Ricci scalar]], take on infinite values.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 8.1}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.1}}</ref> Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularities\u2014where worldlines end\u2014are the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole,<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 2}}; a more extensive treatment of this solution can be found in {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3}}</ref> or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 4}}; for a more extensive treatment, cf. {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 6}}</ref> The Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities ([[Big Crunch]]) as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellis|Van Elst|1999}}; a closer look at the singularity itself is taken in {{Harvnb|B\u00f6rner|1993|loc=sec. 1.2}}</ref>\n\nGiven that these examples are all highly symmetric\u2014and thus simplified\u2014it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization.<ref>Here one should remind to the well-known fact that the important  \"quasi-optical\" singularities of the so-called [[eikonal approximation]]s of many wave-equations, namely the \"[[caustic (mathematics)|caustics]]\", are resolved into finite peaks beyond that approximation.</ref> The famous [[singularity theorems]], proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage<ref>Namely when there are [[trapped null surface]]s, cf. {{Harvnb|Penrose|1965}}</ref> and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|1966}}</ref> However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the [[BKL singularity|BKL conjecture]]).<ref>The conjecture was made in {{Harvnb|Belinskii|Khalatnikov|Lifschitz|1971}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002}}. An accessible exposition is given by {{Harvnb|Garfinkle|2007}}</ref> The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.<ref>The restriction to future singularities naturally excludes initial singularities such as the big bang singularity, which in principle be visible to observers at later cosmic time. The cosmic censorship conjecture was first presented in {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}; a textbook-level account is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=302\u2013305}}. For numerical results, see the review {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution equations===\n{{Main|Initial value formulation (general relativity)}}\n\nEach solution of Einstein's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe&nbsp;\u2014 it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the [[time evolution]] of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a [[coordinate condition]], which is analogous to [[gauge fixing]] in other field theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 7.1}}</ref>\n\nTo understand Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in \"3+1\" formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension. The best-known example is the [[ADM formalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a721.4\u2013\u00a721.7}}</ref> These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always [[existence theorem|exist]], and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Four\u00e8s-Bruhat|1952}} and {{Harvnb|Bruhat|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 10}}; an online review can be found in {{Harvnb|Reula|1998}}</ref> Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2007}}; for a review of the basics of numerical relativity, including the problems arising from the peculiarities of Einstein's equations, see {{Harvnb|Lehner|2001}}</ref>\n\n===Global and quasi-local quantities===\n{{Main|Mass in general relativity}}\nThe notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field\u2014like any physical field\u2014must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a720.4}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system's total mass, either using a hypothetical \"infinitely distant observer\" ([[ADM mass]])<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}</ref> or suitable symmetries ([[Komar mass]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Komar|1959}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}; although defined in a totally different way, it can be shown to be equivalent to the ADM mass for stationary spacetimes, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Magnon-Ashtekar|1979}}</ref> If one excludes from the system's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the [[Mass in general relativity#ADM and Bondi masses in asymptotically flat space-times|Bondi mass]] at null infinity.<ref>For a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}</ref> Just as in [[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical physics]], it can be shown that these masses are positive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|p=295 and refs therein}}; this is important for questions of stability\u2014if there were [[negative mass]] states, then flat, empty Minkowski space, which has mass zero, could evolve into these states</ref> Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 5}}</ref> There have also been a number of attempts to define ''quasi-local'' quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system. The hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about [[isolated system]]s, such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture.<ref>Such quasi-local mass\u2013energy definitions are the [[Hawking energy]], [[Geroch energy]], or Penrose's quasi-local energy\u2013momentum based on [[Twistor theory|twistor]] methods; cf. the review article {{Harvnb|Szabados|2004}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with quantum theory==\nIf general relativity were considered to be one of the two pillars of modern physics, then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to [[solid state physics]], would be the other.<ref>An overview of quantum theory can be found in standard textbooks such as {{Harvnb|Messiah|1999}}; a more elementary account is given in {{Harvnb|Hey|Walters|2003}}</ref> However, how to reconcile quantum theory with general relativity is still an open question.\n\n===Quantum field theory in curved spacetime===\n{{Main|Quantum field theory in curved spacetime}}\n\nOrdinary [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], which form the basis of modern elementary particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ramond|1990}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1995}}, {{Harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995}}; a more accessible overview is {{Harvnb|Auyang|1995}}</ref> In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime.

General [[theory of relativity|relativity]] generalizes [[special relativity]] and refines [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of [[space]] and [[time in physics|time]], or [[spacetime]]. In particular, the ''{{vanchor|[[curvature]] of spacetime|Spacetime curvature|curvature of spacetime}}'' is directly related to the [[energy]] and [[momentum]] of whatever [[matter]] and [[radiation]] are present. The relation is specified by the [[Einstein field equations]], a system of [[partial differential equation]]s.\n\nSome predictions of general relativity differ significantly from those of [[classical physics]], especially concerning the passage of time, the [[geometry]] of space, the motion of bodies in [[free fall]], and the propagation of light. Examples of such differences include [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational lens]]ing, the [[gravitational redshift]] of light, and the [[Shapiro delay|gravitational time delay]]. The predictions of general relativity in relation to classical physics have been [[tests of general relativity|confirmed]] in all observations and experiments to date. Although general relativity is [[Alternatives to general relativity|not the only relativistic theory of gravity]], it is the [[Occam's razor|simplest theory]] that is consistent with [[experimental data]]. However, unanswered questions remain, the most fundamental being how general relativity can be reconciled with the laws of [[quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] to produce a complete and self-consistent theory of [[quantum gravity]].\n\nEinstein's theory has important [[astrophysical]] implications. For example, it implies the existence of black holes\u2014regions of space in which space and time are distorted in such a way that nothing, not even light, can escape\u2014as an end-state for [[massive star]]s. There is ample evidence that the intense radiation emitted by certain kinds of astronomical objects is due to black holes. For example, [[microquasar]]s and [[active galactic nucleus|active galactic nuclei]] result from the presence of [[stellar black hole]]s and [[supermassive black hole]]s, respectively. The bending of light by gravity can lead to the phenomenon of gravitational lensing, in which multiple images of the same distant astronomical object are visible in the sky. General relativity also predicts the existence of [[gravitational wave]]s, which have since been [[List of gravitational wave observations|observed directly]] by the physics collaboration [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory|LIGO]]. In addition, general relativity is the basis of current [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] models of a consistently [[Metric expansion of space|expanding universe]].\n\n<!-- Before any further attempt of deleting the following claim, please, note its sources in the History-section, and the conclusive consensus on the TP. -->\nWidely acknowledged as a theory of extraordinary beauty, general relativity has often been described as the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of general relativity|Classical theories of gravitation}}\n\nSoon after publishing the [[Special relativity|special theory of relativity]] in 1905, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate [[gravity]] into his new relativistic framework. In 1907, beginning with a simple [[thought experiment]] involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the [[Prussian Academy of Science]] in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations.<ref>O'Connor, J.J. and Robertson, E.F.

Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory. But as early as 1916, the astrophysicist [[Karl Schwarzschild]] found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the [[Schwarzschild metric]]. This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes. In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to [[electrical charge|electrically charged]] objects were taken, which eventually resulted in the [[Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m metric|Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution]], now associated with [[charged black hole|electrically charged black holes]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916a}}, {{Harvnb|Schwarzschild|1916b}} and {{Harvnb|Reissner|1916}} (later complemented in {{Harvnb|Nordstr\u00f6m|1918}})</ref> In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the [[universe]] as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology. In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations\u2014the [[cosmological constant]]\u2014to match that observational presumption.<ref>{{Harvnb|Einstein|1917}}, cf. {{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 15e}}</ref> By 1929, however, the work of [[Edwin Hubble|Hubble]] and others had shown that our universe is expanding. This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by [[Alexander Friedmann|Friedmann]] in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant. [[Georges Lema\u00eetre|Lema\u00eetre]] used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the [[Big Bang]] models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state.<ref>Hubble's original article is {{Harvnb|Hubble|1929}}; an accessible overview is given in {{Harvnb|Singh|2004|loc=ch. 2\u20134}}</ref> Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.<ref>As reported in {{Harvnb|Gamow|1970}}. Einstein's condemnation would prove to be premature, cf. the section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]], below</ref>\n\nDuring that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories. It was clearly superior to [[Newtonian gravity]], being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory. Einstein himself had shown in 1915 how his theory explained the [[Perihelion precession of Mercury|anomalous perihelion advance]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] without any arbitrary parameters (\"[[wikt:fudge factor|fudge factors]]\").<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|pp=253\u2013254}}</ref> Similarly, a 1919 expedition led by [[Arthur Eddington|Eddington]] confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total [[solar eclipse of May 29, 1919]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Kennefick|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Kennefick|2007}}</ref> making Einstein instantly famous.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pais|1982|loc=ch. 16}}</ref> Yet the theory entered the mainstream of [[theoretical physics]] and astrophysics only with the developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the [[History of general relativity#More about GR history|golden age of general relativity]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The future of theoretical physics and cosmology: celebrating Stephen Hawking's 60th birthday |first1=Kip |last1=Thorne |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-82081-3 |page=74 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC|ref=harv}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=yLy4b61rfPwC&pg=PA74 Extract of page 74]</ref> Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify [[quasar]]s as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987|loc=ch. 7.8\u20137.10}}, {{Harvnb|Thorne|1994|loc=ch. 3\u20139}}</ref> Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power,<ref>Sections [[General relativity#Orbital effects and the relativity of direction|Orbital effects and the relativity of direction]], [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]] and [[General relativity#Light deflection and gravitational time delay|Light deflection and gravitational time delay]], and references therein</ref> and relativistic cosmology, too, became amenable to direct observational tests.<ref>Section [[General relativity#Cosmology|Cosmology]] and references therein; the historical development is in {{Harvnb|Overbye|1999}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, general relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty.<ref name=\":0\">{{Harvnb|Landau|Lifshitz|1975|loc=p. 228}} \"...the ''general theory of relativity''...was established by Einstein, and represents probably the most beautiful of all existing physical theories.\"</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=p. 3}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Rovelli|2015|loc=pp. 1\u20136}} \"General relativity is not just an extraordinarily beautiful physical theory providing the best description of the gravitational interaction we have so far.

It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time ''versus'' matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent. Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an \"element of revelation\" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1984|loc=p. 6}}</ref> Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity, symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.<ref>{{Harvnb|Engler|2002}}</ref>\n\n==From classical mechanics to general relativity==\nGeneral relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics. The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description. The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.<ref>The following exposition re-traces that of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1}}</ref>\n\n===Geometry of Newtonian gravity<!--'Einstein's elevator experiment' redirects here-->===\n[[File:Elevator gravity.svg|thumb|According to general relativity, objects in a gravitational field behave similarly to objects within an accelerating enclosure. For example, an observer will see a ball fall the same way in a rocket (left) as it does on Earth (right), provided that the acceleration of the rocket is equal to 9.8&nbsp;m/s<sup>2</sup> (the acceleration due to gravity at the surface of the Earth).]]\nAt the base of [[classical mechanics]] is the notion that a [[physical body|body]]'s motion can be described as a combination of free (or [[inertia]]l) motion, and deviations from this free motion. Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second [[Newton's laws of motion|law of motion]], which states that the net [[force]] acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) [[mass]] multiplied by its [[acceleration]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnold|1989|loc=ch. 1}}</ref> The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard [[frame of reference|reference frames]] of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed. In modern parlance, their paths are [[geodesic]]s, straight [[world lines]] in curved spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=5f}}</ref>\n\nConversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as [[electromagnetism]] or [[friction]]), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time [[coordinate]]. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of [[Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]] and its successors (see [[E\u00f6tv\u00f6s experiment]]), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak [[equivalence principle]], or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a [[test body]] in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 2.4}}, {{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 2}}</ref> A simplified version of this is embodied in '''Einstein's elevator experiment'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}</ref>\n\nGiven the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force. This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity. This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time\u2014in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific [[connection (mathematics)|connection]] which depends on the [[gradient]] of the [[gravitational potential]]. Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary [[Euclidean geometry]]. However, space''time'' as a whole is more complicated. As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not [[integrable systems|integrable]]. From this, one can deduce that spacetime is curved. The resulting [[Newton\u2013Cartan theory]] is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors#Informal usage|covariant]] concepts, i.e. a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.2}}, {{Harvnb|Havas|1964}}, {{Harvnb|K\u00fcnzle|1972}}. The simple thought experiment in question was first described in {{Harvnb|Heckmann|Sch\u00fccking|1959}}</ref> In this geometric description, [[tidal effect]]s\u2014the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall\u2014are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=10f}}</ref>\n\n===Relativistic generalization===\n[[File:Light cone.svg|thumb|left|upright|[[Light cone]]]]\nAs intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a [[limiting case (philosophy of science)|limiting case]] of (special) relativistic mechanics.<ref>Good introductions are, in order of increasing presupposed knowledge of mathematics, {{Harvnb|Giulini|2005}}, {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005}}, and {{Harvnb|Rindler|1991}}; for accounts of precision experiments, cf. part IV of {{Harvnb|Ehlers|L\u00e4mmerzahl|2006}}</ref> In the language of [[symmetry]]: where gravity can be neglected, physics is [[Lorentz invariance|Lorentz invariant]] as in special relativity rather than [[Galilean invariance|Galilei invariant]] as in classical mechanics. (The defining symmetry of special relativity is the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]], which includes translations, rotations and boosts.) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the [[speed of light]], and with high-energy phenomena.<ref>An in-depth comparison between the two symmetry groups can be found in {{Harvnb|Giulini|2006}}</ref>\n\nWith Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play. They are defined by the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for each [[event (relativity)|event]] {{math|A}}, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by {{math|A}} via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event {{math|B}} in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event {{math|C}} in the image). These sets are observer-independent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|1991|loc=sec. 22}}, {{Harvnb|Synge|1972|loc=ch. 1 and 2}}</ref> In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space\u2013time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a [[conformal structure]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 2.3}}</ref> or conformal geometry.\n\nSpecial relativity is defined in the absence of gravity, so for practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected. Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global [[inertial frame]]s. Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles. Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight [[time-like]] lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}}, {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 5.1}}</ref>\n\nA priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold\u2014that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames. But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf. [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|below]]). The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=17ff}}; a derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Mermin|2005|loc=ch. 12}}. For the experimental evidence, cf. the section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]], below</ref> The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the [[Equivalence Principle#The Einstein equivalence principle|Einstein equivalence principle]], a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 1.13}}; for an elementary account, see {{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|loc=ch. 2}}; there are, however, some differences between the modern version and Einstein's original concept used in the historical derivation of general relativity, cf. {{Harvnb|Norton|1985}}</ref>\n\nThe same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field\u2014[[proper time]], to give the technical term\u2014does not follow the rules of special relativity. In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the [[Minkowski metric]]. As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry. At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian. Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space. The [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] that defines the geometry\u2014in particular, how lengths and angles are measured\u2014is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or [[pseudo-Riemannian]] metric. Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the [[Levi-Civita connection]], and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable [[Local reference frame|locally inertial coordinates]], the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|loc=sec. 1.4}} for the experimental evidence, see once more section [[General relativity#Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift|Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift]]. Choosing a different connection with non-zero [[torsion tensor|torsion]] leads to a modified theory known as [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]]</ref>\n\n===Einstein's equations===\n{{Main|Einstein field equations|Mathematics of general relativity}}\n\nHaving formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains. In Newtonian gravity, the source is mass. In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the [[energy\u2013momentum tensor]], which includes both [[energy density|energy]] and momentum [[density|densities]] as well as [[stress (physics)|stress]]: [[pressure]] and shear.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|p=16}}, {{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.2}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 2.8}}</ref> Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime. Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the [[field equation]] for gravity relates this tensor and the [[Ricci curvature|Ricci tensor]], which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely. In special relativity, [[conservation of energy]]\u2013momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy\u2013momentum tensor is [[divergence]]-free. This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-[[manifold]] counterparts, [[covariant derivative]]s studied in differential geometry. With this additional condition\u2014the covariant divergence of the energy\u2013momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero\u2014 the simplest set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations:\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent=:\n|title='''Einstein's field equations'''\n|equation=<math>G_{\\mu\\nu}\\equiv R_{\\mu\\nu} - {\\textstyle 1 \\over 2}R\\,g_{\\mu\\nu} = {8 \\pi G \\over c^4} T_{\\mu\\nu}\\,</math>\n|cellpadding\n|border\n|border colour = #50C878\n|background colour = #ECFCF4}}\n\nOn the left-hand side is the [[Einstein tensor]], a specific divergence-free combination of the Ricci tensor <math>R_{\\mu\\nu}</math> and the metric.

All tensors are written in [[abstract index notation]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Ehlers|1973|pp=19\u201322}}; for similar derivations, see sections 1 and 2 of ch. 7 in {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}. The Einstein tensor is the only divergence-free tensor that is a function of the metric coefficients, their first and second derivatives at most, and allows the spacetime of special relativity as a solution in the absence of sources of gravity, cf. {{Harvnb|Lovelock|1972}}. The tensors on both side are of second rank, that is, they can each be thought of as 4\u00d74 matrices, each of which contains ten independent terms; hence, the above represents ten coupled equations. The fact that, as a consequence of geometric relations known as [[Bianchi identities]], the Einstein tensor satisfies a further four identities reduces these to six independent equations, e.g. {{Harvnb|Schutz|1985|loc=sec. 8.3}}</ref> Matching the theory's prediction to observational results for [[planet]]ary [[orbit]]s or, equivalently, assuring that the weak-gravity, low-speed limit is Newtonian mechanics, the proportionality constant can be fixed as <math>\\kappa = \\frac{8\\pi G}{c^4}</math>, where <math>G</math> is the [[gravitational constant]] and <math>c</math> the speed of light in vacuum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Kenyon|1990|loc=sec. 7.4}}</ref> When there is no matter present, so that the energy\u2013momentum tensor vanishes, the results are the vacuum Einstein equations,\n\n:<math>R_{\\mu\\nu}=0.\\,</math>\n\nIn general relativity, the [[world line]] of a particle free from all external, non-gravitational force is a particular type of geodesic in curved spacetime. In other words, a freely moving or falling particle always moves along a geodesic.\n\nThe [[Geodesics in general relativity|'''geodesic equation''']] is:\n:<math> {d^2 x^\\mu \\over ds^2}+\\Gamma^\\mu {}_{\\alpha \\beta}{d x^\\alpha \\over ds}{d x^\\beta \\over ds}=0,</math>\nwhere <math>s</math> is a scalar parameter of motion (e.g. the [[proper time]]), and <math> \\Gamma^\\mu {}_{\\alpha \\beta}</math> are [[Christoffel symbols]] (sometimes called the [[affine connection]] coefficients or [[Levi-Civita connection]] coefficients) which is symmetric in the two lower indices. Greek indices may take the values: 0, 1, 2, 3 and the [[summation convention]] is used for repeated indices <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>. The quantity on the left-hand-side of this equation is the acceleration of a particle, and so this equation is analogous to [[Newton's laws of motion]] which likewise provide formulae for the acceleration of a particle. This equation of motion employs the [[Einstein notation]], meaning that repeated indices are summed (i.e. from zero to three). The Christoffel symbols are functions of the four space-time coordinates, and so are independent of the velocity or acceleration or other characteristics of a [[test particle]] whose motion is described by the geodesic equation.\n\n===Alternatives to general relativity===\n{{Main|Alternatives to general relativity}}\nThere are [[alternatives to general relativity]] built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations. Examples are [[Whitehead's theory of gravitation|Whitehead's theory]], [[Brans\u2013Dicke theory]], [[teleparallelism]], [[f(R) gravity|''f''(''R'') gravity]] and [[Einstein\u2013Cartan theory]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Brans|Dicke|1961}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=sec. 3 in ch. 7}}, {{Harvnb|Goenner|2004|loc=sec. 7.2}}, and {{Harvnb|Trautman|2006}}, respectively</ref>\n\n==Definition and basic applications==\n{{See also|Mathematics of general relativity|Physical theories modified by general relativity}}\n\nThe derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory can be used for model-building.\n\n===Definition and basic properties===\nGeneral relativity is a [[metric (general relativity)|metric]] theory of gravitation. At its core are [[Einstein's equations]], which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional [[pseudo-Riemannian manifold]] representing spacetime, and the [[Stress\u2013energy tensor|energy\u2013momentum]] contained in that spacetime.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 4}},\n{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972|loc=ch. 7}} or, in fact, any other textbook on general relativity</ref> Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as [[free-fall]], orbital motion, and [[spacecraft]] [[Trajectory|trajectories]]), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow.<ref>At least approximately, cf. {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}</ref> The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy\u2013momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist [[John Archibald Wheeler]], spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wheeler|1990|p=xi}}</ref>\n\nWhile general relativity replaces the [[scalar field|scalar]] gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric [[Tensor#As multidimensional arrays|rank]]-two [[tensor]], the latter reduces to the former in certain [[Correspondence principle#Other scientific theories|limiting cases]]. For [[weak-field approximation|weak gravitational fields]] and [[slow-motion approximation|slow speed]] relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of Newton's law of universal gravitation.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 4.4}}</ref>\n\nAs it is constructed using tensors, general relativity exhibits [[general covariance]]: its laws\u2014and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework\u2014take on the same form in all [[coordinate system]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 4.1}}</ref> Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e. it is [[Background independence|background independent]]. It thus satisfies a more stringent [[general principle of relativity]], namely that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] are the same for all observers.<ref>For the (conceptual and historical) difficulties in defining a general principle of relativity and separating it from the notion of general covariance, see {{Harvnb|Giulini|2007}}</ref> [[Local spacetime structure|Locally]], as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is [[Minkowski space|Minkowskian]], and the laws of physics exhibit [[local Lorentz invariance]].<ref>section 5 in ch. 12 of {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1972}}</ref>\n\n===Model-building===\nThe core concept of general-relativistic model-building is that of a [[solutions of the Einstein field equations|solution of Einstein's equations]]. Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold. Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy\u2013momentum tensor must be divergence-free. The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties. In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.<ref>Introductory chapters of {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}</ref>\n\nEinstein's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly.<ref>A review showing Einstein's equation in the broader context of other PDEs with physical significance is {{Harvnb|Geroch|1996}}</ref> Nevertheless, a number of [[exact solutions in general relativity|exact solutions]] are known, although only a few have direct physical applications.<ref>For background information and a list of solutions, cf. {{Harvnb|Stephani|Kramer|MacCallum|Hoenselaers|2003}}; a more recent review can be found in {{Harvnb|MacCallum|2006}}</ref> The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the [[Schwarzschild solution]], the Reissner\u2013Nordstr\u00f6m solution and the [[Kerr metric]], each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe,<ref>{{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3,5,6}}</ref> and the [[Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker metric|Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker]] and [[de Sitter universe]]s, each describing an expanding cosmos.<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=ch. 4, sec. 3.3}}</ref> Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the [[G\u00f6del metric|G\u00f6del universe]] (which opens up the intriguing possibility of [[time travel]] in curved spacetimes), the [[Taub-NUT solution]] (a model universe that is [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]], but [[anisotropic]]), and [[anti-de Sitter space]] (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the [[Maldacena conjecture]]).<ref>Brief descriptions of these and further interesting solutions can be found in {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 5}}</ref>\n\nGiven the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by [[numerical integration]] on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions. In the field of [[numerical relativity]], powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lehner|2002}}</ref> In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as [[naked singularity|naked singularities]]. Approximate solutions may also be found by [[perturbation theory|perturbation theories]] such as [[linearized gravity]]<ref>For instance {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 4.4}}</ref> and its generalization, the [[post-Newtonian expansion]], both of which were developed by Einstein. The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light. The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=sec. 4.1 and 4.2}}</ref> An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Will|2006|loc=sec. 3.2}}, {{Harvnb|Will|1993|loc=ch. 4}}</ref>\n\n==Consequences of Einstein's theory==\nGeneral relativity has a number of physical consequences. Some follow directly from the theory's axioms, whereas others have become clear only in the course of many years of research that followed Einstein's initial publication.\n\n===Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift===\n{{Main|Gravitational time dilation}}\n[[File:Gravitational red-shifting.png|thumb|Schematic representation of the gravitational redshift of a light wave escaping from the surface of a massive body]]\nAssuming that the equivalence principle holds,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|pp=24\u201326 vs. pp. 236\u2013237}} and {{Harvnb|Ohanian|Ruffini|1994|pp=164\u2013172}}.

No influence from an event ''A'' can reach any other location ''X'' before light sent out at ''A'' to ''X''. In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines ([[Geodesic (general relativity)|null geodesics]]) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure. This structure can be displayed using [[Penrose diagram|Penrose\u2013Carter diagrams]] in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk (\"[[Compactification (mathematics)|compactified]]\") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard [[spacetime diagram]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Frauendiener|2004}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.1}}, {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 6.8, 6.9}}</ref>\n\nAware of the importance of causal structure, [[Roger Penrose]] and others developed what is known as [[global geometry]]. In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations. Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the [[Raychaudhuri equation]], and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of [[energy conditions]]) are used to derive general results.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.2\u20139.4}} and {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=ch. 6}}</ref>\n\n===Horizons===\n{{Main|Horizon (general relativity)|No hair theorem|Black hole mechanics}}\nUsing global geometry, some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called [[event horizon|horizons]], which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime. The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the [[hoop conjecture]], the relevant length scale is the [[Schwarzschild radius]]<ref>{{Harvnb|Thorne|1972}}; for more recent numerical studies, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>), no light from inside can escape to the outside. Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well. Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's ''horizon'', is not a physical barrier.<ref>{{Harvnb|Israel|1987}}. A more exact mathematical description distinguishes several kinds of horizon, notably event horizons and [[apparent horizon]]s cf. {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|pp=312\u2013320}} or {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 12.2}}; there are also more intuitive definitions for isolated systems that do not require knowledge of spacetime properties at infinity, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Krishnan|2004}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Ergosphere.svg|thumb|left|The ergosphere of a rotating black hole, which plays a key role when it comes to extracting energy from such a black hole]]\nEarly studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a [[Static spacetime|static]] black hole) and the axisymmetric [[Kerr solution]] (used to describe a rotating, [[Stationary spacetime|stationary]] black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere). Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes. With time they become rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying: electric charge, mass-energy, [[linear momentum]], [[angular momentum]], and location at a specified time. This is stated by the [[no hair theorem|black hole uniqueness theorem]]: \"black holes have no hair\", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans. Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.<ref>For first steps, cf. {{Harvnb|Israel|1971}}; see {{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 9.3}} or {{Harvnb|Heusler|1996|loc=ch. 9 and 10}} for a derivation, and {{Harvnb|Heusler|1998}} as well as {{Harvnb|Beig|Chru\u015bciel|2006}} as overviews of more recent results</ref>\n\nEven more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as [[black hole mechanics]], which is analogous to the [[laws of thermodynamics]]. For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the [[entropy]] of a thermodynamic system. This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g. by the [[Penrose process]]).<ref>The laws of black hole mechanics were first described in {{Harvnb|Bardeen|Carter|Hawking|1973}}; a more pedagogical presentation can be found in {{Harvnb|Carter|1979}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 2}}. A thorough, book-length introduction including an introduction to the necessary mathematics {{Harvnb|Poisson|2004}}. For the Penrose process, see {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}</ref> There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1973}}, {{Harvnb|Bekenstein|1974}}</ref> This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for black hole area to decrease\u2014as long as other processes ensure that, overall, entropy increases. As thermodynamical objects with non-zero temperature, black holes should emit [[thermal radiation]]. Semi-classical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in [[Planck's law]]. This radiation is known as [[Hawking radiation]] (cf. the [[General relativity#Quantum field theory in curved spacetime|quantum theory section]], below).<ref>The fact that black holes radiate, quantum mechanically, was first derived in {{Harvnb|Hawking|1975}}; a more thorough derivation can be found in {{Harvnb|Wald|1975}}. A review is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|2001|loc=ch. 3}}</ref>\n\nThere are other types of horizons. In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed (\"[[particle horizon]]\"), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon).<ref>{{Harvnb|Narlikar|1993|loc=sec. 4.4.4, 4.4.5}}</ref> Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer ([[Rindler space]]), there will be horizons associated with a semi-classical radiation known as [[Unruh effect|Unruh radiation]].<ref>Horizons: cf. {{Harvnb|Rindler|2001|loc=sec. 12.4}}.

Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesics\u2014all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel. But some solutions of Einstein's equations have \"ragged edges\"\u2014regions known as [[spacetime singularity|spacetime singularities]], where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined. In the more interesting cases, these are \"curvature singularities\", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the [[Ricci scalar]], take on infinite values.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 8.1}}, {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 9.1}}</ref> Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularities\u2014where worldlines end\u2014are the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole,<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 2}}; a more extensive treatment of this solution can be found in {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 3}}</ref> or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 4}}; for a more extensive treatment, cf. {{Harvnb|Chandrasekhar|1983|loc=ch. 6}}</ref> The Friedmann\u2013Lema\u00eetre\u2013Robertson\u2013Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities ([[Big Crunch]]) as well.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ellis|Van Elst|1999}}; a closer look at the singularity itself is taken in {{Harvnb|B\u00f6rner|1993|loc=sec. 1.2}}</ref>\n\nGiven that these examples are all highly symmetric\u2014and thus simplified\u2014it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization.<ref>Here one should remind to the well-known fact that the important  \"quasi-optical\" singularities of the so-called [[eikonal approximation]]s of many wave-equations, namely the \"[[caustic (mathematics)|caustics]]\", are resolved into finite peaks beyond that approximation.</ref> The famous [[singularity theorems]], proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage<ref>Namely when there are [[trapped null surface]]s, cf. {{Harvnb|Penrose|1965}}</ref> and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|1966}}</ref> However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g. by the [[BKL singularity|BKL conjecture]]).<ref>The conjecture was made in {{Harvnb|Belinskii|Khalatnikov|Lifschitz|1971}}; for a more recent review, see {{Harvnb|Berger|2002}}. An accessible exposition is given by {{Harvnb|Garfinkle|2007}}</ref> The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers. While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.<ref>The restriction to future singularities naturally excludes initial singularities such as the big bang singularity, which in principle be visible to observers at later cosmic time. The cosmic censorship conjecture was first presented in {{Harvnb|Penrose|1969}}; a textbook-level account is given in {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|pp=302\u2013305}}. For numerical results, see the review {{Harvnb|Berger|2002|loc=sec. 2.1}}</ref>\n\n===Evolution equations===\n{{Main|Initial value formulation (general relativity)}}\n\nEach solution of Einstein's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe&nbsp;\u2014 it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime. It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe. Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the [[time evolution]] of the metric tensor. It must be combined with a [[coordinate condition]], which is analogous to [[gauge fixing]] in other field theories.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hawking|Ellis|1973|loc=sec. 7.1}}</ref>\n\nTo understand Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time. This is done in \"3+1\" formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension. The best-known example is the [[ADM formalism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a721.4\u2013\u00a721.7}}</ref> These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always [[existence theorem|exist]], and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified.<ref>{{Harvnb|Four\u00e8s-Bruhat|1952}} and {{Harvnb|Bruhat|1962}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=ch. 10}}; an online review can be found in {{Harvnb|Reula|1998}}</ref> Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gourgoulhon|2007}}; for a review of the basics of numerical relativity, including the problems arising from the peculiarities of Einstein's equations, see {{Harvnb|Lehner|2001}}</ref>\n\n===Global and quasi-local quantities===\n{{Main|Mass in general relativity}}\nThe notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field\u2014like any physical field\u2014must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Misner|Thorne|Wheeler|1973|loc=\u00a720.4}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system's total mass, either using a hypothetical \"infinitely distant observer\" ([[ADM mass]])<ref>{{Harvnb|Arnowitt|Deser|Misner|1962}}</ref> or suitable symmetries ([[Komar mass]]).<ref>{{Harvnb|Komar|1959}}; for a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}; although defined in a totally different way, it can be shown to be equivalent to the ADM mass for stationary spacetimes, cf. {{Harvnb|Ashtekar|Magnon-Ashtekar|1979}}</ref> If one excludes from the system's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the [[Mass in general relativity#ADM and Bondi masses in asymptotically flat space-times|Bondi mass]] at null infinity.<ref>For a pedagogical introduction, see {{Harvnb|Wald|1984|loc=sec. 11.2}}</ref> Just as in [[Physics in the Classical Limit|classical physics]], it can be shown that these masses are positive.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wald|1984|p=295 and refs therein}}; this is important for questions of stability\u2014if there were [[negative mass]] states, then flat, empty Minkowski space, which has mass zero, could evolve into these states</ref> Corresponding global definitions exist for momentum and angular momentum.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townsend|1997|loc=ch. 5}}</ref> There have also been a number of attempts to define ''quasi-local'' quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system. The hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about [[isolated system]]s, such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture.<ref>Such quasi-local mass\u2013energy definitions are the [[Hawking energy]], [[Geroch energy]], or Penrose's quasi-local energy\u2013momentum based on [[Twistor theory|twistor]] methods; cf. the review article {{Harvnb|Szabados|2004}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship with quantum theory==\nIf general relativity were considered to be one of the two pillars of modern physics, then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to [[solid state physics]], would be the other.<ref>An overview of quantum theory can be found in standard textbooks such as {{Harvnb|Messiah|1999}}; a more elementary account is given in {{Harvnb|Hey|Walters|2003}}</ref> However, how to reconcile quantum theory with general relativity is still an open question.\n\n===Quantum field theory in curved spacetime===\n{{Main|Quantum field theory in curved spacetime}}\n\nOrdinary [[quantum field theory|quantum field theories]], which form the basis of modern elementary particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ramond|1990}}, {{Harvnb|Weinberg|1995}}, {{Harvnb|Peskin|Schroeder|1995}}; a more accessible overview is {{Harvnb|Auyang|1995}}</ref> In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime.
