He began tours that featured Partridge tunes and his own hits. Cassidy achieved far greater solo chart success in the UK than in his native America, including a cover of [[The Young Rascals|The Young Rascals']] \"[[How Can I Be Sure]]\" and the [[double A-side]] single \"[[Daydreamer (1973 song)|Daydreamer]]\" / \"[[The Puppy Song]]\" \u2013 two UK number ones which failed to chart in the States.

He became an instant drawing card, with sellout concert successes in major arenas around the world. These concerts produced mass hysteria, resulting in the media coining the term \"Cassidymania\".

International success continued, mostly in Great Britain, Germany, Japan and South Africa, when he released three well-received solo albums and several hit singles on [[RCA]] in 1975 and 1976. Cassidy became the first recording artist to have a hit with \"[[I Write the Songs]]\", peaking at #11 in the Top 40 in Great Britain before the song became [[Barry Manilow]]'s signature tune.

She is internationally famous as a spokesperson on autism as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/temple-grandin |title=Temple Grandin |work=apbspeakers.com |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Autism spectrum===\n[[Steve Silberman]] in his book, ''[[Neurotribes|NeuroTribes]]'', wrote that Temple Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. [[Bernard Rimland]], a father of a son with autism and author of the book, ''Infantile Autism'', wrote the foreword to Grandin's first book ''Emergence: Labeled Autistic''. Her book was published in 1986. Dr. Rimland wrote \"Temple's ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.\"\n\nIn her later book, ''[[Thinking in Pictures]]'', published in 1995, the neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] wrote at the end of the foreword that the book provided \"a bridge between our world and hers, and allows us to glimpse into a quite other sort of mind.\"\n\nIn her early writings, Grandin characterized herself as a recovered autistic and, in his foreword, [[Bernard Rimland]] used the term recovered autistic individual. In her later writings she has abandoned this characterization. Steve Silberman wrote, \"It became obvious to her, however, that she was not recovered but had learned with great effort to adapt to the social norms of the people around her.\"\n\nWhen her book ''Thinking in Pictures'' was written in 1995, Grandin thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic-specific images the way she did. By the time the expanded edition was published in 2006, she had realized that it had been wrong to presume that every person with autism processed information in the same way she did. In the 2006 edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were:  1. Visual Thinkers like she is, who think in photographically-specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers \u2013 who think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers \u2013 who think in word details, and she noted that their favorite subject may be history.\n\nIn one of her later books, ''The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum'', the concept of three different types of thinking by autistic individuals is expanded. This book was published in 2013. An influential book that helped her to develop her concept of pattern thinking was [[Clara Claiborne Park]]'s book entitled, ''Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter's Life with Autism''. It was published in 2001. ''The Autistic Brain'' also contains an extensive review of scientific studies that provide evidence that object-visual thinking is different from spatial-visualization abilities.\n\nGrandin became well-known beyond the American autistic community, after being described by [[Oliver Sacks]] in the title narrative of his book, ''[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]'' (1995), for which he won a [[Polk Award]]. The title is derived from Grandin's characterization of how she feels around [[neurotypical]] people. In the mid-1980s Grandin first spoke in public about autism at the request of [[Ruth C. Sullivan]], one of the founders of the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA). Sullivan writes:\n{{cquote|I first met Temple in the mid-1980s [at the] annual [ASA] conference. Standing on the periphery of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [ASA] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [ASA] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive (\"like being tied to the rail and the train's coming\"). She was asked many questions: \"Why does my son do so much spinning?\" \"Why does he hold his hands to his ears?\" \"Why doesn't he look at me?\" She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=adPodg5MNU0C&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=temple+grandin+ruth+sullivan#v=onepage&q=temple%20grandin%20ruth%20sullivan&f=false |title=The Way I See It: A Personal Look at Autism and Aspberger's |first=Temple |last=Grandin |publisher=Future Horizons |year=2008 |isbn=9781932565720 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nBased on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]] to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks \"totally in pictures\", using her vast visual memory to translate information into a mental slideshow of images that may be manipulated or correlated.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Temple |last=Grandin |title=How does visual thinking work in the mind of a person with autism?

Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.\n\nAs a proponent of [[neurodiversity]], Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly-autistic individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27221|title=Edge.org|website=www.edge.org|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref> However, she believes that autistic children who are severely handicapped need therapy with [[applied behavioral analysis]].<ref name=\"wrongplanet\" /> Additionally, she has claimed that she only will attend talks given by autistics who can hold down a career.<ref name=\"ArtAutism\">{{cite web |last=Sandison |first=Ron |title=Temple Grandin To Autistic Adults: Get Your Butts Out Of The House And Get A Job |url=https://the-art-of-autism.com/temple-grandin-to-autistic-adults-get-your-butts-out-of-the-house-and-get-a-job/ |website=The Art of Autism |date=April 13, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Handling livestock===\nIn 1980 Grandin published her first two scientific articles on beef cattle behavior during handling: \"Livestock Behavior as Related to Handling Facilities Design\" in the ''International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems, Vol. 1, pp. 33-52'' and \"Observations of Cattle Behavior Applied to the Design of Cattle Handling Facilities\", ''Applied Animal Ethology, Vol. 6, pp. 19-31.'' She was one of the first scientists to report that animals are sensitive to visual distractions in handling facilities such as shadows, dangling chains, and other environmental details that most people do not notice. When she was awarded her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, she studied the effects of environmental enrichment on pigs. The title of her [[Thesis|dissertation]] was \"Effect of Rearing Environment and Environmental Enrichment on the Behavior and Neural Development in Young Pigs\". Grandin expanded her theories in her book, ''Animals Make Us Human''.\n\nIn 1993, she edited the first edition of ''Livestock Handling and Transport''. Grandin wrote three chapters and included chapters from contributors from around the world. Subsequent editions of the book were published in 2000, 2007, and 2014. In her academic work as a professor at Colorado State University, her graduate student, Bridgett Voisinet, conducted one of the early studies that demonstrated that cattle who remained calm during handling, had higher weight gains. In 1997, when the paper was published, this was a new concept. The paper is entitled, \"Feedlot Cattle with Calm Temperaments Have Higher Average Daily Gains Than Cattle with Excitable Temperaments\", published in ''The Journal of Animal Science, Vol. 75, pp. 892-896.''\n\nAnother important paper published by Grandin was, \"Assessment of Stress During Handling and Transport\", ''Journal of Animal Science, 1997, Vol. 75, pp. 249-257''. This paper presented the concept that an animal's previous experiences with handling could have an effect on how it will react to being handled in the future, as a new concept in the animal-handling industry.\n\nA major piece of equipment that Grandin developed was a center track (double rail) conveyor restrainer system for holding cattle during stunning at large beef slaughtering plants. The first system was installed in the mid-1980s for calves and a system for large beef cattle was developed in 1990. This equipment is now being used by many large meat companies. It is described in \"Double Rail Restrainer Conveyor for Livestock Handling\", first published in the ''Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, Vol. 4, pp. 327-338'' in 1988, and \"Transferring results of behavioral research to industry to improve animal welfare on the farm, ranch, and slaughter plant\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 8, pp. 215-228'', published in 2003.\n\nGrandin also developed an objective, numerical scoring system for assessing animal welfare at [[Slaughterhouse|slaughtering plants]]. The use of this scoring system resulted in significant improvements in animal stunning and handling during slaughter. This work is described in \"Objective scoring of animal handling and stunning practices in slaughter plants\", ''[[American Veterinary Medical Association|Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association]], Vol. 212, pp. 36-39, \"The feasibility of using vocalization scoring as an indicator of poor welfare during slaughter\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 56, pp.&nbsp;121\u2013128,'' and \"Effect of animal welfare audits of slaughter plants by a major fast food company on cattle handling and stunning practices\", ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 216, pp.&nbsp;848\u2013851.\n\nIn 2008, Grandin published ''Humane Livestock Handling''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/humanelivestockh0000gran|title=Humane livestock handling|last=Grandin, Temple.|date=2008|publisher=Storey Pub|others=Deesing, Mark.|isbn=9781603420280|location=North Adams, MA|oclc=176902393|url-access=registration}}</ref> with contributions by Mark Deesing, a long time collaborator with her. The book contains a review of the main aspects of cattle behavior and provides a visual guide in the form of construction plans and diagrams for the implementation of Grandin's ideas relating to humane livestock handling.\n\n===Other scientific contributions===\nGrandin is the author or co-author of more than 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers on a variety of other animal behavior subjects. Some of the other subjects are: the effect of hair whorl position on cattle behavior, the influence of stress prior to slaughter upon meat quality, religious slaughter, mothering behavior of beef cows, cattle temperament, and causes of bruising.\n\n===Animal welfare===\nGrandin has lectured widely about her first-hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed curved corrals she adapted with the intention of reducing stress, panic, and injury in animals being led to [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]. This has proved to be a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep connection to them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coe |first=Sue |title=Cruel: bearing witness to animal exploitation. |date=2012 |publisher=OR Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-935928-72-0 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nHer business website promotes improvement of standards for [[slaughterhouse]]s and livestock farms.

She compares the properties and rights of owning cattle, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such \"properties\", because legally, a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot [[torture]] an animal.\n\nHer insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASABE Fellows |url=http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) |access-date=April 14, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030144237/http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |archive-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of [[pink slime]], Grandin spoke out in support of the food product.

Even so, Grandin states that [[middle school|junior high]] and [[High school (North America)|high school]] were the most unpleasant times of her life.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grandin |first=Temple |title=Thinking in Pictures: And Other Reports from My Life with Autism |url=https://archive.org/details/thinkinginpictur00gran |url-access=registration |isbn=9780385477925 |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |year=1995}}</ref>\n\nThe medical advice at the time for a diagnosis of autism was to recommend institutionalization, a measure that caused a bitter rift of opinion between Grandin's parents.<ref name=\"wrongplanet\" /> Her father was keen to follow this advice while her mother was strongly opposed to the idea as it likely would have caused her to never be able to see her daughter again.\n\n===Middle school and high school===\nGrandin attended [[Beaver Country Day School]] from seventh grade to ninth grade. She was expelled at the age of 14 for throwing a book at a schoolmate who had taunted her. Grandin has described herself as the \"nerdy kid\" whom everyone ridiculed. She has described occasions when she walked down the hallways and her fellow students would taunt her by saying \"tape recorder\" because of her habit of repetitive speech. Grandin states, \"I could laugh about it now, but back then it really hurt.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Temple Grandin Inducted into Colorado Women's Hall of Fame |url=http://www.wherefoodcomesfrom.com/article/2281/Temple-Grandin-Inducted-into-Colorado-Womens-Hall-of-Fame |date=March 8, 2012 |access-date=April 14, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228000859/http://www.wherefoodcomesfrom.com/article/2281/Temple-Grandin-Inducted-into-Colorado-Womens-Hall-of-Fame |archive-date=December 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe year after her expulsion, Grandin's parents divorced. Three years later, Grandin's mother married Ben Cutler, a New York saxophonist.<ref name=\"nyt\" /> At 15, Grandin spent a summer on the [[Arizona]] [[ranch]] of Ben Cutler's sister, Ann, and this would become a formative experience toward her subsequent career interest.\n\nFollowing her expulsion from Beaver Country Day School (reports vary on the name of the school Grandin was expelled from, with Grandin noting it to be Cherry Falls Girls' School in her first book, ''Emergence: Labelled Autistic''), Grandin's mother placed her in Mountain Country School (now known as [[Hampshire Country School]]), a private boarding school in [[Rindge, New Hampshire]], for children with behavioral problems. It was here that Grandin met William Carlock, a science teacher who had worked for [[NASA]]. He became her mentor and helped significantly toward building up her self-confidence.<ref name=\"testsite\">{{cite web |url=https://www.aspergerstestsite.com/1095/squeeze-machine-by-temple-grandi/ |title=How the squeeze machine came to be |website=Aspergers Test Site |date=June 6, 2013 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt was Carlock who gave Grandin the idea to build her [[hug box]] (referred to as a \"''squeeze machine''\" by Grandin) when she returned from her aunt's farm in Arizona in her senior year of high school.<ref name=\"testsite\" /> At the age of 18 when she was still attending Mountain Country School, with Carlock's assistance Grandin built the hug box.<ref name=\"Grandin\">{{cite journal |url=https://www.grandin.com/inc/squeeze.html |title=Calming Effects of Deep Touch Pressure in Patients with Autistic Disorder, College Students, and Animals |last=Grandin |first=Temple |journal=Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=63\u201372 |date=Spring 1992 |pmid=19630623 |doi=10.1089/cap.1992.2.63 |publisher=[[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.]] |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref> Carlock's supportive role in Grandin's life continued even after she left Mountain Country School. For example, when Grandin was facing criticism for her hug box at [[Franklin Pierce University|Franklin Pierce College]], it was Carlock who suggested that Grandin undertake scientific experiments to evaluate the efficacy of the device.<ref name=\"testsite\" /> It was his constant guidance to Grandin to refocus the rigid obsessions she experienced with the hug box into a productive assignment, that subsequently, allowed this study undertaken by Grandin to be widely cited as evidence of Grandin's resourcefulness.\n\n===Higher education===\nAfter she graduated from [[Hampshire Country School|Mountain Country School]] in 1966, Grandin went on to earn her [[bachelor's degree]] in human [[psychology]] from [[Franklin Pierce University|Franklin Pierce College]] in 1970, a [[master's degree]] in [[animal science]] from [[Arizona State University]] in 1975, and a [[doctoral degree]] in animal science from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]] in 1989.\n\n==Career==\nGrandin is a prominent and widely-cited proponent for the humane treatment of livestock for slaughter. She is internationally famous as a spokesperson on autism as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/temple-grandin |title=Temple Grandin |work=apbspeakers.com |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Autism spectrum===\n[[Steve Silberman]] in his book, ''[[Neurotribes|NeuroTribes]]'', wrote that Temple Grandin helped break down years of shame and stigma because she was one of the first adults to publicly disclose that she was autistic. [[Bernard Rimland]], a father of a son with autism and author of the book, ''Infantile Autism'', wrote the foreword to Grandin's first book ''Emergence: Labeled Autistic''. Her book was published in 1986. Dr. Rimland wrote \"Temple's ability to convey to the reader her innermost feelings and fears, coupled with her capacity for explaining mental processes will give the reader an insight into autism that very few have been able to achieve.\"\n\nIn her later book, ''[[Thinking in Pictures]]'', published in 1995, the neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] wrote at the end of the foreword that the book provided \"a bridge between our world and hers, and allows us to glimpse into a quite other sort of mind.\"\n\nIn her early writings, Grandin characterized herself as a recovered autistic and, in his foreword, [[Bernard Rimland]] used the term recovered autistic individual. In her later writings she has abandoned this characterization. Steve Silberman wrote, \"It became obvious to her, however, that she was not recovered but had learned with great effort to adapt to the social norms of the people around her.\"\n\nWhen her book ''Thinking in Pictures'' was written in 1995, Grandin thought that all individuals with autism thought in photographic-specific images the way she did. By the time the expanded edition was published in 2006, she had realized that it had been wrong to presume that every person with autism processed information in the same way she did. In the 2006 edition, she wrote that there were three types of specialized thinking. They were:  1. Visual Thinkers like she is, who think in photographically-specific images. 2. Music and Math Thinkers \u2013 who think in patterns and may be good at mathematics, chess, and programming computers. 3. Verbal Logic Thinkers \u2013 who think in word details, and she noted that their favorite subject may be history.\n\nIn one of her later books, ''The Autistic Brain: Thinking Across the Spectrum'', the concept of three different types of thinking by autistic individuals is expanded. This book was published in 2013. An influential book that helped her to develop her concept of pattern thinking was [[Clara Claiborne Park]]'s book entitled, ''Exiting Nirvana: A Daughter's Life with Autism''. It was published in 2001. ''The Autistic Brain'' also contains an extensive review of scientific studies that provide evidence that object-visual thinking is different from spatial-visualization abilities.\n\nGrandin became well-known beyond the American autistic community, after being described by [[Oliver Sacks]] in the title narrative of his book, ''[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]'' (1995), for which he won a [[Polk Award]]. The title is derived from Grandin's characterization of how she feels around [[neurotypical]] people. In the mid-1980s Grandin first spoke in public about autism at the request of [[Ruth C. Sullivan]], one of the founders of the [[Autism Society of America]] (ASA). Sullivan writes:\n{{cquote|I first met Temple in the mid-1980s [at the] annual [ASA] conference. Standing on the periphery of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [ASA] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [ASA] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive (\"like being tied to the rail and the train's coming\"). She was asked many questions: \"Why does my son do so much spinning?\" \"Why does he hold his hands to his ears?\" \"Why doesn't he look at me?\" She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=adPodg5MNU0C&pg=PR13&lpg=PR13&dq=temple+grandin+ruth+sullivan#v=onepage&q=temple%20grandin%20ruth%20sullivan&f=false |title=The Way I See It: A Personal Look at Autism and Aspberger's |first=Temple |last=Grandin |publisher=Future Horizons |year=2008 |isbn=9781932565720 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\nBased on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism and supportive teachers, who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]] to noise and other sensory stimuli. She says words are her second language and that she thinks \"totally in pictures\", using her vast visual memory to translate information into a mental slideshow of images that may be manipulated or correlated.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Temple |last=Grandin |title=How does visual thinking work in the mind of a person with autism? A personal account |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=364 |issue=1522 |pages=1437\u20131442 |year=2009 |pmid=19528028 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0297 |pmc=2677580}}</ref> Grandin attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head, that may be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She also is able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows.\n\nAs a proponent of [[neurodiversity]], Grandin does not support eliminating autism genes or treating mildly-autistic individuals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27221|title=Edge.org|website=www.edge.org|access-date=2019-08-17}}</ref> However, she believes that autistic children who are severely handicapped need therapy with [[applied behavioral analysis]].<ref name=\"wrongplanet\" /> Additionally, she has claimed that she only will attend talks given by autistics who can hold down a career.<ref name=\"ArtAutism\">{{cite web |last=Sandison |first=Ron |title=Temple Grandin To Autistic Adults: Get Your Butts Out Of The House And Get A Job |url=https://the-art-of-autism.com/temple-grandin-to-autistic-adults-get-your-butts-out-of-the-house-and-get-a-job/ |website=The Art of Autism |date=April 13, 2017 |access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Handling livestock===\nIn 1980 Grandin published her first two scientific articles on beef cattle behavior during handling: \"Livestock Behavior as Related to Handling Facilities Design\" in the ''International Journal for the Study of Animal Problems, Vol. 1, pp. 33-52'' and \"Observations of Cattle Behavior Applied to the Design of Cattle Handling Facilities\", ''Applied Animal Ethology, Vol. 6, pp. 19-31.'' She was one of the first scientists to report that animals are sensitive to visual distractions in handling facilities such as shadows, dangling chains, and other environmental details that most people do not notice. When she was awarded her Ph.D. at the University of Illinois, she studied the effects of environmental enrichment on pigs. The title of her [[Thesis|dissertation]] was \"Effect of Rearing Environment and Environmental Enrichment on the Behavior and Neural Development in Young Pigs\". Grandin expanded her theories in her book, ''Animals Make Us Human''.\n\nIn 1993, she edited the first edition of ''Livestock Handling and Transport''. Grandin wrote three chapters and included chapters from contributors from around the world. Subsequent editions of the book were published in 2000, 2007, and 2014. In her academic work as a professor at Colorado State University, her graduate student, Bridgett Voisinet, conducted one of the early studies that demonstrated that cattle who remained calm during handling, had higher weight gains. In 1997, when the paper was published, this was a new concept. The paper is entitled, \"Feedlot Cattle with Calm Temperaments Have Higher Average Daily Gains Than Cattle with Excitable Temperaments\", published in ''The Journal of Animal Science, Vol. 75, pp. 892-896.''\n\nAnother important paper published by Grandin was, \"Assessment of Stress During Handling and Transport\", ''Journal of Animal Science, 1997, Vol. 75, pp. 249-257''. This paper presented the concept that an animal's previous experiences with handling could have an effect on how it will react to being handled in the future, as a new concept in the animal-handling industry.\n\nA major piece of equipment that Grandin developed was a center track (double rail) conveyor restrainer system for holding cattle during stunning at large beef slaughtering plants. The first system was installed in the mid-1980s for calves and a system for large beef cattle was developed in 1990. This equipment is now being used by many large meat companies. It is described in \"Double Rail Restrainer Conveyor for Livestock Handling\", first published in the ''Journal of Agricultural Engineering Research, Vol. 4, pp. 327-338'' in 1988, and \"Transferring results of behavioral research to industry to improve animal welfare on the farm, ranch, and slaughter plant\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 8, pp. 215-228'', published in 2003.\n\nGrandin also developed an objective, numerical scoring system for assessing animal welfare at [[Slaughterhouse|slaughtering plants]]. The use of this scoring system resulted in significant improvements in animal stunning and handling during slaughter. This work is described in \"Objective scoring of animal handling and stunning practices in slaughter plants\", ''[[American Veterinary Medical Association|Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association]], Vol. 212, pp. 36-39, \"The feasibility of using vocalization scoring as an indicator of poor welfare during slaughter\", ''Applied Animal Behavior Science, Vol. 56, pp.&nbsp;121\u2013128,'' and \"Effect of animal welfare audits of slaughter plants by a major fast food company on cattle handling and stunning practices\", ''Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association, Vol. 216, pp.&nbsp;848\u2013851.\n\nIn 2008, Grandin published ''Humane Livestock Handling''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/humanelivestockh0000gran|title=Humane livestock handling|last=Grandin, Temple.|date=2008|publisher=Storey Pub|others=Deesing, Mark.|isbn=9781603420280|location=North Adams, MA|oclc=176902393|url-access=registration}}</ref> with contributions by Mark Deesing, a long time collaborator with her. The book contains a review of the main aspects of cattle behavior and provides a visual guide in the form of construction plans and diagrams for the implementation of Grandin's ideas relating to humane livestock handling.\n\n===Other scientific contributions===\nGrandin is the author or co-author of more than 60 peer-reviewed scientific papers on a variety of other animal behavior subjects. Some of the other subjects are: the effect of hair whorl position on cattle behavior, the influence of stress prior to slaughter upon meat quality, religious slaughter, mothering behavior of beef cows, cattle temperament, and causes of bruising.\n\n===Animal welfare===\nGrandin has lectured widely about her first-hand experiences of the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes. She studied the behavior of cattle, how they react to ranchers, movements, objects, and light. Grandin then designed curved corrals she adapted with the intention of reducing stress, panic, and injury in animals being led to [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]]. This has proved to be a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's head in her hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep connection to them.<ref>{{cite book |last=Coe |first=Sue |title=Cruel: bearing witness to animal exploitation. |date=2012 |publisher=OR Books |location=New York |isbn=978-1-935928-72-0 |page=64}}</ref>\n\nHer business website promotes improvement of standards for [[slaughterhouse]]s and livestock farms.

She compares the properties and rights of owning cattle, versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both may be used to serve human purposes in many ways, but when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such \"properties\", because legally, a person can smash or grind up a screwdriver, but cannot [[torture]] an animal.\n\nHer insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASABE Fellows |url=http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) |access-date=April 14, 2019 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030144237/http://www.asabe.org/media/199220/fellows_citations_since_97_for_website.pdf |archive-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, when the American beef industry was struggling with public perception of its use and sale of [[pink slime]], Grandin spoke out in support of the food product. She said, \"It should be on the market. It should be labeled. We should not be throwing away that much beef.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Animal scientist Temple Grandin supports 'pink slime' |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/all-we-can-eat/post/animal-scientist-temple-grandin-supports-pink-slime/2012/05/23/gJQAyrDnlU_blog.html |date=May 23, 2012 |first=Tim |last=Carman |access-date=April 14, 2019 |work=Washington Post}}</ref>\n\nGrandin's work has attracted the attention of philosophers interested in the moral status of animals.

She later stated, for example, that she preferred the [[science fiction]], [[documentary]], and [[thriller (genre)|thriller]] genre of films and television shows to more dramatic or romantic ones. Beyond her work in animal science and welfare and autism rights, her interests include [[Equestrianism|horseback riding]], [[science fiction]], [[Film|movies]], and [[biochemistry]].\n\nShe has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. Grandin has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her [[sensory processing disorder]] and has structured her lifestyle to avoid [[sensory overload]]. She regularly takes [[antidepressant]]s, but no longer uses a squeeze-box ([[hug machine]]), the device she invented at the age of 18 as a form of stress relief therapy,<ref name=\"Grandin\" /> stating in February 2010 that: \"It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it.

I experienced this making Clone Wars as well as making Mandalorian\u2026 Before, I would have to come in at a certain length for every single episode of Clone Wars or Rebels and I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019d love just an extra 30 seconds.\u2019 It might not seem significant to a viewer, but it is actually a significant amount of time. So I love the flexibility of the space that allows you to tell the story in the way that you really intend.

And we\u2019re proud of our team that came together to make this show. We feel really good about it and we want the audience to feel good about it. We want them to get that feeling of adventure and excitement. We like that we're not dealing with the bigger moving, shaking, moments of the galaxy, but kinda of a gritty, underbelly, street level view you know, which to me, reminds me more of what I pictured coming out of \u201cA New Hope\u201d. It\u2019s more of that realm of cantinas and villainy. But there\u2019s something brewing maybe. And that could be quiet fighting.

I experienced this making Clone Wars as well as making Mandalorian\u2026 Before, I would have to come in at a certain length for every single episode of Clone Wars or Rebels and I thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019d love just an extra 30 seconds.\u2019 It might not seem significant to a viewer, but it is actually a significant amount of time. So I love the flexibility of the space that allows you to tell the story in the way that you really intend.

And we\u2019re proud of our team that came together to make this show. We feel really good about it and we want the audience to feel good about it. We want them to get that feeling of adventure and excitement. We like that we're not dealing with the bigger moving, shaking, moments of the galaxy, but kinda of a gritty, underbelly, street level view you know, which to me, reminds me more of what I pictured coming out of \u201cA New Hope\u201d. It\u2019s more of that realm of cantinas and villainy. But there\u2019s something brewing maybe. And that could be quiet fighting.

His [[English people|English]] paternal ancestors emigrated to America in the 17th century, originally settling in [[Queen Anne's County, Maryland]]. Knotts' brothers were named Willis, William, and Ralph.\n\nDon's mother was 40 at the time of his birth and his father suffered from mental illness; he had a [[nervous breakdown]] due to the stress of Don's birth.

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''.

Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy\u2014and originally cousin\u2014of Sheriff [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy]], three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character.<ref>{{cite book |last = Monush |first = Barry |title = Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965 |volume = 1 |year = 2003 |publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn = 1-55783-551-9 |page = 397 }}</ref>\n\nA summary of the show from the website of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] describes Deputy Barney Fife:\n\n{{quote|Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = Mayberry Memories: The Andy Griffith Show Photo Album |edition = 40 |year = 2000 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 1-55853-830-5 |page = 6 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts believed remarks by Griffith that ''The Andy Griffith Show'' would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with [[Universal Studios]]. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] and [[Helen Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Norman Fell]] and [[Audra Lindley]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series ''[[The Ropers]]''.\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

After high school, he traveled to [[New York City]] to try to make his way as a comedian but returned home to attend West Virginia University when his career failed to take off. After his college freshman year, Knotts joined the U.S. Army and spent most of his service entertaining troops.<ref name=drill /> He toured the western [[Pacific Islands]] as a comedian as part of a G.I. variety show called \"Stars and Gripes\".<ref name=biography>{{cite web |url = http://www.biography.com/people/don-knotts-9542240 |title = Biography of Don Knotts |website = biography.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nHis [[ventriloquist]] act included a dummy named Danny \"Hooch\" Matador. In a ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine interview in the 1970s, he said that he had grown tired of playing straight man for a hunk of wood when he was in the Army. According to Knotts, he tossed the dummy overboard off a ship in the [[Australasia|South Pacific]].\n\nKnotts served in the U.S. Army from June 21, 1943, to January 6, 1946. Discharged in the rank of Technician Grade 5, which was the equivalent then of a Corporal. During his military service, Knotts was awarded the World War II Victory Medal, Philippine Liberation Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (with 4 bronze service stars), Army Good Conduct Medal, Marksman Badge (with an [[M1 Carbine]]) and Honorable Service lapel pin.\n\nKnotts returned to West Virginia University after being demobilized and graduated in 1948. He married and moved back to New York, where connections he had made while in the Special Services Branch helped him break into show business. In addition to doing stand-up comedy at clubs, he appeared on the radio, eventually playing the wisecracking, know-it-all character \"Windy Wales\" on a radio Western called \"[[Bobby Benson and the B-Bar-B Riders]]\".<ref name=obituary>{{cite web |url = http://www.legacy.com/ns/don-knotts-obituary/16845505 |title = Don Knotts Obituary |website = legacy.com |access-date = February 8, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts got his first major break on television in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]'' where he appeared from 1953 to 1955. He came to fame in 1956 on [[Steve Allen]]'s variety show, as part of Allen's repertory company, most notably in Allen's mock \"Man in the Street\" interviews, always as an extremely nervous man. He remained with the Allen program through the 1959\u20131960 season. From October 20, 1955, through September 14, 1957, Knotts appeared in the Broadway play version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants]]'', in which he played two roles, listed on the playbill as a Corporal Manual Dexterity and a Preacher.<ref>{{cite web |title = No Time for Sergeants: Opening Night Cast |work = [[Playbill (magazine)|Playbill]] |date = March 30, 2014 }}</ref> In 1958, Knotts appeared for the first time on film with [[Andy Griffith]] in the film version of ''[[No Time for Sergeants (1958 film)|No Time for Sergeants]]''. In that film, Knotts reprises his Broadway role and plays a high-strung Air Force test administrator whose routine is disrupted by the hijinks of a provincial new recruit.\n\n=== ''The Andy Griffith Show'' ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Don Knotts 1960.JPG|thumb|As Barney Fife, Knotts gets the help of Sheriff Taylor when his gun gets stuck on his finger]]\n[[File:DonKnotts1961.jpg|thumb|Knotts receives his first [[Emmy Award]] for ''The Andy Griffith Show'', 1961]]\nIn 1960, Andy Griffith was offered the opportunity to headline his own [[sitcom]], ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'' (1960\u20131968). Knotts took the role of Barney Fife, the deputy\u2014and originally cousin\u2014of Sheriff [[Andy Taylor (The Andy Griffith Show)|Andy Taylor]] (portrayed by Griffith). Knotts's portrayal of the deputy on the popular show earned him five [[Emmy Award]]s for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series|Best Supporting Actor in a Television Comedy]], three awards for the first five seasons that he played the character.<ref>{{cite book |last = Monush |first = Barry |title = Screen World Presents the Encyclopedia of Hollywood Film Actors: From the Silent Era to 1965 |volume = 1 |year = 2003 |publisher = Hal Leonard Corporation |isbn = 1-55783-551-9 |page = 397 }}</ref>\n\nA summary of the show from the website of the [[Museum of Broadcast Communications]] describes Deputy Barney Fife:\n\n{{quote|Self-important, romantic, and nearly always wrong, Barney dreamed of the day he could use the one bullet Andy had issued to him, though he did fire his gun on a few occasions. He always fired his pistol accidentally while still in his holster or in the ceiling of the court house, at which point he would sadly hand his pistol to Andy. This is why Barney kept his one very shiny bullet in his shirt pocket. In episode #196, Andy gave Barney more bullets so that he would have a loaded gun to go after a bad guy that Barney unintentionally helped escape. While Barney was forever frustrated that Mayberry was too small for the delusional ideas he had of himself, viewers got the sense that he couldn't have survived anywhere else. Don Knotts played the comic and pathetic sides of the character with equal aplomb and he received three Emmy Awards during the show's first five seasons.<ref>[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm \"Don Knotts.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522043858/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/A/htmlA/andygriffith/andygriffith.htm |date=May 22, 2008 }} Museum of Broadcast Communications</ref>}}\n\nWhen the show first aired, Griffith was intended to be the comedic lead with Knotts as his [[straight man]], similar to their roles in ''No Time for Sergeants''. However, it was quickly discovered that the show was funnier with the roles reversed. As Griffith maintained in several interviews, \"By the second episode, I knew that Don should be funny, and I should play straight.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = Mayberry Memories: The Andy Griffith Show Photo Album |edition = 40 |year = 2000 |publisher = Thomas Nelson Inc |isbn = 1-55853-830-5 |page = 6 }}</ref>\n\nKnotts believed remarks by Griffith that ''The Andy Griffith Show'' would end after five seasons, and he began to look for other work, signing a five-film contract with [[Universal Studios]]. He was caught off guard when Griffith announced that he would continue the show after all, but Knotts's hands were tied. In his autobiography, Knotts admitted that he had not yet signed a contract when Griffith announced his decision; but he had made up his mind to move on, believing he would not get the chance again. Knotts left the series in 1965. His character's absence on the show was explained by Deputy Fife's having finally made the \"big time,\" joining the Raleigh, North Carolina police force.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Beck |first1 = Ken |last2 = Clark |first2 = Jim |title = The Andy Griffith Show Book |edition = 3 |year = 2000 |publisher = Macmillan |isbn = 0-312-26287-6 |page = 129 }}</ref>\n\n=== Post-Mayberry film career ===\n[[File:Andy Griffith Ernie Ford Don Knotts Andy Griffith Special 1967.JPG|thumb|On a 1967 Andy Griffith special, Knotts plays the outraged wife of [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]], as Griffith looks on]]\nKnotts went on to star in a series of film comedies that drew on his high-strung persona from the television series: he had a cameo appearance in [[United Artists]]' ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963), and starred in [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[The Incredible Mr. Limpet]]'' (1964). Knotts then began his Universal five-film contract with ''[[The Ghost and Mr. Chicken]]'' (1966), ''[[The Reluctant Astronaut]]'' (1967), ''[[The Shakiest Gun in the West]]'' (1968), ''[[The Love God?]]'' (1969) and ''[[How to Frame a Figg]]'' (1971). Knotts reprised his role as Barney Fife several times in the 1960s: he made five guest appearances on ''The Andy Griffith Show'' (gaining him another two Emmy Awards), and he later appeared once on the [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Mayberry R.F.D.]]'', where he was present as best man for the marriage of Andy Taylor and his longtime love, [[Helen Crump]].\n\nAfter making ''How to Frame a Figg'', Knotts's five-film contract with Universal finished. He continued to work steadily, though he did not appear as a regular on any successful television series until his appearance on ''[[Three's Company]]'' in 1979. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Knotts served as the spokesman for [[Dodge]] trucks and was featured prominently in a series of print ads and dealer brochures. On television, he went on to host a variety show/sitcom hybrid on [[NBC]], ''The Don Knotts Show'', which aired Tuesdays during the fall of 1970, but the series was low-rated and short-lived. He also made frequent guest appearances on other shows such as ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'' and ''[[Here's Lucy]]''. In 1970, he appeared as a Barney Fife-like police officer in the pilot of ''[[The New Andy Griffith Show]]''. In 1972, Knotts voiced an animated version of himself in two episodes of ''[[The New Scooby Doo Movies]]'': \"The Spooky Fog of Juneberry\", in which he played a lawman resembling Barney Fife, and \"Guess Who's Knott Coming to Dinner\". He also appeared as Felix Unger in a stage version of [[Neil Simon]]'s ''[[The Odd Couple (play)|The Odd Couple]]'', with [[Art Carney]] as Oscar Madison.\n\nBeginning in 1975, Knotts was teamed with [[Tim Conway]] in a series of [[slapstick]] films aimed at children, including the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang (film)|The Apple Dumpling Gang]]'' (1975) and its sequel, ''[[The Apple Dumpling Gang Rides Again]]'' (1979). They also did two independent films, the boxing comedy ''[[The Prize Fighter]]'' (1979), and the mystery-comedy ''[[The Private Eyes (1980 film)|The Private Eyes]]'' (1980). Knotts co-starred in several other Disney films, including ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]]'' (1976), ''[[No Deposit, No Return]]'' (1976), ''[[Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo]]'' (1977) and ''[[Hot Lead and Cold Feet]]'' (1978).\n\n=== ''Three's Company'' ===\nIn 1979, Knotts returned to series television in his second most identifiable role, the wacky-but-lovable landlord [[Ralph Furley]] on ''[[Three's Company]]''. The series, which was already an established hit, added Knotts to the cast when the original landlords, [[Stanley Roper|Stanley]] and [[Helen Roper]] (a married couple played by [[Norman Fell]] and [[Audra Lindley]], respectively) left the series to star in their own short-lived spin-off series ''[[The Ropers]]''.\n\nOn set, Knotts easily integrated himself to the already-established cast who were, as [[John Ritter]] put it, \"so scared\" of Knotts because of his star status when he joined the cast. When [[Suzanne Somers]] left the show after a contract dispute in 1981, the writers started giving the material meant for Somers's Chrissy to Knotts's Furley. Knotts remained on the series until it ended in 1984. The ''Three's Company'' script supervisor, Carol Summers, became Knotts' agent and often accompanied him to personal appearances.\n\n=== Later years ===\nIn 1986, Don Knotts reunited with Andy Griffith in the made-for-television film ''[[Return to Mayberry]]'', again reprising his Barney Fife role. In early 1987, Knotts joined the cast of the first-run syndication comedy ''[[What a Country!]]'', playing Principal Bud McPherson for the series' remaining 13 episodes. The sitcom was produced by Martin Rips and Joseph Staretski, who had previously worked on ''Three's Company''. In 1988, Knotts joined Andy Griffith in another show, playing the recurring role of pesky neighbor Les Calhoun on ''[[Matlock (TV series)|Matlock]]'' until 1992.\n\nAfter that, Knotts's roles were sporadic, including a [[cameo appearance]] in the film ''[[Big Bully (film)|Big Bully]]'' (1996) as the principal of the high school. In 1998, Knotts played a small but pivotal role as a mysterious TV repairman in ''[[Pleasantville (film)|Pleasantville]]''. That year, his home town of [[Morgantown, West Virginia]], changed the name of the street formerly known as ''South University Avenue'' ([[U.S. Route 119 in West Virginia|U.S. Route 119]]) to ''Don Knotts Boulevard'' on \"Don Knotts Day.\" Also that day, in honor of Knotts's role as Barney Fife, he was named an honorary deputy sheriff with the [[Monongalia County, West Virginia|Monongalia County]] Sheriff's Department.\n\nKnotts was recognized in 2000 with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. He continued to act on stage, but much of his film and television work after 2000 was as voice talent. In 2002, he appeared again with [[Scooby-Doo]] in the video game ''[[Scooby-Doo! Night of 100 Frights]]''. (Knotts also spoofed his appearances on that show in various promotions for [[Cartoon Network]] and in a parody on ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', where he was teamed with [[Phyllis Diller]].) In 2003, Knotts teamed up with [[Tim Conway]] again to provide voices for the direct-to-video children's series ''[[Hermie and Friends]]'', which continued until his death. In 2005, he was the voice of Mayor Turkey Lurkey in ''[[Chicken Little (2005 film)|Chicken Little]]'' (2005), his first Disney movie since 1979. On September 12, 2003, Knotts was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] in a stage version of ''[[On Golden Pond (play)|On Golden Pond]]'' when he received a call from [[John Ritter]]'s family telling him that his former ''Three's Company'' co-star had died of an [[aortic dissection]] that day.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Knotts and his co-stars attended the funeral four days later. Knotts had appeared with Ritter one final time in a cameo on ''[[8 Simple Rules]] for Dating My Teenage Daughter''. It was an episode that paid homage to their earlier television series. Knotts was the last ''Three's Company'' star to work with Ritter.\n\nDuring this period of time, [[macular degeneration]] in both eyes caused the otherwise robust Knotts to become virtually blind. His live appearances on television were few. In 2005, Knotts parodied his Ralph Furley character while playing a [[Paul Young (Desperate Housewives)|Paul Young]] variation in a ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' sketch on ''[[TV Land Award|The 3rd Annual TV Land Awards]]''. He parodied that part one final time in \"Stone Cold Crazy\", an episode of the sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''. In the show, Knotts played Fez and Jackie's new landlord. This was his last live-action television appearance. His final role was in ''[[Air Buddies]]'' (2006) (a direct-to-video sequel to ''[[Air Bud]]''), voicing the sheriff's deputy dog, Sniffer.\n\n== Personal life ==\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\nKnotts was married three times. His marriage to Kathryn Metz lasted from 1947 until their divorce in 1964. He married Loralee Czuchna in 1974 and they divorced in 1983. His third marriage was to Frances Yarborough, from 2002 until his death in 2006. From his first marriage, Knotts had a son, Thomas Knotts, and a daughter, actress [[Karen Knotts]] (born April 2, 1954).\n\nKnotts struggled with [[hypochondria]] and [[macular degeneration]].<ref name=\"biography\" /><ref name=\"Obit\">{{cite news |last1 = Collins |first1 = Scott |title = Don Knotts, star of 'The Andy Griffith Show,' dead at 81 |url = http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/25/nation/la-na-donknotts-obit/2 |accessdate = July 19, 2017 |work = Los Angeles Times |date = February 25, 2006 }}</ref> [[Betty Lynn]], one of Knotts' co-stars on ''The Andy Griffith Show'', described him as a \"very quiet man.

The work was completed about 65 years after Weber's death by [[Gustav Mahler]].\n\n==Composition history==\nIn 1821, [[Theodor Hell]] developed a drama called ''The Battle for the Bride'', with a story taken from ''Der Brautkampf'' (1819) by {{Interlanguage link multi|Carl Seidel|de}}. Hell gave his friend Weber the text, but Weber disliked the title and changed it to ''Die drei Pintos'' (\"The Three Pintos\"). The title comes from the protagonist, Don Pinto, who is impersonated by two other characters in the course of the opera.\n\nWeber began composing the score and worked at it off and on from then until 1824, but other work including ''Euryanthe'' intervened and it remained incomplete at his death in 1826. All that existed, so far, were a number of coded fragments of music: 7 sketches for 17 numbers, and a total of bars scored out of an eventual total of 1700 bars.\n\nWeber's bereaved family made a number of unsuccessful attempts to have ''Die drei Pintos'' completed, but eventually his widow Caroline took the draft to [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], a composer, and friend of Theodor Hell. For some reason, Meyerbeer did nothing and &mdash; 26 years later, just before Caroline died &mdash; the fragments were returned to her untouched. Her son Max then approached various composers seeking one who would finish the opera, but he was advised to \"give up\".\n\nAfter Max's death in 1881, his son Carl (Carl senior's grandson) inherited the composer's musical estate, and vigorously continued the task of trying to find someone to complete the opera. He eventually encountered the 26-year-old [[Gustav Mahler]], who was working as second conductor at the [[Leipzig]] Stadttheater for the 1886-87 season. Mahler was keen to help, and became a regular visitor at the Webers' residence (ostensibly to deal with operatic matters though he was also enamoured of Carl's wife Marion; Carl tried to ignore that situation as best he could). \n\nIn the spring of 1887, Mahler cracked C. M. von Weber's code, unscrambled the drafts and instrumentalized the existing fragments in accordance with Weber's wishes. A further 13 musical numbers were needed in addition to the existing 7, and Mahler went ahead and composed this music himself, based on Weber's themes. It was decided that the original shape of the opera should be kept: a dialogue with musical numbers. However, the interlude music between Acts I and II (Pinto's dream) and the two-part finale of Act III were written by Mahler, although still based on Weber's [[leitmotif]]s and [[Theme (music)|themes]].\n\n==Performance history==\nMahler had been an admirer of Weber, and in this way he succeeded in creating a complete opera which was premiered at the Neues Stadttheater, [[Leipzig]] on 20 January 1888, with Mahler conducting. [[Richard Strauss]] admired the work, but appears to have changed his opinion after his mentor [[Hans von B\u00fclow]] panned it; like B\u00fclow, the influential critic [[Eduard Hanslick]] was also critical. \n\nAfter Mahler's death (1911) ''Die drei Pintos'' gradually disappeared from regular production. Although it is rarely produced nowadays, the \"Intermezzo\", composed entirely by Mahler based on melodies by Weber, hints at the flute calls (echoed by other wind instruments such as the oboe and bassoon) in the slow section of the first movement of Mahler's Symphony no. 1. \n\nPerformances are rare. There was a production at the John Lewis Theatre in [[London]] on 10 April 1962 and a concert performance at the [[Edinburgh International Festival]] in 1976.  The American premi\u00e8re, given by the [[Opera Theatre of Saint Louis]], took place on 6 June 1979, and in June 1997 a concert performance was given as part of the [[Vienna Festival]]. In January 1998, seven fully staged performances in a new production conducted by [[Geoffrey Moull]] were given by the [[Bielefeld Opera]] in Germany. In February 1998, three performances in English were given in a fully staged production by [http://www.operasouth.co.uk Opera Omnibus] in [[Haslemere]],  England. A concert performance of Zychowicz's edition of the opera was conducted by Leonard Botsteinat the Bard Festival in Fall 2002.  In October 2003, there were six performances of a new production at the [[Wexford Festival Opera|Wexford Festival]].  In January 2010, the Bronx Opera Company gave the New York staged the premiere of an English-language version of the work (http://www.musicweb-international.com/sandh/2010/Jan-Jun10/drei_pintos.htm). In March 2011, there were four performances by [[UCOpera]] at the [[Bloomsbury Theatre]] near [[University College London]]. In 2013 it was successfully performed by [[Moscow Chamber Musical Theatre|Moscow Pokrovsky Chamber Musical Theatre]], conducted by [[Gennady Rozhdestvensky]].\n\n== Roles ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Role\n!Voice type\n!Premiere cast<ref>{{cite web\n     | url = http://amadeusonline.eu/almanacco.php?Start=0&Giorno=20&Mese=01&Anno=1888&Giornata=&Testo=&Parola=Stringa\n     | title = Almanacco 20 January 1888\n     | publisher = AmadeusOnline\n     | language = Italian\n     | accessdate = 27 September 2010\n}}</ref><br />20 January 1888<br />(Conductor: Gustav Mahler)\n|-\n|Don Pantaleone Roiz de Pacheco, ''a nobleman'' || [[bass (voice type)|bass]] || [[Bernhard K\u00f6hler]]\n|-\n|Don Gomez de Freiros, ''a nobleman'' || [[tenor]] || [[Jacob H\u00fcbner (tenor)|Jacob H\u00fcbner]]\n|-\n|Clarissa, ''Don Pantaleone's daughter'' || [[soprano]] || [[Emma Baumann]]\n|-\n|Laura, ''Clarissa's maid'' || [[mezzo-soprano]] || [[Josefine von Artner]]\n|-\n|Don Gaston de Viratos, ''a former student'' || tenor || Charles Hedmondt\n|-\n|Ambrosio, ''Don Gaston's servant'' || [[baritone]] || [[Otto Schelper]]\n|-\n|Don Pinto de Fonseca, ''a young country squire'' || bass || [[Karl Grengg]]\n|-\n|Inez, ''the Innkeeper's daughter'' || soprano || {{ill|Therese Rothauser|de}}\n|-\n|Innkeeper || bass || August Proft\n|-\n|Major-domo || tenor ||\n|-\n|colspan=\"3\" |Chorus: ''students, villagers and servants of Don Pantaleone''\n|}\n\n== Synopsis ==\n:Time:  Late 17th century\n:Place:  Moorish Spain\n\n===Act 1===\nDon Gaston de Viratos is taking leave of his friends before leaving for [[Madrid]], where he is set to become a government official and also hopes to find a bride. Inez, daughter of the innkeeper, tells him (by way of a warning) of the \"romance of the lovesick cat Mansor\", the song of a faithless lover who, despite burning lover's oaths, leaves his Zaide in the lurch. \n\nNow Don Pinto de Fonseca, a foolish country squire, appears; he is also on his way to Madrid, to marry Donna Clarissa. The marriage has been arranged between the two fathers and he is worried about his first meeting with the girl, whom he has never met: how does one woo one's future wife? Gaston proceeds to teach him all the arts of the fiery lover \u2014 his servant Ambrosio having to play the part of the bride. \n\nWhen Pinto, now exhausted, turns to food and drink, Gaston decides to save the unknown girl from this uncouth wooer: he makes Pinto drunk and takes from him the letter promising marriage. To the amusement of the other guests at the inn, Gaston and Ambrosio put the sleeping Don Pinto to bed, so that he can sleep off his drunkenness and they can proceed to Madrid.\n\n===Act 2===\nDon Pantaleone Roiz de Pacheco has assembled all his servants, and they are wondering why. He then appears himself, and announces the marriage of his daughter Clarissa to the son of a friend, Don Pinto. In the general joy which ensues, nobody notices Clarissa's despair: she loves Don Gomez de Freiros, and wants to marry no other. Her love has had to be kept secret, because Gomez was forced into hiding following a duel. Clarissa's servant Laura consoles and encourages her. She brings Gomez to the house secretly, and he is determined to defend his love with his sword. \n\n===Act 3===\nLaura and the servants are preparing the hall in Don Pantaleone's palace for the wedding. Gaston and Ambrosio discover Laura, whom Ambrosio succeeds in winning for himself. Gomez comes across Gaston, whom he takes to be Don Pinto; and he reveals to him his love for Clarissa. The false Pinto (Gaston) insists upon the rights of the stolen letter with its promise of marriage, and challenges Clarissa's lover (Gomez) to a duel. Gomez, anxious to avoid any insult, offers him satisfaction. However Pinto-Gaston generously releases the girl before Pantaleone's people come to greet the bridegroom, and they decide that Don Gomez will present himself as (that is, claim to be) Don Pinto to get around the plans of the bride's father. \n\nDon Pantaleone is just bringing in his daughter, the bride, when the real Pinto enters the hall. Nobody believes his assurances that he is Don Pinto de Fonseca, and when he tries to show his bride the art of wooing learned from the student Gaston, he is ridiculed. He then notices Gaston and rushes at him so angrily that the latter has to threaten him with his sword. Don Pinto is thrown out, Gaston and Ambrosio are satisfied with the outcome of their adventure, and nothing now stands in the way of the marriage between Clarissa and Gomez.\n\n==Recordings==\n* Werner Hollweg, [[Hermann Prey]], [[Lucia Popp]] et al., [[Munich Philharmonic Orchestra]] conductor [[Gary Bertini]] (studio recording, [[RCA Red Seal]], 1976).\n* Gunnar Gudbj\u00f6rnsson, Alessandro Svab, [[Barbara Zechmeister]] et al., Wexford Festival Opera Chorus, National Philharmonic Orchestra of Belarus, conductor Paolo Arrivabeni (live performance, Naxos, 2004), a performance that received a review in the now defunct magazine Stereo Review.\n\n==References==\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist}}\n'''Sources'''\n*Holden, Amanda (Ed.), ''The New Penguin Opera Guide'', New York: Penguin Putnam, 2001. {{ISBN|0-14-029312-4}}\n*Production programme (February 1998) based on libretto (English translation by Rodney Blumen)\n*Zychowicz, James L.
