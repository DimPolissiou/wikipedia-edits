Allegations of SRA involved reports of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]] of people in the context of [[occult]] or [[Theistic Satanism|Satanic]] rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a worldwide SRA organization that includes the wealthy and powerful of the world elite in which children are abducted or bred for [[human sacrifice]]s, [[child pornography|pornography]], and [[prostitution]].\n\nNearly every aspect of SRA was controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers', therapists', and social workers' handling of allegations of [[child sexual abuse]]. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in [[psychotherapy]]. The movement gradually secularized, dropping or deprecating the \"Satanic\" aspects of the allegations in favor of names that were less overtly religious such as \"sadistic\" or simply \"ritual abuse\" and becoming more associated with [[dissociative identity disorder]] and anti-government [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].\n\nInitial publicity came via [[Lawrence Pazder]]'s 1980 book ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' and was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by the [[McMartin preschool trial]]. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences, as well as through the attention of [[talk show]]s, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as one researcher put it in 2017, \"involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America's white middle-class suburban daycare centers.\"<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0021875817000858 | volume=51 | title=Editors\u2019 Note | year=2017 | journal=Journal of American Studies | pages=v\u2013vii | last1 = Bernier | first1 = Celeste-Marie | last2 = Sewell | first2 = Bevan | last3 = Moynihan | first3 = Sin\u00e9ad | last4 = Witham | first4 = Nick}}</ref>\n\nOfficial investigations produced no evidence of widespread conspiracies or of the slaughter of thousands;

McHugh]], professor of psychiatry at [[Johns Hopkins University]] discusses in his book ''Try to Remember'' the developments that led to the creation of false memories in the SRA moral panic and the formation of the FMSF as an effort to bring contemporary scientific research and political action to the polarizing struggle about false memories within the mental health disciplines. According to McHugh, there is no coherent scientific basis for the core belief of one side of the struggle, that sexual abuse can cause massive systemic repression of memories that can only be accessed through hypnosis, coercive interviews and other dubious techniques. The group of psychiatrists who promoted these ideas, whom McHugh terms \"[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] Freudians\", consistently followed a [[deductive reasoning|deductive approach]] to diagnosis in which the theory and causal explanation of symptoms was assumed to be childhood sexual abuse leading to dissociation, followed by a set of unproven and unreliable treatments with a strong [[confirmation bias]] that inevitably produced the allegations and causes that were assumed to be there.\n\nThe treatment approach involved isolation of the patient from friends and family within psychiatric wards dedicated to the treatment of dissociation, filled with other patients who were treated by the same doctors with the same flawed methods and staff members who also coherently and universally ascribed to the same set of beliefs. These methods began in the 1980s and continued for several years until a series of court cases and [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits resulted in hospitals failing to support the approach. In cases where the dissociative symptoms were ignored, the coercive treatment approach ceased and the patients were removed from dedicated wards, allegations of satanic rape and abuse normally ceased, \"recovered\" memories were identified as fabrications and conventional treatments for presenting symptoms were generally successful.<ref>{{cite book |last=McHugh |first=PR |authorlink=Paul R.

Allegations of SRA involved reports of [[Physical abuse|physical]] and [[sexual abuse]] of people in the context of [[occult]] or [[Theistic Satanism|Satanic]] rituals. In its most extreme form, allegations involve a conspiracy of a worldwide SRA organization that includes the wealthy and powerful of the world elite in which children are abducted or bred for [[human sacrifice]]s, [[child pornography|pornography]], and [[prostitution]].\n\nNearly every aspect of SRA was controversial, including its definition, the source of the allegations and proof thereof, testimonies of alleged victims, and court cases involving the allegations and criminal investigations. The panic affected lawyers', therapists', and social workers' handling of allegations of [[child sexual abuse]]. Allegations initially brought together widely dissimilar groups, including religious fundamentalists, police investigators, child advocates, therapists, and clients in [[psychotherapy]]. The movement gradually secularized, dropping or deprecating the \"Satanic\" aspects of the allegations in favor of names that were less overtly religious such as \"sadistic\" or simply \"ritual abuse\" and becoming more associated with [[dissociative identity disorder]] and anti-government [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].\n\nInitial publicity came via [[Lawrence Pazder]]'s 1980 book ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' and was sustained and popularized throughout the decade by the [[McMartin preschool trial]]. Testimonials, symptom lists, rumors, and techniques to investigate or uncover memories of SRA were disseminated through professional, popular, and religious conferences, as well as through the attention of [[talk show]]s, sustaining and further spreading the moral panic throughout the United States and beyond. In some cases, allegations resulted in criminal trials with varying results; after seven years in court, the McMartin trial resulted in no convictions for any of the accused, while other cases resulted in lengthy sentences, some of which were later reversed. Scholarly interest in the topic slowly built, eventually resulting in the conclusion that the phenomenon was a moral panic, which, as one researcher put it in 2017, \"involved hundreds of accusations that devil-worshipping paedophiles were operating America's white middle-class suburban daycare centers.\"<ref>BERNIER, C., SEWELL, B., MOYNIHAN, S., & WITHAM, N.

SRA allegations in the courts catalyzed a broad agenda of research into the nature of children's testimony and the reliability of their oral evidence in court. Ultimately in SRA cases, the coercive techniques used by believing district attorneys, therapists and police officers were critical in establishing, and often resolving, SRA cases.

McHugh]], professor of psychiatry at [[Johns Hopkins University]] discusses in his book ''Try to Remember'' the developments that led to the creation of false memories in the SRA moral panic and the formation of the FMSF as an effort to bring contemporary scientific research and political action to the polarizing struggle about false memories within the mental health disciplines. According to McHugh, there is no coherent scientific basis for the core belief of one side of the struggle, that sexual abuse can cause massive systemic repression of memories that can only be accessed through hypnosis, coercive interviews and other dubious techniques. The group of psychiatrists who promoted these ideas, whom McHugh terms \"[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] Freudians\", consistently followed a [[deductive reasoning|deductive approach]] to diagnosis in which the theory and causal explanation of symptoms was assumed to be childhood sexual abuse leading to dissociation, followed by a set of unproven and unreliable treatments with a strong [[confirmation bias]] that inevitably produced the allegations and causes that were assumed to be there.\n\nThe treatment approach involved isolation of the patient from friends and family within psychiatric wards dedicated to the treatment of dissociation, filled with other patients who were treated by the same doctors with the same flawed methods and staff members who also coherently and universally ascribed to the same set of beliefs. These methods began in the 1980s and continued for several years until a series of court cases and [[medical malpractice]] lawsuits resulted in hospitals failing to support the approach. In cases where the dissociative symptoms were ignored, the coercive treatment approach ceased and the patients were removed from dedicated wards, allegations of satanic rape and abuse normally ceased, \"recovered\" memories were identified as fabrications and conventional treatments for presenting symptoms were generally successful.<ref>{{cite book |last=McHugh |first=PR |authorlink=Paul R.

Written in 1940, published in August 1942, the book is about the legendary [[303 Polish Squadron|No. 303 (\"Ko\u015bciuszko\") Polish Squadron]] (Polish: 303 Dywizjon My\u015bliwski \"Warszawski im. Tadeusza Ko\u015bciuszki\") of [[Polish Air Force]] fighter pilots who flew with [[Great Britain|Great Britain's]] [[Royal Air Force]] (R.A.F.) during the [[Battle of Britain]].\n\nNo. 303 (\"Ko\u015bciuszko\") Polish Squadron continued the traditions of the earlier [[Polish 7th Air Escadrille]] ({{lang-pl|7. Eskadra Lotnicza}}) or \"Ko\u015bciuszko Squadron\", as it was better known, which was one of the most active units of the [[Polish Air Force]] during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919-1921. Formed in late 1918, Polish 7th Air Escadrille was re-formed in late 1919 from American volunteers, initially commanded by [[Cedric Fauntleroy]], then by [[Merian Cooper]] (who originally recruited the American pilots for this unit).\n\n==Background==\nAuthor Arkady Fiedler was a bestselling travel writer researching in [[Tahiti]] when [[World War II]] began. He made his way back to [[Europe]] and joined the [[Polish Army]] in [[France]] after [[Invasion of Poland|Poland had fallen to the Germans]]. Fiedler managed to get to [[England]] with the other Polish forces after the [[fall of France]], where he saw all the attention that the Polish pilots of [[No. 303 Squadron RAF|303 Squadron]] were getting from the British press\u2014they were the highest-scoring Allied fighter squadron in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Fiedler recognized that their story would make a great book.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/303-squadron/arkady-fiedler/jarek-garlinski/9781607720041|title=303 Squadron by Arkady Fiedler, Jarek Garlinski &#124; Waterstones|website=www.waterstones.com}}</ref>\n\nHe undertook to chronicle the extraordinary achievements of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron during the Battle of Britain with the blessing of Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]].\n\nArkady Fiedler began writing ''303 Squadron'' \u201clive\u201d during the Battle of Britain, spending time with the Polish pilots and ground crew of No. 303 Squadron at their base at [[RAF Northolt]], West [[London]], England. He wrote the book in [[Polish language|Polish]] under the title ''Dywizjon 303''.

Copies duplicated by the [[Polish Underground]] were secretly passed from person to person. The account of the successes of their fighter pilots, fighting in distant lands for freedom, boosted morale in the beleaguered country. The book inspired soldier-poet [http://www.bibliotekapiosenki.pl/Kalkusinski_Czeslaw Czes\u0142aw \u2018Czechura\u2019 Ka\u0142kusi\u0144ski], serving with a forest partisan unit of the AK (''[[Armia Krajowa]]'') in the [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] region, to write a poem entitled \u201c303 Squadron\u201d which was set to music by his fellow soldier [http://www.bibliotekapiosenki.pl/Fajt_Henryk Henryk \u2018Garda\u2019 Fajt], and soon found its way to London via the [[Polish Underground]] where it was played over the [[BBC]] and heard by Polish airmen serving in Great Britain.\n\n''Dywizjon 303'' became a classic in Poland. It is mandatory reading for children in grammar school, and has gone through numerous Polish editions.\n\nIn connection with the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 2010, a new English translation was commissioned by publisher [[Aquila Polonica]] at the request of Fiedler\u2019s son. This is the first new English-language edition of ''Dywizjon 303'' since 1942, and for the first time in English identifies the pilots by their true names. This new edition contains nearly 200 historic photos, maps and other illustrations and supplemental material to set the story in historical context.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/30/how-polish-airmen-succeeded/|title=BOOK REVIEW: How Polish airmen succeeded|first=|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]}}</ref> Winner of the 2011 Benjamin Franklin Gold Award for History and Silver Award for Interior Design (1-2 Colour).\n\nIn \"Flying\" magazine, Lane Wallace noted, \"Typically, fighter pilot stories are written either by individual surviving pilots or historians after the fact.

Written in 1940, published in August 1942, the book is about the legendary [[303 Polish Squadron|No. 303 (\"Ko\u015bciuszko\") Polish Squadron]] (Polish: 303 Dywizjon My\u015bliwski \"Warszawski im. Tadeusza Ko\u015bciuszki\") of [[Polish Air Force]] fighter pilots who flew with [[Great Britain|Great Britain's]] [[Royal Air Force]] (R.A.F.) during the [[Battle of Britain]].\n\nNo. 303 (\"Ko\u015bciuszko\") Polish Squadron continued the traditions of the earlier [[Polish 7th Air Escadrille]] ({{lang-pl|7. Eskadra Lotnicza}}) or \"Ko\u015bciuszko Squadron\", as it was better known, which was one of the most active units of the [[Polish Air Force]] during the [[Polish-Soviet War]] of 1919-1921. Formed in late 1918, Polish 7th Air Escadrille was re-formed in late 1919 from American volunteers, initially commanded by [[Cedric Fauntleroy]], then by [[Merian Cooper]] (who originally recruited the American pilots for this unit).\n\n==Background==\nAuthor Arkady Fiedler was a bestselling travel writer researching in [[Tahiti]] when [[World War II]] began. He made his way back to [[Europe]] and joined the [[Polish Army]] in [[France]] after [[Invasion of Poland|Poland had fallen to the Germans]]. Fiedler managed to get to [[England]] with the other Polish forces after the [[fall of France]], where he saw all the attention that the Polish pilots of [[No. 303 Squadron RAF|303 Squadron]] were getting from the British press\u2014they were the highest-scoring Allied fighter squadron in the [[Battle of Britain]]. Fiedler recognized that their story would make a great book.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.waterstones.com/book/303-squadron/arkady-fiedler/jarek-garlinski/9781607720041|title=303 Squadron by Arkady Fiedler, Jarek Garlinski &#124; Waterstones|website=www.waterstones.com}}</ref>\n\nHe undertook to chronicle the extraordinary achievements of No. 303 (Polish) Squadron during the Battle of Britain with the blessing of Polish Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]].\n\nArkady Fiedler began writing ''303 Squadron'' \u201clive\u201d during the Battle of Britain, spending time with the Polish pilots and ground crew of No. 303 Squadron at their base at [[RAF Northolt]], West [[London]], England. He wrote the book in [[Polish language|Polish]] under the title ''Dywizjon 303''. It was translated into English by Jarek Garlinski<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polandww2.com/303-squadron/303-squadron-about-the-translator|title=About the Translator|website=www.polandww2.com}}</ref> and published in Great Britain in 1942 (where it went through several printings), and in the [[United States]] in 1943.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.derekcrowe.com/post.aspx?id=106|title=303 Squadron (Polish) - Battle of Britain - Arkady Fiedler|website=www.derekcrowe.com}}</ref>\n\nA clandestine edition of ''Dywizjon 303'' was parachuted into German-occupied Poland in 1943. Copies duplicated by the [[Polish Underground]] were secretly passed from person to person. The account of the successes of their fighter pilots, fighting in distant lands for freedom, boosted morale in the beleaguered country. The book inspired soldier-poet [http://www.bibliotekapiosenki.pl/Kalkusinski_Czeslaw Czes\u0142aw \u2018Czechura\u2019 Ka\u0142kusi\u0144ski], serving with a forest partisan unit of the AK (''[[Armia Krajowa]]'') in the [[Cz\u0119stochowa]] region, to write a poem entitled \u201c303 Squadron\u201d which was set to music by his fellow soldier [http://www.bibliotekapiosenki.pl/Fajt_Henryk Henryk \u2018Garda\u2019 Fajt], and soon found its way to London via the [[Polish Underground]] where it was played over the [[BBC]] and heard by Polish airmen serving in Great Britain.\n\n''Dywizjon 303'' became a classic in Poland. It is mandatory reading for children in grammar school, and has gone through numerous Polish editions.\n\nIn connection with the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 2010, a new English translation was commissioned by publisher [[Aquila Polonica]] at the request of Fiedler\u2019s son. This is the first new English-language edition of ''Dywizjon 303'' since 1942, and for the first time in English identifies the pilots by their true names. This new edition contains nearly 200 historic photos, maps and other illustrations and supplemental material to set the story in historical context.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/30/how-polish-airmen-succeeded/|title=BOOK REVIEW: How Polish airmen succeeded|first=|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]}}</ref> Winner of the 2011 Benjamin Franklin Gold Award for History and Silver Award for Interior Design (1-2 Colour).\n\nIn \"Flying\" magazine, Lane Wallace noted, \"Typically, fighter pilot stories are written either by individual surviving pilots or historians after the fact. But the pilots of 303 Squadron had an advantage when it came to recording their adventures accurately as they unfolded: Like [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]], they had a professional writer assigned to the squadron and tasked with making sure their story wasn't mistold or forgotten\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Lane Wallace|title=Forgotten Adventure in Real Time|url=http://www.polandww2.com/images/MEDIA_ROOM/NewsAndReviews/2011/flyingmagazine2011march-r-highlighted.pdf|publisher=Flying Magazine|date=March 2011}}</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' about forgotten pieces of World War II history, such as the story of 303 Squadron, Sanjay Saigal asked, \"shouldn't cultural literacy include knowing about Polish heroism in the defense of Britain?\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Sanjay Saigal|title=The Unknown Knowns|url=http://www.polandww2.com/images/MEDIA_ROOM/NewsAndReviews/2011/theatlantic2011-3-9.pdf|publisher=The Atlantic|date=March 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==The names were changed==\nAll the names in that book were pseudononymous due to war time security concerns for the pilots and their families. <blockquote>\"Because the book was published during the war, in order to protect the Polish airmen and their families remaining in occupied Poland from German reprisals, Fiedler used pseudonyms for the airmen of 303 Squadron. This practice was mandated in a memoregarding confidential information issued by the Air Ministry dated Oct. 14, 1949.[33] In connection with the 70th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in 2010, a new English translation was commissioned by publisher Aquila Polonica at the request of Fiedler\u2019s son. 303 Squadron: The Legendary Battle of Britain Fighter Squadron is the first new English-language edition of Dywizjon 303 since 1942, and for the first time in English identifies the pilots by their true names.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ancienssaintcasimir.e-monsite.com/medias/files/303-polish-fighter-sqadron.pdf |page=9 |title=No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Publishing history==\n\n'''Great Britain'''\n* ''Dywizjon 303''<br /> Publisher: M.I.
