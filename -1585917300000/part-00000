His writings display a deep curiosity towards the [[Nature (philosophy)|natural world]], influenced by the [[scientific revolution]] of [[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] enquiry.\nBrowne's literary works are permeated by  references to [[Classics|Classical]] and [[Bible|Biblical]] sources as well as the idiosyncrasies of his own personality. Although often described as suffused with [[melancholia]], his writings are also characterised by wit and subtle humour, while his literary style is varied, according to genre, resulting in a rich, unique [[prose]] which ranges from rough notebook observations to polished [[Baroque]] eloquence.\n\n== Biography ==\n=== Early life ===\nThe son of Thomas Browne, a [[silk]] merchant from [[Upton, Cheshire|Upton]], Cheshire, and Anne Browne, the daughter of Paul Garraway of [[Sussex]], he was born in the parish of [[St Michael-le-Querne|St Michael]], [[Cheapside]], in London on 19 October 1605.<ref>R.

He graduated from Oxford in January 1627, after which he studied medicine at [[University of Padua|Padua]] and [[University of Montpellier|Montpellier]] universities, completing his studies at [[University of Leiden|Leiden]], where he received a [[Doctor of Medicine|medical degree]] in 1633.  He settled in [[Norwich]] in 1637 and practised medicine there until his death in 1682.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mNeymtxbkxgC&pg=PA296 |p=296 |title=Life Cycles in England, 1560-1720: Cradle to Grave |author=Mary Abbott |publisher=Psychology Press |year=1996|isbn=9780415108430 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/21/the-adventures-of-sir-thomas-browne-in-the-21st-century-hugh-aldersey-williams-review |work=The Guardian |date=21 May 2015 |author=Colin Burrow |title=The Adventures of Sir Thomas Browne in the 21st Century by Hugh Aldersey-Williams \u2013 review}}</ref>\n\nIn 1641, he married Dorothy Mileham (1621-1685), of [[Burlingham St Peter]], Norfolk. She bore him ten children, six of whom died before their parents.\n\n===Literary works===\n[[File:Lady Dorothy Browne (n\u00e9e Mileham); Sir Thomas Browne by Joan Carlile.jpg|thumb|''[[Lady Dorothy Browne and Sir Thomas Browne]]'', by [[Joan Carlile]], c. 1641 \u2013 1650]]\nBrowne's first literary work was ''[[Religio Medici]]'' ''(The Religion of a Physician)'' which was circulated as a [[manuscript]] among his friends. It surprised him when an unauthorised edition appeared in 1642, since the work included several unorthodox religious speculations. An authorised text appeared in 1643, with some of the more controversial views removed. The expurgation did not end the controversy: in 1645, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]] attacked ''Religio Medici'' in his ''Medicus Medicatus'' ''(The Doctor, Doctored)'' and, in common with much Protestant literature, the book was placed upon the Papal ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in the same year.<ref>J. S. Finch A doctor's Life of Faith and Science. Princeton 1950</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1646 Browne published his encyclopaedia, ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]], or, Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths'', the title of which refers to the prevalence of false beliefs and \"vulgar errors\".  A sceptical work that debunks a number of legends circulating at the time in a methodical and witty manner, it displays the [[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] side of Browne&mdash;the side that was unafraid of what at the time was still called \"[[the new learning]]\".  The book is significant in the [[history of science]] because it promoted an awareness of up-to-date scientific journalism.\n\nBrowne's last publication during his lifetime were two philosophical Discourses which are closely related to each other in concept. The first, ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk]]'' (1658) inspired by the discovery of some [[Bronze Age]] burials in earthenware vessels found in [[Norfolk]], resulted in a literary meditation upon death, the [[funerary]] customs of the world and the ephemerality of fame. The other discourse in the [[diptych]] is antithetical in style, subject-matter and imagery. ''[[The Garden of Cyrus|The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, and Mystically Considered]]'' (1658) features the [[quincunx]] which is used by Browne to demonstrate evidence of [[Platonic realism|the Platonic forms]] in art and nature.<ref>Frank Huntley, Sir Thomas Browne : A biographical and Critical Study  Ann Arbor University of Michigan Press, 1962</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Later life and knighthood ===\n[[File:Sir Thomas Browne's House, Norwich.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration of Sir Thomas Browne's house in Norwich]]\nIn ''Religio Medici'', Browne confirmed his belief, in accordance with the vast majority of seventeenth century European society, in the existence of [[angel]]s and [[witchcraft]].

The courtier [[John Evelyn]], who had occasionally corresponded with Browne, took good use of the royal visit to call upon \"the learned doctor\" of European fame and wrote of his visit, \"His whole house and garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarities and that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things\".<ref>The Diary of John Evelyn ed. John Eve  pub. Everyman (2003)</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nDuring his visit, Charles visited Browne's home. A [[banquet]] was held in [[St. Andrew's and Blackfriars' Hall, Norwich|St Andrew's Hall]] for the royal visit.  Obliged to honour a notable local, the name of the Mayor of Norwich was proposed to the King for [[knight]]hood. The Mayor, however, declined the honour and proposed Browne's name instead.<ref>Simon Wilkins Supplementary Memoir citing [[Francis Blomefield]] Sir Thomas Browne Collected Works Vol. I pub. 1836</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Death and aftermath ===\n[[File:The will of Sir Thomas Browne.jpg|thumb|Sir Thomas Browne's [[Will and testament|will]], dated 2 December 1679]]\n\nBrowne died on 19 October 1682 and was buried in the chancel of [[St Peter Mancroft]], Norwich. His skull was removed when his lead coffin was accidentally re-opened by workmen in 1840. It was not re-interred in St Peter Mancroft until 4 July 1922 when it was recorded in the [[Parish register|burial register]] as aged 317 years.<ref>Colin Dickey.

Alluding to the commonplace opus of alchemy it reads, ''Amplissimus Vir Dns. Thomas Browne, Miles, Medicinae Dr., Annos Natus 77 Denatus 19 Die mensis Octobris, Anno. Dni. 1682, hoc Loculo indormiens. Corporis Spagyrici pulvere plumbum in aurum Convertit.'' \u2014 translated from Latin as \"The esteemed Gentleman Thomas Browne, Knight, Doctor of Medicine, 77 years old, died on the 19th of October in the year of Our Lord 1682 and lies sleeping in this coffin. With the dust of his alchemical body he converts lead into gold\". The origin of the invented word ''spagyrici'' are from the Greek of: ''Spao'' to tear open, + ''ageiro'' to collect, a signature neologism coined by [[Paracelsus]] to define his medicine-oriented alchemy; the origins of [[iatrochemistry]], being first advanced by him.\n\nBrowne's coffin-plate verse, along with the collected works of Paracelsus and several followers of the Swiss physician listed in his library, are evidence that although sometimes highly critical of Paracelsus, nevertheless, like the 'Luther of Medicine', he believed in [[palingenesis]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]] and the [[kabbalah]].<ref>Manchester Guardian 19 October 1905</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne]] was held in the care of his eldest son Edward until 1708.

The freshness and ingenuity of his mind invested everything he touched with interest; while on more important subjects his style, if frequently ornate and Latinate, often rises to the highest pitch of stately eloquence.  His [[paradox]]ical place in the [[history of ideas]], as equally, a devout Christian, a promoter of the new [[induction (philosophy)|inductive]] science and adherent of ancient [[esoteric]] learning,  have greatly contributed to his ambiguity in the history of ideas. For these reasons, one literary critic succinctly assessed him as \"an instance of scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the [[Church of England]]\".<ref>Sencourt R., ''Outflying Philosophy: A Literary Study of the Religious Element in the Poems and Letters of John Donne and in the Works of Sir Thomas Browne.'', Ardent Media, 1925, p. 126</ref> However, the complexity of Browne's labyrinthine thought processes, his highly stylised language, along with his many allusions to  Biblical, Classical and contemporary learning, along with esoteric authors, are each contributing factors for why he remains obscure, little-read and thus, misunderstood.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.html | title=The physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne}}</ref>\n\nBrowne appears at No. 69 in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s list of top cited sources.

It surprised him when an unauthorised edition appeared in 1642, since the work included several unorthodox religious speculations. An authorised text appeared in 1643, with some of the more controversial views removed. The expurgation did not end the controversy: in 1645, [[Alexander Ross (writer)|Alexander Ross]] attacked ''Religio Medici'' in his ''Medicus Medicatus'' ''(The Doctor, Doctored)'' and, in common with much Protestant literature, the book was placed upon the Papal ''[[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]]'' in the same year.<ref>J. S. Finch A doctor's Life of Faith and Science. Princeton 1950</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nIn 1646 Browne published his encyclopaedia, ''[[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]], or, Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths'', the title of which refers to the prevalence of false beliefs and \"vulgar errors\".  A sceptical work that debunks a number of legends circulating at the time in a methodical and witty manner, it displays the [[Francis Bacon|Baconian]] side of Browne&mdash;the side that was unafraid of what at the time was still called \"[[the new learning]]\".  The book is significant in the [[history of science]] because it promoted an awareness of up-to-date scientific journalism.\n\nBrowne's last publication during his lifetime were two philosophical Discourses which are closely related to each other in concept. The first, ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial|Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk]]'' (1658) inspired by the discovery of some [[Bronze Age]] burials in earthenware vessels found in [[Norfolk]], resulted in a literary meditation upon death, the [[funerary]] customs of the world and the ephemerality of fame. The other discourse in the [[diptych]] is antithetical in style, subject-matter and imagery. ''[[The Garden of Cyrus|The Garden of Cyrus, or The Quincuncial Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, and Mystically Considered]]'' (1658) features the [[quincunx]] which is used by Browne to demonstrate evidence of [[Platonic realism|the Platonic forms]] in art and nature.<ref>Frank Huntley, Sir Thomas Browne : A biographical and Critical Study  Ann Arbor University of Michigan Press, 1962</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n=== Later life and knighthood ===\n[[File:Sir Thomas Browne's House, Norwich.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration of Sir Thomas Browne's house in Norwich]]\nIn ''Religio Medici'', Browne confirmed his belief, in accordance with the vast majority of seventeenth century European society, in the existence of [[angel]]s and [[witchcraft]].

The courtier [[John Evelyn]], who had occasionally corresponded with Browne, took good use of the royal visit to call upon \"the learned doctor\" of European fame and wrote of his visit, \"His whole house and garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarities and that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things\".<ref>The Diary of John Evelyn ed.

A [[banquet]] was held in [[St. Andrew's and Blackfriars' Hall, Norwich|St Andrew's Hall]] for the royal visit.  Obliged to honour a notable local, the name of the Mayor of Norwich was proposed to the King for [[knight]]hood.

His skull was removed when his lead coffin was accidentally re-opened by workmen in 1840.

Alluding to the commonplace opus of alchemy it reads, ''Amplissimus Vir Dns. Thomas Browne, Miles, Medicinae Dr., Annos Natus 77 Denatus 19 Die mensis Octobris, Anno.

With the dust of his alchemical body he converts lead into gold\". The origin of the invented word ''spagyrici'' are from the Greek of: ''Spao'' to tear open, + ''ageiro'' to collect, a signature neologism coined by [[Paracelsus]] to define his medicine-oriented alchemy; the origins of [[iatrochemistry]], being first advanced by him.\n\nBrowne's coffin-plate verse, along with the collected works of Paracelsus and several followers of the Swiss physician listed in his library, are evidence that although sometimes highly critical of Paracelsus, nevertheless, like the 'Luther of Medicine', he believed in [[palingenesis]], [[physiognomy]], [[alchemy]], [[astrology]] and the [[kabbalah]].<ref>Manchester Guardian 19 October 1905</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nThe [[Library of Sir Thomas Browne]] was held in the care of his eldest son Edward until 1708.

The freshness and ingenuity of his mind invested everything he touched with interest; while on more important subjects his style, if frequently ornate and Latinate, often rises to the highest pitch of stately eloquence.  His [[paradox]]ical place in the [[history of ideas]], as equally, a devout Christian, a promoter of the new [[induction (philosophy)|inductive]] science and adherent of ancient [[esoteric]] learning,  have greatly contributed to his ambiguity in the history of ideas. For these reasons, one literary critic succinctly assessed him as \"an instance of scientific reason lit up by mysticism in the [[Church of England]]\".<ref>Sencourt R., ''Outflying Philosophy: A Literary Study of the Religious Element in the Poems and Letters of John Donne and in the Works of Sir Thomas Browne.'', Ardent Media, 1925, p. 126</ref> However, the complexity of Browne's labyrinthine thought processes, his highly stylised language, along with his many allusions to  Biblical, Classical and contemporary learning, along with esoteric authors, are each contributing factors for why he remains obscure, little-read and thus, misunderstood.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.levity.com/alchemy/sir_thomas_browne.html | title=The physician and philosopher Sir Thomas Browne}}</ref>\n\nBrowne appears at No. 69 in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''{{'}}s list of top cited sources.

This statue occupies the central position in the Haymarket beside St Peter Mancroft, not far from the site of his house. Unveiled on 19 October 1905, it was moved from its original position in 1973.\n* In 1931 the English painter [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]] was invited to illustrate a book of his own choice, Nash choose Sir Thomas Browne's ''Urn Burial'' and ''The Garden of Cyrus'', providing the publisher with a set of 32 illustrations to accompany Browne's Discourses. The edition was published in 1932. A pencil drawing by Nash called \"Urne Buriall: Teeth, Bones and Hair\" is held by Birmingham Museums Trust.\n* In 2005 a small standing figure in silver and bronze, commissioned for the 400th anniversary of Browne's birth, was sculpted by Robert Mileham.\n*In 2016 the artists [[Peter Rodulfo]] and [[Mark Burrell]] elected Browne as honorary ''Great-Grandfather'' of the [[North Sea Magical Realists]] art-movement. Simultaneously they realised in painting items taken from Browne's ''[[Musaeum Clausum]]'' in its ''Rarities in Pictures'' section.

The weekend newscasts consist of '''''Newsroom Weekend''''', anchored by [[Claire Celdran]] at 6:00pm on weekends and at 12:00 noon on Saturdays, and a 15-minute weekend morning show '''''Newsroom Junior Edition''''' anchored by young contributors trained by CNN Philippines. It formerly aired the 3:00pm edition dubbed as '''''Global Newsroom''''' from 2016 to 2017.\n\n==Background==\n===As a noontime newscast===\nThe newscast was launched on March 16, 2015 as a 60-minute standalone noontime newscast, replacing ''[[Newsday (9News)|Newsday]]'' (which ran across CNN PH's predecessors TalkTV, Solar News Channel and 9TV). It was first anchored by former CNN Philippines News chief Jing Magsaysay and journalist Mai Rodriguez, who was held over from ''Newsday''.\n\nIn September 2015, Magsaysay left the newscast after his resignation following the \"right-sizing\" retrenchment of 70 junior staffers and contractual employees, who worked in the company for Programming and Technical Engineering divisions, leaving Rodriguez as the sole anchor for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2015/09/first-on-mnp-jing-magsaysay-resigns-as.html|title=First on MNP: Jing Magsaysay resigns as SVP of CNN Philippines|website=Medianewser.com|accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Expansion===\nOn February 15, 2016, the newscast expanded its airtime, aligning with [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|its international counterpart]]. However, the expansion reformatted from a single 60-minute newscast to three 30-minute editions in its initial run. The 8am edition was first anchored by the late [[Amelyn Veloso]], who formerly anchored ''[[CNN Philippines Headline News]]'' and was concurrently hosting ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]''. [[Claire Celdran]] replaced Rodriguez in the noontime edition while the latter became anchor of the network's weekend newscasts. The 9:00pm edition replaced ''[[CNN Philippines Nightly News]]'', anchored by its holdover, Mitzi Borromeo. The English-language noontime edition and the original broadcast of ''Newsroom'' was axed on April 4, 2016 and reformatted to ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]'' with [[Pinky Webb]].\n\nOn April 11, 2016, ''Newsroom'' debuted a 3 pm edition dubbed as ''Global Newsroom'' catering on international news relevant to Filipinos, first hosted by [[Claire Celdran]]. It carries the similar format of [[Global Conversations]], which was cancelled four months later (August 26).\n\nOn February 6, 2017, ''Newsroom'' launched its mid-morning edition in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] language dubbed as ''Newsroom Ngayon,'' anchored by Ruth Cabal replacing [[Serbisyo All Access]].<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Newsroom Ngayon'' serves as a sister newscast with CNN Philippines' first Filipino language newscast, ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]'', which airs at midday.\n\nOn February 27, 2017, due to personnel reshuffling, Claire Celdran replaced Veloso at the 8 am slot while [[CNN Philippines Network News|Network News]] anchor [[Pia Hontiveros]] took over the ''Global Newsroom'' chair. Veloso would occasionally appear in special editions, until she died of cancer on August 24.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/08/cnn-anchor-amelyn-veloso-dies-at-42.html|title=CNN Philippines anchor Amelyn Veloso dies at 42|last=|first=|date=August 24, 2017|website=Medianewser.com|access-date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2017, ''Newsroom'' launched its weekend edition anchored by the pioneer weekday noontime anchor Mai Rodriguez. It started out at the Saturday noontime slot until April 1, 2017 when it expanded to include broadcasts on weekend evenings at 6 pm, following the cancellation of [[CNN Philippines Network News|Network News]] a week before as a result of the launching of ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night]]'' on weeknights from March 27. '''Newsroom Weekend''' later added a Sunday noontime edition on May 28, 2017 [[Marawi crisis|at the wake of the Marawi City crisis]]. Prior to a permanent weekend expansion, Rodriguez anchored special newscasts during severe weather coverage and other news of utmost importance.\n\nGlobal Newsroom aired its last broadcast on December 29, 2017, to gave way to the extension of [[Amanpour]] on January 1, 2018 as part of the network reorganization. Prior to the extension, some segments of the latter were usually aired on Global Newsroom.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, Mitzi Borromeo left the evening edition to pursue an advanced degree while retaining her position as host of Profiles and will appear on special editions. It was announced that former [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] anchor and former [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] undersecretary [[Cherie Mercado]] will replace Borromeo on the anchor chair beginning February 12. from February 1 to 9, [[Pia Hontiveros]] and correspondent Joyce Ilas took turns in anchoring the newscast in interim.\n\nIn 2018, [[Claire Celdran]] left both [[New Day (CNN Philippines)|New Day]] and the morning edition, citing more time to spend for her family. Former [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] anchor Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo replaced Celdran on both shows. Prior to this, Mai Rodriguez and Ruth Cabal took turns in filling-up Celdran's vacant spot.\n\nOn September 3, 2018, Ruth Cabal and Cherie Mercado switched anchoring duties, with Cabal leading the 9pm primetime edition and Mercado anchoring Newsroom Ngayon, citing personal reasons. CNN Philippines also launched a 15-minute weekend ''Newsroom Junior Edition'' on September 1 as part of the ''CNN PH Junior'' weekend morning block, featuring kids and young teens anchoring news bites of the day, similar to its predecessor [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]]'s [[NewsWatch Junior Edition]] (2008\u20132009) and [[NewsWatch (Philippine TV series)|Jr. NewsWatch]] (2005).\n\nIn May 2019, Cherie Mercado left Newsroom Ngayon, citing her move to Canada to study. Mai Rodriguez was tapped to replace Mercado while selected correspondents are doing the weekend edition for the month of June and July. On August 3, 2019, [[Claire Celdran]], who is returning to the network after a year, is named as the interim replacement for Rodriguez on Newsroom Weekend but she only anchors the Saturday midday edition and the Sunday edition with selected correspondents still anchoring the Saturday Primetime edition.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, Ruth Cabal returns to Newsroom Ngayon after more than a year doing the evening edition. She replaced Mai Rodriguez who is named as the new anchor for the evening edition.\n\nBeginning March 30, 2020, former [[BBC World News]] and [[CNBC]] anchor Rico Hizon takes over the 9pm edition, his first after coming home to the Philippines from international news stints in Singapore and Hong Kong.<ref> http://www.medianewser.com/2020/03/former-bbc-anchor-rico-hizon-joining-cnn-philippines.html </ref>\n\nOn April 2, 2020, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' was moved to 3 pm timeslot, this was done after the newscast halted due to skeletal workforce imposed by the network due to [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n<br />\n\n===Special editions===\nWhen warranted, ''Newsroom'' would air special editions of the newscast, either within or beyond the current four-edition format. Emulating [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|its international counterpart]], ''Newsroom'' preempts programming for rolling news coverage and breaking stories (i.e. [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] hearings, and hooking up to [[CNN International]] during major relevant overseas coverage). However, when special events warrant during the early primetime slot, this function goes to ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night with Pia Hontiveros]]'' until 8:00 pm and only under the most dire situations would warrant preemption of the weeknight 9:00 pm edition in favor of uninterrupted coverage starting from where ''News Night'' leaves off.\n\n====EDSA and Muhammad Ali====\nUnder the initial three-split schedule, ''Newsroom'' aired additional editions on the 30th anniversary of the [[People Power Revolution]] and the aftermath of [[Muhammad Ali]]'s death, respectively, with the broadcast airing four times on February 25, 2016, all but one edition airing a full hour. On June 6, 2016, ''Global Newsroom'' ran a full hour covering the aftermath of the boxer's death. [[Mico Halili]] co-anchored the broadcast with [[Claire Celdran]] and Dr. Freddie Gomez providing medical perspective, augmenting the network's extended bulletins done on the day of Ali's death.\n\n====The Marawi City crisis====\nAt [[Battle of Marawi]] on May 23, 2017, the entire primetime current affairs block gave way to initial developments of the unfolding situation in the city with [[Pia Hontiveros]] anchoring uninterrupted coverage for four hours from 6:00 to 10:00 pm. Only the usual 10:00 pm edition of ''Sportsdesk'' was greenlit before Mitzi Borromeo resumed coverage for another half-hour. To further cope up with the developments in the city, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' added a special 2:00 pm edition during the third day of the conflict and ''Newsroom Weekend'' added a special Saturday morning edition on May 27 and a Sunday noontime edition on May 28. On the latter days of the conflict, ''Mindanao Hour'' press conferences were broadcast to serve as a lead in to ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]''.\n\n====Resorts World Manila robbery====\nThe incident marked the program's lengthiest uninterrupted coverage outside of scheduled political functions, totalling almost six hours. Ruth Cabal anchored a three-hour block from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, before breaking away to simulcast [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|CNN Newsroom International]]. Pia Hontiveros took the air from 2:00 to 2:30 and 3:00-5:00 pm. The coverage was heavily delivered in Filipino on the first two blocks before reverting to English on the extended slot of ''Global Newsroom''. Again, ''SportsDesk'' was greenlit but the planned morning edition was broadcast live-to-tape at 2:30 pm, deviating from the regular protocol of replaying the live 11:00 am broadcast on the slot. The following day, three editions was aired instead of the usual two for Saturdays. A special edition was aired at 10:00 am followed by the usual broadcast at 12:00 noon and the 6:00 pm edition was temporarily moved up to 5:30 pm and ran one and a half-hours covering the press conference revealing CCTV footage of the incident.\n\n==Current presenters==\nThe presenters of the broadcasts are arranged according to assigned slots and priority when special editions would warrant across their timeslots.\n* Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo (2018\u2013present, morning edition)\n* Ruth Cabal (2017\u20132018; 2019-present, ''Newsroom Ngayon''; 2018-2019, evening edition)\n* [[Rico Hizon]] (2020-present, evening edition)\n* Claire Celdran (2016, original noontime edition; 2016\u20132017, ''Global Newsroom''; 2017\u20132018, morning edition; 2019-present, weekend edition)\n\n==Segments==\n===Newsroom===\n*CNN Philippines Investigates (investigative report)\n*The Business Report (business news)\n\n===Newsroom Ngayon===\n*Serbisyo Ngayon (public service)\n*Isyu Ngayon (hottest topics of the day)\n*Trabaho Ngayon (classifieds and job search)\n*Good Juan (human interest and inspiring stories)\n\n===Newsroom Junior Edition===\n*Here at Home (national news)\n*Did You Know That?

The weekend newscasts consist of '''''Newsroom Weekend''''', anchored by [[Claire Celdran]] at 6:00pm on weekends and at 12:00 noon on Saturdays, and a 15-minute weekend morning show '''''Newsroom Junior Edition''''' anchored by young contributors trained by CNN Philippines. It formerly aired the 3:00pm edition dubbed as '''''Global Newsroom''''' from 2016 to 2017.\n\n==Background==\n===As a noontime newscast===\nThe newscast was launched on March 16, 2015 as a 60-minute standalone noontime newscast, replacing ''[[Newsday (9News)|Newsday]]'' (which ran across CNN PH's predecessors TalkTV, Solar News Channel and 9TV). It was first anchored by former CNN Philippines News chief Jing Magsaysay and journalist Mai Rodriguez, who was held over from ''Newsday''.\n\nIn September 2015, Magsaysay left the newscast after his resignation following the \"right-sizing\" retrenchment of 70 junior staffers and contractual employees, who worked in the company for Programming and Technical Engineering divisions, leaving Rodriguez as the sole anchor for the rest of its run.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2015/09/first-on-mnp-jing-magsaysay-resigns-as.html|title=First on MNP: Jing Magsaysay resigns as SVP of CNN Philippines|website=Medianewser.com|accessdate=1 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===.Expansion===\nOn February 15, 2016, the newscast expanded its airtime, aligning with [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|its international counterpart]]. However, the expansion reformatted from a single 60-minute newscast to three 30-minute editions in its initial run. The 8am edition was first anchored by the late [[Amelyn Veloso]], who formerly anchored ''[[CNN Philippines Headline News]]'' and was concurrently hosting ''[[Serbisyo All Access]]''. [[Claire Celdran]] replaced Rodriguez in the noontime edition while the latter became anchor of the network's weekend newscasts. The 9:00pm edition replaced ''[[CNN Philippines Nightly News]]'', anchored by its holdover, Mitzi Borromeo. The English-language noontime edition and the original broadcast of ''Newsroom'' was axed on April 4, 2016 and reformatted to ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]'' with [[Pinky Webb]].\n\nOn April 11, 2016, ''Newsroom'' debuted a 3 pm edition dubbed as ''Global Newsroom'' catering on international news relevant to Filipinos, first hosted by [[Claire Celdran]]. It carries the similar format of [[Global Conversations]], which was cancelled four months later (August 26).\n\nOn February 6, 2017, ''Newsroom'' launched its mid-morning edition in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] language dubbed as ''Newsroom Ngayon,'' anchored by Ruth Cabal replacing [[Serbisyo All Access]].<ref name=\":0\" /> ''Newsroom Ngayon'' serves as a sister newscast with CNN Philippines' first Filipino language newscast, ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]'', which airs at midday.\n\nOn February 27, 2017, due to personnel reshuffling, Claire Celdran replaced Veloso at the 8 am slot while [[CNN Philippines Network News|Network News]] anchor [[Pia Hontiveros]] took over the ''Global Newsroom'' chair. Veloso would occasionally appear in special editions, until she died of cancer on August 24.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medianewser.com/2017/08/cnn-anchor-amelyn-veloso-dies-at-42.html|title=CNN Philippines anchor Amelyn Veloso dies at 42|last=|first=|date=August 24, 2017|website=Medianewser.com|access-date=August 24, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn March 4, 2017, ''Newsroom'' launched its weekend edition anchored by the pioneer weekday noontime anchor Mai Rodriguez. It started out at the Saturday noontime slot until April 1, 2017 when it expanded to include broadcasts on weekend evenings at 6 pm, following the cancellation of [[CNN Philippines Network News|Network News]] a week before as a result of the launching of ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night]]'' on weeknights from March 27. '''Newsroom Weekend''' later added a Sunday noontime edition on May 28, 2017 [[Marawi crisis|at the wake of the Marawi City crisis]]. Prior to a permanent weekend expansion, Rodriguez anchored special newscasts during severe weather coverage and other news of utmost importance.\n\nGlobal Newsroom aired its last broadcast on December 29, 2017, to gave way to the extension of [[Amanpour]] on January 1, 2018 as part of the network reorganization. Prior to the extension, some segments of the latter were usually aired on Global Newsroom.\n\nOn January 31, 2018, Mitzi Borromeo left the evening edition to pursue an advanced degree while retaining her position as host of Profiles and will appear on special editions. It was announced that former [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]] anchor and former [[Department of Transportation (Philippines)|Department of Transportation]] undersecretary [[Cherie Mercado]] will replace Borromeo on the anchor chair beginning February 12. from February 1 to 9, [[Pia Hontiveros]] and correspondent Joyce Ilas took turns in anchoring the newscast in interim.\n\nIn 2018, [[Claire Celdran]] left both [[New Day (CNN Philippines)|New Day]] and the morning edition, citing more time to spend for her family. Former [[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] anchor Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo replaced Celdran on both shows. Prior to this, Mai Rodriguez and Ruth Cabal took turns in filling-up Celdran's vacant spot.\n\nOn September 3, 2018, Ruth Cabal and Cherie Mercado switched anchoring duties, with Cabal leading the 9pm primetime edition and Mercado anchoring Newsroom Ngayon, citing personal reasons. CNN Philippines also launched a 15-minute weekend ''Newsroom Junior Edition'' on September 1 as part of the ''CNN PH Junior'' weekend morning block, featuring kids and young teens anchoring news bites of the day, similar to its predecessor [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]]'s [[NewsWatch Junior Edition]] (2008\u20132009) and [[NewsWatch (Philippine TV series)|Jr. NewsWatch]] (2005).\n\nIn May 2019, Cherie Mercado left Newsroom Ngayon, citing her move to Canada to study. Mai Rodriguez was tapped to replace Mercado while selected correspondents are doing the weekend edition for the month of June and July. On August 3, 2019, [[Claire Celdran]], who is returning to the network after a year, is named as the interim replacement for Rodriguez on Newsroom Weekend but she only anchors the Saturday midday edition and the Sunday edition with selected correspondents still anchoring the Saturday Primetime edition.\n\nOn October 7, 2019, Ruth Cabal returns to Newsroom Ngayon after more than a year doing the evening edition. She replaced Mai Rodriguez who is named as the new anchor for the evening edition.\n\nBeginning March 30, 2020, former [[BBC World News]] and [[CNBC]] anchor Rico Hizon takes over the 9pm edition, his first after coming home to the Philippines from international news stints in Singapore and Hong Kong.<ref> http://www.medianewser.com/2020/03/former-bbc-anchor-rico-hizon-joining-cnn-philippines.html </ref>\n\nOn April 3, 2020, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' was moved to 3 pm timeslot, this is done after the newscast halted due to skeletal workforce imposed by the network due to [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|2019-20 Coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n<br />\n\n===Special editions===\nWhen warranted, ''Newsroom'' would air special editions of the newscast, either within or beyond the current four-edition format. Emulating [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|its international counterpart]], ''Newsroom'' preempts programming for rolling news coverage and breaking stories (i.e. [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]] and [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] hearings, and hooking up to [[CNN International]] during major relevant overseas coverage). However, when special events warrant during the early primetime slot, this function goes to ''[[News Night (CNN Philippines)|News Night with Pia Hontiveros]]'' until 8:00 pm and only under the most dire situations would warrant preemption of the weeknight 9:00 pm edition in favor of uninterrupted coverage starting from where ''News Night'' leaves off.\n\n====EDSA and Muhammad Ali====\nUnder the initial three-split schedule, ''Newsroom'' aired additional editions on the 30th anniversary of the [[People Power Revolution]] and the aftermath of [[Muhammad Ali]]'s death, respectively, with the broadcast airing four times on February 25, 2016, all but one edition airing a full hour. On June 6, 2016, ''Global Newsroom'' ran a full hour covering the aftermath of the boxer's death. [[Mico Halili]] co-anchored the broadcast with [[Claire Celdran]] and Dr. Freddie Gomez providing medical perspective, augmenting the network's extended bulletins done on the day of Ali's death.\n\n====The Marawi City crisis====\nAt [[Battle of Marawi]] on May 23, 2017, the entire primetime current affairs block gave way to initial developments of the unfolding situation in the city with [[Pia Hontiveros]] anchoring uninterrupted coverage for four hours from 6:00 to 10:00 pm. Only the usual 10:00 pm edition of ''Sportsdesk'' was greenlit before Mitzi Borromeo resumed coverage for another half-hour. To further cope up with the developments in the city, ''Newsroom Ngayon'' added a special 2:00 pm edition during the third day of the conflict and ''Newsroom Weekend'' added a special Saturday morning edition on May 27 and a Sunday noontime edition on May 28. On the latter days of the conflict, ''Mindanao Hour'' press conferences were broadcast to serve as a lead in to ''[[Balitaan (CNN Philippines)|Balitaan]]''.\n\n====Resorts World Manila robbery====\nThe incident marked the program's lengthiest uninterrupted coverage outside of scheduled political functions, totalling almost six hours. Ruth Cabal anchored a three-hour block from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, before breaking away to simulcast [[CNN Newsroom (CNNI)|CNN Newsroom International]]. Pia Hontiveros took the air from 2:00 to 2:30 and 3:00-5:00 pm. The coverage was heavily delivered in Filipino on the first two blocks before reverting to English on the extended slot of ''Global Newsroom''. Again, ''SportsDesk'' was greenlit but the planned morning edition was broadcast live-to-tape at 2:30 pm, deviating from the regular protocol of replaying the live 11:00 am broadcast on the slot. The following day, three editions was aired instead of the usual two for Saturdays. A special edition was aired at 10:00 am followed by the usual broadcast at 12:00 noon and the 6:00 pm edition was temporarily moved up to 5:30 pm and ran one and a half-hours covering the press conference revealing CCTV footage of the incident.\n\n==Current presenters==\nThe presenters of the broadcasts are arranged according to assigned slots and priority when special editions would warrant across their timeslots.\n* Ria Tanjuatco-Trillo (2018\u2013present, morning edition)\n* Ruth Cabal (2017\u20132018; 2019-present, ''Newsroom Ngayon''; 2018-2019, evening edition)\n* [[Rico Hizon]] (2020-present, evening edition)\n* Claire Celdran (2016, original noontime edition; 2016\u20132017, ''Global Newsroom''; 2017\u20132018, morning edition; 2019-present, weekend edition)\n\n==Segments==\n===Newsroom===\n*CNN Philippines Investigates (investigative report)\n*The Business Report (business news)\n\n===Newsroom Ngayon===\n*Serbisyo Ngayon (public service)\n*Isyu Ngayon (hottest topics of the day)\n*Trabaho Ngayon (classifieds and job search)\n*Good Juan (human interest and inspiring stories)\n\n===Newsroom Junior Edition===\n*Here at Home (national news)\n*Did You Know That?

The characteristic trade of silk through the [[Silk Road]] connected various regions from China, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East to Europe and Africa.]]\n\nThe '''history of Asia''' can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]].\n\nThe coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations and religions, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[China]] shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.\n\nThe steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of [[Siberia]] was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the [[tundra]]. These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.\n\nThe centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], [[Karakum Desert]], and [[Gobi Desert]] formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty.  While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force.  Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.\n\nThe [[spread of Islam]] waved the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and the [[Timurid Renaissance]], which later influenced the [[Islamic Gunpowders]].\n\nAsia's history features major developments seen in other parts of the world, as well as events that have affected those other regions. These include the trade of the [[Silk Road]], which spread cultures, languages, religions, and diseases throughout Afro-Eurasian trade. Another major advancement was the innovation of [[gunpowder]] in medieval China, later developed by the Gunpowder empires, mainly by the [[Mughal tribe|Mughal]]s and [[Safavid]]s, which led to advanced warfare through the use of guns.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistory of Asia}}\nA report by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari on Lahuradewa, [[India]] shows new C14 datings that range between 9000 and 8000 BCE associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site in entire South Asia.<ref name=\"archae\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|title=Second preliminary report of the excavations at Lahuradewa district\n|publisher=Directorate of Archaeology (U.P, India)\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040512/http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|archivedate=2011-06-13\n|df=\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] near Yixian in [[Hebei]] Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the [[Cishan culture|Cishan]] and [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] cultures of about 8000\u20137000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the [[Taihang Mountains]],  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures.

Some of the great cities of this civilization include [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], which had a high level of town planning and arts. The cause of the destruction of these regions around 1700 BCE is debatable, although evidence suggests it was caused by natural disasters (especially flooding).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indus Valley Civilisation|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|work=ThinkQuest|accessdate=9 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014129/http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=}}</ref> This era marks [[Vedic period]] in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BCE.

Persian politics included a tolerance for other cultures, a highly [[centralized government]], and significant infrastructure developments. Later, in [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]'s rule, the territories were integrated, a bureaucracy was developed, nobility were assigned military positions, tax collection was carefully organized, and spies were used to ensure the loyalty of regional officials. The primary religion of Persia at this time was [[Zoroastrianism]], developed by the philosopher [[Zoroaster]]. It introduced an early form of [[monotheism]] to the area. The religion banned animal sacrifice and the use of intoxicants in rituals; and introduced the concept of spiritual salvation through personal moral action, an [[end time]], and both [[General judgment|general]] and [[Particular judgment]] with a [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. These concepts would heavily influence later emperors and the masses. More importantly, Zoroastrianism would be an important precursor for the [[Abrahamic religions]] such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Persian Empire was successful in establishing peace and stability throughout the Middle East and were a major influence in art, politics (affecting Hellenistic leaders), and religion.\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] conquered this dynasty in the 4th century BCE, creating the brief [[Hellenistic period]]. He was unable to establish stability and after his death, Persia broke into small, weak dynasties including the [[Seleucid Empire]], followed by the [[Parthian Empire]]. By the end of the Classical age, Persia had been reconsolidated into the [[Sassanid Empire]], also known as the second Persian Empire.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] would later control parts of Western Asia. The [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.\n\n====India====\n{{See also|Greater India}}\n\nThe Maurya and Gupta empires are called the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture. The religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], which began in Indian sub-continent, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia.\n\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|270px|Expansion of [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]]]\nBy 600 BCE, India had been divided into 17 regional states that would occasionally feud amongst themselves. In 327 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] came to India with a vision of conquering the whole world. He crossed northwestern India and created the province [[Bactria]] but could not move further because his army wanted to go back to their family. Shortly prior, the soldier [[Chandragupta Maurya]] began to take control of the Ganges river and soon established the [[Maurya Empire]]. The Maurya Empire (Sanskrit: \u092e\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Maurya R\u0101javan\u015bha) was the geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE. It was one of the world's largest empires in its time, stretching to the [[Himalayas]] in the north, what is now [[Assam]] in the east, probably beyond modern [[Pakistan]] in the west, and annexing [[Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], at its greatest extent. South of Mauryan empire was the [[Tamilakam]] an independent country dominated by three dynasties, the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyans]], [[Cholas]] and [[Cheras]]. The government established by Chandragupta was led by an autocratic king, who primarily relied on the military to assert his power.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} It also applied the use of a bureaucracy and even sponsored a postal service.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} Chandragupta's grandson, [[Ashoka]], greatly extended the empire by conquering most of modern-day India (save for the southern tip). He eventually converted to Buddhism, though, and began a peaceful life where he promoted the religion as well as humane methods throughout India. The Maurya Empire would disintegrate soon after Ashoka's death and was conquered by the Kushan invaders from the northwest, establishing the [[Kushan Empire]]. Their conversion to Buddhism caused the religion to be associated with foreigners and therefore a decline in its popularity occurred.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}}\n\nThe Kushan Empire would fall apart by 220 CE, creating more political turmoil in India. Then in 320, the [[Gupta Empire]] (Sanskrit: \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Gupta R\u0101javan\u015bha) was established and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by [[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]], the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization. Gupta kings united the area primarily through negotiation of local leaders and families as well as strategical intermarriage.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} Their rule covered less land than the Maurya Empire, but established the greatest stability.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} In 535, the empire ended when India was overrun by the [[Hunas]].\n\n====Classical China====\n\n=====Zhou Dynasty=====\n{{main|Zhou dynasty}}\n[[File:Zhou dynasty 1000 BC.png|thumb|Population concentration and boundaries of the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty in China]]\nSince 1029 BCE, the [[Zhou dynasty]] ({{zh|c=\u5468\u671d|p=Zh\u014du Ch\u00e1o|w=Chou Ch'ao}} {{IPA-cmn|t\u0282\u00f3\u028a t\u0282\u02b0\u0251\u030c\u028a|}}), had existed in China and it would continue to until 258 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The Zhou dynasty had been using a [[Feudalism|feudal system]] by giving power to local nobility and relying on their loyalty in order to control its large territory.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} As a result, the Chinese government at this time tended to be very decentralized and weak, and there was often little the emperor could do to resolve national issues. Nonetheless, the government was able to retain its position with the creation of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which could establish an emperor as divinely chosen to rule. The Zhou additionally discouraged the [[human sacrifice]] of the preceding eras and unified the [[Chinese language]]. Finally, the Zhou government encouraged settlers to move into the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] valley, thus creating the Chinese Middle Kingdom.\n\nBut by 500 BCE, its political stability began to decline due to repeated nomadic incursions{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} and internal conflict derived from the fighting princes and families. This was lessened by the many philosophical movements, starting with the life of [[Confucius]]. His philosophical writings (called [[Confucianism]]) concerning the respect of elders and of the state would later be popularly used in the Han dynasty. Additionally, [[Laozi]]'s concepts of [[Taoism]], including [[yin and yang]] and the innate duality and balance of nature and the universe, became popular throughout this period. Nevertheless, the Zhou Dynasty eventually disintegrated as the local nobles began to gain more power and their conflict devolved into the [[Warring States period]], from 402 to 201 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=44}}\n\n=====Qin Dynasty=====\n{{main|Qin Dynasty}}\nOne leader eventually came on top, [[Qin Shi Huang]] ({{zh|c=\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d}}, ''Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec''), who overthrew the last Zhou emperor and established the Qin dynasty.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The [[Qin dynasty]] (Chinese: \u79e6\u671d; pinyin: Q\u00edn Ch\u00e1o) was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 207 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=42}} The new Emperor abolished the feudal system and directly appointed a bureaucracy that would rely on him for power. Huang's imperial forces crushed any regional resistance, and they furthered the Chinese empire by expanding down to the [[South China Sea]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. Greater organization brought a uniform tax system, a national census, regulated road building (and cart width), standard measurements, standard coinage, and an official written and spoken language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} Further reforms included new irrigation projects, the encouragement of [[silk]] manufacturing,{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} and (most famously) the beginning of the construction of the Great Wall of China\u2014designed to keep out the nomadic raiders who'd constantly badger the Chinese people. However, Shi Huang was infamous for his tyranny, forcing laborers to build the Wall, ordering heavy taxes, and severely punishing all who opposed him. He oppressed Confucians and promoted [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], the idea that people were inherently evil, and that a strong, forceful government was needed to control them. Legalism was infused with realistic, logical views and rejected the pleasures of educated conversation as frivolous. All of this made Shi Huang extremely unpopular with the people. As the Qin began to weaken, various factions began to fight for control of China.\n\n=====Han Dynasty=====\n{{main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Silk Road]] in Asia]]\nThe [[Han dynasty]] (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u671d; pinyin: H\u00e0n Ch\u00e1o; 206 BCE \u2013 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220\u2013265 CE). Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history. One of the Han dynasty's greatest emperors, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], established a peace throughout China comparable to the [[Pax Romana]] seen in the Mediterranean a hundred years later.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\". The Han Dynasty was established when two peasants succeeded in rising up against Shi Huang's significantly weaker successor-son. The new Han government retained the centralization and bureaucracy of the Qin, but greatly reduced the repression seen before. They expanded their territory into [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Central Asia]], creating an even larger empire than the Qin.\n\nThe Han developed contacts with the Persian Empire in the Middle East and the Romans, through the [[Silk Road]], with which they were able to trade many commodities\u2014primarily silk. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the [[Silk Road]], which connected China, [[India]], the Middle East and Europe. Han emperors like Wu also promoted Confucianism as the national \"religion\" (although it is debated by theologians as to whether it is defined as such or as a philosophy). Shrines devoted to Confucius were built and Confucian philosophy was taught to all scholars who entered the Chinese bureaucracy. The bureaucracy was further improved with the introduction of an examination system that selected scholars of high merit. These bureaucrats were often upper-class people educated in special schools, but whose power was often checked by the lower-class brought into the bureaucracy through their skill. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was very effective and highly respected by all in the realm and would last over 2,000 years. The Han government was highly organized and it commanded the military, judicial law (which used a system of courts and strict laws), agricultural production, the economy, and the general lives of its people. The government also promoted intellectual philosophy, scientific research, and detailed historical records.\n\nHowever, despite all of this impressive stability, central power began to lose control by the turn of the [[Common Era]]. As the Han Dynasty declined, many factors continued to pummel it into submission until China was left in a state of chaos. By 100 CE, philosophical activity slowed, and corruption ran rampant in the bureaucracy. Local landlords began to take control as the scholars neglected their duties, and this resulted in heavy taxation of the peasantry. Taoists began to gain significant ground and protested the decline. They started to proclaim magical powers and promised to save China with them; the Taoist [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 (led by rebels in yellow scarves) failed but was able to weaken the government. The aforementioned Huns combined with diseases killed up to half of the population and officially ended the Han dynasty by 220. The ensuing period of chaos was so terrible it lasted for three centuries, where many weak regional rulers and dynasties failed to establish order in China. This period of chaos and attempts at order is commonly known as that of the [[Six Dynasties]]. The first part of this included the [[Three Kingdoms]] which started in 220 and describes the brief and weak successor \"dynasties\" that followed the Han. In 265, the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] of China was started and this soon split into two different empires in control of northwestern and southeastern China. In 420, the conquest and abdication of those two dynasties resulted in the first of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Northern and Southern Dynasties passed through until finally, by 557, the [[Northern Zhou|Northern Zhou dynasty]] ruled the north and the [[Chen dynasty]] ruled the south.\n\n==Medieval{{anchor|Medieval}}==\nDuring this period, the [[Eastern world]] empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.\n\n===Western Asia (Middle East)===\n{{main|Medieval Middle East}}\n[[File:Byzantine and Sassanid Empires in 600 CE.png|thumb|right|310px|Byzantine and Sassanian Empires in 600 AD]]\nThe Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Medieval era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the Arabian Empires.\n\nIn the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sassanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sassanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.\n\nWhile the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the [[Seljuq Empire]].\n\n[[File:Caliphate 750.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[early Muslim conquests]], 622\u2013750]]\nAfter Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.\n\nThe dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] and advancing as far south as the border of [[Egypt]] in what became known as the [[Mongol conquests]]. The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].\n\n===Central Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Central Asia}}\n\n====Mongol Empire====\n[[Image:Mongolia 1500 AD.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] residual states and domains by the 15th century]]\nThe [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as [[Genghis Khan]]. He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.\n\n===South Asia/Indian Subcontinent===\n====India====\n{{main|Medieval India}}\n[[File:Delhi Sultanate map.png|thumb|right|320px|The [[Delhi Sultanate]].]]\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]]. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyas]] and the [[Cholas]] from still farther south. The Cholas could under the rule of [[Raja Raja Chola]] defeat their rivals and rise to a regional power. Cholas expanded northward and defeated [[Eastern Chalukya]], [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Kalinga]] and the [[Pala Empire|Pala]]. Under [[Rajendra Chola]] the Cholas created the first notable navy of Indian subcontinent. The [[Chola navy]] extended the influence of Chola empire to [[southeast asia]]. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.<ref>{{citation|last=Stein|first=B.|author-link=Burton Stein|date=1998|title=A History of India|edition=1st|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-20546-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXdVS0SzQSAC|pages=119\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests include the limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Umayyad campaigns in India, during the time of the Rajput kingdoms in the 8th century.\n\nMajor economic and military powers like the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], were seen to be established. The search of their wealth led the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]].\n\n===East Asia===\n{{main|History of East Asia}}\n\n====China====\n{{main|Medieval China}}\nChina saw the rise and fall of the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties and therefore improvements in its bureaucracy, the spread of [[Buddhism]], and the advent of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. It was an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.\n\n=====Sui Dynasty=====\n{{main|Sui dynasty}}\nA new powerful dynasty began to rise in the 580s, amongst the divided factions of China. This was started when an aristocrat named Yang Jian married his daughter into the Northern Zhou dynasty. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] and appeased the nomadic military by abandoning the Confucian scholar-gentry. Emperor Wen soon led the conquest of the southern Chen Dynasty and united China once more under the [[Sui dynasty]]. The emperor lowered taxes and constructed granaries that he used to prevent famine and control the market. Later Wen's son would murder him for the throne and declare himself [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]. Emperor Yang revived the Confucian scholars and the bureaucracy, much to anger of the aristocrats and nomadic military leaders. Yang became an excessive leader who overused China's resources for personal luxury and perpetuated exhaustive attempts to conquer Goguryeo. His military failures and neglect of the empire forced his own ministers to assassinate him in 618, ending the Sui Dynasty.\n\n=====Tang dynasty=====\n{{main|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:Battle of Talas.png|thumb|380px|[[Battle of Talas]] between Tang dynasty and [[Abbasid Caliphate]] c. 751]]\n\nFortunately, one of Yang's most respectable advisors, Li Yuan, was able to claim the throne quickly, preventing a chaotic collapse. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]], and established the [[Tang dynasty]] in 623. The Tang saw expansion of China through conquest to Tibet in the west, [[Vietnam]] in the south, and Manchuria in the north. Tang emperors also improved the education of scholars in the Chinese bureaucracy. A Ministry of Rites was established and the examination system was improved to better qualify scholars for their jobs.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=270|loc=Chapter 12|quote=In the Tang and Song periods, the examination system was greatly expanded, and the pattern of advancement in the civil service was much more regularized. This meant that in the political realm more than any previous political system (and those yet to come for centuries), the Chinese connected merit as measured by tested skills with authority and status.}} In addition, Buddhism became popular in China with two different strains between the peasantry and the elite, the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and [[Zen]] strains, respectively.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|pages=271\u2013272|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Among the masses, the salvationist pure land strain of Mahayana Buddhism won widespread conversions because it seemed to provide a refuge from an age of war and turmoil. Members of the elite class, on the other hand, were more attracted to the Chan variant of Buddhism, or Zen as it is known in Japan and the West.}} Greatly supporting the spread of Buddhism was [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], who additionally claimed an unofficial \"Zhou dynasty\" and displayed China's tolerance of a woman ruler, which was rare at the time. However, Buddhism would also experience some backlash, especially from Confucianists and Taoists. This would usually involve criticism about how it was costing the state money, since the government was unable to tax Buddhist monasteries, and additionally sent many grants and gifts to them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=273|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Because monastic lands and resources were not taxed, the Tang regime lost huge amounts of revenue as a result of imperial grants or the gifts of wealthy families to Buddhist monasteries.}}\n\nThe Tang dynasty began to decline under the rule of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who began to neglect the economy and military and caused unrest amongst the court officials due to the excessive influence of his concubine, [[Yang Guifei]], and her family.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The arrogance and excessive ambition of Yang Guifei and her family angered members of the rival cliques at court, who took every opportunity to turn Yang's excesses into a cause for popular unreast.}} This eventually sparked a revolt in 755.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The deepening crisis came to a head in 755 when one of [Xuanzong]'s main military leaders&nbsp;... led a widely supported revolt with the aim of founding a new dynasty to supplant the Tang.}} Although the revolt failed, subduing it required involvement with the unruly nomadic tribes outside of China and distributing more power to local leaders\u2014leaving the government and economy in a degraded state. The Tang dynasty officially ended in 907 and various factions led by the aforementioned nomadic tribes and local leaders would fight for control of China in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].\n\n=====Liao, Song and Jin dynasties=====\n{{main|Liao dynasty|Song dynasty|Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)}}\nBy 960, most of China proper had been reunited under the [[Song dynasty]], although it lost territories in the north and could not defeat one of the nomadic tribes there\u2014the [[Liao dynasty]] of the highly sinicized [[Khitan people]]. From then on, the Song would have to pay tribute to avoid invasion and thus set the precedent for other nomadic kingdoms to oppress them. The Song also saw the revival of Confucianism in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This had the effect of putting the Confucian scholars at a higher status than aristocrats or Buddhists and also intensified the reduction of power in women. The infamous practice of [[foot binding]] developed in this period as a result. Eventually the Liao dynasty in the north was overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] of the Manchu-related [[Jurchen people]]. The new Jin kingdom [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|invaded northern China]], leaving the Song to flee farther south and creating the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1126. There, cultural life flourished.\n\n=====Yuan Dynasty=====\n{{main|Yuan dynasty}}\n [[File:Route of Marco Polo.png|thumb|380px|Map of Marco Polo's travels]]\nBy 1227, the Mongols had conquered the [[Western Xia]] kingdom northwest of China. Soon the Mongols incurred upon the Jin empire of the Jurchens. Chinese cities were soon besieged by the Mongol hordes that showed little mercy for those who resisted and the Southern Song Chinese were quickly losing territory. In 1271 the current great khan, [[Kublai Khan]], claimed himself Emperor of China and officially established the Yuan Dynasty. By 1290, all of China was under control of the Mongols, marking the first time they were ever completely conquered by a foreign invader; the new capital was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (modern-day [[Beijing]]). Kublai Khan segregated Mongol culture from Chinese culture by discouraging interactions between the two peoples, separating living spaces and places of worship, and reserving top administrative positions to Mongols, thus preventing Confucian scholars to continue the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, Kublai remained fascinated with Chinese thinking, surrounding himself with Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian advisors.\n\nMongol women displayed a contrasting independent nature compared to the Chinese women who continued to be suppressed. Mongol women often rode out on hunts or even to war. Kublai's wife, [[Chabi]], was a perfect example of this; Chabi advised her husband on several political and diplomatic matters; she convinced him that the Chinese were to be respected and well-treated in order to make them easier to rule.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=327|loc=Chapter 14|quote=[Chabi] convinced Kubilai that the harsh treatment of the survivors of the defeated Song imperial family would only anger the peoples of north China and make them more difficult to rule.}} However this was not enough to affect Chinese women's position, and the increasingly Neo-Confucian successors of Kublai further repressed Chinese and even Mongol women.\n\nThe Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe, had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331.\n\n====Korea====\n{{main|Medieval Korea}}\n\n====[[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]====\n[[File:History of Korea-476.PNG|thumb|left|Korean peninsula in 476 AD. There are three kingdoms and Gaya Union in the picture. This picture shows the heyday of [[Goguryeo]]]]\nThe three Kingdoms of Korea involves [[Goguryeo]] in north, [[Baekje]] in southwest, and [[Silla]] in southeast Korean peninsula. These three kingdoms were like a bridge of cultures between China and Japan. Thanks to them, Japan was able to accept Chinese splendid cultures. [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of Japan had been taught by two teachers. One was from [[Baekje]], the other was from [[Goguryeo]]. Once Japan invaded [[Silla]], Goguryeo helped Silla to defeat Japan. [[Baekje]] met the earliest heyday of them. Its heyday was the 5th century AD. Its capital was [[Seoul]]. During its heyday, the kingdom made colonies overseas. Liaodong, China and Kyushu, Japan were the colonies of [[Baekje]] during its short heyday. [[Goguryeo]] was the strongest kingdom of all. They sometimes called themselves  as an Empire. Its heyday was 6th century. King Gwanggaeto widened its territory  to north. So Goguryeo dominated from Korean peninsula to Manchuria. And his son, [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|King Jangsu]] widened its territory to south. He occupied [[Seoul]], and moved its capital to [[Pyeongyang]]. Goguryeo almost occupied three quarters of South Korean peninsula thanks to king Jangsu who widened the kingdom's territory to south. [[Silla]] met the latest heyday. King Jinheung went north and occupied[[Seoul]]. But it was short. [[Baekje]] became stronger and attacked Silla. Baekje occupied more than 40 cities of Silla. So Silla could hardly survive.\nChina's Sui dynasty invaded [[Goguryeo]] and [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War]] occurs between Korea and China. [[Goguryeo]] won against China and [[Sui dynasty]] fell. After then, [[Tang dynasty]] reinvaded [[Goguryeo]] and helped [[Silla]] to unify the peninsula. Because Silla was the weakest of all, so it asked Tang for help. [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and Japan helped each other against Tang-Silla alliance, but [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] fell. Unfortunately, [[Tang dynasty]] betrayed [[Silla]] in order to occupy the whole Korean peninsula. During the [[Silla-Tang war]], people of fallen Baekje and Goguryeo helped Silla against Chinese invasion, so Silla could beat China and unified the peninsula. This war helped Korean people to unite mentally.\n=====North-South States Period=====\n[[File:History of Korea-Inter-country Age-830 CE.gif|thumb|left|[[Balhae]] in the north, [[Later Silla]] in the south]]\n[[File:Korea - Seoul - National Museum - Incense Burner 0252-06a.jpg|thumb|right|the [[Goryeo ware]], which shows splendid culture of [[Goryeo]] in mediaeval Korea.]]\n\nThe rest of [[Goguryeo]] people established [[Balhae]] and won the war against Tang in later 7th century AD. [[Balhae]] is the north state, and [[Later Silla]] was the south state. Balhae was a quite strong kingdom as their ancestor Goguryeo did. Finally, the Emperor of Tang dynasty admits Balhae as 'A strong country in the East'. They liked to trade with Japan, China, and Silla. Balhae and Later Silla sent a lot of international students to China. And Arabian merchants came into Korean peninsula, so Korea became known as 'Silla' in the western countries. Silla improved Korean writing system called Idu letters. Idu affected [[Katakana]] of Japan. [[Liao dynasty]] invaded [[Balhae]] in early 10th century, so [[Balhae]] fell.\n\n=====Later Three Kingdoms of Korea=====\nThe unified Korean kingdom, Later Silla divided into three kingdoms again because of the corrupt central government. It involves [[Later Goguryeo]](also as known as \"Taebong\"), [[Later Baekje]], and Later Silla. The general of [[Later Goguryeo]], Wang Geon took the thrown and  changed its name into [[Goryeo]], which was derived by the old strong kingdom, Goguryeo, and Goryeo reunified the peninsula.\n\n=====Goryeo(918~1392)=====\n{{main|Goryeo}}\n[[File:Goryo Taejo Wangkun 2.jpg|thumb|left|The first King of [[Goryeo]], as known as [[Taejo of Goryeo]](918~943)]]\n[[Goryeo]] reunited the Korean peninsula during the later three kingdoms period and named itself as 'Empire'. But nowadays, Goryeo is known as a kingdom. The name 'Goryeo' was derived from [[Goguryeo]], and the name [[Korea]] was derived from Goryeo. Goryeo adopted people from fallen [[Balhae]]. They also widened their territory to north by defending Liao dynasty and attacking the [[Jurchen people]]. Goryeo developed a splendid culture. The first metal type printed book [[Jikji]] was also from Korea. The [[Goryeo ware]] is one of the most famous legacies of this kingdom. Goryeo imported Chinese government system and developed into their own ways.\n\nDuring this period, laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced. Buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula. The [[Tripitaka Koreana]] is 81,258 books total. It was made to keep Korea safe against the Mongolian invasion. It is now a UNESCO world heritage. Goryeo won the battle against [[Liao dynasty]]. Then, the [[Mongolian Empire]] invaded Goryeo. Goryeo did not disappear but it had to obey Mongolians. After 80 years, in 14th century, the Mongolian dynasty Yuan lose power, King Gongmin tried to free themselves against Mongol although his wife was also Mongolian. At the 14th century, [[Ming dynasty]] want Goryeo to obey China. But Goryeo didn't. They decided to invade China. Going to China, the general of Goryeo, Lee Sung-Gae came back and destroyed Goryeo and established new dynasty, [[Joseon]]. And he became [[Taejo of Joseon]], which means the first king of [[Joseon]].\n\n\n====Japan====\n{{main|Medieval Japan}}\n[[File:Shotoku Taishi.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]]]]\n\n=====Asuka period=====\nJapan's medieval history began with the [[Asuka period]], from around 600 to 710. The time was characterized by the [[Taika Reform]] and imperial centralization, both of which were a direct result of growing Chinese contact and influences. In 603, [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Yamato dynasty]] began significant political and cultural changes. He issued the [[Seventeen-article constitution]] in 604, centralizing power towards the emperor (under the title ''tenno'', or heavenly sovereign) and removing the power to levy taxes from provincial lords. Sh\u014dtoku was also a patron of Buddhism and he encouraged building temples competitively.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}}\n\n=====Nara period=====\nSh\u014dtoku's reforms transitioned Japan to the [[Nara period]] (c. 710 to c. 794), with the moving of the Japanese capital to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in [[Honshu]]. This period saw the culmination of Chinese-style writing, etiquette, and architecture in Japan along with Confucian ideals{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} to supplement the already present Buddhism. Peasants revered both Confucian scholars and Buddhist monks. However, in the wake of the [[735\u2013737 Japanese smallpox epidemic]], Buddhism gained the status of state religion and the government ordered the construction of numerous Buddhist temples, monasteries, and statues.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} The lavish spending combined with the fact that many aristocrats did not pay taxes, put a heavy burden on peasantry that caused poverty and famine.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} Eventually the Buddhist position got out of control, threatening to seize imperial power and causing [[Emperor Kanmu]] to move the capital to [[Heian-ky\u014d]] to avoid a Buddhist takeover.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] and the end of Taika reform.\n\n=====Heian period=====\nWith the Heian period (from 794 to 1185) came a decline of imperial power. Chinese influence also declined, as a result of its correlation with imperial centralization and the [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]], which came to be regarded as ineffective. By 838, the Japanese court discontinued its embassies in China; only traders and Buddhist monks continued to travel to China. Buddhism itself came to be considered more Japanese than Chinese, and persisted to be popular in Japan. Buddhists monks and monasteries continued their attempts to gather personal power in courts, along with aristocrats. One particular noble family that dominated influence in the imperial bureaucracy was the [[Fujiwara clan]]. During this time cultural life in the imperial court flourished. There was a focus on beauty and social interaction and writing and literature was considered refined. Noblewomen were cultured the same as noblemen, dabbling in creative works and politics. A prime example of both Japanese literature and women's role in high-class culture at this time was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written by the [[lady-in-waiting]] [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Popularization of wooden palaces and [[sh\u014dji]] sliding doors amongst the nobility also occurred.\n\nLoss of imperial power also led to the rise of provincial warrior elites. Small lords began to function independently. They administered laws, supervised public works projects, and collected revenue for themselves instead of the imperial court. Regional lords also began to build their own armies. These warriors were loyal only their local lords and not the emperor, although the imperial government increasingly called them in to protect the capital. The regional warrior class developed into the [[samurai]], which created its own culture: including specialized weapons such as the [[katana]] and a form of chivalry, [[bushido]]. The imperial government's loss of control in the second half of the Heian period allowed banditry to grow, requiring both feudal lords and Buddhist monasteries to procure warriors for protection. As imperial control over Japan declined, feudal lords also became more independent and seceded from the empire. These feudal states squandered the peasants living in them, reducing the farmers to an almost [[serfdom]] status. Peasants were also rigidly restricted from rising to the samurai class, being physically set off by dress and weapon restrictions. As a result of their oppression, many peasants turned to Buddhism as a hope for reward in the afterlife for upright behavior.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=296}}\n\nWith the increase of feudalism, families in the imperial court began to depend on alliances with regional lords. The Fujiwara clan declined from power, replaced by a rivalry between the [[Taira clan]] and the [[Minamoto clan]]. This rivalry grew into the [[Genpei War]] in the early 1180s. This war saw the use of both samurai and peasant soldiers. For the samurai, battle was ritual and they often easily cut down the poorly trained peasantry. The Minamoto clan proved successful due to their rural alliances. Once the Taira was destroyed, the Minamoto established a military government called the [[shogunate]] (or bakufu), centered in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].\n\n=====Kamakura period=====\nThe end of the Genpei War and the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the [[Kamakura period]] in 1185, solidifying feudal Japan.\n\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Southeast Asia}}\n\n==Early modern==\n{{further|Early modern period}}\n[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|A 1796 map of Asia (or the \"[[Eastern world]]\"), which also included the continent of [[Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]) within its realm.]]\nThe [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of [[Siberia]] and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India and initiated the second golden age for India. China was the largest economy in the world for much of the time, followed by India until the 18th century.\n\n===Ming China===\n\nBy 1368, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] had claimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor]] and established the Ming dynasty of China. Immediately, the new emperor and his followers drove the Mongols and their culture out of China and beyond the Great Wall.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Immediately after he seized the throne, Zhu launched an effort to rid China of all traces of the \"barbarian\" Mongols. Mongol dress was discarded, Mongol names were dropped by those who had adopted them and were removed from buildings and court records, and Mongol palaces and administrative buildings in some areas were raided and sacked. The nomads themselves fled or were driven beyond the Great Wall, where military expeditions pursued them on several occasions.}} The new emperor was somewhat suspicious of the scholars that dominated China's bureaucracy, for he had been born a peasant and was uneducated.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Because the Hongwu emperor, like the founder of the earlier Han dynasty, was from a peasant family and thus poorly educated, he viewed the scholar-gentry with some suspicion.}} Nevertheless, Confucian scholars were necessary to China's bureaucracy and were reestablished as well as reforms that would improve the exam systems and make them more important in entering the bureaucracy than ever before. The exams became more rigorous, cut down harshly on cheating, and those who excelled were more highly appraised. Finally, Hongwu also directed more power towards the role of emperor so as to end the corrupt influences of the bureaucrats.\n\n====Society and economy====\nThe Hongwu emperor, perhaps for his sympathy of the common-folk, had built many irrigation systems and other public projects that provided help for the peasant farmers.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Perhaps because his lowly origins and personal suffering made him sensitive to the plight of the peasantry, Hongwu introduced measures that would improve the lot of the common people. Like most strong emperors, he promoted public works projects, including dike building and the extension of irrigation systems aimed at improving the farmers' yields.}} They were also allowed to cultivate and claim unoccupied land without having to pay any taxes and labor demands were lowered.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=... Hongwu decreed that unoccupied lands would become the tax-exempt property of those who cleared and cultivated them. He lowered forced labor demands on the peasantry by both the government and members of the gentry class.}} However, none of this was able to stop the rising landlord class that gained many privileges from the government and slowly gained control of the peasantry. Moneylenders foreclosed on peasant debt in exchange for mortgages and bought up farmer land, forcing them to become the landlords' tenants or to wander elsewhere for work.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=505|loc=Chapter 22}} Also during this time, [[Neo-Confucianism]] intensified even more than the previous two dynasties (the Song and Yuan). Focus on the superiority of elders over youth, men over women, and teachers over students resulted in minor discrimination of the \"inferior\" classes. The fine arts grew in the Ming era, with improved techniques in brush painting that depicted scenes of court, city or country life; people such as scholars or travelers; or the beauty of mountains, lakes, or marshes. The Chinese novel fully developed in this era, with such classics written such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]''.\n\nEconomics grew rapidly in the Ming Dynasty as well. The introduction of American crops such as [[maize]], [[sweet potatoes]], and [[peanut]]s allowed for cultivation of crops in infertile land and helped prevent famine. The population boom that began in the Song dynasty accelerated until China's population went from 80 or 90 million to 150 million in three centuries, culminating in 1600.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By 1600 the population of China had risen to as many as 150 million from 80 to 90 million in the 14th century.}} This paralleled the market economy that was growing both internally and externally. Silk, tea, ceramics, and lacquer-ware were produced by artisans that traded them in Asia and to Europeans. Westerners began to trade (with some Chinese-assigned limits), primarily in the port-towns of [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Although merchants benefited greatly from this, land remained the primary symbol of wealth in China and traders' riches were often put into acquiring more land.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Much of the merchants' wealth was invested in land rather than plowed back into trade or manufacturing, because land owning, not commerce, remained the surest route to social status in China.}} Therefore, little of these riches were used in private enterprises that could've allowed for China to develop the [[market economy]] that often accompanied the highly-successful Western countries.\n\n====Foreign interests====\n[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the [[Fort St George]] in 18th-century [[Madras]].]]\nIn the interest of national glory, the Chinese began sending impressive [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships across the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. From 1403 to 1433, the [[Yongle Emperor]] commissioned [[Treasure voyages|expeditions]] led by the admiral [[Zheng He]], a Muslim [[eunuch]] from China. Chinese junks carrying hundreds of soldiers, goods, and animals for zoos, traveled to Southeast Asia, Persia, southern Arabia, and east Africa to show off Chinese power. Their prowess exceeded that of current Europeans at the time, and had these expeditions not ended, the world economy may be different from today.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=339|loc=Chapter 15|quote=There is no question that the course of world history might have been changed dramatically had the Chinese thrust continued, for the tiny European expeditions that began to creep down the western coast of Africa at about the same time would have been no match for this combination of merchant and military organization.}} In 1433, the Chinese government decided that the cost of a navy was an unnecessary expense. The Chinese navy was slowly dismantled and focus on interior reform and military defense began. It was China's longstanding priority that they protect themselves from nomads and they have accordingly returned to it. The growing limits on the Chinese navy would leave them vulnerable to foreign invasion by sea later on.\n\n[[File:Schall-von-bell.jpg|thumb|Here a Jesuit, Adam Schall von Bell (1592\u20131666), is dressed as an official of the Chinese Department of Astronomy.]]\n\nAs was inevitable, Westerners arrived on the Chinese east coast, primarily [[Jesuit]] missionaries which reached the mainland in 1582. They attempted to [[Jesuit China missions|convert the Chinese people to Christianity]] by first converting the top of the social hierarchy and allowing the lower classes to subsequently convert. To further gain support, many Jesuits adopted Chinese dress, customs, and language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=The Jesuits believed that the best way to convert a great civilization such as China was to adopt the dress, customs, language and manners of its elite.}} Some Chinese scholars were interested in certain Western teachings and especially in Western technology. By the 1580s, Jesuit scholars like [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Adam Schall]] amazed the Chinese elite with technological advances such as European clocks, improved calendars and cannons, and the accurate prediction of eclipses.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Beginning in the 1580s, a succession of brilliant Jesuit scholars ... spent most of their time in the imperial city, correcting faulty calendars, forging cannons, fixing clocks imported from Europe, and astounding the Chinese scholar-gentry with the accuracy of their instruments and their ability to predict eclipses.}} Although some the scholar-gentry converted, many were suspicious of the Westerners whom they called \"barbarians\" and even resented them for the embarrassment they received at the hand of Western correction. Nevertheless, a small group of Jesuit scholars remained at the court to impress the emperor and his advisors.\n\n====Decline====\n[[Image:Batavia, C. de Jonghe (1740).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch Batavia in the 17th century, built in what is now [[North Jakarta]]]]\n\nNear the end of the 1500s, the extremely centralized government that gave so much power to the emperor had begun to fail as more incompetent rulers took the mantle. Along with these weak rulers came increasingly corrupt officials who took advantage of the decline. Once more the public projects fell into disrepair due to neglect by the bureaucracy and resulted in floods, drought, and famine that rocked the peasantry. The famine soon became so terrible that some peasants resorted to selling their children to slavery to save them from starvation, or to eating bark, the feces of geese, or [[Cannibalism|other people]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=509|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Peasants in afflicted districts were reduced to eating the bark from trees or the excrement of wild geese. Some peasants sold their children into slavery to keep them from starving, and peasants in some areas resorted to cannibalism.}} Many landlords abused the situation by building large estates where desperate farmers would work and be exploited. In turn, many of these farmers resorted to flight, banditry, and open rebellion.\n\nAll of this corresponded with the usual dynastic decline of China seen before, as well as the growing foreign threats. In the mid-16th century, Japanese and ethnic Chinese pirates began to raid the southern coast, and neither the bureaucracy nor the military were able to stop them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=One of the early signs of the seriousness of imperial deterioration was the inability of Chinese bureaucrats and military forces to put an end to the epidemic of Japanese (and ethnic Chinese) pirate attacks that ravaged the southern coast in the mid-16th century.}} The threat of the northern [[Manchu people]] also grew. The Manchu were an already large state north of China, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [[Nurhaci]] suddenly united them under the [[Eight Banners]]\u2014armies that the opposing families were organized into. The Manchus adopted many Chinese customs, specifically taking after their bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Manchus still remained a Chinese [[vassal]]. In 1644 Chinese administration became so weak, the 16th and last emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], did not respond to the severity of an ensuing rebellion by local dissenters until the enemy had invaded the [[Forbidden City]] (his personal estate). He soon hanged himself in the imperial gardens.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By [1644], the administrative apparatus had become so feeble that the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, did not realize how serious the rebel advance was until enemy soldiers were scaling the walls of the forbidden city. ... the ill-fated Chongzhen retreated to the imperial gardens and hanged himself rather than face capture.}} For a brief amount of time, the [[Shun dynasty]] was claimed, until a loyalist Ming official called support from the Manchus to put down the new dynasty. The Shun Dynasty ended within a year and the Manchu were now within the Great Wall. Taking advantage of the situation, the Manchus marched on the Chinese capital of Beijing. [[Manchu conquest of China|Within two decades]] all of China belonged to the Manchu and the [[Qing dynasty]] was established.\n===Korea: Joseon dynasty(1392~1897)===\n{{Main|Joseon}}\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-Gyeonghoeru-02.jpg|thumb|left|Gyeonghoeru of [[Gyeongbokgung]], the [[Joseon]] dynasty's royal palace.]]\nIn early-modern Korea, the 500-year-old kingdom, [[Goryeo]] fell and new dynasty [[Joseon]] rose in August 5th, 1392. [[Taejo of Joseon]] changed the country's name from [[Goryeo]] to [[Joseon]]. The fourth king, [[Sejong the Great]] created [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabets by himself in 1443. He also improved science technology as Koreans invent Sun Clocks, Water Clocks, Rain-Measuring system, Star Map, Korean map, and detail records of Korean small villages. He even widened the territory to the north. So nowadays' Korean territory formed at that age. He even attacked Japanese pirates in Tsushima Island, who had been attacking Korea a lot. So he is considered the best king ever in history of Korea. The ninth king, [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] accomplished the first complete Korean [[Gyeongguk daejeon|law code]] in 1485. So the culture and people's lives were improved again. \n\nIn 1592, Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] invaded Korea. That war is [[Imjin war]]. At that war, Joseon was in a long peace like PAX ROMANA. So Joseon was not ready for the war. Joseon lose again and again. Japanese army conquered [[Seoul]]. The whole [[Korean peninsula]] was in danger. But [[Yi Sun-sin]], the most renowned general of Korea defeated Japanese fleet in southern Korea coast even 13 ships VS 133 ships. This is the legendary battle called \"[[Battle of Myeongnyang]]\". After then, [[Ming dynasty]] helped Joseon and Japan lose the battle. So Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi fell, the [[Edo period]] begins. Korea hurt a lot at [[Imjin war]]. Not long after, Manchurian people invaded Joseon again. It is called [[Qing invasion of Joseon]]. First invasion was for sake. Because Qing was at war between Ming, so Ming's alliance Joseon was threatening. And the second invasion was for Joseon to obey Qing. After then, Qing defeated Ming and took the whole Chinese territories. Joseon also had to obey Qing because Joseon lose the second war against Qing.\n\nAfter Qing invasion, the princes of Joseon dynasty lived their childhood in China. The son of king Injo met [[Adam Schall]] in Beijing. So he wanted to introduce western technologies to Korean people when he becomes a king. Unfortunately, he died before he takes the thrown. After then, the alternative prince became the 17th king of Joseon dynasty, Hyojong, trying to revenge for his kingdom and fallen Ming dynasty to Qing. Later kings such as Yeongjo and Jeongjo tried to improve their people's lives and stop the governors' unreasonable competition. From 17th century to 18th century, Joseon sent diplomats and artists to Japan more than 10 times. This group was called 'Tongshinsa'. They were sent to Japan to teach Japan about advanced Korean cultures. Japanese people liked to receive poems from Korean nobles. At that time, Korea was more powerful than Japan. But that relationship between Joseon and Japan was reversed after 19th century. Because Japan became more powerful than Korea and China, either. So Joseon sent diplomats called 'Sooshinsa' to learn Japanese advanced technologies. After king Jeongjo's death, some noble families controlled the whole kingdom in early 19th century. At the end of that period, Western people invaded Joseon. In 1876, Joseon was set free from Qing so they did not have to obey Qing. But Japanese Empire was happy because Joseon became a perfect independent kingdom. So Japan could intervene the kingdom more. After this, Joseon traded with the US and sent 'Sooshinsa' to Japan, 'Youngshinsa' to Qing, and 'Bobingsa' to the US and Europe. These groups took many modern things to Korean peninsula.\n===Japan: Tokugawa or Edo period (1603\u20131867)===\n{{Main|Edo period}}\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', c. 1830 by [[Hokusai]], an example of art flourishing in the Edo Period]]\nIn early-modern  Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of \"warring states\", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603.\n\nSociety in the Japanese \"[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]\" (see [[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of [[samurai]], with the farmers, artisans, and merchants ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy. Literacy rose in the two centuries of isolation.<ref>Geoffrey Barraclough and Norman Stone, ''Harper Collins Atlas of World History'' (2003) p 175.</ref>\n\nIn some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014ds'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014ds'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.<ref>McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' (2002) pp 69-75.</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Mughal Empire|Maratha Empire}}\n[[File:Shah Abbas the Great receiving the Mughal ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618.jpg|thumb|The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618 negotiating with [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]] of [[Safavid dynasty|Iran]]. ]]\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions.

The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire.

However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.\n\nThe [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.<ref>Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.</ref>\n\n\n\n==Late modern==\n{{further|Modern history#Late modern period}}\n===Central Asia: The Great Game, Russia vs Great Britain===\n[[File:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|250px|Political cartoon depicting the Afghan [[Sher Ali Khan|Emir Sher Ali]] with the rival \"friends\" the [[Russian Bear]] and British Lion (1878)]]\n\n[[The Great Game]] was a political and diplomatic confrontation between Great Britain and Russia over [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and neighbouring territories in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. It lasted from 1828 to 1907.  There was no war, but there were many threats. Russia was fearful of British commercial and military inroads into [[Central Asia]], and Britain was fearful of Russia  threatening its largest and most important possession, India. This resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires.  Britain made it a high priority to protect all the approaches to India, and the \"great game\" is primarily how the British did this in terms of a possible Russian threat.  Historians with access  to the archives have concluded that Russia had no plans involving India, as the Russians repeatedly stated.<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814\u20131974'' (1974) p 200</ref>\n\nThe Great Game began in 1838 when Britain decided to gain control over the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and make it a protectorate, and to use the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian Empire]], the [[Khanate of Khiva]], and the Emirate of Bukhara as buffer states between both empires. This would protect India and also key British sea trade routes by stopping Russia from gaining a port on the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean.  Russia proposed Afghanistan as the neutral zone, and the final result was diving up Afghanistan with a neutral zone in the middle between Russian areas in the north and British in the South. Important episodes included the failed [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1838, the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1845, the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1848, the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, and the annexation of [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] by Russia.<ref>* {{cite journal |jstor = 40105749|title = Great Britain's Great Game: An Introduction|journal = The International History Review|volume = 2|issue = 2|pages = 160\u2013171|last1 = Ingram|first1 = Edward|year = 1980|doi = 10.1080/07075332.1980.9640210}}\n</ref> The 1901 novel [[Kim (novel)|''Kim'']] by [[Rudyard Kipling]] made the term popular and introduced the new implication of great power rivalry.

The Manchu Qing emperors, especially Confucian scholar [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], remained largely conservative\u2014retaining the bureaucracy and the scholars within it, as well as the Confucian ideals present in Chinese society. However, changes in the economy and new attempts at resolving certain issues occurred too. These included increased trade with Western countries that brought large amounts of silver into the Chinese economy in exchange for tea, [[porcelain]], and silk textiles. This allowed for a new merchant-class, the [[comprador]]s, to develop. In addition, repairs were done on existing [[Levee|dikes]], canals, roadways, and [[irrigation]] works. This, combined with the lowering of taxes and government-assigned labor, was supposed to calm peasant unrest. However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.\n\nBy the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing China's politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.\n\n====Opium War====\n{{Main|First Opium War}}\n\nChina saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners. Originally, European traders were at a disadvantage because the Chinese cared little for their goods, while European demand for Chinese commodities such as tea and porcelain only grew. In order to tip the trade imbalance in their favor, British merchants began to sell Indian [[opium]] to the Chinese. Not only did this sap Chinese bullion reserves, it also led to widespread drug addiction amongst the [[scholar official|bureaucracy]] and society in general. A ban was placed on opium as early as 1729 by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], but little was done to enforce it. By the early 19th century, under the new [[Daoguang Emperor]], the government began serious efforts to eradicate opium from Chinese society. Leading this endeavour were respected scholar-officials including [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Imperial Commissioner]] [[Lin Zexu]].\n\nAfter Lin [[Destruction of opium at Humen|destroyed more than 20,000 chests of opium]] in the summer of 1839, Europeans demanded compensation for what they saw as unwarranted Chinese interference in their affairs. When it was not paid, the British declared war later the same year, starting what became known as the [[First Opium War]]. The outdated Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] were no match for the advanced British gunboats, and soon the [[Yangzi River]] region came under threat of British bombardment and invasion. The emperor had no choice but to sue for peace, resulting in the exile of Lin and the making of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ceded the British control of [[Hong Kong]] and opened up trade and diplomacy with other European countries, including Germany, France, and the USA.\n====Inner Manchuria====\n{{Further|Northeast China|{{History of Manchuria}}}}\nNortheast China came under influence of Russia with the building of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] through [[Harbin, China|Harbin]] to [[Vladivostok]].<ref>Henry B.  Miller, \"Russian Development of Manchuria.\" ''National Geographic Magazine'' 15 (1904): 113+ [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=cxQSAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA113&dq=manchuria+%22port+arthur%22&ots=k-fC6YolIf&sig=sPnaOR2ZzlHvUrI4-dWa41thFj0 online]. </ref> The [[Empire of Japan]] replaced Russian influence in the region as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904\u20131905, and Japan laid the [[South Manchurian Railway]] in 1906 to [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]].  During the [[Warlord Era]] in China, [[Zhang Zuolin]] established himself in Northeast China, but was murdered by the Japanese for being too independent.  The former Chinese  emperor, [[Puyi]], was then placed on the throne to lead a Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].<ref>Louise Young, ''Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=YjW41KFGw04C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=manchuria++japan&ots=ukkqHB3sQy&sig=s5VbuYRGeCmqdOk0grwc3JpxSzo#v=onepage&q=manchuria%20%20japan&f=false excerpt] </ref>  In August 1945, the Soviet Union invaded the region.  From 1945 to 1948, Northeast China was a base area for Mao Zedong's  [[People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]].  With the encouragement of the Kremlin, the area was used as a staging ground during the Civil War for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]], who were victorious in 1949 and have controlled ever since.<ref>Steven I.

Because the noble family of the king's wife got the power and ruled the country by their way. The 26th king of Joseon dynasty, [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]]'s father, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] wanted the king be powerful again. Even he wasn't the king, as the father of young king, He destroyed noble families and corrupt organizations. So the royal family got the power again. But he wanted to rebuild [[Gyeongbokgung]] palace in order to show the royal power. So he was criticized by people because he spent enormous money. So his son, the real king [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] got power. \n\nThe 26th king of Joseon, Gojong changed the nation's name to ''Daehan Jeguk''. It means the [[Korean Empire]]. And he also promoted himself as an emperor. The new empire accepted more western technology and strengthened military power. Unfortunately, in the [[Russo-Japanese war]], Japan won and started to invade Korea. Japan first stole the right to diplomacy from Korean Empire illegally. But every western country ignored this invasion because they knew Japan became a strong country as they defeated Russian Empire. So emperor Gojong sent diplomats to the Netherlands to let everyone know that Japan stole the Empire's right illegally. But it failed. Japan kicked Gojong off. 3 years after, In 1910, Korean Empire became a part of Empire of Japan. It was the first time ever after invasion of Han dynasty in 108 BC.\n\n\n==Contemporary==\n{{further|Contemporary history}}\n[[File:Asia (late 19th century- early 20th century).jpg|thumb|380px|left|Map of Asia for early 20th century]]\n\nThe European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the early 20th century, such as [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[Spanish East Indies]], and Portuguese [[Macau]] and [[Goa]]. The [[Great Game]] between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as [[Persia]], [[Thailand]] and most of China. In the twentieth century, [[Imperial Japan]] expanded into China and Southeast Asia during the [[World War II]]. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the [[Cold War]], the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the [[Soviet Union]] and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]. The [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.\n\n===China===\n{{main|History of the Republic of China|History of the People's Republic of China}}\nPrior to [[World War II]], China faced a civil war between [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist party and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist party; the nationalists appeared to be in the lead. However, once the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invaded]] in 1937, the two parties were forced to form a temporary cease-fire in order to defend China. The nationalists faced many military failures that caused them to lose territory and subsequently, respect from the Chinese masses. In contrast, the communists' use of guerilla warfare (led by [[Lin Biao]]) proved effective against the Japanese's conventional methods and put the Communist Party on top by 1945. They also gained popularity for the reforms they were already applying in controlled areas, including land redistribution, education reforms, and widespread health care. For the next four years, the nationalists would be forced to retreat to the small island east of China, known as [[Taiwan]] (formerly known as Formosa), where they remain today. In mainland China, [[China|People's Republic of China]] was established by the Communist Party, with [[Mao Zedong]] as its [[President of the People's Republic of China|state chairman]].\n\nThe communist government in China was defined by the party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]]. These hard-line officers controlled the [[People's Liberation Army]], which itself controlled large amounts of the bureaucracy. This system was further controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which additionally supported the state chairman who was considered the head of the government. The People's Republic's foreign policies included the repressing of [[secession]] attempts in Mongolia and Tibet and supporting of [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]], respectively. Additionally, by 1960 China began to cut off its connections with the Soviet Union due to border disputes and an increasing Chinese sense of superiority, especially the personal feeling of Mao over the Russian premier, [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n\nToday China plays important roles in world economics and politics. China today is the world's second largest economy and the second fastest growing economy.\n==Korea==\n[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit 01.jpg|thumb|right|The third Inter-Korean Summit between South Korean president [[Moon Jae-in]] and North Korean supreme leader [[Kim Jong-un]]. It was a historical event that symbolized the peace of Asia.]]\nAfter [[Korean War]], Korea divided into North and South. In 1960, [[North Korea]] was far more wealthier than [[South Korea]]. But in 1970, South Korea begins to outrun the North Korean economy. In 2018, South Korea is ranked #10 in world [[GDP]] ranking.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Ancient Asian history]]\n* [[History of Southeast Asia]]\n* {{slink|List of history journals|Asia}}\n* [[Prehistoric Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Best, Antony.

The characteristic trade of silk through the [[Silk Road]] connected various regions from China, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East to Europe and Africa.]]\n\nThe '''history of Asia''' can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]].\n\nThe coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations and religions, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[China]] shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.\n\nThe steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of [[Siberia]] was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the [[tundra]]. These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.\n\nThe centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], [[Karakum Desert]], and [[Gobi Desert]] formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty.  While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force.  Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.\n\nThe [[spread of Islam]] waved the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and the [[Timurid Renaissance]], which later influenced the [[Islamic Gunpowders]].\n\nAsia's history features major developments seen in other parts of the world, as well as events that have affected those other regions. These include the trade of the [[Silk Road]], which spread cultures, languages, religions, and diseases throughout Afro-Eurasian trade. Another major advancement was the innovation of [[gunpowder]] in medieval China, later developed by the Gunpowder empires, mainly by the [[Mughal tribe|Mughal]]s and [[Safavid]]s, which led to advanced warfare through the use of guns.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistory of Asia}}\nA report by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari on Lahuradewa, [[India]] shows new C14 datings that range between 9000 and 8000 BCE associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site in entire South Asia.<ref name=\"archae\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|title=Second preliminary report of the excavations at Lahuradewa district\n|publisher=Directorate of Archaeology (U.P, India)\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040512/http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|archivedate=2011-06-13\n|df=\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] near Yixian in [[Hebei]] Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the [[Cishan culture|Cishan]] and [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] cultures of about 8000\u20137000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the [[Taihang Mountains]],  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures.

The [[Ubaid period|Ubaid]] culture flourished from 5500 BCE.\n\n==Ancient==\n===Bronze Age===\n{{Main|Ancient Near East}}\n[[File:Bronze-age-collapse.svg|thumb|270px|A map of the [[Bronze Age collapse]], c. 1200 BCE]]\nThe [[Chalcolithic]] period (or Copper Age) began about 4500 BCE, then the [[Bronze Age]] began about 3500 BCE, replacing the Neolithic cultures.\n\nThe [[Indus Valley Civilization]] (IVC) was a Bronze Age civilization (3300\u20131300 BCE; mature period 2600\u20131900 BCE) which was centered mostly in the western part of the Indian Subcontinent; it is considered that an early form of Hinduism was performed during this civilization. Some of the great cities of this civilization include [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], which had a high level of town planning and arts. The cause of the destruction of these regions around 1700 BCE is debatable, although evidence suggests it was caused by natural disasters (especially flooding).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indus Valley Civilisation|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|work=ThinkQuest|accessdate=9 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014129/http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=}}</ref> This era marks [[Vedic period]] in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BCE. During this period, the [[Sanskrit]] language developed and the [[Vedas]] were written, epic hymns that told tales of gods and wars. This was the basis for the Vedic religion, which would eventually sophisticate and develop into [[Hinduism]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=68}}\n\nChina and [[Vietnam]] were also centres of metalworking.

Persian politics included a tolerance for other cultures, a highly [[centralized government]], and significant infrastructure developments. Later, in [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]'s rule, the territories were integrated, a bureaucracy was developed, nobility were assigned military positions, tax collection was carefully organized, and spies were used to ensure the loyalty of regional officials. The primary religion of Persia at this time was [[Zoroastrianism]], developed by the philosopher [[Zoroaster]]. It introduced an early form of [[monotheism]] to the area. The religion banned animal sacrifice and the use of intoxicants in rituals; and introduced the concept of spiritual salvation through personal moral action, an [[end time]], and both [[General judgment|general]] and [[Particular judgment]] with a [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. These concepts would heavily influence later emperors and the masses. More importantly, Zoroastrianism would be an important precursor for the [[Abrahamic religions]] such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Persian Empire was successful in establishing peace and stability throughout the Middle East and were a major influence in art, politics (affecting Hellenistic leaders), and religion.\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] conquered this dynasty in the 4th century BCE, creating the brief [[Hellenistic period]]. He was unable to establish stability and after his death, Persia broke into small, weak dynasties including the [[Seleucid Empire]], followed by the [[Parthian Empire]]. By the end of the Classical age, Persia had been reconsolidated into the [[Sassanid Empire]], also known as the second Persian Empire.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] would later control parts of Western Asia. The [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.\n\n====India====\n{{See also|Greater India}}\n\nThe Maurya and Gupta empires are called the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture. The religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], which began in Indian sub-continent, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia.\n\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|270px|Expansion of [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]]]\nBy 600 BCE, India had been divided into 17 regional states that would occasionally feud amongst themselves. In 327 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] came to India with a vision of conquering the whole world. He crossed northwestern India and created the province [[Bactria]] but could not move further because his army wanted to go back to their family. Shortly prior, the soldier [[Chandragupta Maurya]] began to take control of the Ganges river and soon established the [[Maurya Empire]]. The Maurya Empire (Sanskrit: \u092e\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Maurya R\u0101javan\u015bha) was the geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE. It was one of the world's largest empires in its time, stretching to the [[Himalayas]] in the north, what is now [[Assam]] in the east, probably beyond modern [[Pakistan]] in the west, and annexing [[Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], at its greatest extent. South of Mauryan empire was the [[Tamilakam]] an independent country dominated by three dynasties, the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyans]], [[Cholas]] and [[Cheras]]. The government established by Chandragupta was led by an autocratic king, who primarily relied on the military to assert his power.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} It also applied the use of a bureaucracy and even sponsored a postal service.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} Chandragupta's grandson, [[Ashoka]], greatly extended the empire by conquering most of modern-day India (save for the southern tip). He eventually converted to Buddhism, though, and began a peaceful life where he promoted the religion as well as humane methods throughout India. The Maurya Empire would disintegrate soon after Ashoka's death and was conquered by the Kushan invaders from the northwest, establishing the [[Kushan Empire]]. Their conversion to Buddhism caused the religion to be associated with foreigners and therefore a decline in its popularity occurred.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}}\n\nThe Kushan Empire would fall apart by 220 CE, creating more political turmoil in India. Then in 320, the [[Gupta Empire]] (Sanskrit: \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Gupta R\u0101javan\u015bha) was established and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by [[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]], the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization. Gupta kings united the area primarily through negotiation of local leaders and families as well as strategical intermarriage.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} Their rule covered less land than the Maurya Empire, but established the greatest stability.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} In 535, the empire ended when India was overrun by the [[Hunas]].\n\n====Classical China====\n\n=====Zhou Dynasty=====\n{{main|Zhou dynasty}}\n[[File:Zhou dynasty 1000 BC.png|thumb|Population concentration and boundaries of the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty in China]]\nSince 1029 BCE, the [[Zhou dynasty]] ({{zh|c=\u5468\u671d|p=Zh\u014du Ch\u00e1o|w=Chou Ch'ao}} {{IPA-cmn|t\u0282\u00f3\u028a t\u0282\u02b0\u0251\u030c\u028a|}}), had existed in China and it would continue to until 258 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The Zhou dynasty had been using a [[Feudalism|feudal system]] by giving power to local nobility and relying on their loyalty in order to control its large territory.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} As a result, the Chinese government at this time tended to be very decentralized and weak, and there was often little the emperor could do to resolve national issues. Nonetheless, the government was able to retain its position with the creation of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which could establish an emperor as divinely chosen to rule. The Zhou additionally discouraged the [[human sacrifice]] of the preceding eras and unified the [[Chinese language]]. Finally, the Zhou government encouraged settlers to move into the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] valley, thus creating the Chinese Middle Kingdom.\n\nBut by 500 BCE, its political stability began to decline due to repeated nomadic incursions{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} and internal conflict derived from the fighting princes and families. This was lessened by the many philosophical movements, starting with the life of [[Confucius]]. His philosophical writings (called [[Confucianism]]) concerning the respect of elders and of the state would later be popularly used in the Han dynasty. Additionally, [[Laozi]]'s concepts of [[Taoism]], including [[yin and yang]] and the innate duality and balance of nature and the universe, became popular throughout this period. Nevertheless, the Zhou Dynasty eventually disintegrated as the local nobles began to gain more power and their conflict devolved into the [[Warring States period]], from 402 to 201 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=44}}\n\n=====Qin Dynasty=====\n{{main|Qin Dynasty}}\nOne leader eventually came on top, [[Qin Shi Huang]] ({{zh|c=\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d}}, ''Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec''), who overthrew the last Zhou emperor and established the Qin dynasty.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The [[Qin dynasty]] (Chinese: \u79e6\u671d; pinyin: Q\u00edn Ch\u00e1o) was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 207 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=42}} The new Emperor abolished the feudal system and directly appointed a bureaucracy that would rely on him for power. Huang's imperial forces crushed any regional resistance, and they furthered the Chinese empire by expanding down to the [[South China Sea]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. Greater organization brought a uniform tax system, a national census, regulated road building (and cart width), standard measurements, standard coinage, and an official written and spoken language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} Further reforms included new irrigation projects, the encouragement of [[silk]] manufacturing,{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} and (most famously) the beginning of the construction of the Great Wall of China\u2014designed to keep out the nomadic raiders who'd constantly badger the Chinese people. However, Shi Huang was infamous for his tyranny, forcing laborers to build the Wall, ordering heavy taxes, and severely punishing all who opposed him. He oppressed Confucians and promoted [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], the idea that people were inherently evil, and that a strong, forceful government was needed to control them. Legalism was infused with realistic, logical views and rejected the pleasures of educated conversation as frivolous. All of this made Shi Huang extremely unpopular with the people. As the Qin began to weaken, various factions began to fight for control of China.\n\n=====Han Dynasty=====\n{{main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Silk Road]] in Asia]]\nThe [[Han dynasty]] (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u671d; pinyin: H\u00e0n Ch\u00e1o; 206 BCE \u2013 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220\u2013265 CE). Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history. One of the Han dynasty's greatest emperors, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], established a peace throughout China comparable to the [[Pax Romana]] seen in the Mediterranean a hundred years later.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\". The Han Dynasty was established when two peasants succeeded in rising up against Shi Huang's significantly weaker successor-son. The new Han government retained the centralization and bureaucracy of the Qin, but greatly reduced the repression seen before. They expanded their territory into [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Central Asia]], creating an even larger empire than the Qin.\n\nThe Han developed contacts with the Persian Empire in the Middle East and the Romans, through the [[Silk Road]], with which they were able to trade many commodities\u2014primarily silk. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the [[Silk Road]], which connected China, [[India]], the Middle East and Europe. Han emperors like Wu also promoted Confucianism as the national \"religion\" (although it is debated by theologians as to whether it is defined as such or as a philosophy). Shrines devoted to Confucius were built and Confucian philosophy was taught to all scholars who entered the Chinese bureaucracy. The bureaucracy was further improved with the introduction of an examination system that selected scholars of high merit. These bureaucrats were often upper-class people educated in special schools, but whose power was often checked by the lower-class brought into the bureaucracy through their skill. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was very effective and highly respected by all in the realm and would last over 2,000 years. The Han government was highly organized and it commanded the military, judicial law (which used a system of courts and strict laws), agricultural production, the economy, and the general lives of its people. The government also promoted intellectual philosophy, scientific research, and detailed historical records.\n\nHowever, despite all of this impressive stability, central power began to lose control by the turn of the [[Common Era]]. As the Han Dynasty declined, many factors continued to pummel it into submission until China was left in a state of chaos. By 100 CE, philosophical activity slowed, and corruption ran rampant in the bureaucracy. Local landlords began to take control as the scholars neglected their duties, and this resulted in heavy taxation of the peasantry. Taoists began to gain significant ground and protested the decline. They started to proclaim magical powers and promised to save China with them; the Taoist [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 (led by rebels in yellow scarves) failed but was able to weaken the government. The aforementioned Huns combined with diseases killed up to half of the population and officially ended the Han dynasty by 220. The ensuing period of chaos was so terrible it lasted for three centuries, where many weak regional rulers and dynasties failed to establish order in China. This period of chaos and attempts at order is commonly known as that of the [[Six Dynasties]]. The first part of this included the [[Three Kingdoms]] which started in 220 and describes the brief and weak successor \"dynasties\" that followed the Han. In 265, the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] of China was started and this soon split into two different empires in control of northwestern and southeastern China. In 420, the conquest and abdication of those two dynasties resulted in the first of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Northern and Southern Dynasties passed through until finally, by 557, the [[Northern Zhou|Northern Zhou dynasty]] ruled the north and the [[Chen dynasty]] ruled the south.\n\n==Medieval{{anchor|Medieval}}==\nDuring this period, the [[Eastern world]] empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.\n\n===Western Asia (Middle East)===\n{{main|Medieval Middle East}}\n[[File:Byzantine and Sassanid Empires in 600 CE.png|thumb|right|310px|Byzantine and Sassanian Empires in 600 AD]]\nThe Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Medieval era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the Arabian Empires.\n\nIn the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sassanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sassanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.\n\nWhile the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the [[Seljuq Empire]].\n\n[[File:Caliphate 750.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[early Muslim conquests]], 622\u2013750]]\nAfter Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.\n\nThe dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] and advancing as far south as the border of [[Egypt]] in what became known as the [[Mongol conquests]]. The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].\n\n===Central Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Central Asia}}\n\n====Mongol Empire====\n[[Image:Mongolia 1500 AD.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] residual states and domains by the 15th century]]\nThe [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as [[Genghis Khan]]. He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.\n\n===South Asia/Indian Subcontinent===\n====India====\n{{main|Medieval India}}\n[[File:Delhi Sultanate map.png|thumb|right|320px|The [[Delhi Sultanate]].]]\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]]. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyas]] and the [[Cholas]] from still farther south. The Cholas could under the rule of [[Raja Raja Chola]] defeat their rivals and rise to a regional power. Cholas expanded northward and defeated [[Eastern Chalukya]], [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Kalinga]] and the [[Pala Empire|Pala]]. Under [[Rajendra Chola]] the Cholas created the first notable navy of Indian subcontinent. The [[Chola navy]] extended the influence of Chola empire to [[southeast asia]]. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.<ref>{{citation|last=Stein|first=B.|author-link=Burton Stein|date=1998|title=A History of India|edition=1st|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-20546-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXdVS0SzQSAC|pages=119\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests include the limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Umayyad campaigns in India, during the time of the Rajput kingdoms in the 8th century.\n\nMajor economic and military powers like the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], were seen to be established. The search of their wealth led the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]].\n\n===East Asia===\n{{main|History of East Asia}}\n\n====China====\n{{main|Medieval China}}\nChina saw the rise and fall of the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties and therefore improvements in its bureaucracy, the spread of [[Buddhism]], and the advent of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. It was an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.\n\n=====Sui Dynasty=====\n{{main|Sui dynasty}}\nA new powerful dynasty began to rise in the 580s, amongst the divided factions of China. This was started when an aristocrat named Yang Jian married his daughter into the Northern Zhou dynasty. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] and appeased the nomadic military by abandoning the Confucian scholar-gentry. Emperor Wen soon led the conquest of the southern Chen Dynasty and united China once more under the [[Sui dynasty]]. The emperor lowered taxes and constructed granaries that he used to prevent famine and control the market. Later Wen's son would murder him for the throne and declare himself [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]. Emperor Yang revived the Confucian scholars and the bureaucracy, much to anger of the aristocrats and nomadic military leaders. Yang became an excessive leader who overused China's resources for personal luxury and perpetuated exhaustive attempts to conquer Goguryeo. His military failures and neglect of the empire forced his own ministers to assassinate him in 618, ending the Sui Dynasty.\n\n=====Tang dynasty=====\n{{main|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:Battle of Talas.png|thumb|380px|[[Battle of Talas]] between Tang dynasty and [[Abbasid Caliphate]] c. 751]]\n\nFortunately, one of Yang's most respectable advisors, Li Yuan, was able to claim the throne quickly, preventing a chaotic collapse. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]], and established the [[Tang dynasty]] in 623. The Tang saw expansion of China through conquest to Tibet in the west, [[Vietnam]] in the south, and Manchuria in the north. Tang emperors also improved the education of scholars in the Chinese bureaucracy. A Ministry of Rites was established and the examination system was improved to better qualify scholars for their jobs.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=270|loc=Chapter 12|quote=In the Tang and Song periods, the examination system was greatly expanded, and the pattern of advancement in the civil service was much more regularized. This meant that in the political realm more than any previous political system (and those yet to come for centuries), the Chinese connected merit as measured by tested skills with authority and status.}} In addition, Buddhism became popular in China with two different strains between the peasantry and the elite, the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and [[Zen]] strains, respectively.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|pages=271\u2013272|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Among the masses, the salvationist pure land strain of Mahayana Buddhism won widespread conversions because it seemed to provide a refuge from an age of war and turmoil. Members of the elite class, on the other hand, were more attracted to the Chan variant of Buddhism, or Zen as it is known in Japan and the West.}} Greatly supporting the spread of Buddhism was [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], who additionally claimed an unofficial \"Zhou dynasty\" and displayed China's tolerance of a woman ruler, which was rare at the time. However, Buddhism would also experience some backlash, especially from Confucianists and Taoists. This would usually involve criticism about how it was costing the state money, since the government was unable to tax Buddhist monasteries, and additionally sent many grants and gifts to them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=273|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Because monastic lands and resources were not taxed, the Tang regime lost huge amounts of revenue as a result of imperial grants or the gifts of wealthy families to Buddhist monasteries.}}\n\nThe Tang dynasty began to decline under the rule of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who began to neglect the economy and military and caused unrest amongst the court officials due to the excessive influence of his concubine, [[Yang Guifei]], and her family.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The arrogance and excessive ambition of Yang Guifei and her family angered members of the rival cliques at court, who took every opportunity to turn Yang's excesses into a cause for popular unreast.}} This eventually sparked a revolt in 755.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The deepening crisis came to a head in 755 when one of [Xuanzong]'s main military leaders&nbsp;... led a widely supported revolt with the aim of founding a new dynasty to supplant the Tang.}} Although the revolt failed, subduing it required involvement with the unruly nomadic tribes outside of China and distributing more power to local leaders\u2014leaving the government and economy in a degraded state. The Tang dynasty officially ended in 907 and various factions led by the aforementioned nomadic tribes and local leaders would fight for control of China in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].\n\n=====Liao, Song and Jin dynasties=====\n{{main|Liao dynasty|Song dynasty|Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)}}\nBy 960, most of China proper had been reunited under the [[Song dynasty]], although it lost territories in the north and could not defeat one of the nomadic tribes there\u2014the [[Liao dynasty]] of the highly sinicized [[Khitan people]]. From then on, the Song would have to pay tribute to avoid invasion and thus set the precedent for other nomadic kingdoms to oppress them. The Song also saw the revival of Confucianism in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This had the effect of putting the Confucian scholars at a higher status than aristocrats or Buddhists and also intensified the reduction of power in women. The infamous practice of [[foot binding]] developed in this period as a result. Eventually the Liao dynasty in the north was overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] of the Manchu-related [[Jurchen people]]. The new Jin kingdom [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|invaded northern China]], leaving the Song to flee farther south and creating the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1126. There, cultural life flourished.\n\n=====Yuan Dynasty=====\n{{main|Yuan dynasty}}\n [[File:Route of Marco Polo.png|thumb|380px|Map of Marco Polo's travels]]\nBy 1227, the Mongols had conquered the [[Western Xia]] kingdom northwest of China. Soon the Mongols incurred upon the Jin empire of the Jurchens. Chinese cities were soon besieged by the Mongol hordes that showed little mercy for those who resisted and the Southern Song Chinese were quickly losing territory. In 1271 the current great khan, [[Kublai Khan]], claimed himself Emperor of China and officially established the Yuan Dynasty. By 1290, all of China was under control of the Mongols, marking the first time they were ever completely conquered by a foreign invader; the new capital was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (modern-day [[Beijing]]). Kublai Khan segregated Mongol culture from Chinese culture by discouraging interactions between the two peoples, separating living spaces and places of worship, and reserving top administrative positions to Mongols, thus preventing Confucian scholars to continue the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, Kublai remained fascinated with Chinese thinking, surrounding himself with Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian advisors.\n\nMongol women displayed a contrasting independent nature compared to the Chinese women who continued to be suppressed. Mongol women often rode out on hunts or even to war. Kublai's wife, [[Chabi]], was a perfect example of this; Chabi advised her husband on several political and diplomatic matters; she convinced him that the Chinese were to be respected and well-treated in order to make them easier to rule.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=327|loc=Chapter 14|quote=[Chabi] convinced Kubilai that the harsh treatment of the survivors of the defeated Song imperial family would only anger the peoples of north China and make them more difficult to rule.}} However this was not enough to affect Chinese women's position, and the increasingly Neo-Confucian successors of Kublai further repressed Chinese and even Mongol women.\n\nThe Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe, had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331.\n\n====Korea====\n{{main|Medieval Korea}}\n\n====[[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]====\n[[File:History of Korea-476.PNG|thumb|left|Korean peninsula in 476 AD. There are three kingdoms and Gaya Union in the picture. This picture shows the heyday of [[Goguryeo]]]]\nThe three Kingdoms of Korea involves [[Goguryeo]] in north, [[Baekje]] in southwest, and [[Silla]] in southeast Korean peninsula. These three kingdoms were like a bridge of cultures between China and Japan. Thanks to them, Japan was able to accept Chinese splendid cultures. [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of Japan had been taught by two teachers. One was from [[Baekje]], the other was from [[Goguryeo]]. Once Japan invaded [[Silla]], Goguryeo helped Silla to defeat Japan. [[Baekje]] met the earliest heyday of them. Its heyday was the 5th century AD. Its capital was [[Seoul]]. During its heyday, the kingdom made colonies overseas. Liaodong, China and Kyushu, Japan were the colonies of [[Baekje]] during its short heyday. [[Goguryeo]] was the strongest kingdom of all. They sometimes called themselves  as an Empire. Its heyday was 6th century. King Gwanggaeto widened its territory  to north. So Goguryeo dominated from Korean peninsula to Manchuria. And his son, [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|King Jangsu]] widened its territory to south. He occupied [[Seoul]], and moved its capital to [[Pyeongyang]]. Goguryeo almost occupied three quarters of South Korean peninsula thanks to king Jangsu who widened the kingdom's territory to south. [[Silla]] met the latest heyday. King Jinheung went north and occupied[[Seoul]]. But it was short. [[Baekje]] became stronger and attacked Silla. Baekje occupied more than 40 cities of Silla. So Silla could hardly survive.\nChina's Sui dynasty invaded [[Goguryeo]] and [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War]] occurs between Korea and China. [[Goguryeo]] won against China and [[Sui dynasty]] fell. After then, [[Tang dynasty]] reinvaded [[Goguryeo]] and helped [[Silla]] to unify the peninsula. Because Silla was the weakest of all, so it asked Tang for help. [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and Japan helped each other against Tang-Silla alliance, but [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] fell. Unfortunately, [[Tang dynasty]] betrayed [[Silla]] in order to occupy the whole Korean peninsula. During the [[Silla-Tang war]], people of fallen Baekje and Goguryeo helped Silla against Chinese invasion, so Silla could beat China and unified the peninsula. This war helped Korean people to unite mentally.\n=====North-South States Period=====\n[[File:History of Korea-Inter-country Age-830 CE.gif|thumb|left|[[Balhae]] in the north, [[Later Silla]] in the south]]\n[[File:Korea - Seoul - National Museum - Incense Burner 0252-06a.jpg|thumb|right|the [[Goryeo ware]], which shows splendid culture of [[Goryeo]] in mediaeval Korea.]]\n\nThe rest of [[Goguryeo]] people established [[Balhae]] and won the war against Tang in later 7th century AD. [[Balhae]] is the north state, and [[Later Silla]] was the south state. Balhae was a quite strong kingdom as their ancestor Goguryeo did. Finally, the Emperor of Tang dynasty admits Balhae as 'A strong country in the East'. They liked to trade with Japan, China, and Silla. Balhae and Later Silla sent a lot of international students to China. And Arabian merchants came into Korean peninsula, so Korea became known as 'Silla' in the western countries. Silla improved Korean writing system called Idu letters. Idu affected [[Katakana]] of Japan. [[Liao dynasty]] invaded [[Balhae]] in early 10th century, so [[Balhae]] fell.\n\n=====Later Three Kingdoms of Korea=====\nThe unified Korean kingdom, Later Silla divided into three kingdoms again because of the corrupt central government. It involves [[Later Goguryeo]](also as known as \"Taebong\"), [[Later Baekje]], and Later Silla. The general of [[Later Goguryeo]], Wang Geon took the thrown and  changed its name into [[Goryeo]], which was derived by the old strong kingdom, Goguryeo, and Goryeo reunified the peninsula.\n\n=====Goryeo(918~1392)=====\n{{main|Goryeo}}\n[[File:Goryo Taejo Wangkun 2.jpg|thumb|left|The first King of [[Goryeo]], as known as [[Taejo of Goryeo]](918~943)]]\n[[Goryeo]] reunited the Korean peninsula during the later three kingdoms period and named itself as 'Empire'. But nowadays, Goryeo is known as a kingdom. The name 'Goryeo' was derived from [[Goguryeo]], and the name [[Korea]] was derived from Goryeo. Goryeo adopted people from fallen [[Balhae]]. They also widened their territory to north by defending Liao dynasty and attacking the [[Jurchen people]]. Goryeo developed a splendid culture. The first metal type printed book [[Jikji]] was also from Korea. The [[Goryeo ware]] is one of the most famous legacies of this kingdom. Goryeo imported Chinese government system and developed into their own ways.\n\nDuring this period, laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced. Buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula. The [[Tripitaka Koreana]] is 81,258 books total. It was made to keep Korea safe against the Mongolian invasion. It is now a UNESCO world heritage. Goryeo won the battle against [[Liao dynasty]]. Then, the [[Mongolian Empire]] invaded Goryeo. Goryeo did not disappear but it had to obey Mongolians. After 80 years, in 14th century, the Mongolian dynasty Yuan lose power, King Gongmin tried to free themselves against Mongol although his wife was also Mongolian. At the 14th century, [[Ming dynasty]] want Goryeo to obey China. But Goryeo didn't. They decided to invade China. Going to China, the general of Goryeo, Lee Sung-Gae came back and destroyed Goryeo and established new dynasty, [[Joseon]]. And he became [[Taejo of Joseon]], which means the first king of [[Joseon]].\n\n\n====Japan====\n{{main|Medieval Japan}}\n[[File:Shotoku Taishi.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]]]]\n\n=====Asuka period=====\nJapan's medieval history began with the [[Asuka period]], from around 600 to 710. The time was characterized by the [[Taika Reform]] and imperial centralization, both of which were a direct result of growing Chinese contact and influences. In 603, [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Yamato dynasty]] began significant political and cultural changes. He issued the [[Seventeen-article constitution]] in 604, centralizing power towards the emperor (under the title ''tenno'', or heavenly sovereign) and removing the power to levy taxes from provincial lords. Sh\u014dtoku was also a patron of Buddhism and he encouraged building temples competitively.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}}\n\n=====Nara period=====\nSh\u014dtoku's reforms transitioned Japan to the [[Nara period]] (c. 710 to c. 794), with the moving of the Japanese capital to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in [[Honshu]]. This period saw the culmination of Chinese-style writing, etiquette, and architecture in Japan along with Confucian ideals{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} to supplement the already present Buddhism. Peasants revered both Confucian scholars and Buddhist monks. However, in the wake of the [[735\u2013737 Japanese smallpox epidemic]], Buddhism gained the status of state religion and the government ordered the construction of numerous Buddhist temples, monasteries, and statues.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} The lavish spending combined with the fact that many aristocrats did not pay taxes, put a heavy burden on peasantry that caused poverty and famine.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} Eventually the Buddhist position got out of control, threatening to seize imperial power and causing [[Emperor Kanmu]] to move the capital to [[Heian-ky\u014d]] to avoid a Buddhist takeover.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] and the end of Taika reform.\n\n=====Heian period=====\nWith the Heian period (from 794 to 1185) came a decline of imperial power. Chinese influence also declined, as a result of its correlation with imperial centralization and the [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]], which came to be regarded as ineffective. By 838, the Japanese court discontinued its embassies in China; only traders and Buddhist monks continued to travel to China. Buddhism itself came to be considered more Japanese than Chinese, and persisted to be popular in Japan. Buddhists monks and monasteries continued their attempts to gather personal power in courts, along with aristocrats. One particular noble family that dominated influence in the imperial bureaucracy was the [[Fujiwara clan]]. During this time cultural life in the imperial court flourished. There was a focus on beauty and social interaction and writing and literature was considered refined. Noblewomen were cultured the same as noblemen, dabbling in creative works and politics. A prime example of both Japanese literature and women's role in high-class culture at this time was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written by the [[lady-in-waiting]] [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Popularization of wooden palaces and [[sh\u014dji]] sliding doors amongst the nobility also occurred.\n\nLoss of imperial power also led to the rise of provincial warrior elites. Small lords began to function independently. They administered laws, supervised public works projects, and collected revenue for themselves instead of the imperial court. Regional lords also began to build their own armies. These warriors were loyal only their local lords and not the emperor, although the imperial government increasingly called them in to protect the capital. The regional warrior class developed into the [[samurai]], which created its own culture: including specialized weapons such as the [[katana]] and a form of chivalry, [[bushido]]. The imperial government's loss of control in the second half of the Heian period allowed banditry to grow, requiring both feudal lords and Buddhist monasteries to procure warriors for protection. As imperial control over Japan declined, feudal lords also became more independent and seceded from the empire. These feudal states squandered the peasants living in them, reducing the farmers to an almost [[serfdom]] status. Peasants were also rigidly restricted from rising to the samurai class, being physically set off by dress and weapon restrictions. As a result of their oppression, many peasants turned to Buddhism as a hope for reward in the afterlife for upright behavior.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=296}}\n\nWith the increase of feudalism, families in the imperial court began to depend on alliances with regional lords. The Fujiwara clan declined from power, replaced by a rivalry between the [[Taira clan]] and the [[Minamoto clan]]. This rivalry grew into the [[Genpei War]] in the early 1180s. This war saw the use of both samurai and peasant soldiers. For the samurai, battle was ritual and they often easily cut down the poorly trained peasantry. The Minamoto clan proved successful due to their rural alliances. Once the Taira was destroyed, the Minamoto established a military government called the [[shogunate]] (or bakufu), centered in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].\n\n=====Kamakura period=====\nThe end of the Genpei War and the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the [[Kamakura period]] in 1185, solidifying feudal Japan.\n\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Southeast Asia}}\n\n==Early modern==\n{{further|Early modern period}}\n[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|A 1796 map of Asia (or the \"[[Eastern world]]\"), which also included the continent of [[Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]) within its realm.]]\nThe [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of [[Siberia]] and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India and initiated the second golden age for India. China was the largest economy in the world for much of the time, followed by India until the 18th century.\n\n===Ming China===\n\nBy 1368, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] had claimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor]] and established the Ming dynasty of China. Immediately, the new emperor and his followers drove the Mongols and their culture out of China and beyond the Great Wall.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Immediately after he seized the throne, Zhu launched an effort to rid China of all traces of the \"barbarian\" Mongols. Mongol dress was discarded, Mongol names were dropped by those who had adopted them and were removed from buildings and court records, and Mongol palaces and administrative buildings in some areas were raided and sacked. The nomads themselves fled or were driven beyond the Great Wall, where military expeditions pursued them on several occasions.}} The new emperor was somewhat suspicious of the scholars that dominated China's bureaucracy, for he had been born a peasant and was uneducated.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Because the Hongwu emperor, like the founder of the earlier Han dynasty, was from a peasant family and thus poorly educated, he viewed the scholar-gentry with some suspicion.}} Nevertheless, Confucian scholars were necessary to China's bureaucracy and were reestablished as well as reforms that would improve the exam systems and make them more important in entering the bureaucracy than ever before. The exams became more rigorous, cut down harshly on cheating, and those who excelled were more highly appraised. Finally, Hongwu also directed more power towards the role of emperor so as to end the corrupt influences of the bureaucrats.\n\n====Society and economy====\nThe Hongwu emperor, perhaps for his sympathy of the common-folk, had built many irrigation systems and other public projects that provided help for the peasant farmers.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Perhaps because his lowly origins and personal suffering made him sensitive to the plight of the peasantry, Hongwu introduced measures that would improve the lot of the common people. Like most strong emperors, he promoted public works projects, including dike building and the extension of irrigation systems aimed at improving the farmers' yields.}} They were also allowed to cultivate and claim unoccupied land without having to pay any taxes and labor demands were lowered.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=... Hongwu decreed that unoccupied lands would become the tax-exempt property of those who cleared and cultivated them. He lowered forced labor demands on the peasantry by both the government and members of the gentry class.}} However, none of this was able to stop the rising landlord class that gained many privileges from the government and slowly gained control of the peasantry. Moneylenders foreclosed on peasant debt in exchange for mortgages and bought up farmer land, forcing them to become the landlords' tenants or to wander elsewhere for work.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=505|loc=Chapter 22}} Also during this time, [[Neo-Confucianism]] intensified even more than the previous two dynasties (the Song and Yuan). Focus on the superiority of elders over youth, men over women, and teachers over students resulted in minor discrimination of the \"inferior\" classes. The fine arts grew in the Ming era, with improved techniques in brush painting that depicted scenes of court, city or country life; people such as scholars or travelers; or the beauty of mountains, lakes, or marshes. The Chinese novel fully developed in this era, with such classics written such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]''.\n\nEconomics grew rapidly in the Ming Dynasty as well. The introduction of American crops such as [[maize]], [[sweet potatoes]], and [[peanut]]s allowed for cultivation of crops in infertile land and helped prevent famine. The population boom that began in the Song dynasty accelerated until China's population went from 80 or 90 million to 150 million in three centuries, culminating in 1600.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By 1600 the population of China had risen to as many as 150 million from 80 to 90 million in the 14th century.}} This paralleled the market economy that was growing both internally and externally. Silk, tea, ceramics, and lacquer-ware were produced by artisans that traded them in Asia and to Europeans. Westerners began to trade (with some Chinese-assigned limits), primarily in the port-towns of [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Although merchants benefited greatly from this, land remained the primary symbol of wealth in China and traders' riches were often put into acquiring more land.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Much of the merchants' wealth was invested in land rather than plowed back into trade or manufacturing, because land owning, not commerce, remained the surest route to social status in China.}} Therefore, little of these riches were used in private enterprises that could've allowed for China to develop the [[market economy]] that often accompanied the highly-successful Western countries.\n\n====Foreign interests====\n[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the [[Fort St George]] in 18th-century [[Madras]].]]\nIn the interest of national glory, the Chinese began sending impressive [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships across the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. From 1403 to 1433, the [[Yongle Emperor]] commissioned [[Treasure voyages|expeditions]] led by the admiral [[Zheng He]], a Muslim [[eunuch]] from China. Chinese junks carrying hundreds of soldiers, goods, and animals for zoos, traveled to Southeast Asia, Persia, southern Arabia, and east Africa to show off Chinese power. Their prowess exceeded that of current Europeans at the time, and had these expeditions not ended, the world economy may be different from today.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=339|loc=Chapter 15|quote=There is no question that the course of world history might have been changed dramatically had the Chinese thrust continued, for the tiny European expeditions that began to creep down the western coast of Africa at about the same time would have been no match for this combination of merchant and military organization.}} In 1433, the Chinese government decided that the cost of a navy was an unnecessary expense. The Chinese navy was slowly dismantled and focus on interior reform and military defense began. It was China's longstanding priority that they protect themselves from nomads and they have accordingly returned to it. The growing limits on the Chinese navy would leave them vulnerable to foreign invasion by sea later on.\n\n[[File:Schall-von-bell.jpg|thumb|Here a Jesuit, Adam Schall von Bell (1592\u20131666), is dressed as an official of the Chinese Department of Astronomy.]]\n\nAs was inevitable, Westerners arrived on the Chinese east coast, primarily [[Jesuit]] missionaries which reached the mainland in 1582. They attempted to [[Jesuit China missions|convert the Chinese people to Christianity]] by first converting the top of the social hierarchy and allowing the lower classes to subsequently convert. To further gain support, many Jesuits adopted Chinese dress, customs, and language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=The Jesuits believed that the best way to convert a great civilization such as China was to adopt the dress, customs, language and manners of its elite.}} Some Chinese scholars were interested in certain Western teachings and especially in Western technology. By the 1580s, Jesuit scholars like [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Adam Schall]] amazed the Chinese elite with technological advances such as European clocks, improved calendars and cannons, and the accurate prediction of eclipses.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Beginning in the 1580s, a succession of brilliant Jesuit scholars ... spent most of their time in the imperial city, correcting faulty calendars, forging cannons, fixing clocks imported from Europe, and astounding the Chinese scholar-gentry with the accuracy of their instruments and their ability to predict eclipses.}} Although some the scholar-gentry converted, many were suspicious of the Westerners whom they called \"barbarians\" and even resented them for the embarrassment they received at the hand of Western correction. Nevertheless, a small group of Jesuit scholars remained at the court to impress the emperor and his advisors.\n\n====Decline====\n[[Image:Batavia, C. de Jonghe (1740).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch Batavia in the 17th century, built in what is now [[North Jakarta]]]]\n\nNear the end of the 1500s, the extremely centralized government that gave so much power to the emperor had begun to fail as more incompetent rulers took the mantle. Along with these weak rulers came increasingly corrupt officials who took advantage of the decline. Once more the public projects fell into disrepair due to neglect by the bureaucracy and resulted in floods, drought, and famine that rocked the peasantry. The famine soon became so terrible that some peasants resorted to selling their children to slavery to save them from starvation, or to eating bark, the feces of geese, or [[Cannibalism|other people]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=509|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Peasants in afflicted districts were reduced to eating the bark from trees or the excrement of wild geese. Some peasants sold their children into slavery to keep them from starving, and peasants in some areas resorted to cannibalism.}} Many landlords abused the situation by building large estates where desperate farmers would work and be exploited. In turn, many of these farmers resorted to flight, banditry, and open rebellion.\n\nAll of this corresponded with the usual dynastic decline of China seen before, as well as the growing foreign threats. In the mid-16th century, Japanese and ethnic Chinese pirates began to raid the southern coast, and neither the bureaucracy nor the military were able to stop them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=One of the early signs of the seriousness of imperial deterioration was the inability of Chinese bureaucrats and military forces to put an end to the epidemic of Japanese (and ethnic Chinese) pirate attacks that ravaged the southern coast in the mid-16th century.}} The threat of the northern [[Manchu people]] also grew. The Manchu were an already large state north of China, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [[Nurhaci]] suddenly united them under the [[Eight Banners]]\u2014armies that the opposing families were organized into. The Manchus adopted many Chinese customs, specifically taking after their bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Manchus still remained a Chinese [[vassal]]. In 1644 Chinese administration became so weak, the 16th and last emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], did not respond to the severity of an ensuing rebellion by local dissenters until the enemy had invaded the [[Forbidden City]] (his personal estate). He soon hanged himself in the imperial gardens.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By [1644], the administrative apparatus had become so feeble that the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, did not realize how serious the rebel advance was until enemy soldiers were scaling the walls of the forbidden city. ... the ill-fated Chongzhen retreated to the imperial gardens and hanged himself rather than face capture.}} For a brief amount of time, the [[Shun dynasty]] was claimed, until a loyalist Ming official called support from the Manchus to put down the new dynasty. The Shun Dynasty ended within a year and the Manchu were now within the Great Wall. Taking advantage of the situation, the Manchus marched on the Chinese capital of Beijing. [[Manchu conquest of China|Within two decades]] all of China belonged to the Manchu and the [[Qing dynasty]] was established.\n===Korea: Joseon dynasty(1392~1897)===\n{{Main|Joseon}}\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-Gyeonghoeru-02.jpg|thumb|left|Gyeonghoeru of [[Gyeongbokgung]], the [[Joseon]] dynasty's royal palace.]]\nIn early-modern Korea, the 500-year-old kingdom, [[Goryeo]] fell and new dynasty [[Joseon]] rose in August 5th, 1392. [[Taejo of Joseon]] changed the country's name from [[Goryeo]] to [[Joseon]]. The fourth king, [[Sejong the Great]] created [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabets by himself in 1443. He also improved science technology as Koreans invent Sun Clocks, Water Clocks, Rain-Measuring system, Star Map, Korean map, and detail records of Korean small villages. He even widened the territory to the north. So nowadays' Korean territory formed at that age. He even attacked Japanese pirates in Tsushima Island, who had been attacking Korea a lot. So he is considered the best king ever in history of Korea. The ninth king, [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] accomplished the first complete Korean [[Gyeongguk daejeon|law code]] in 1485. So the culture and people's lives were improved again. \n\nIn 1592, Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] invaded Korea. That war is [[Imjin war]]. At that war, Joseon was in a long peace like PAX ROMANA. So Joseon was not ready for the war. Joseon lose again and again. Japanese army conquered [[Seoul]]. The whole [[Korean peninsula]] was in danger. But [[Yi Sun-sin]], the most renowned general of Korea defeated Japanese fleet in southern Korea coast even 13 ships VS 133 ships. This is the legendary battle called \"[[Battle of Myeongnyang]]\". After then, [[Ming dynasty]] helped Joseon and Japan lose the battle. So Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi fell, the [[Edo period]] begins. Korea hurt a lot at [[Imjin war]]. Not long after, Manchurian people invaded Joseon again. It is called [[Qing invasion of Joseon]]. First invasion was for sake. Because Qing was at war between Ming, so Ming's alliance Joseon was threatening. And the second invasion was for Joseon to obey Qing. After then, Qing defeated Ming and took the whole Chinese territories. Joseon also had to obey Qing because Joseon lose the second war against Qing.\n\nAfter Qing invasion, the princes of Joseon dynasty lived their childhood in China. The son of king Injo met [[Adam Schall]] in Beijing. So he wanted to introduce western technologies to Korean people when he becomes a king. Unfortunately, he died before he takes the thrown. After then, the alternative prince became the 17th king of Joseon dynasty, Hyojong, trying to revenge for his kingdom and fallen Ming dynasty to Qing. Later kings such as Yeongjo and Jeongjo tried to improve their people's lives and stop the governors' unreasonable competition. From 17th century to 18th century, Joseon sent diplomats and artists to Japan more than 10 times. This group was called 'Tongshinsa'. They were sent to Japan to teach Japan about advanced Korean cultures. Japanese people liked to receive poems from Korean nobles. At that time, Korea was more powerful than Japan. But that relationship between Joseon and Japan was reversed after 19th century. Because Japan became more powerful than Korea and China, either. So Joseon sent diplomats called 'Sooshinsa' to learn Japanese advanced technologies. After king Jeongjo's death, some noble families controlled the whole kingdom in early 19th century. At the end of that period, Western people invaded Joseon. In 1876, Joseon was set free from Qing so they did not have to obey Qing. But Japanese Empire was happy because Joseon became a perfect independent kingdom. So Japan could intervene the kingdom more. After this, Joseon traded with the US and sent 'Sooshinsa' to Japan, 'Youngshinsa' to Qing, and 'Bobingsa' to the US and Europe. These groups took many modern things to Korean peninsula.\n===Japan: Tokugawa or Edo period (1603\u20131867)===\n{{Main|Edo period}}\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', c. 1830 by [[Hokusai]], an example of art flourishing in the Edo Period]]\nIn early-modern  Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of \"warring states\", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603.\n\nSociety in the Japanese \"[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]\" (see [[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of [[samurai]], with the farmers, artisans, and merchants ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy. Literacy rose in the two centuries of isolation.<ref>Geoffrey Barraclough and Norman Stone, ''Harper Collins Atlas of World History'' (2003) p 175.</ref>\n\nIn some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014ds'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014ds'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against [[Shah Ahmad Durrani]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.\n\n=== British and Dutch colonization ===\n{{Main|Dutch East India Company|East India Company}}\nThe European economic and naval powers pushed into Asia, first to do trading, and then to take over major colonies. The Dutch led the way followed by the British. Portugal had arrived first, but was too weak to maintain its small holdings and was largely pushed out, retaining only [[Goa]] and [[Macau]]. The British set up a private organization, the [[East India Company]], which handled both trade and Imperial control of much of India.<ref>Holden Furber, ''Rival Empires of Trade in the Orient, 1600\u20131800'' (U of Minnesota Press,  1976). </ref>\n\nThe [[Company rule in India|commercial colonization of India]] commenced in 1757, after the [[Battle of Plassey]], when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=76}}</ref> in 1765, when the Company was granted the ''diwani'', or the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}</ref> or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in [[Calcutta]], appointed its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Warren Hastings]], and became directly involved in governance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=56}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Clive and Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, 1757 by Francis Hayman.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] and [[Mir Jafar]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]], 1757 by Francis Hayman]]\n\nThe [[Maratha Empire|Maratha states]], following the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], eventually lost to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818 with the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]].

However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.\n\nThe [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.<ref>Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.</ref>\n\n\n\n==Late modern==\n{{further|Modern history#Late modern period}}\n===Central Asia: The Great Game, Russia vs Great Britain===\n[[File:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|250px|Political cartoon depicting the Afghan [[Sher Ali Khan|Emir Sher Ali]] with the rival \"friends\" the [[Russian Bear]] and British Lion (1878)]]\n\n[[The Great Game]] was a political and diplomatic confrontation between Great Britain and Russia over [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and neighbouring territories in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. It lasted from 1828 to 1907.  There was no war, but there were many threats. Russia was fearful of British commercial and military inroads into [[Central Asia]], and Britain was fearful of Russia  threatening its largest and most important possession, India. This resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires.  Britain made it a high priority to protect all the approaches to India, and the \"great game\" is primarily how the British did this in terms of a possible Russian threat.  Historians with access  to the archives have concluded that Russia had no plans involving India, as the Russians repeatedly stated.<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814\u20131974'' (1974) p 200</ref>\n\nThe Great Game began in 1838 when Britain decided to gain control over the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and make it a protectorate, and to use the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian Empire]], the [[Khanate of Khiva]], and the Emirate of Bukhara as buffer states between both empires. This would protect India and also key British sea trade routes by stopping Russia from gaining a port on the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean.  Russia proposed Afghanistan as the neutral zone, and the final result was diving up Afghanistan with a neutral zone in the middle between Russian areas in the north and British in the South. Important episodes included the failed [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1838, the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1845, the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1848, the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, and the annexation of [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] by Russia.<ref>* {{cite journal |jstor = 40105749|title = Great Britain's Great Game: An Introduction|journal = The International History Review|volume = 2|issue = 2|pages = 160\u2013171|last1 = Ingram|first1 = Edward|year = 1980|doi = 10.1080/07075332.1980.9640210}}\n</ref> The 1901 novel [[Kim (novel)|''Kim'']] by [[Rudyard Kipling]] made the term popular and introduced the new implication of great power rivalry.

The Manchu Qing emperors, especially Confucian scholar [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], remained largely conservative\u2014retaining the bureaucracy and the scholars within it, as well as the Confucian ideals present in Chinese society. However, changes in the economy and new attempts at resolving certain issues occurred too. These included increased trade with Western countries that brought large amounts of silver into the Chinese economy in exchange for tea, [[porcelain]], and silk textiles. This allowed for a new merchant-class, the [[comprador]]s, to develop. In addition, repairs were done on existing [[Levee|dikes]], canals, roadways, and [[irrigation]] works. This, combined with the lowering of taxes and government-assigned labor, was supposed to calm peasant unrest. However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.\n\nBy the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing China's politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.\n\n====Opium War====\n{{Main|First Opium War}}\n\nChina saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners. Originally, European traders were at a disadvantage because the Chinese cared little for their goods, while European demand for Chinese commodities such as tea and porcelain only grew. In order to tip the trade imbalance in their favor, British merchants began to sell Indian [[opium]] to the Chinese. Not only did this sap Chinese bullion reserves, it also led to widespread drug addiction amongst the [[scholar official|bureaucracy]] and society in general. A ban was placed on opium as early as 1729 by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], but little was done to enforce it. By the early 19th century, under the new [[Daoguang Emperor]], the government began serious efforts to eradicate opium from Chinese society. Leading this endeavour were respected scholar-officials including [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Imperial Commissioner]] [[Lin Zexu]].\n\nAfter Lin [[Destruction of opium at Humen|destroyed more than 20,000 chests of opium]] in the summer of 1839, Europeans demanded compensation for what they saw as unwarranted Chinese interference in their affairs. When it was not paid, the British declared war later the same year, starting what became known as the [[First Opium War]]. The outdated Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] were no match for the advanced British gunboats, and soon the [[Yangzi River]] region came under threat of British bombardment and invasion. The emperor had no choice but to sue for peace, resulting in the exile of Lin and the making of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ceded the British control of [[Hong Kong]] and opened up trade and diplomacy with other European countries, including Germany, France, and the USA.\n====Inner Manchuria====\n{{Further|Northeast China|{{History of Manchuria}}}}\nNortheast China came under influence of Russia with the building of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] through [[Harbin, China|Harbin]] to [[Vladivostok]].<ref>Henry B.  Miller, \"Russian Development of Manchuria.\" ''National Geographic Magazine'' 15 (1904): 113+ [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=cxQSAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA113&dq=manchuria+%22port+arthur%22&ots=k-fC6YolIf&sig=sPnaOR2ZzlHvUrI4-dWa41thFj0 online]. </ref> The [[Empire of Japan]] replaced Russian influence in the region as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904\u20131905, and Japan laid the [[South Manchurian Railway]] in 1906 to [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]].  During the [[Warlord Era]] in China, [[Zhang Zuolin]] established himself in Northeast China, but was murdered by the Japanese for being too independent.  The former Chinese  emperor, [[Puyi]], was then placed on the throne to lead a Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].<ref>Louise Young, ''Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=YjW41KFGw04C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=manchuria++japan&ots=ukkqHB3sQy&sig=s5VbuYRGeCmqdOk0grwc3JpxSzo#v=onepage&q=manchuria%20%20japan&f=false excerpt] </ref>  In August 1945, the Soviet Union invaded the region.  From 1945 to 1948, Northeast China was a base area for Mao Zedong's  [[People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]].  With the encouragement of the Kremlin, the area was used as a staging ground during the Civil War for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]], who were victorious in 1949 and have controlled ever since.<ref>Steven I.

Because the noble family of the king's wife got the power and ruled the country by their way. The 26th king of Joseon dynasty, [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]]'s father, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] wanted the king be powerful again. Even he wasn't the king, as the father of young king, He destroyed noble families and corrupt organizations. So the royal family got the power again. But he wanted to rebuild [[Gyeongbokgung]] palace in order to show the royal power. So he was criticized by people because he spent enormous money. So his son, the real king [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] got power. \n\nThe 26th king of Joseon, Gojong changed the nation's name to ''Daehan Jeguk''. It means the [[Korean Empire]]. And he also promoted himself as an emperor. The new empire accepted more western technology and strengthened military power. Unfortunately, in the [[Russo-Japanese war]], Japan won and started to invade Korea. Japan first stole the right to diplomacy from Korean Empire illegally. But every western country ignored this invasion because they knew Japan became a strong country as they defeated Russian Empire. So emperor Gojong sent diplomats to the Netherlands to let everyone know that Japan stole the Empire's right illegally. But it failed. Japan kicked Gojong off. 3 years after, In 1910, Korean Empire became a part of Empire of Japan. It was the first time ever after invasion of Han dynasty in 108 BC.\n\n\n==Contemporary==\n{{further|Contemporary history}}\n[[File:Asia (late 19th century- early 20th century).jpg|thumb|380px|left|Map of Asia for early 20th century]]\n\nThe European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the early 20th century, such as [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[Spanish East Indies]], and Portuguese [[Macau]] and [[Goa]]. The [[Great Game]] between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as [[Persia]], [[Thailand]] and most of China. In the twentieth century, [[Imperial Japan]] expanded into China and Southeast Asia during the [[World War II]]. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the [[Cold War]], the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the [[Soviet Union]] and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]. The [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.\n\n===China===\n{{main|History of the Republic of China|History of the People's Republic of China}}\nPrior to [[World War II]], China faced a civil war between [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist party and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist party; the nationalists appeared to be in the lead. However, once the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invaded]] in 1937, the two parties were forced to form a temporary cease-fire in order to defend China. The nationalists faced many military failures that caused them to lose territory and subsequently, respect from the Chinese masses. In contrast, the communists' use of guerilla warfare (led by [[Lin Biao]]) proved effective against the Japanese's conventional methods and put the Communist Party on top by 1945. They also gained popularity for the reforms they were already applying in controlled areas, including land redistribution, education reforms, and widespread health care. For the next four years, the nationalists would be forced to retreat to the small island east of China, known as [[Taiwan]] (formerly known as Formosa), where they remain today. In mainland China, [[China|People's Republic of China]] was established by the Communist Party, with [[Mao Zedong]] as its [[President of the People's Republic of China|state chairman]].\n\nThe communist government in China was defined by the party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]]. These hard-line officers controlled the [[People's Liberation Army]], which itself controlled large amounts of the bureaucracy. This system was further controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which additionally supported the state chairman who was considered the head of the government. The People's Republic's foreign policies included the repressing of [[secession]] attempts in Mongolia and Tibet and supporting of [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]], respectively. Additionally, by 1960 China began to cut off its connections with the Soviet Union due to border disputes and an increasing Chinese sense of superiority, especially the personal feeling of Mao over the Russian premier, [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n\nToday China plays important roles in world economics and politics. China today is the world's second largest economy and the second fastest growing economy.\n==Korea==\n[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit 01.jpg|thumb|right|The third Inter-Korean Summit between South Korean president [[Moon Jae-in]] and North Korean supreme leader [[Kim Jong-un]]. It was a historical event that symbolized the peace of Asia.]]\nAfter [[Korean War]], Korea divided into North and South. In 1960, [[North Korea]] was far more wealthier than [[South Korea]]. But in 1970, South Korea begins to outrun the North Korean economy. In 2018, South Korea is ranked #10 in world [[GDP]] ranking.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Ancient Asian history]]\n* [[History of Southeast Asia]]\n* {{slink|List of history journals|Asia}}\n* [[Prehistoric Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Best, Antony.

It is represented by three local government councillors, each elected to serve a four-year term. Kursaal was one of the four new wards created in 2000 during boundary changes in Southend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1487/made/data.htm|title=The Borough of Southend-on-Sea (Electoral Changes) Order 2000|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe wards boundaries are Victoria road in the east, with half the road being in Thorpe. The queensway ring road in the west. The seafront around Marine Parade in the south, and multiple smaller roads in the north. It borders Thorpe, Milton, St Lukes and Victoria. While it also shares a small border with Southchurch ward along Surbiton Avenue. They have remained this way since the wards creation in 2001.\n\n==Ward Profile==\nThe ward is defined by many different features, the Woodgrange estate makes up a large portion of the south of the ward and houses many of its inhabitants. The ward had in 2011 an unemployment rate of 13.5% higher than the Southend average of 8.1%.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.southend.gov.uk/downloads/file/3129/kursaal_wardpdf|title=Southend-on-Sea Borough Council download - Ward Profiles - About the Council - Information Centre - Southend Insights|first=Southend-on-Sea Borough|last=Council|website=www.southend.gov.uk}}</ref> It also had around 35% of home ownership compared to a 65% average in the rest of Southend.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The health of the inhabitants is also worse than compared to most over residents of [[Southend]].

It is represented by three local government councillors, each elected to serve a four-year term. Kursaal was one of the four new wards created in 2000 during boundary changes in Southend.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2000/1487/made/data.htm|title=The Borough of Southend-on-Sea (Electoral Changes) Order 2000|website=www.legislation.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\n==Boundaries==\nThe wards boundaries are Victoria road in the east, with half the road being in Thorpe. The queensway ring road in the west. The seafront around Marine Parade in the south, and multiple smaller roads in the north. It borders Thorpe, Milton, St Lukes and Victoria. While it also shares a small border with Southchurch ward along Surbiton Avenue. They have remained this way since the wards creation in 2001.\n\n==Ward Profile==\nThe ward is defined by many different features, the Woodgrange estate makes up a large portion of the south of the ward and houses many of its inhabitants. The ward had in 2011 an unemployment rate of 13.5% higher than the Southend average of 8.1%.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=https://www.southend.gov.uk/downloads/file/3129/kursaal_wardpdf|title=Southend-on-Sea Borough Council download - Ward Profiles - About the Council - Information Centre - Southend Insights|first=Southend-on-Sea Borough|last=Council|website=www.southend.gov.uk}}</ref> It also had around 35% of home ownership compared to a 65% average in the rest of Southend.<ref name=\"auto\"/> The health of the inhabitants is also worse than compared to most over residents of [[Southend]].

The Elymian tribes have been speculated to be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European people]] who migrated to Sicily from either [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolia]], the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean-Anatolian Coastal-Basin]], [[Liguria]] ([[Cinque Terre|Cinque Terre Coast]]), or one of the [[Aegean Islands]], or perhaps were a collection of native migratory maritime-based tribes from all previously mentioned regions. When the Elymians migrated to Sicily is unknown, however [[Hellenic historiography|scholars of antiquity]] considered them to be the second oldest inhabitants, while the Sicanians, thought to be the oldest inhabitants of Sicily by scholars of antiquity, were speculated to also be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European tribe]], who migrated via boat from the [[J\u00facar|X\u00faquer river]] basin in [[Province of Castell\u00f3n|Castell\u00f3n]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Province of Alicante|Alicante]].   \n\nAll three tribes lived both a [[sedentary]] [[pastoral farming]] and [[Orchard|orchard farming]] lifestyle, and a [[semi-nomadic]] [[fishing]] and [[mixed farming]] lifestyle. The river [[Salso|Salsu]] was the territorial boundary between the Sicels and Sicanians. They wore basic [[Clothing in the ancient world|clothing]] made of wool, [[Fiber crop|plant fibre]], [[papyrus]], [[esparto grass]], animal skins, [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]], leather and fur, and created tools and weapons using [[Forging|metal forging]] and [[pottery]]. They typically lived in a [[nuclear family]] unit, with some [[Extended family|extended]] family members as well, usually within a [[Trullo|drystone hut]], a [[neolithic long house]] or a simple [[hut]] made of mud, stones, wood, palm leaves or grass. Their main methods of transportation were horseback, donkeys and [[chariots]]. Evidence of pet [[wildcats]], [[Cirneco dell'Etna|cirneco dogs]] and [[List of wooden toys|children toys]] have been discovered in archaeological digs, especially in [[Necropolis of Pantalica|cemetery tombs]]. Their diet was a typical [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean diet]], including unique food varieties such as [[Gaglioppo]], [[Acitana]] and [[Diamante citron]], while in modern times the [['Nduja|Calabrian Salami]], which is also produced in Sicily, and sometimes used to make [['Nduja|spicy 'Nduja spreadable paste/sauce]], is a popular type of salami sold in [[Brazil]] and the [[Anglosphere]]. The Sicelian polytheistic worship of the ancient and native [[chthonic]], [[animism|animistic]]-cult deities associated with [[geysers]] known as the [[Palici]], and of the volcano-fire god by the name of [[Adranus|Adranos]], were also worshipped throughout Sicily by the Elymians and Sicanians. The Elymians inhabited the western parts of Sicily, while the Sicanians inhabitated the central parts, and the Sicels inhabitated the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] parts.  [[File:Sicilia arcaica.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|Map of early settlements of Sicily]]\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{See also|Magna Graecia|Ancient Carthage|Phoenicia}}\nFrom the 11th century BC, [[Phoenicians]] began to settle in western Sicily, having already started colonies on the nearby parts of [[maghreb|North Africa]] and [[Malta]]. Sicily was later colonized and heavily settled by [[Greeks]], beginning in the 8th century BC. Initially, this was restricted to the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] and southern parts of the island. As the [[Greek colonisation|Greek]] and [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenician]] communities grew more populous and more powerful, the Sicels and Sicanians were pushed further into the centre of the island. The independent [[Tyre, Lebanon|Phoenician]] colonial settlements were eventually absorbed by Carthage during the 6th Century BC. By the 3rd century BC, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was the most populous [[City-state|Greek city state]] in the world. [[Political_history_of_the_world#Ancient_history|Sicilian politics]] was intertwined with politics in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] itself, leading [[Classical Athens|Athens]], for example, to mount the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] in 415-413 BC during the [[Peloponnesian War]], which ended up severely affecting a defeated Athens, both politically and economically, in the following years to come. The constant warfare between [[Ancient Carthage]] and the [[Magna Graecia|Greek city-states]] eventually opened the door to an emerging [[Roman Republic|third power]]. In the 3rd century BC the [[Messina|Messanan Crisis]], caused by [[Mamertines|Mamertine]] [[mercenaries]] from [[Campania]], when the city-states of [[Messina]] ([[Punics|Carthaginian-owned]]) and [[Syracuse,Sicily|Syracuse]] ([[Dorians|Dorian-owned]]) were being constantly raided and pillaged by [[Mamertines]], during the period (282-240 BC) when Central (including Western) and Northeast Sicily were put under Carthaginian rule, motivated the intervention of the [[Roman Republic]] into Sicilian affairs, and led to the [[First Punic War]] between [[Rome]] and [[Carthage]]. By the end of the [[First Punic War|war]] in 242 BC, and with the death of [[Hiero II]], all of Sicily except Syracuse was in Roman hands, becoming Rome's first province outside of the Italian peninsula. For the next 600 years, Sicily would be [[Sicilia (Roman province)|a province]] of the Roman Republic and later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Prior to Roman rule, there were three native [[Elymian]] towns by the names of [[Segesta]], [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]] and [[Entella]], as well as several [[Sicels|Siculian]] towns called [[Agira|Agyrion]], [[Enna]] and [[Necropolis of Pantalica|Pantalica]]. \n\nSometime after Carthage conquered most of Sicily except for the Southeast which was still controlled by Syracuse, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus#Ruler of Sicily|Pyrrhus of Epirus]], the [[Molossians|Molossian]] king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], was installed as King/Tyrant of Sicily from 278-275 BC, even capturing the native [[Elymians|Elymian]] mountain-city of [[Eryx]], which was previously under Carthaginian fortification & protection before he captured it. Pyrrhus even attempted to capture [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] ([[Siege of Lilybaeum]]) from the [[Punics]], which didn't succeed. A couple years later (275 BC), Envoys from [[South Italy|Southern Italy]] had notified him that of all the [[Magna Graecia|Greek cities]] in Italy, only Tarentum hadn't fallen to the Romans. Upon hearing this, coinciding with the fact that the Sicilian city-states had started becoming hostile towards him, due to him trying to force Sicily into becoming a [[Martial law|martial state]], Pyrrhus made his decision to depart from the island and dethrone himself, leaving Syracuse and Carthage in charge of the island again. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\" While his army was being transported by ship to mainland Italy, Pyrrhus' navy was destroyed by the Carthaginians at the [[Battle of the Strait of Messina]], with 98 warships sunk or disabled out of 110. After Pyrrhus of Epirus landed on Mainland Italy, his Roman opponents had mastered up a large army under [[Roman consul]] [[Manius Curius Dentatus]], while he was still Tyrant of Sicily. After Pyrrhus was defeated at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)]] by the Romans, he decided to end his campaigns against Southern Italy, and return to [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], resulting in the loss of all his territorial gains in Italy. The city of Tarentum however still remained under Epirote control. \n\nThe ancient historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] who wrote and recorded the monumental works of manuscripts about [[universal history|universal world/human history]] called [[Bibliotheca historica]], and the ancient [[Doric Greek|Doric-Greek]] revolutionary scientist, inventor and mathematician [[Archimedes]] who anticipated modern [[calculus]], and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] by applying methods of [[infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] and [[Method of exhaustion|exhaustion]] to rigorously derive and prove the range of [[geometry|geometric]] [[theorems]], and invented the innovative [[Archimedes' screw|Archimedean screw]], [[Block and tackle|compound pulleys]], and defensive war machines to protect his native town of Syracuse from invasions, were both born, grew up in, lived and died in Sicily.\n\n===Middle ages===\nAs the Roman Empire was falling apart, a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe known as the [[Vandals]], and an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe known as the [[Alans]] took over Sicily in 468 AD (after [[Battle of Carthage (439)|taking]] Carthage in 439 they tried several times but failed to take the  island) under the rule of their king [[Geiseric]] ([[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alanian Kingdom]]). The Vandals & Alans gained a monopoly on the Mediterranean grain trade during their monarchical reign, with all grain taxes being monitored by them. Due to the [[Western Roman Empire]] being too preoccupied with war in [[Gaul]], when the Vandals & Alans started [[Invasion|invading]] Sicily in 440, the Romans could not respond. Eastern Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II]] sent a failed expeditionary force to deal with them in 441, which ended in a Vandal-Alan counter-victory. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions, except for one toehold in [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]], to [[Odoacer]] (an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]] [[Barbarian]] statesman & general of possible [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] & [[Huns|Hunnic]] descent, and [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client king]] under [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] whose [[King of Italy|reign over Italy]] marked the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]) in 476 and completely to the [[Ostrogothic]] conquest of Sicily by [[Theodoric the Great]] which began in 488; although the [[Goths]] were [[Germanic]], Theodoric sought to revive [[Roman people|Roman]] culture and government and allowed freedom of religion. In contrast to the prior Carthaginian, Syracusan (Dorian) and Roman Empires which ruled Sicily in the past, Sicily did not serve as a distinct province or administrative region under Germanic control, although it did retain a certain amount of autonomy. The [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] took place between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (with its capital-city based at [[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul]]), and during the reign of [[Justinian I]], Sicily was brought back under [[Greco-Roman_world|Greco-Roman rule]] under the military expeditions of Byzantine generals [[Belisarius|Flavius Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], resulting in [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine-Greek language]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|religion]] being embraced by the majority of the population. It was Syracuse where the Byzantine Emperor [[Constans II]] desired to move his capital in 663 AD, a decision which eventually led to his assassination. Sicily remained under [[Autonomous province|autonomous]] stable [[Constantinople|Byzantine rule]] as the [[Sicily (theme)|Theme/Province of Sicily]] ([[Theme (Byzantine district)]] for several peaceful centuries, until an invasion by [[Arab]] [[Muslims]] ([[Aghlabids]] from the [[Banu Tamim|Banu Tamim Clan]]) in the 9th century. \n\nBesides Sicily, the Theme or Province of Sicily also included the adjacent region of [[Calabria]] in Mainland Italy. The capital city of Byzantine Sicily was Syracuse. The province was looked after by the imperial governor known as a [[Praetor]], and was militarily protected under a general by the title of [[Dux]]. Sicily itself was divided into many districts known as a [[Turma]]. The Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Exarch of Ravennan Italy]] named [[Theophylact (exarch)|Theophylact]], between 702-709, originally came from Sicily. The garrison of [[Ravenna]] tried to kill him in 701, for reasons unknown. He also marched to Rome in 701 shortly after his promotion in the Exarchate for unknown reasons, which angered the Romans and local soldiers living there, however he was able to speak to the [[Pope John VI|Pope]], who calmed the Romans down. While Theophylact was still Exarch, Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian II]] seized all the leading citizens and officials of Ravenna at a local banquet, and dragged them abroad a ship to Constantinople. He sentenced many of them to death, while sparing some. This was due to a recent rebellion which [[Ravenna]] took part in, in 695. Justinian II later sacked Ravenna, weakening the Exarchate in charge of it. Theophylact was not a victim of the catastrophe, but was the first Exarch to experience a weakened Ravenna. Theophylact possibly moved back to Sicily after he retired from the Exarchate in 709. Theophylact might have also been the [[Strategos]] of Sicily from 700-710. The Strategos of Sicily was also able to exercise some control over the autonomous duchies of [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], depending on the local political situation or faction at the time.\n\nThe [[Aghlabid]] invasions were in part caused by the Byzantine-Sicilian military commander [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Euphemius]], who invited the Aghlabids to aid him in his rebellion against the imperial governor of Sicily in 826 AD, specifically the request was made to the third Aghlabird [[Emir]] [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya|Ziyadat Allah I]] of [[Ifriqiya]], in return for a place as a general and safe refuge; a Muslim army was sent.<ref name=\"stan\"/> He agreed to conquer Sicily, promising to give it back to Euphemius in exchange for a yearly tribute, and entrusted its conquest to the 70-year-old qadi [[Asad ibn al-Furat]]. The Muslim force counted 10,000 infantry, 700 cavalry and 100 ships, reinforced by Euphemius' ships and, after the landing at [[Mazara del Vallo]]. The first battle against the loyal Byzantine troops occurred on July 15, 827, near Mazara, resulting in an [[Aghlabid]] victory. A similar situation happened a century prior, when the imperial governor of Sicily (Sergios), had declared a Byzantine official from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] by the name of [[Basil Onomagoulos]] ([[regnal name]] [[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]) as rival emperor, when false news reached Sicily that Constantinople had fallen to the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. When [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo the Syrian]] sent an [[Chartoularios|administrative official]] named [[Paul (exarch)|Paul]] to Sicily, the people and army of Syracuse surrendered Basil and his rebels up to him, leading to the beheading of Basil, while the former governor Sergios was able to escape to [[Kingdom of the Lombards|the parts of Mainland Italy controlled by the Lombards]]. \n\nAnother rebellion took place between the years 781-793, when the aristocratic governor of Sicily, [[Elpidius (rebel)|Elpidius]], was accused of conspiring against [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]] in favour of [[Nikephoros (Caesar)|Nikephoros]]. After Elpidius's forces were militarily defeated by Empress Irene's large fleet dispatched in Sicily, he, along with his lieutenant, the [[dux]] of [[Calabria]] named Nikephoros, defected to the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], where he was humorously acknowledged as rival emperor. After losing another military expedition, this time against [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] with the help of the Abbasids, he advised the [[Banu Abbas|Abbasid]] [[Emir]] of [[Upper Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Abd al-Malik ibn Salih]], to \"throw away his silk and put on his armour\", warning him against the aggressive new reign of [[Nikephoros I]]. [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|The Muslim conquest]] was a see-saw affair; the local population resisted fiercely and the [[Aghlabids|Arabs]] suffered considerable dissension and infighting among themselves during this process. Not until 965 was the island's conquest successfully completed by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], with Syracuse in particular resisting almost to the end ([[Siege of Syracuse (877-878)]]). Before 965, there still remained some fortified towns under Roman-Byzantine protection. During the [[Emirate of Sicily]]'s reign, substantial settlements were established in various regions of Sicily by [[Arab-Berbers]]. Their capital was based at [[Palermo|Bal'harm]]. \n\nThe first phase of [[Muslim]] rule began with the conquests of the third Aghlabid [[Emir]] [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya]], and consolidated with the reign of the ninth Emir [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya]] after the conquest of [[Taormina]]. The first attempt to [[Siege of Syracuse (827-828)|capture Syracuse]] was under general [[Asad ibn al-Furat]], although it ended in a Byzantine victory. A strong combination of [[Ifriqiya|Ifriqiyan]] and [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] troops helped to capture the Island between 830-831. After a revolt was suppressed, the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Mansur Billah]] appointed a member of the [[Kalbids|Kalbid]] dynasty, [[Al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi]], as First Emir of Sicily. The Kalbids ruled Sicily from 948 to 1053. [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis]], fourth ruler of the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] [[Sanhaja]] dynasty in North Africa, attempted to annex the island for the Zirids, but his attempts failed. The new Arab-Berber rulers initiated revolutionary [[Arab Agricultural Revolution|land reforms]], which in turn increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, a dent to the dominance of the landed estates. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems through [[Qanats]], introducing oranges, lemons, pistachio and sugarcane to Sicily. [[Ibn Hawqal]], a [[Baghdad|Baghdadi]] [[merchant]] who visited Sicily in 950, commented that a walled suburb called the Kasr (the palace) was the center of Palermo, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman Catholic cathedral. The suburb of Al-Khalisa (Kalsa) contained the Sultan's palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqual reckoned there were 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. By 1050, Palermo had a population of 350,000, making it one of the largest cities in Europe, behind Islamic-Spain's capital C\u00f3rdoba and the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, which had populations over 450-500,000. Palermo's population dropped to 150,000 under Norman rule. By 1330 Palermo's population had declined to 51,000, possibly due to the inhabitants of the region being deported to other regions of [[County of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] or to the Norman [[County of Apulia and Calabria]]. The Arab traveler [[Ibn Jubayr]] from [[Al-Andalus]] stated that the buildings built during this period were made of [[limestone]]. The latinized Catholic Sicilians in Western Sicily still continued to revolt until Norman rule, and the [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]-speaking Byzantine [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]-[[Catholicism|Catholic]] Sicilians in the East almost secured their independence several times during their revolts. Christians and Jews were tolerated in Muslim Sicily as [[dhimmi|dhimmis]], and had to pay the [[Jizya]] poll tax, and [[Kharaj]] land tax, but were exempt from the [[Zakat]] alms-giving tax Muslims had to pay. Many Jews immigrated to Sicily during Muslim rule, but left after the Normans arrived. \n\n[[File:Sicilian types and costumes.jpg|thumb|200px|Sicilians in traditional dress]] \nIn the 11th century, the mainland southern Italian powers were hiring [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman mercenaries]], who were Christian descendants of the [[Vikings]]; it was the [[Normans]] under [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] (of the [[Hauteville dynasty]]) who conquered Sicily from the Muslims [[Battle of Cerami|over a period of thirty years]] until finally controlling the entire island by 1091 as the [[County of Sicily]]. In 1130, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]] founded the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] as an independent state with its own [[Sicilian Parliament|Parliament]], language, [[schooling]], army and currency, while the Sicilian culture evolved distinct traditions, clothing, linguistic changes, [[Sicilian cuisine|cuisine]] and customs not found in mainland [[Italy]].<ref>James Minahan, ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World A-Z'', 2002 p.1714.</ref> A great number of mainland [[County of Apulia and Calabria|Southern Italian]] and [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] families began settling in Sicily during this time.\n\nThe Siculo-Norman rule of the [[Hauteville dynasty]] continued until 1198, when [[Frederick I of Sicily]], the son of a [[Siculo-Norman]] queen and a [[Hohenstaufen dynasty|Swabian-German]] emperor ascended the throne. In fact it was during the reign of this Hohenstaufen ([[Swabians|Swabian-German]]) king [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], that the poetic form known as a [[sonnet]] was invented by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], the head Poet, Teacher and [[Notary]] of the [[Sicilian School|Sicilian School for Poetry]]. His (Frederick I) descendants governed Sicily until the [[Papal States|Papacy]] invited a [[Capetian dynasty|French]] prince to take the throne, which led to a decade-and-a-half of French rule under [[Charles I of Sicily]]; he was later deposed in the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] against French rule, which put the daughter of [[Manfred of Sicily]] - [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance II]] and her husband [[Peter III of Aragon]], a member of the [[House of Barcelona]], on the throne. Their [[House of Barcelona|descendants]] ruled the Kingdom of Sicily until 1401. Following the [[Compromise of Caspe]] in 1412 the Sicilian throne passed to the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] monarchs from [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. [[Frederick of Castile]] had participated in the services of the last Hohenstaufen King [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] at the [[Battle of Benevento]] against the French [[House of Capet|Capetians]] and the [[Papal States|Papacy]] in 26 February 1266. ([[Guelphs and Ghibellines]])\n\nFrom 1194, the Holy Roman Emperor and member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] became King of Sicily via his marriage to [[Constance, Queen of Sicily]], daughter of [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]]. Because Henry was stuck in the Hohenstaufen conflict with the [[House of Welf]], he had to enforce the inheritance claims by his wife against her nephew Count [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]]. Henry's attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] failed at the [[Siege of Naples (1191)|siege of Naples in 1191]] due to an epidemic, and following his retreat Empress Constance was captured. Based on an enormous ransom for the release of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]], he conquered Sicily in 1194; however, the intended unification with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ultimately failed due to the opposition of the [[Papacy]]. In February 1194, [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]] died, leaving as heir a young boy, [[William III of Sicily|William III]], under the tutelage of his mother [[Sibylla of Acerra]], sister of [[Richard, Count of Acerra]]. In May Emperor Henry, based on King Richard's ransom, again set out for Italy. He reached Milan at Pentecost and occupied Naples in August. He met little resistance and on 20 November 1194 entered Palermo capital of Kingdom of Sicily and was crowned king on 25 December. On the next day his wife Constance, who had stayed back in Iesi, gave birth to his only son and heir Frederick II, the future emperor and king of Sicily and Jerusalem. The young William and his mother Sibylla had fled to [[Caltabellotta]] Castle; he officially renounced the Sicilian kingdom in turn for the [[County of Lecce]] and the [[Principality of Capua]]. A few days after Henry's coronation, however, the royal family and several Norman nobles were accused of a coup attempt and arrested. Henry is said to have had William blinded and castrated. Some, however, like the Siculo-Greek [[Eugenius of Palermo|Eugene of Palermo]], transitioned into the new Hohenstaufen government with ease. William was probably deported to the Altems ([[Hohenems]]) Castle in [[Swabia]], where he died in captivity about 1198. To take revenge for the capture of his wife, Henry hanged [[Richard, Count of Acerra]] brother of [[Sibylla of Acerra|Sibylla]] in 1196. Henry placed further [[Ministerialis|ministeriales]] in the Sicilian administration, like the [[Troia, Apulia|Troian]] bishop [[Walter of Palearia]] who became chancellor. His loyal henchman Markward von Annweiler was appointed a Duke of [[Ravenna]], placing him in a highly strategic position to control the route to Sicily via the Italian [[Romagna]] region and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. \n\nDuring the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], there was a [[Muslim settlement of Lucera|massive deportation and resettlement]] of 20,000 [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Sicilian Muslims]] to [[Lucera]], a planned settlement in [[Province of Foggia|Foggia]], [[Apulia]]. The settlement thrived for about 75 years. In 1300, it was sacked by the Christian forces of [[Charles II of Naples]] and its Muslim inhabitants were exiled or sold into slavery.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/> The Sicilian territories inherited by Frederick II from his mother Constance of Sicily carried with them not only authority over the Roman Catholic majority of the island, but also over significant numbers of [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. The Muslims of the 'regno' were a heterogeneous community, that included Arabs (concentrated particularly in the triangle made by [[Mazara del Vallo]]-[[Monreale]]-[[Corleone]]), Berbers (settled mostly in [[Agrigento]] and in its province), small groups of [[Persians]] (amongst them, in particular, the [[Khwarazm|Khwarizmi]] community of Palermo), and a sizable number of local people who had converted to Islam during the Muslim rule in Sicily. Frederick\u2019s accession to the throne did not bring social and religious peace to Sicily. The terrain of the island favoured in fact the resistance action of groups of Muslims, hoping to restore the dominion of Islam in what in Arabic had initially been called Al-ard al-Kabira, the \"Great Land\", and then, simply, Siqilliyya.\n\nSome Muslim groups had found bases for resistance in central and western Sicily, around [[San Giuseppe Jato|Iato]] and [[Entella]]. In Entella the resistance was led by a Muslim woman recorded in the contemporary Christian chronicles as the \u201c[[Virago]] of Entella\u201d. As a consequence, after most of the affluent and powerful Muslims had returned to North Africa, in 1220 Frederick II determined to expel the remaining Muslims from Sicily, or at least the less docile groups amongst them, who constituted the essential remaining leadership of the Muslim community, the notables, the scholars and the warriors with their families, and resettle them in the [[South Italy|southern Italian mainland]].\n\nThe localities of Lucera (in Apulia, dating from 1224), Girofalco (now [[Girifalco]], in [[Calabria]]) and [[Acerenza]] (in [[Lucania]]) were chosen for the resettlement. Smaller groups of Sicilian Muslims were also deported to the localities of [[Stornara]], Casal Monte Saraceno and Castel Saraceno as well as to [[Campania]].\n\nThe total population of these Muslim communities has been estimated by most modern scholars at around 60,000 individuals, judging from the community's ability to supply the Kings of Sicily a theoretical military contingent of around 14\u201315,000 men strong, of which 7\u201310,000, as reported by contemporary sources, were effectively employable on the battlefield at Cortenuova. These troops, most of them lightly armed archers and many also trained in the use of the sling, constituted the faithful personal bodyguard of the Hohenstaufens, since they had no connection to the political rivals of the \"House of Swabia\" and were ready to wage war\u2014ferociously even for the contemporary standards\u2014on the local populations, and depended entirely on their sovereign.\n\nIn 1239 the Emperor Frederick II ordered the concentration of the [[Saracen]] communities in Lucera and Apulia, a command that was substantially enforced. By 1240 the resettlements had taken place, with 20,000 Muslims settled in Lucera, 30,000 in other nearby parts of Apulia and the remaining 10,000 who would have been placed in communities outside Apulia.

In 1735, the Spanish era ended when [[Charles V of Sicily|Charles V]] from the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|House of Bourbon]] was crowned king. For the better part of the next century-and-a-half, Sicily was in [[personal union]] with the other Southern Italian [[Kingdom of Naples]], with the official residence located in [[Naples]], under the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbon dynasty]]. In 1861, however, Sicily became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] as a result of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. After the unification of Italy and the [[Fascism|Fascist era]], a wave of [[Sicilian nationalism]] led to the adoption of the [[Statute of Sicily]], under which the island has become an [[autonomous region]]. Since 1946, the island enjoys the most advanced special status of all the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]]s, which allows the Sicilian residents to keep 100% of the revenue from all the taxes, without giving back any to the central government in [[Rome]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type=\n|align=right\n|widths=50px \n|heights=50px\n|footnote=Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2017\n|1861|2409000\n|1871|2590000\n|1881|2933000\n|1901|3568000\n|1911|3812000\n|1921|4223000\n|1931|3906000\n|1936|4000000\n|1951|4487000\n|1961|4721000\n|1971|4681000\n|1981|4907000\n|1991|4966000\n|2001|4969000\n|2011|5002904\n|2017|5029615\n}}\n\n[[File:Palermo panorama.JPG|thumb|The city of [[Palermo]] in 2005]]\nSicily has experienced the presence of a number of different cultures and ethnicities in its vast history, including the original [[Italic peoples]] ([[Sicani]], [[Siculi]] and [[Elymians]], although the language families which each of these three peoples spoke has still not been deciphered by academia or linguistic historians/scholars), [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenicians]] ([[Phoenicia]]) and [[Punics|Carthaginians]] ([[Ancient Carthage]]), [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] ([[Magna Graecia]]), [[Bruttians]], [[Lucanians]], [[Mamertines]], [[Iberians]], [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], [[Colchis|Colchians]] (Proto-[[Georgians]]), [[Anatolian peoples|Anatolians]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Assyria|Assyrians]], [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[Nabataeans]], [[Numidians]], [[Tribe of Judah|Judeans]] & [[Tribe of Dan|Danites]], [[Eurasian nomads]] ([[Scythia]]), [[Illyrians]], [[Ligures]], [[Gauls]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the [[ancient history|ancient]] and [[classical antiquity|classical periods]]. \n\nFrom the medieval and modern eras, Sicily experienced [[Human migration|migratory]] waves of [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] (During [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alan]] rule), while under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Emirate of Sicily|Saracen]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] rules, there were considerable numbers of [[Arabs]], [[Berbers]], [[Hebrews]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Tarabin Bedouin|Tarabin Bedouins]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]], [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Nubians]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Tatars]], [[Vikings]], [[Mongols]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Normans]], [[Swabians]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austrians and Hungarians]], [[Lombards]] and [[Italians]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]], [[Spaniards]], [[Sardinians]], [[Basques]], [[Romanians]], [[French people|French]], [[British people|British]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] people settling in Sicily for various reasons, such as to escape [[persecution]], to establish merchant communities or to find better land for cultivation.\n\nAbout five million people live in Sicily, making it the [[List of regions of Italy#List of regions|fourth most populated region in Italy]].

Other studies have also confirmed that the population of Sicily is genetically similar, but not identical, to that of [[Crete]], [[Cyprus]] and the [[Peloponnese]] (Such as the [[Maniots]]), while they do not seem to cluster or show any sort of genetic affinity to any [[Ethnic group|population groups]] from [[Geography of Greece|Mainland Greece]], [[Geography of Albania|Albania]] or the [[Balkans]].

Haplogroup G reaches its highest percentage among [[Georgians]], its presence in Sicily is probably a result of [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasian]] immigration into Sicily after the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman conquest]], while the presence of haplogroup Q at almost 3 percent is most likely the result of previous [[Tatar]], and [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] migration into Sicily during the medieval and early modern periods, as this haplogroup is mostly found in the [[Americas]] and [[Siberia]]. The two most common MtDNA haplogroups in Sicily are [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroups H]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U]], which are also the two most commonly found MtDNA hpgroups in [[Europe]] as a whole. Further migrations by the [[Vandals]], [[Alans]], [[Byzantine Greeks]], [[Lombards]], [[Normans]], [[Vikings]], [[Turkic peoples]] (including [[Crimean Tatars]]) and [[Mongols]] ([[Demographics of Central Asia|Central Asians]]), [[Lebanese people]], [[Syrians]], [[Kurds]], [[Tarabin Bedouin|Tarabin Bedouins]], Albanian [[Tosks]] and [[Ghegs]], [[Transcaucasus|South Caucasians]] and [[Saracens]] ([[Arab-Berbers]] and [[Levant|Arab Levantines]]) had a small, yet noticeable, effect on the ethnic composition of the Sicilian people. The [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman civilisation]] proliferated for several centuries on the island, with a strong impact on the culture, and [[Italo-Normans|Normans]] and especially mainland [[South Italy|Southern Italians]] repopulated the island during this time. The Norman Kingdom of Sicily was created in 1130, with Palermo as its capital, and would last until the 18th century. Nowadays it is in north-west Sicily, around Palermo and Trapani, that Norman Y-DNA is the most common, with 15 to 20% of the lineages belonging to haplogroup I. Today, Ancient & Medieval Greek (Cretan, [[List of islands of Greece|Islander Greek]] and Peloponnesian) genetic paternal legacy is estimated at 37% in Sicily, and North African ([[Arab-Berber]]) at 6%.<ref name=nature.com/> A recent genetic study of Southern Italian and Sicilian populations has shown that Sicilians are very closely related to mainland Italians from the adjacent regions of [[Calabria]], [[Basilicata]] and [[Apulia]], as well as to the [[Maltese people]] with whom they share the most genetic similarity with besides the [[Calabria|Calabrese]], and [[Cypriots]] of [[Demographics of Cyprus|any ethnolinguistic origin or cultural identity]].<ref name=\"journals.plos.org\">{{cite journal|title= An Ancient Mediterranean Melting Pot: Investigating the Uniparental Genetic Structure and Population History of Sicily and Southern Italy| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0096074|pmid = 24788788|volume=9|issue = 4|page=e96074|journal=PLOS ONE|year = 2014|last1 = Sarno|first1 = Stefania|last2 = Boattini|first2 = Alessio|last3 = Carta|first3 = Marilisa|last4 = Ferri|first4 = Gianmarco|last5 = Al\u00f9|first5 = Milena|last6 = Yao|first6 = Daniele Yang|last7 = Ciani|first7 = Graziella|last8 = Pettener|first8 = Davide|last9 = Luiselli|first9 = Donata|pmc = 4005757| bibcode=2014PLoSO...996074S}}</ref>\n[[File:Haplogroups europe.png|thumb|right|300px|Y-Dna Haplogroups in Europe.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"3\"|Frequencies (in %) of haplogroups.<ref name=\"nature.com\"/><ref name=\"journals.plos.org\"/><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Francalacci |first1=P |title=Peopling of three Mediterranean islands (Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily) inferred by Y-chromosome biallelic variability |journal= American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=13 March 2003 |volume=121 |issue=3 |pages=270\u2013279 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.10265 |pmid=12772214 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capelli |first1=C |title=Population Structure in the Mediterranean Basin: A Y Chromosome Perspective |journal=Annals of Human Genetics |date=13 September 2005 |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=207\u2013225 |doi=10.1111/j.1529-8817.2005.00224.x |pmid=16626331 |hdl=2108/37090 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Capelli |first1=C |title=Moors and Saracens in Europe: estimating the medieval North African male legacy in southern Europe |journal= European Journal of Human Genetics|date=21 January 2009 |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=848\u2013852 |doi=10.1038/ejhg.2008.258 |pmid=19156170 |pmc=2947089 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Brisighelli |first1=Francesca |title=Uniparental Markers of Contemporary Italian Population Reveals Details on Its Pre-Roman Heritage |journal=PLOS One|volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e50794 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0050794 |pmid=23251386 |pmc=3519480 |year=2012 |bibcode=2012PLoSO...750794B }}</ref><ref name=Tofanelli>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tofanelli S, Brisighelli F, Anagnostou P, Busby GB, Ferri G, Thomas MG, Taglioli L, Rudan I, Zemunik T, Hayward C, Bolnick D, Romano V, Cali F, Luiselli D, Shepherd GB, Tusa S, Facella A, Capelli C | title = The Greeks in the West: genetic signatures of the Hellenic colonisation in southern Italy and Sicily | journal = European Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 429\u201336 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26173964 | pmc = 4757772 | doi = 10.1038/ejhg.2015.124 }}</ref>\n|-\n| ''Y-chromosome''  || ''mtDNA''\n|-\n| 3,5% [[Haplogroup I-M253|I1]] || 5% [[Haplogroup HV (mtDNA)|HV]]\n|-\n| 3,5% [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]] || 45,2% [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|H]]\n|-\n| 4,5% [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]] || 2,3% HV0+[[Haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]]\n|-\n| 30,5% [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] || 6,7% [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|J]]\n|-\n| 9% [[Haplogroup G-M201|G]] || 7,1% [[Haplogroup T (mtDNA)|T]]\n|-\n| 23% [[Haplogroup J-M172|J2]] || 10% [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U*]]\n|-\n| 3% [[Haplogroup J-M267|J* + J1]] || 6,3% [[Haplogroup K (mtDNA)|K]]\n|-\n| 18% [[Haplogroup E-M215 (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] || 6% [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N1]]+[[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]]\n|-\n| 4% [[Haplogroup T-M184|T]] || 1% [[Haplogroup N (mtDNA)|N2]]+[[Haplogroup W (mtDNA)|W]]\n|-\n| 0% [[Haplogroup L-M20|L]] || 3,7% [[Haplogroup X (mtDNA)|X]]\n|-\n| 1% [[Haplogroup Q-M242|Q]] || 6,7% Other\n|}\n\n===Names & Surnames===\nThe most common Sicilian names are ''Giuseppe'', ''Maria'' and ''Salvatore''.

However the use of [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family).\n\nSicilian was an early influence in the development of standard Italian, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and his court of notaries or ''Magna Curia'' which, headed by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], also gave birth to the [[Sicilian School]], widely inspired by troubadour literature. It is in this language that appeared the first [[sonnet]], whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself. Sicilian was also the official language of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1300 to 1543. Prior to the 20th century, large numbers of Sicilian people spoke only Sicilian as their mother tongue, with little or no fluent knowledge of [[Italian language|Italian]]. Today, while Sicilian is an unrecognized language being used as part of many people's daily life, Italian is the only official language and predominates in the public arena.\n\nThe [[Siculo-Arabic]] dialect as a vernacular [[Varieties of Arabic|variety of]] [[Arabic]] once spoken in [[Sicily]] and neighbouring [[Malta]] between the end of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century. The language became extinct in Sicily, but in Malta it eventually evolved into what is now the [[Maltese language]]. It influenced the dialect of [[Pantelleria]].\n\nThe [[Siculish]] dialect is the [[Macaronic language|macaronic]] \"Sicilianization\" of [[English language]] words and phrases by immigrants from [[Sicily]] to the [[United States]] in the early 20th century. Forms of Siculish are also to be found in other Sicilian immigrant communities of [[Anglosphere|English-speaking countries]], namely Canada and Australia.  A surprising similarity can often be found between these forms, through either coincidence, trans-national movements of Sicilian immigrants, or more likely, through the logical adaptation of [[English language|English]] using linguistic norms from the Sicilian language.\n\n====Ethno-linguistic minorities====\nThere are two main historical [[Ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] minorities in Sicily, the [[Lombards of Sicily]] and the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]].\n* The [[Lombards of Sicily]] are a linguistic minority living in Sicily who speak an isolated variety of Gallo-Italic dialects, the so-called [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily]].

The Lombards of Sicily, who originally hailed from Northern Italy, settled the central and [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] part of Sicily about 900 years ago, during the [[Norman conquest of Sicily]]. Because of linguistic differences among the Gallo-Italic dialects of Sicily, it is supposed that there were different immigration routes. From [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]], and [[Lombardy]] they began to spread south between the 11th and 14th centuries. The most important areas where the Gallo-Italic of Sicily is spoken are [[Acquedolci]], [[Montalbano Elicona]], [[Novara di Sicilia]], [[Fondachelli-Fantina]] [[San Fratello]] and [[San Piero Patti]] ([[Province of Messina]]), [[Aidone]], [[Nicosia, Sicily|Nicosia]], [[Piazza Armerina]] and [[Sperlinga]] ([[Province of Enna]]).\n[[File:Tabelle italiano-albanese.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Bilingual road signs, in Italian and Arb\u00ebresh in [[Piana degli Albanesi]].]]\n* The [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]] settled in Southern Italy in the 15th to 18th centuries in several waves of migrations. They are the descendants of mostly [[Tosk Albanian]] refugees of Christian faith who fled to Italy after the Albanian conquest and subsequent Islamisation by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the [[Balkans]]. They speak their own variant of the [[Arb\u00ebresh]] language. There are three identified Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb communities in the [[province of Palermo]], which have maintained unchanged, with different aspects together, the ethnic, linguistic and religious origins. The areas are: [[Contessa Entellina]], [[Piana degli Albanesi]] and [[Santa Cristina Gela]]; while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely intelligible. The largest centre is [[Piana degli Albanesi]] which, besides being the hub of [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi|religious]] and socio-cultural communities, has guarded and defended their peculiarities intact over time. There are two other communities with a strong historical and linguistic heritage.\n\n* The community of the [[Griko people|Greeks of Messina]] (or Siculo-Greeks) speaks [[modern Greek]] with some elements of the [[Ancient Greek|ancient Greek language]] spoken in the island, and [[Calabrian Greek]]. The Greek community was reconstituted in 2003 with the name of ''\"Comunit\u00e0 Hellenica dello Stretto\"'' (Hellenic Community of the Strait).\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Icon - Main altar of Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015.JPG|180px|right|thumb|[[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]], [[Monreale Cathedral]].]]\nThe vast majority of Sicilians are [[baptism|baptized]] as [[Roman Catholic]]. The Catholic religion represents one of the most important elements of the Sicilian identity. The [[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]] is the patroness of Sicily. The Sicilian people are also known for their deep devotion to some Sicilian female saints: the martyrs [[Agatha of Sicily|Agatha]] and [[Saint Lucy|Lucy]], respectively patroness of Catania and Syracuse, and the hermitess [[Saint Rosalia|Rosalia]], patroness of Palermo. The Sicilian people have significantly contributed to the history of [[Christianity]]. There were four Sicilian [[Pope|Popes]] ([[Pope Agatho|Agatho]], [[Pope Leo II|Leo II]], [[Pope Sergius I|Sergius I]], [[Pope Stephen III|Stephen III]]) and a Sicilian [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] ([[Methodios I of Constantinople|Methodios I]]).\n\n===Art and architecture===\n{{Main article|Norman-Sicilian culture|Sicilian Baroque}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main article|Sicilian cuisine}}\n\n{{Main article|List of people from Sicily|List of Sicilian Americans}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery caption=\"Sicilian folk costumes and traditions\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Sicilian artigiana 6.jpg|Sicilian artigiana at a presepe vivente at Santa Maria La Stella, Sicily\nFile:Women in Albanian dress.jpg|Women in Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb dress\nFile:Sicilian costume 3 1880.jpg|Boy in Sicilian costume of the 1880s\nFile:Sicilian costume 1880s.jpg|Girl wearing a costume of the 1880s period in Sicily\nFile:Reprofotografi av bild fr\u00e5n resealbum, i samband med utst\u00e4llningen Samtida venetianskt konstglas - Hallwylska museet - 87765.tif|Sicilian family, 1880s.\nFile:Ramacca 033.jpg|Sicilian band in medieval costumes\nFile:Piana-degli-Albanesi-bjs2007-03.jpg|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb in Piana degli Albanesi\nFile:Handkolorerat fotografi p\u00e5 siciliansk vagn - Hallwylska museet - 104084.tif|\nFile:Artigiano siciliano.JPG|A Sicilian artisan in Sutera\nFile:Bruno, Giuseppe (1836-1904) - n. 020 (Timbrato sul retro).jpg|Two peasants wearing a Sicilian costume, 1880s\nFile:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - n. 0024 - Pescatore catanese.jpg|Fisherman from Catania, 1890s.\nFile:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - n. 0036 - da - Sicilia mitica Arcadia - p. 61.jpg|A girl holding an amphora, Limina, 1880/1890\nFile:Catacombe dei Cappuccini Palermo.jpg|Catacombe dei Cappuccini, Palermo\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|People of Sicily}}\n*[[List of people from Sicily]]\n*[[Sicilian Americans]]\n*[[Kingdom of Sicily]]\n*[[History of Sicily]]\n*[[Sicilian language]]\n*[[Magna Graecia]]\n*[[Crown of Aragon]]\n*[[Maltese people]]\n*[[Italians]]\n*[[Griko people]]\n*[[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Sicily}}\n\n[[Category:People from Sicily| ]]\n[[Category:Romance peoples]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox ethnic group|\n| group = Sicilians\n| native_name = {{native name|it|Siciliani / Siculi}}<br/>{{native name|scn|Siciliani}}\n| image = \n| region1 = {{flag|Sicily}}<br/><small>(inhabitants of Sicily)</small>\n| pop1 = 5,029,675\n| ref1 = <ref>[[National Institute of Statistics (Italy)|ISTAT]]</ref><ref>[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/scn c. 5 million speakers of the] [[Sicilian language]] in Italy, according to the [[Ethnologue]] (includes ethnic Sicilians in southern [[Calabria]].</ref>\n| rels = [[Christianity]]: Predominantly [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] ([[Latin liturgical rites|Latin]] and [[Byzantine Rite]]s)\n| langs = [[Italian language|Italian]] \u2022 [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] \u2022 [[Gallo-Sicilian]]\n}}\n'''Sicilians''' or the '''Sicilian people''' ('''''Siciliani''''' in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], or also '''''Siculi''''' in Italian<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it//vocabolario/siculo|title=s\u00ecculo in Vocabolario - Treccani|website=www.treccani.it}}</ref>) are a [[Romance peoples|Romance]]<ref name=\"Minahan\">{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |author-link= |title=One Europe, Many Nations: A Historical Dictionary of European National Groups |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NwvoM-ZFoAgC |date=2000 |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |location= |page=776 |isbn=0313309841 |quote=Romance (Latin) nations...

The Elymian tribes have been speculated to be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European people]] who migrated to Sicily from either [[Central Anatolia Region|Central Anatolia]], the [[Mediterranean Region, Turkey|Mediterranean-Anatolian Coastal-Basin]], [[Liguria]] ([[Cinque Terre|Cinque Terre Coast]]), or one of the [[Aegean Islands]], or perhaps were a collection of native migratory maritime-based tribes from all previously mentioned regions. When the Elymians migrated to Sicily is unknown, however [[Hellenic historiography|scholars of antiquity]] considered them to be the second oldest inhabitants, while the Sicanians, thought to be the oldest inhabitants of Sicily by scholars of antiquity, were speculated to also be a [[Mediterranean race|pre-Indo-European tribe]], who migrated via boat from the [[J\u00facar|X\u00faquer river]] basin in [[Province of Castell\u00f3n|Castell\u00f3n]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]], [[Province of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Province of Alicante|Alicante]].   \n\nAll three tribes lived both a [[sedentary]] [[pastoral farming]] and [[Orchard|orchard farming]] lifestyle, and a [[semi-nomadic]] [[fishing]] and [[mixed farming]] lifestyle. The river [[Salso|Salsu]] was the territorial boundary between the Sicels and Sicanians. They wore basic [[Clothing in the ancient world|clothing]] made of wool, [[Fiber crop|plant fibre]], [[papyrus]], [[esparto grass]], animal skins, [[Arecaceae|palm leaves]], leather and fur, and created tools and weapons using [[Forging|metal forging]] and [[pottery]]. They typically lived in a [[nuclear family]] unit, with some [[Extended family|extended]] family members as well, usually within a [[Trullo|drystone hut]], a [[neolithic long house]] or a simple [[hut]] made of mud, stones, wood, palm leaves or grass. Their main methods of transportation were horseback, donkeys and [[chariots]]. Evidence of pet [[wildcats]], [[Cirneco dell'Etna|cirneco dogs]] and [[List of wooden toys|children toys]] have been discovered in archaeological digs, especially in [[Necropolis of Pantalica|cemetery tombs]]. Their diet was a typical [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean diet]], including unique food varieties such as [[Gaglioppo]], [[Acitana]] and [[Diamante citron]], while in modern times the [['Nduja|Calabrian Salami]], which is also produced in Sicily, and sometimes used to make [['Nduja|spicy 'Nduja spreadable paste/sauce]], is a popular type of salami sold in [[Brazil]] and the [[Anglosphere]]. The Sicelian polytheistic worship of the ancient and native [[chthonic]], [[animism|animistic]]-cult deities associated with [[geysers]] known as the [[Palici]], and of the volcano-fire god by the name of [[Adranus|Adranos]], were also worshipped throughout Sicily by the Elymians and Sicanians. The Elymians inhabited the western parts of Sicily, while the Sicanians inhabitated the central parts, and the Sicels inhabitated the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] parts.  [[File:Sicilia arcaica.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|Map of early settlements of Sicily]]\n\n===Ancient history===\n{{See also|Magna Graecia|Ancient Carthage|Phoenicia}}\nFrom the 11th century BC, [[Phoenicians]] began to settle in western Sicily, having already started colonies on the nearby parts of [[maghreb|North Africa]] and [[Malta]]. Sicily was later colonized and heavily settled by [[Greeks]], beginning in the 8th century BC. Initially, this was restricted to the [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] and southern parts of the island. As the [[Greek colonisation|Greek]] and [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenician]] communities grew more populous and more powerful, the Sicels and Sicanians were pushed further into the centre of the island. The independent [[Tyre, Lebanon|Phoenician]] colonial settlements were eventually absorbed by Carthage during the 6th Century BC. By the 3rd century BC, [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was the most populous [[City-state|Greek city state]] in the world. [[Political_history_of_the_world#Ancient_history|Sicilian politics]] was intertwined with politics in [[Ancient Greece|Greece]] itself, leading [[Classical Athens|Athens]], for example, to mount the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] in 415-413 BC during the [[Peloponnesian War]], which ended up severely affecting a defeated Athens, both politically and economically, in the following years to come. The constant warfare between [[Ancient Carthage]] and the [[Magna Graecia|Greek city-states]] eventually opened the door to an emerging [[Roman Republic|third power]]. In the 3rd century BC the [[Messina|Messanan Crisis]], caused by [[Mamertines|Mamertine]] [[mercenaries]] from [[Campania]], when the city-states of [[Messina]] ([[Punics|Carthaginian-owned]]) and [[Syracuse,Sicily|Syracuse]] ([[Dorians|Dorian-owned]]) were being constantly raided and pillaged by [[Mamertines]], during the period (282-240 BC) when Central (including Western) and Northeast Sicily were put under Carthaginian rule, motivated the intervention of the [[Roman Republic]] into Sicilian affairs, and led to the [[First Punic War]] between [[Rome]] and [[Carthage]]. By the end of the [[First Punic War|war]] in 242 BC, and with the death of [[Hiero II]], all of Sicily except Syracuse was in Roman hands, becoming Rome's first province outside of the Italian peninsula. For the next 600 years, Sicily would be [[Sicilia (Roman province)|a province]] of the Roman Republic and later [[Roman Empire|Empire]]. Prior to Roman rule, there were three native [[Elymian]] towns by the names of [[Segesta]], [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]] and [[Entella]], as well as several [[Sicels|Siculian]] towns called [[Agira|Agyrion]], [[Enna]] and [[Necropolis of Pantalica|Pantalica]]. \n\nSometime after Carthage conquered most of Sicily except for the Southeast which was still controlled by Syracuse, [[Pyrrhus of Epirus#Ruler of Sicily|Pyrrhus of Epirus]], the [[Molossians|Molossian]] king of [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], was installed as King/Tyrant of Sicily from 278-275 BC, even capturing the native [[Elymians|Elymian]] mountain-city of [[Eryx]], which was previously under Carthaginian fortification & protection before he captured it. Pyrrhus even attempted to capture [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]] ([[Siege of Lilybaeum]]) from the [[Punics]], which didn't succeed. A couple years later (275 BC), Envoys from [[South Italy|Southern Italy]] had notified him that of all the [[Magna Graecia|Greek cities]] in Italy, only Tarentum hadn't fallen to the Romans. Upon hearing this, coinciding with the fact that the Sicilian city-states had started becoming hostile towards him, due to him trying to force Sicily into becoming a [[Martial law|martial state]], Pyrrhus made his decision to depart from the island and dethrone himself, leaving Syracuse and Carthage in charge of the island again. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\" While his army was being transported by ship to mainland Italy, Pyrrhus' navy was destroyed by the Carthaginians at the [[Battle of the Strait of Messina]], with 98 warships sunk or disabled out of 110. After Pyrrhus of Epirus landed on Mainland Italy, his Roman opponents had mastered up a large army under [[Roman consul]] [[Manius Curius Dentatus]], while he was still Tyrant of Sicily. After Pyrrhus was defeated at the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)]] by the Romans, he decided to end his campaigns against Southern Italy, and return to [[Epirus (ancient state)|Epirus]], resulting in the loss of all his territorial gains in Italy. The city of Tarentum however still remained under Epirote control. \n\nThe ancient historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] who wrote and recorded the monumental works of manuscripts about [[universal history|universal world/human history]] called [[Bibliotheca historica]], and the ancient [[Doric Greek|Doric-Greek]] revolutionary scientist, inventor and mathematician [[Archimedes]] who anticipated modern [[calculus]], and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] by applying methods of [[infinitesimal|infinitesimals]] and [[Method of exhaustion|exhaustion]] to rigorously derive and prove the range of [[geometry|geometric]] [[theorems]], and invented the innovative [[Archimedes' screw|Archimedean screw]], [[Block and tackle|compound pulleys]], and defensive war machines to protect his native town of Syracuse from invasions, were both born, grew up in, lived and died in Sicily.\n\n===Middle ages===\nAs the Roman Empire was falling apart, a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] tribe known as the [[Vandals]], and an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] tribe known as the [[Alans]] took over Sicily in 468 AD (after [[Battle of Carthage (439)|taking]] Carthage in 439 they tried several times but failed to take the  island) under the rule of their king [[Geiseric]] ([[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alanian Kingdom]]). The Vandals & Alans gained a monopoly on the Mediterranean grain trade during their monarchical reign, with all grain taxes being monitored by them. Due to the [[Western Roman Empire]] being too preoccupied with war in [[Gaul]], when the Vandals & Alans started [[Invasion|invading]] Sicily in 440, the Romans could not respond. Eastern Roman Emperor [[Theodosius II]] sent a failed expeditionary force to deal with them in 441, which ended in a Vandal-Alan counter-victory. However, they soon lost these newly acquired possessions, except for one toehold in [[Marsala|Lilybaeum]], to [[Odoacer]] (an [[Arianism|Arian Christian]] [[Barbarian]] statesman & general of possible [[East Germanic languages|East Germanic]] & [[Huns|Hunnic]] descent, and [[Patronage in ancient Rome|client king]] under [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] whose [[King of Italy|reign over Italy]] marked the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire|Fall of the Western Roman Empire]]) in 476 and completely to the [[Ostrogothic]] conquest of Sicily by [[Theodoric the Great]] which began in 488; although the [[Goths]] were [[Germanic]], Theodoric sought to revive [[Roman people|Roman]] culture and government and allowed freedom of religion. In contrast to the prior Carthaginian, Syracusan (Dorian) and Roman Empires which ruled Sicily in the past, Sicily did not serve as a distinct province or administrative region under Germanic control, although it did retain a certain amount of autonomy. The [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|Gothic War]] took place between the [[Ostrogoths]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] (with its capital-city based at [[Constantinople]], modern [[Istanbul]]), and during the reign of [[Justinian I]], Sicily was brought back under [[Greco-Roman_world|Greco-Roman rule]] under the military expeditions of Byzantine generals [[Belisarius|Flavius Belisarius]] and [[Narses]], resulting in [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine-Greek language]] and [[Greek Orthodox Church|religion]] being embraced by the majority of the population. It was Syracuse where the Byzantine Emperor [[Constans II]] desired to move his capital in 663 AD, a decision which eventually led to his assassination. Sicily remained under [[Autonomous province|autonomous]] stable [[Constantinople|Byzantine rule]] as the [[Sicily (theme)|Theme/Province of Sicily]] ([[Theme (Byzantine district)]] for several peaceful centuries, until an invasion by [[Arab]] [[Muslims]] ([[Aghlabids]] from the [[Banu Tamim|Banu Tamim Clan]]) in the 9th century. \n\nBesides Sicily, the Theme or Province of Sicily also included the adjacent region of [[Calabria]] in Mainland Italy. The capital city of Byzantine Sicily was Syracuse. The province was looked after by the imperial governor known as a [[Praetor]], and was militarily protected under a general by the title of [[Dux]]. Sicily itself was divided into many districts known as a [[Turma]]. The Byzantine [[Exarchate of Ravenna|Exarch of Ravennan Italy]] named [[Theophylact (exarch)|Theophylact]], between 702-709, originally came from Sicily. The garrison of [[Ravenna]] tried to kill him in 701, for reasons unknown. He also marched to Rome in 701 shortly after his promotion in the Exarchate for unknown reasons, which angered the Romans and local soldiers living there, however he was able to speak to the [[Pope John VI|Pope]], who calmed the Romans down. While Theophylact was still Exarch, Byzantine Emperor [[Justinian II]] seized all the leading citizens and officials of Ravenna at a local banquet, and dragged them abroad a ship to Constantinople. He sentenced many of them to death, while sparing some. This was due to a recent rebellion which [[Ravenna]] took part in, in 695. Justinian II later sacked Ravenna, weakening the Exarchate in charge of it. Theophylact was not a victim of the catastrophe, but was the first Exarch to experience a weakened Ravenna. Theophylact possibly moved back to Sicily after he retired from the Exarchate in 709. Theophylact might have also been the [[Strategos]] of Sicily from 700-710. The Strategos of Sicily was also able to exercise some control over the autonomous duchies of [[Duchy of Naples|Naples]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], depending on the local political situation or faction at the time.\n\nThe [[Aghlabid]] invasions were in part caused by the Byzantine-Sicilian military commander [[Euphemius (Sicily)|Euphemius]], who invited the Aghlabids to aid him in his rebellion against the imperial governor of Sicily in 826 AD, specifically the request was made to the third Aghlabird [[Emir]] [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya|Ziyadat Allah I]] of [[Ifriqiya]], in return for a place as a general and safe refuge; a Muslim army was sent.<ref name=\"stan\"/> He agreed to conquer Sicily, promising to give it back to Euphemius in exchange for a yearly tribute, and entrusted its conquest to the 70-year-old qadi [[Asad ibn al-Furat]]. The Muslim force counted 10,000 infantry, 700 cavalry and 100 ships, reinforced by Euphemius' ships and, after the landing at [[Mazara del Vallo]]. The first battle against the loyal Byzantine troops occurred on July 15, 827, near Mazara, resulting in an [[Aghlabid]] victory. A similar situation happened a century prior, when the imperial governor of Sicily (Sergios), had declared a Byzantine official from [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] by the name of [[Basil Onomagoulos]] ([[regnal name]] [[Tiberius (praenomen)|Tiberius]]) as rival emperor, when false news reached Sicily that Constantinople had fallen to the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]]. When [[Leo III the Isaurian|Emperor Leo the Syrian]] sent an [[Chartoularios|administrative official]] named [[Paul (exarch)|Paul]] to Sicily, the people and army of Syracuse surrendered Basil and his rebels up to him, leading to the beheading of Basil, while the former governor Sergios was able to escape to [[Kingdom of the Lombards|the parts of Mainland Italy controlled by the Lombards]]. \n\nAnother rebellion took place between the years 781-793, when the aristocratic governor of Sicily, [[Elpidius (rebel)|Elpidius]], was accused of conspiring against [[Irene of Athens|Empress Irene]] in favour of [[Nikephoros (Caesar)|Nikephoros]]. After Elpidius's forces were militarily defeated by Empress Irene's large fleet dispatched in Sicily, he, along with his lieutenant, the [[dux]] of [[Calabria]] named Nikephoros, defected to the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], where he was humorously acknowledged as rival emperor. After losing another military expedition, this time against [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] with the help of the Abbasids, he advised the [[Banu Abbas|Abbasid]] [[Emir]] of [[Upper Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], [[Abd al-Malik ibn Salih]], to \"throw away his silk and put on his armour\", warning him against the aggressive new reign of [[Nikephoros I]]. [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|The Muslim conquest]] was a see-saw affair; the local population resisted fiercely and the [[Aghlabids|Arabs]] suffered considerable dissension and infighting among themselves during this process. Not until 965 was the island's conquest successfully completed by the [[Fatimid Caliphate]], with Syracuse in particular resisting almost to the end ([[Siege of Syracuse (877-878)]]). Before 965, there still remained some fortified towns under Roman-Byzantine protection. During the [[Emirate of Sicily]]'s reign, substantial settlements were established in various regions of Sicily by [[Arab-Berbers]]. Their capital was based at [[Palermo|Bal'harm]]. \n\nThe first phase of [[Muslim]] rule began with the conquests of the third Aghlabid [[Emir]] [[Ziyadat Allah I of Ifriqiya]], and consolidated with the reign of the ninth Emir [[Ibrahim II of Ifriqiya]] after the conquest of [[Taormina]]. The first attempt to [[Siege of Syracuse (827-828)|capture Syracuse]] was under general [[Asad ibn al-Furat]], although it ended in a Byzantine victory. A strong combination of [[Ifriqiya|Ifriqiyan]] and [[Andalusia|Andalusian]] troops helped to capture the Island between 830-831. After a revolt was suppressed, the Fatimid Caliph [[Al-Mansur Billah]] appointed a member of the [[Kalbids|Kalbid]] dynasty, [[Al-Hasan ibn Ali al-Kalbi]], as First Emir of Sicily. The Kalbids ruled Sicily from 948 to 1053. [[Al-Mu'izz ibn Badis]], fourth ruler of the [[Zirid dynasty|Zirid]] [[Sanhaja]] dynasty in North Africa, attempted to annex the island for the Zirids, but his attempts failed. The new Arab-Berber rulers initiated revolutionary [[Arab Agricultural Revolution|land reforms]], which in turn increased productivity and encouraged the growth of smallholdings, a dent to the dominance of the landed estates. The Arabs further improved irrigation systems through [[Qanats]], introducing oranges, lemons, pistachio and sugarcane to Sicily. [[Ibn Hawqal]], a [[Baghdad|Baghdadi]] [[merchant]] who visited Sicily in 950, commented that a walled suburb called the Kasr (the palace) was the center of Palermo, with the great Friday mosque on the site of the later Roman Catholic cathedral. The suburb of Al-Khalisa (Kalsa) contained the Sultan's palace, baths, a mosque, government offices, and a private prison. Ibn Hawqual reckoned there were 7,000 individual butchers trading in 150 shops. By 1050, Palermo had a population of 350,000, making it one of the largest cities in Europe, behind Islamic-Spain's capital C\u00f3rdoba and the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, which had populations over 450-500,000. Palermo's population dropped to 150,000 under Norman rule. By 1330 Palermo's population had declined to 51,000, possibly due to the inhabitants of the region being deported to other regions of [[County of Sicily|Norman Sicily]] or to the Norman [[County of Apulia and Calabria]]. The Arab traveler [[Ibn Jubayr]] from [[Al-Andalus]] stated that the buildings built during this period were made of [[limestone]]. The latinized Catholic Sicilians in Western Sicily still continued to revolt until Norman rule, and the [[Medieval Greek|Greek]]-speaking Byzantine [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]-[[Catholicism|Catholic]] Sicilians in the East almost secured their independence several times during their revolts. Christians and Jews were tolerated in Muslim Sicily as [[dhimmi|dhimmis]], and had to pay the [[Jizya]] poll tax, and [[Kharaj]] land tax, but were exempt from the [[Zakat]] alms-giving tax Muslims had to pay. Many Jews immigrated to Sicily during Muslim rule, but left after the Normans arrived. \n\n[[File:Sicilian types and costumes.jpg|thumb|200px|Sicilians in traditional dress]] \nIn the 11th century, the mainland southern Italian powers were hiring [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|Norman mercenaries]], who were Christian descendants of the [[Vikings]]; it was the [[Normans]] under [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger I]] (of the [[Hauteville dynasty]]) who conquered Sicily from the Muslims [[Battle of Cerami|over a period of thirty years]] until finally controlling the entire island by 1091 as the [[County of Sicily]]. In 1130, [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]] founded the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] as an independent state with its own [[Sicilian Parliament|Parliament]], language, [[schooling]], army and currency, while the Sicilian culture evolved distinct traditions, clothing, linguistic changes, [[Sicilian cuisine|cuisine]] and customs not found in mainland [[Italy]].<ref>James Minahan, ''Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups Around the World A-Z'', 2002 p.1714.</ref> A great number of mainland [[County of Apulia and Calabria|Southern Italian]] and [[Italo-Normans|Norman]] families began settling in Sicily during this time.\n\nThe Siculo-Norman rule of the [[Hauteville dynasty]] continued until 1198, when [[Frederick I of Sicily]], the son of a [[Siculo-Norman]] queen and a [[Hohenstaufen dynasty|Swabian-German]] emperor ascended the throne. In fact it was during the reign of this Hohenstaufen ([[Swabians|Swabian-German]]) king [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], that the poetic form known as a [[sonnet]] was invented by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], the head Poet, Teacher and [[Notary]] of the [[Sicilian School|Sicilian School for Poetry]]. His (Frederick I) descendants governed Sicily until the [[Papal States|Papacy]] invited a [[Capetian dynasty|French]] prince to take the throne, which led to a decade-and-a-half of French rule under [[Charles I of Sicily]]; he was later deposed in the [[War of the Sicilian Vespers]] against French rule, which put the daughter of [[Manfred of Sicily]] - [[Constance of Sicily, Queen of Aragon|Constance II]] and her husband [[Peter III of Aragon]], a member of the [[House of Barcelona]], on the throne. Their [[House of Barcelona|descendants]] ruled the Kingdom of Sicily until 1401. Following the [[Compromise of Caspe]] in 1412 the Sicilian throne passed to the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] monarchs from [[Crown of Aragon|Aragon]] and [[Crown of Castile|Castile]]. [[Frederick of Castile]] had participated in the services of the last Hohenstaufen King [[Manfred, King of Sicily|Manfred of Sicily]] at the [[Battle of Benevento]] against the French [[House of Capet|Capetians]] and the [[Papal States|Papacy]] in 26 February 1266. ([[Guelphs and Ghibellines]])\n\nFrom 1194, the Holy Roman Emperor and member of the Hohenstaufen dynasty [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry VI]] became King of Sicily via his marriage to [[Constance, Queen of Sicily]], daughter of [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]]. Because Henry was stuck in the Hohenstaufen conflict with the [[House of Welf]], he had to enforce the inheritance claims by his wife against her nephew Count [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]]. Henry's attempt to conquer the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] failed at the [[Siege of Naples (1191)|siege of Naples in 1191]] due to an epidemic, and following his retreat Empress Constance was captured. Based on an enormous ransom for the release of [[Richard I of England|King Richard I of England]], he conquered Sicily in 1194; however, the intended unification with the [[Holy Roman Empire]] ultimately failed due to the opposition of the [[Papacy]]. In February 1194, [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred of Lecce]] died, leaving as heir a young boy, [[William III of Sicily|William III]], under the tutelage of his mother [[Sibylla of Acerra]], sister of [[Richard, Count of Acerra]]. In May Emperor Henry, based on King Richard's ransom, again set out for Italy. He reached Milan at Pentecost and occupied Naples in August. He met little resistance and on 20 November 1194 entered Palermo capital of Kingdom of Sicily and was crowned king on 25 December. On the next day his wife Constance, who had stayed back in Iesi, gave birth to his only son and heir Frederick II, the future emperor and king of Sicily and Jerusalem. The young William and his mother Sibylla had fled to [[Caltabellotta]] Castle; he officially renounced the Sicilian kingdom in turn for the [[County of Lecce]] and the [[Principality of Capua]]. A few days after Henry's coronation, however, the royal family and several Norman nobles were accused of a coup attempt and arrested. Henry is said to have had William blinded and castrated. Some, however, like the Siculo-Greek [[Eugenius of Palermo|Eugene of Palermo]], transitioned into the new Hohenstaufen government with ease. William was probably deported to the Altems ([[Hohenems]]) Castle in [[Swabia]], where he died in captivity about 1198. To take revenge for the capture of his wife, Henry hanged [[Richard, Count of Acerra]] brother of [[Sibylla of Acerra|Sibylla]] in 1196. Henry placed further [[Ministerialis|ministeriales]] in the Sicilian administration, like the [[Troia, Apulia|Troian]] bishop [[Walter of Palearia]] who became chancellor. His loyal henchman Markward von Annweiler was appointed a Duke of [[Ravenna]], placing him in a highly strategic position to control the route to Sicily via the Italian [[Romagna]] region and the [[Apennine Mountains|Apennines]]. \n\nDuring the reign of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], there was a [[Muslim settlement of Lucera|massive deportation and resettlement]] of 20,000 [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Sicilian Muslims]] to [[Lucera]], a planned settlement in [[Province of Foggia|Foggia]], [[Apulia]]. The settlement thrived for about 75 years. In 1300, it was sacked by the Christian forces of [[Charles II of Naples]] and its Muslim inhabitants were exiled or sold into slavery.<ref name=\"Taylor\"/> The Sicilian territories inherited by Frederick II from his mother Constance of Sicily carried with them not only authority over the Roman Catholic majority of the island, but also over significant numbers of [[Greeks]], [[Jews]] and [[Muslims]]. The Muslims of the 'regno' were a heterogeneous community, that included Arabs (concentrated particularly in the triangle made by [[Mazara del Vallo]]-[[Monreale]]-[[Corleone]]), Berbers (settled mostly in [[Agrigento]] and in its province), small groups of [[Persians]] (amongst them, in particular, the [[Khwarazm|Khwarizmi]] community of Palermo), and a sizable number of local people who had converted to Islam during the Muslim rule in Sicily. Frederick\u2019s accession to the throne did not bring social and religious peace to Sicily. The terrain of the island favoured in fact the resistance action of groups of Muslims, hoping to restore the dominion of Islam in what in Arabic had initially been called Al-ard al-Kabira, the \"Great Land\", and then, simply, Siqilliyya.\n\nSome Muslim groups had found bases for resistance in central and western Sicily, around [[San Giuseppe Jato|Iato]] and [[Entella]]. In Entella the resistance was led by a Muslim woman recorded in the contemporary Christian chronicles as the \u201c[[Virago]] of Entella\u201d. As a consequence, after most of the affluent and powerful Muslims had returned to North Africa, in 1220 Frederick II determined to expel the remaining Muslims from Sicily, or at least the less docile groups amongst them, who constituted the essential remaining leadership of the Muslim community, the notables, the scholars and the warriors with their families, and resettle them in the [[South Italy|southern Italian mainland]].\n\nThe localities of Lucera (in Apulia, dating from 1224), Girofalco (now [[Girifalco]], in [[Calabria]]) and [[Acerenza]] (in [[Lucania]]) were chosen for the resettlement. Smaller groups of Sicilian Muslims were also deported to the localities of [[Stornara]], Casal Monte Saraceno and Castel Saraceno as well as to [[Campania]].\n\nThe total population of these Muslim communities has been estimated by most modern scholars at around 60,000 individuals, judging from the community's ability to supply the Kings of Sicily a theoretical military contingent of around 14\u201315,000 men strong, of which 7\u201310,000, as reported by contemporary sources, were effectively employable on the battlefield at Cortenuova. These troops, most of them lightly armed archers and many also trained in the use of the sling, constituted the faithful personal bodyguard of the Hohenstaufens, since they had no connection to the political rivals of the \"House of Swabia\" and were ready to wage war\u2014ferociously even for the contemporary standards\u2014on the local populations, and depended entirely on their sovereign.\n\nIn 1239 the Emperor Frederick II ordered the concentration of the [[Saracen]] communities in Lucera and Apulia, a command that was substantially enforced. By 1240 the resettlements had taken place, with 20,000 Muslims settled in Lucera, 30,000 in other nearby parts of Apulia and the remaining 10,000 who would have been placed in communities outside Apulia. In this controlled environment, they could not challenge royal authority and still benefited the crown with taxes and military service.\n\nAfter [[Charles I of Sicily]]'s wife \"Beatrice of Provence\", had passed away in July 1267, the widowed Charles married [[Margaret of Burgundy, Queen of Sicily|Margaret of Nevers]] in November 1268, whose father [[Odo, Count of Nevers]], died two years prior at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] (a city now acting as the holiest city of the [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith]]) within the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. {{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=182}}. When Pope Clement died on the 29th of November 1268 {{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=118}}, the [[Papal States|Papal vacancy]] lasted three years, strengthening Charles' authority in Southern Italy, but also deprived him of the ecclesiastic support that only a pope could provide. {{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=119}}{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=136}} Charles had sent [[Guy de Montfort, Count of Nola]] and his forces to Sicily in order to force the anti-French rebels into submission, but they could only capture [[Augusta, Sicily|Augusta]]. {{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=124}} Charles placed his commander by the name of \"William l'Estandart\" in charge of the Sicilian Army in August 1269. {{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=124}} L'Estandart managed to capture [[Agrigento]], forcing [[Frederick of Castile]] and Frederick Lancia into to seek refuge in [[Tunis]]. {{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=124}} After L'Estandart's subsequent victory at [[Sciacca]], only Capece resisted, but he also had to surrender in early 1270.{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=124}} [[Louis IX of France]] obsessed with the liberation of Jerusalem, decided to begin his new crusade with a military campaign against Tunis.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=196}}{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=183}} According to his confessor, [[Geoffrey of Beaulieu]], Louis was convinced that al-Mustansir of Tunis was ready to convert to Christianity.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=196}} The 13th-century Italian historian, and Guelph chronicler \"Saba Malaspina\" stated that Charles persuaded Louis to attack Tunis, because he wanted to secure the payment of the tribute that the rulers of Tunis had paid to the former Sicilian monarchs.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=195}}\n\nCharles and Philip departed Tunis on 10{{nbs}}November.{{sfn|Lock|2006|p=183}} A storm dispersed their fleet at [[Trapani]] and most of Charles' galleys were lost or damaged.{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=143}} Genoese ships returning from the crusade were also sunk or forced to land in Sicily.{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=150}} Charles seized the damaged ships and their cargo, ignoring all protests from the Ghibelline authorities of Genoa.{{sfn|Runciman|1958|p=150}} Before leaving Sicily he granted temporary tax concessions to the Sicilians, because he realised that the conquest of the island had caused much destruction.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=106}} Charles took out enforced loans whenever he needed \"immediately a large sum of money for certain arduous and pressing business\", as he explained in one of his decrees.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=104}}\n\n[[Purveyance]]s, the requisitioning of goods, increased the unpopularity of Charles' government in the ''Regno''.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=104}} His subjects were forced to guard prisoners or lodge soldiers in their homes.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=104}} The restoration of old fortresses, bridges and aqueducts and the building of new castles required the employment of craftsmen, although most of them were unwilling to participate in such lengthy projects.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=161}} Thousands of people were forced to serve in the army in foreign lands, especially after 1279.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=104}}{{sfn|Abulafia|2000|p=109}} Trading in salt was declared a royal monopoly.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=157}} In December 1281, Charles again ordered the collection of the ''subventio generalis'', requiring the payment of 150% of the customary amount.{{sfn|Dunbabin|1998|p=102}}.

In 1735, the Spanish era ended when [[Charles V of Sicily|Charles V]] from the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|House of Bourbon]] was crowned king. For the better part of the next century-and-a-half, Sicily was in [[personal union]] with the other Southern Italian [[Kingdom of Naples]], with the official residence located in [[Naples]], under the [[House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies|Bourbon dynasty]]. In 1861, however, Sicily became part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] as a result of the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento]]. After the unification of Italy and the [[Fascism|Fascist era]], a wave of [[Sicilian nationalism]] led to the adoption of the [[Statute of Sicily]], under which the island has become an [[autonomous region]]. Since 1946, the island enjoys the most advanced special status of all the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]]s, which allows the Sicilian residents to keep 100% of the revenue from all the taxes, without giving back any to the central government in [[Rome]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Historical populations\n|type=\n|align=right\n|widths=50px \n|heights=50px\n|footnote=Source: [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] 2017\n|1861|2409000\n|1871|2590000\n|1881|2933000\n|1901|3568000\n|1911|3812000\n|1921|4223000\n|1931|3906000\n|1936|4000000\n|1951|4487000\n|1961|4721000\n|1971|4681000\n|1981|4907000\n|1991|4966000\n|2001|4969000\n|2011|5002904\n|2017|5029615\n}}\n\n[[File:Palermo panorama.JPG|thumb|The city of [[Palermo]] in 2005]]\nSicily has experienced the presence of a number of different cultures and ethnicities in its vast history, including the original [[Italic peoples]] ([[Sicani]], [[Siculi]] and [[Elymians]], although the language families which each of these three peoples spoke has still not been deciphered by academia or linguistic historians/scholars), [[List of Phoenician cities|Phoenicians]] ([[Phoenicia]]) and [[Punics|Carthaginians]] ([[Ancient Carthage]]), [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]] and [[Pontic Greeks]] ([[Magna Graecia]]), [[Bruttians]], [[Lucanians]], [[Mamertines]], [[Iberians]], [[Cyprus|Cypriots]], [[Colchis|Colchians]] (Proto-[[Georgians]]), [[Anatolian peoples|Anatolians]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Assyria|Assyrians]], [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamians]], [[Nabataeans]], [[Numidians]], [[Tribe of Judah|Judeans]] & [[Tribe of Dan|Danites]], [[Eurasian nomads]] ([[Scythia]]), [[Illyrians]], [[Ligures]], [[Gauls]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and [[Byzantine Greeks]] during the [[ancient history|ancient]] and [[classical antiquity|classical periods]]. \n\nFrom the medieval and modern eras, Sicily experienced [[Human migration|migratory]] waves of [[Vandals]] and [[Alans]] (During [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandal-Alan]] rule), while under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Emirate of Sicily|Saracen]] and [[Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] rules, there were considerable numbers of [[Arabs]], [[Berbers]], [[Hebrews]], [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Tarabin Bedouin|Tarabin Bedouins]], [[Peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasians]], [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Nubians]], [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]], [[Turkic peoples|Turks]], [[Tatars]], [[Vikings]], [[Mongols]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Normans]], [[Swabians]], [[Austria-Hungary|Austrians and Hungarians]], [[Lombards]] and [[Italians]], [[Crown of Aragon|Aragonese]], [[Spaniards]], [[Sardinians]], [[Basques]], [[Romanians]], [[French people|French]], [[British people|British]] and [[Albanians|Albanian]] people settling in Sicily for various reasons, such as to escape [[persecution]], to establish merchant communities or to find better land for cultivation.\n\nAbout five million people live in Sicily, making it the [[List of regions of Italy#List of regions|fourth most populated region in Italy]].

However the use of [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] is limited to informal contexts (mostly in family).\n\nSicilian was an early influence in the development of standard Italian, although its use remained confined to an intellectual elite. This was a literary language in Sicily created under the auspices of [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and his court of notaries or ''Magna Curia'' which, headed by [[Giacomo da Lentini]], also gave birth to the [[Sicilian School]], widely inspired by troubadour literature. It is in this language that appeared the first [[sonnet]], whose invention is attributed to Giacomo da Lentini himself. Sicilian was also the official language of the Kingdom of Sicily from 1300 to 1543. Prior to the 20th century, large numbers of Sicilian people spoke only Sicilian as their mother tongue, with little or no fluent knowledge of [[Italian language|Italian]].

Forms of Siculish are also to be found in other Sicilian immigrant communities of [[Anglosphere|English-speaking countries]], namely Canada and Australia.  A surprising similarity can often be found between these forms, through either coincidence, trans-national movements of Sicilian immigrants, or more likely, through the logical adaptation of [[English language|English]] using linguistic norms from the Sicilian language.\n\n====Ethno-linguistic minorities====\nThere are two main historical [[Ethnolinguistics|ethno-linguistic]] minorities in Sicily, the [[Lombards of Sicily]] and the [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb]].\n* The [[Lombards of Sicily]] are a linguistic minority living in Sicily who speak an isolated variety of Gallo-Italic dialects, the so-called [[Gallo-Italic of Sicily]].

The Lombards of Sicily, who originally hailed from Northern Italy, settled the central and [[Eastern Sicily|eastern]] part of Sicily about 900 years ago, during the [[Norman conquest of Sicily]]. Because of linguistic differences among the Gallo-Italic dialects of Sicily, it is supposed that there were different immigration routes. From [[Piedmont]], [[Liguria]], [[Emilia-Romagna|Emilia]], and [[Lombardy]] they began to spread south between the 11th and 14th centuries. The most important areas where the Gallo-Italic of Sicily is spoken are [[Acquedolci]], [[Montalbano Elicona]], [[Novara di Sicilia]], [[Fondachelli-Fantina]] [[San Fratello]] and [[San Piero Patti]] ([[Province of Messina]]), [[Aidone]], [[Nicosia, Sicily|Nicosia]], [[Piazza Armerina]] and [[Sperlinga]] ([[Province of Enna]]).\n[[File:Tabelle italiano-albanese.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Bilingual road signs, in Italian and Arb\u00ebresh in [[Piana degli Albanesi]].]]\n* The [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]] settled in Southern Italy in the 15th to 18th centuries in several waves of migrations. They are the descendants of mostly [[Tosk Albanian]] refugees of Christian faith who fled to Italy after the Albanian conquest and subsequent Islamisation by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in the [[Balkans]]. They speak their own variant of the [[Arb\u00ebresh]] language. There are three identified Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb communities in the [[province of Palermo]], which have maintained unchanged, with different aspects together, the ethnic, linguistic and religious origins. The areas are: [[Contessa Entellina]], [[Piana degli Albanesi]] and [[Santa Cristina Gela]]; while the varieties of Piana and Santa Cristina Gela are similar enough to be entirely mutually intelligible, the variety of Contessa Entellina is not entirely intelligible. The largest centre is [[Piana degli Albanesi]] which, besides being the hub of [[Eparchy of Piana degli Albanesi|religious]] and socio-cultural communities, has guarded and defended their peculiarities intact over time. There are two other communities with a strong historical and linguistic heritage.\n\n* The community of the [[Griko people|Greeks of Messina]] (or Siculo-Greeks) speaks [[modern Greek]] with some elements of the [[Ancient Greek|ancient Greek language]] spoken in the island, and [[Calabrian Greek]]. The Greek community was reconstituted in 2003 with the name of ''\"Comunit\u00e0 Hellenica dello Stretto\"'' (Hellenic Community of the Strait).\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Icon - Main altar of Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015.JPG|180px|right|thumb|[[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]], [[Monreale Cathedral]].]]\nThe vast majority of Sicilians are [[baptism|baptized]] as [[Roman Catholic]]. The Catholic religion represents one of the most important elements of the Sicilian identity. The [[Hodegetria|Virgin Hodegetria]] is the patroness of Sicily. The Sicilian people are also known for their deep devotion to some Sicilian female saints: the martyrs [[Agatha of Sicily|Agatha]] and [[Saint Lucy|Lucy]], respectively patroness of Catania and Syracuse, and the hermitess [[Saint Rosalia|Rosalia]], patroness of Palermo. The Sicilian people have significantly contributed to the history of [[Christianity]]. There were four Sicilian [[Pope|Popes]] ([[Pope Agatho|Agatho]], [[Pope Leo II|Leo II]], [[Pope Sergius I|Sergius I]], [[Pope Stephen III|Stephen III]]) and a Sicilian [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] ([[Methodios I of Constantinople|Methodios I]]).\n\n===Art and architecture===\n{{Main article|Norman-Sicilian culture|Sicilian Baroque}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main article|Sicilian cuisine}}\n\n{{Main article|List of people from Sicily|List of Sicilian Americans}}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery caption=\"Sicilian folk costumes and traditions\" mode=\"packed\" style=\"font-size:88%; line-height:130%\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:Sicilian artigiana 6.jpg|Sicilian artigiana at a presepe vivente at Santa Maria La Stella, Sicily\nFile:Women in Albanian dress.jpg|Women in Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb dress\nFile:Sicilian costume 3 1880.jpg|Boy in Sicilian costume of the 1880s\nFile:Sicilian costume 1880s.jpg|Girl wearing a costume of the 1880s period in Sicily\nFile:Reprofotografi av bild fr\u00e5n resealbum, i samband med utst\u00e4llningen Samtida venetianskt konstglas - Hallwylska museet - 87765.tif|Sicilian family, 1880s.\nFile:Ramacca 033.jpg|Sicilian band in medieval costumes\nFile:Piana-degli-Albanesi-bjs2007-03.jpg|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb in Piana degli Albanesi\nFile:Handkolorerat fotografi p\u00e5 siciliansk vagn - Hallwylska museet - 104084.tif|\nFile:Artigiano siciliano.JPG|A Sicilian artisan in Sutera\nFile:Bruno, Giuseppe (1836-1904) - n. 020 (Timbrato sul retro).jpg|Two peasants wearing a Sicilian costume, 1880s\nFile:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - n. 0024 - Pescatore catanese.jpg|Fisherman from Catania, 1890s.\nFile:Gloeden, Wilhelm von (1856-1931) - n. 0036 - da - Sicilia mitica Arcadia - p. 61.jpg|A girl holding an amphora, Limina, 1880/1890\nFile:Catacombe dei Cappuccini Palermo.jpg|Catacombe dei Cappuccini, Palermo\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|People of Sicily}}\n*[[List of people from Sicily]]\n*[[Sicilian Americans]]\n*[[Kingdom of Sicily]]\n*[[History of Sicily]]\n*[[Sicilian language]]\n*[[Magna Graecia]]\n*[[Crown of Aragon]]\n*[[Maltese people]]\n*[[Italians]]\n*[[Griko people]]\n*[[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Sicily}}\n\n[[Category:People from Sicily| ]]\n[[Category:Romance peoples]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Sp", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicilians"}

In 2015, it was the [[Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic|fourth busiest airport]] in the United Kingdom after [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[Manchester Airport|Manchester]]. Stansted's runway is also used by private companies such as the [[Harrods Aviation]], [[Titan Airways]] and XJet terminals which are private ground handlers who are able to handle private flights, charter flights and state visits.\n\nOriginally owned and operated by [[Heathrow Airport Holdings|BAA]], since February 2013 the airport has been owned [[Manchester Airports Group]] (MAG) following a March 2009 ruling by the Competition Commission.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stansted Airport being sold to Manchester for \u00a31.5bn |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-21093783 |work=BBC News |date=19 January 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=\u00a31.5&nbsp;billion Stansted Airport sale complete |author=Sinead Holland |url=http://www.harlowstar.co.uk/News/Harlow-news/15-billion-Stansted-Airport-sale-complete-20130228174702.htm |newspaper=Harlow Star |date=28 February 2013 |accessdate=28 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nLondon Stansted Airport has one main passenger terminal, near the village of [[Stansted Mountfitchet]]. There are three passenger satellites in which the departure gates are situated; one is connected to the main terminal by an air-bridge and the other two by the [[Stansted Airport Transit System]] people mover.\n\nThe terminal building was designed by [[Foster and Partners|Foster Associates]] with input from the structural engineer [[Peter Rice]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/architecture-genius-expressed-in-nuts-and-bolts-peter-rice-is-an-engineer-revered-by-the-worlds-top-1530478.html|title=Architecture: Genius expressed in nuts and bolts: Peter Rice is an|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref>  and features a \"floating\" roof, supported by a [[space frame]] of inverted-pyramid roof trusses, creating the impression of a stylised swan in flight. The base of each truss structure is a \"utility pillar\", which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, go through security and on to the departure gates all on the same level.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Stansted saw rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24&nbsp;million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years to 2012. Passenger totals later increased, and in 2016 recorded an annual increase of 8.0% to 24.3&nbsp;million and numbers have since continued to rise.<ref name=\"stats\"/>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Before Stansted Airport aa.jpg|thumb|300px|Where Stansted Airport is now, as about 1935]]\n[[File:B-26-stanst.jpg|thumb|A [[Martin B-26 Marauder]] of the 344th Bomb Group at Stansted, 1944.]]\n[[File:Avro 685 York XF919.G-AMUS Air Charter STA 10.4.55 edited-2.jpg|thumb|[[Avro York]] of the based [[Air Charter Limited|Air Charter Ltd]] taking off on a trooping flight in 1955 with wartime hangars in the background]]\n===Second World War===\n{{Main article|RAF Stansted Mountfitchet}}\n\nThe airfield opened in 1943 and was used during the Second World War as [[RAF Stansted Mountfitchet]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[United States Army Air Forces]] as a bomber airfield and as a major maintenance depot. Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.\n\nThe station was first allocated to the [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] in August 1942 as a heavy bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an [[Air Materiel Command#Air Technical Services Command|Air Technical Services Command]] (ATSC) maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.\n\n===Post-war use===\nAfter the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the [[Air Ministry]] and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services (LAMS), equipped with ex-RAF [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70-1\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to [[NATO]]. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under [[BAA Limited|BAA]] control in 1966.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s the Fire Service Training School (FSTS) was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields as well as those of many overseas countries.\n\n===Commercial operations===\n[[File:London Stansted Airport main entrance.jpg|thumb|The Terminal building at night]]\n[[File:London Stansted Airport - Baggage reclaim.jpg|thumb|The Arrivals hall in the Terminal building, which was extended in 2008.]]\nBeginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.\n[[File:London Stansted Airport Air View.jpg|thumb|View of Stansted from the air.]]\n\nStansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford In 1966-67 the Government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the \"[[Roskill Commission]]\") of 1968-71 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that [[Cublington]] in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London's third airport.<ref>Roskill (1971). ''Report, Commission on the Third London Airport''. London: HMSO.</ref> However, the Conservative Government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed. But, in 1974, the incoming Labour Government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=Inside London's Airports Policy: Indecision, decision and counter-decision|last=Le Blond|first=Paul|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763655|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nStansted was then considered as an option for long term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy (ACAP) and the Study Group on South East Airports (SGSEA) and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative Government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981-83. The Inspector's Report was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a White Paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport's capacity to 15&nbsp;million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nThe current terminal building was designed by architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]. Construction was undertaken by [[John Laing Group|John Laing]] and took place between 1988 and 1991,<ref>Ritchie, p. 173</ref> costing \u00a3100&nbsp;million.<ref>''Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA''&nbsp;\u2013 1991 (Michael Donne&nbsp;\u2013 BAA plc), p. 62-63</ref> In 1990 it was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award]]. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport, and [[Stansted Airport railway station]] opened in 1991.\n\nLong-haul scheduled services commenced in the early 1990s when [[American Airlines]] operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and [[O'Hare International Airport]], however the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news | title = American Airlines to quit Stansted: Long haul carrier scraps Chicago service |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1 April 1993 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/american-airlines-to-quit-stansted-long-haul-carrier-scraps-chicago-service-1452654.html | first=Michael | last=Harrison | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> [[Continental Airlines]] also operated services in the late 1990s from [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], but this service was stopped shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nLong-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when [[Eos Airlines]] and [[MAXjet Airways]] commenced all-business-class services from Stansted to [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|New York\u2013JFK Airport]]. In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington, D.C.]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York\u2013JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008.

Finally, in July 2008, American Airlines withdrew from the airport.\n\n===Latest developments===\nLong haul transatlantic operations made a return to Stansted in June 2010, when [[Sun Country Airlines]] announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to [[Minneapolis]]. The flights made a re-fuelling stop-over in [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a non-stop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and were then discontinued due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long haul flights. {{Cn|date=May 2017}}\n\nLong-haul services to Asia commenced in March 2009 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2009/03/09/air-asia-x-launches-flights-between-stansted-and-kl/|title=Air Asia X launches flights between Stansted and KL \u2013 Business Traveller|work=Business Traveller|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> with Malaysian low-cost airline [[AirAsia X]] providing direct flights to [[Kuala Lumpur]]; however, on 24 October 2011, this service moved to Gatwick Airport before being later withdrawn completely.\n\nA major expansion programme to the existing terminal took place between 2007 and 2009, adding nearly {{convert|5900|m2|abbr=on}} of floorspace to give space for additional baggage carousels, a new immigration and passport control hall and a [[hypostyle]] arrivals hall with improved facilities.\n\nIn November 2006, [[Uttlesford]] District Council rejected a [[BAA Limited|BAA]] planning application to increase the permitted number of aircraft movements and to remove the limit on passenger numbers. BAA immediately appealed against the decision and a public inquiry opened lasting from May until October 2007. Planning Inspector Alan Boyland made his recommendations in January 2008. {{Cn|date=May 2017}} Those recommendations were largely followed by the Secretary of State for Transport ([[Geoff Hoon]]) and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears), who jointly allowed the applicant's appeal in October 2008.

When a domestic flight arrives at a gate which is not located in Satellite 2, passengers are transported to a gate on Satellite 2 by a courtesy bus service from the aircraft.\n\n===Car parks and hotels===\n[[File:Radisson Hotel at Stansted Airport - geograph.org.uk - 321206.jpg|thumb|The [[Radisson Blu]] hotel which is just a short walk from the Terminal building.]]\nStansted has a variety of car parking including Long, Mid and Short Stay options along with Valet and Meet and Greet Parking services. There are also two drop off areas available. The express area is located near the short stay car park while a free service is within the mid stay. A fee is charged for the express service.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/transport-and-directions/pick-up-and-drop-off|title=Pick Up and Drop Off|accessdate=2 June 2015}}</ref> Terminal Road North and its free drop off area directly outside the terminal was closed shortly after MAG took over the airport in 2013. Since 2004, Stansted also offers a range of hotel accommodation including [[Holiday Inn Express]], [[Novotel]], [[Premier Inn]] and [[Radisson Blu]] hotels and the recently opened [[Hampton by Hilton]], the last two of which are both within two minutes of the Terminal building via an undercover walkway. There are regular bus service transfers between the Terminal building and Stansted's car parks and hotels.\n\n===Control tower===\n[[File:Stansted Airport - geograph.org.uk - 1761312.jpg|thumb|The Terminal Building with the adjacent Control Tower]]\nStansted's [[air traffic control tower]] was completed in 1996 and was the tallest in Britain at the time of its construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdaconsulting.co.uk/consulting/transport-and-utilities/stansted-airport-control-tower|title=Stansted Airport Control Tower&nbsp;\u2013 MDA Consulting|accessdate=29 October 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009175913/http://www.mdaconsulting.co.uk/consulting/transport-and-utilities/stansted-airport-control-tower|archivedate=9 October 2011}}</ref> It is located on the southside of the airfield alongside the main terminal building. It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.\n\n===Other infrastructure===\nThere are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] and the [[Boeing 747]]. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport. The largest are located at the south east of the airfield, one of which is used by Ryanair.\n\n[[Titan Airways]] has its head office in the Enterprise House on the airport property.<ref>\"[http://www.titan-airways.com/contact-us.html Contact Us].\" Titan Airways.

This would have been the subject of a public inquiry and, if approved, would have allowed Stansted to handle more passengers than Heathrow did at the time of the application.<ref>{{Cite news | title = \u00a32.5bn Stansted Generation 2 planning bid submitted | publisher = Transport Briefing | date = 12 March 2008 | url = http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4781 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081007053448/http://www.transportbriefing.co.uk/story.php?id=4781 | archivedate = 7 October 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2010, BAA withdrew its plans to build a second runway at Stansted and withdrew the plans to build a new runway at [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]].<ref name=\"withdraw\">BBC News: [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8701433.stm Heathrow and Stansted runway plans scrapped by BAA], 24 May 2010. Visited 20 June 2011</ref>\n\nThe ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA's 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.\n\nPrior to the United Kingdom's May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly \u00a3200&nbsp;million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.\n\nThe public inquiry into BAA's second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] to allow time for BAA and the Government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission's ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission's ruling and to sell Stansted.\n\nOn 10 February 2010, Secretary of State [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the General Election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.<ref name=\"withdraw\"/>\n\n====Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE)====\nThe [[advocacy group]] Stop Stansted Expansion (\"SSE\"), formed in 2002 as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport [[White Paper]] in December 2003.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100519093443/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/air/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; The Future of Air Transport \u2013 White Paper and the Civil Aviation Bill]. Webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref>\n\nIt still actively campaigns against what its members see as the unsustainable expansion of the airport. SSE was a major participant in the 2007 \"G1\" public inquiry and had committed to be a major participant in the anticipated inquiry into the 'G2' second runway proposal. Following the withdrawal of the G2 planning application the group called upon BAA to sell the homes it had bought to support the planned expansion.\n\nIn September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the Government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies,<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission Airports Commission]. GOV.UK. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref> to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK's status as a global aviation hub. The Commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election the Commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.\n\nThroughout 2013, the Airports Commission published discussion papers and invited submissions from key stakeholders on the main issues it wished to consider. SSE made several thorough submissions. SSE also accepted an invitation to give oral evidence and make a presentation to the Commission on aviation demand forecasting and connectivity at a public evidence session held in Manchester in July 2013.<ref>Stansted Airport Airfield Fire Services 30 March 1998 Emerald Airways HS748 engine exploded on take off whilst carrying the Leeds United football team, aircraft written off but no one injured.

MAG has invested \u00a340&nbsp;million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, a number of new shops and an Escape Lounge, however the remodelling has drawn heavy criticism due to the length of time it takes to walk through the shopping areas to get to the departure gates.\n\nSatellite One has also been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |title=Transport Secretary Launches \u00a380 Million Terminal Redevelopment |date=20 June 2013 |publisher=London Stansted Airport |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234429/http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |archivedate=21 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===New Arrivals Terminal===\nAn arrivals terminal is planned to be built at Stansted, with construction due to begin in 2018, taking three years to complete. The site will include larger immigration and baggage reclaim areas, with more shops and facilities available after arrival into the UK. The current terminal will be reconfigured to departures only, with security and check-in areas due to be expanded. The project is expected to cost \u00a3130m, and, once completed, will make London Stansted the only airport in the UK with dedicated arrivals and departures terminal buildings.<ref>{{Cite

The base of each truss structure is a \"utility pillar\", which provides indirect uplighting illumination and is the location for air-conditioning, water, telecommunications and electrical outlets. The layout of the airport was originally designed to provide an unobstructed flow for passengers to arrive at the short-stay car park, move through the check-in hall, go through security and on to the departure gates all on the same level.\n\nFrom 1997 to 2007, Stansted saw rapid expansion of passenger numbers on the back of the boom in low-cost air travel, peaking at 24&nbsp;million passengers in the 12 months to October 2007, but passenger numbers declined in the next five years to 2012.

Although the official name was Stansted Mountfitchet, the base was known as simply Stansted in both written and spoken form.\n\nThe station was first allocated to the [[USAAF]] [[Eighth Air Force]] in August 1942 as a heavy bomber airfield. As well as an operational bomber base, Stansted was also an [[Air Materiel Command#Air Technical Services Command|Air Technical Services Command]] (ATSC) maintenance and supply depot concerned with major overhauls and modification of B-26s. After D-Day, these activities were transferred to France, but the base was still used as a supply storage area for the support of aircraft on the continent.\n\n===Post-war use===\nAfter the withdrawal of the Americans on 12 August 1945, Stansted was taken over by the [[Air Ministry]] and used by No. 263 Maintenance Unit, RAF for storage purposes. In addition, between March 1946 and August 1947, Stansted was used for housing German prisoners of war.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, p. 70.</ref>\n\nIn November 1946, the recently established British cargo airline, London Aero and Motor Services (LAMS), equipped with ex-RAF [[Handley Page Halifax]]es, moved into Stansted, using it as a base for its operations until it was wound up in July 1948.<ref name=\"AIllfeb78 p70-1\">Wright ''Aircraft Illustrated'' February 1978, pp. 70\u201371.</ref>\n\nThe Ministry of Civil Aviation finally took control of Stansted in 1949 and the airport was then used as a base by several UK charter airlines. The US military returned in 1954 to extend the runway for a possible transfer to [[NATO]]. The transfer to NATO was never realised, however, and the airport continued in civil use, ending up under [[BAA Limited|BAA]] control in 1966.\n\nDuring the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s the Fire Service Training School (FSTS) was based on the eastern side of the airfield under the auspices of the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, now the Civil Aviation Authority. The school was responsible for the training of all aviation fire crews for British airfields as well as those of many overseas countries.\n\n===Commercial operations===\n[[File:London Stansted Airport main entrance.jpg|thumb|The Terminal building at night]]\n[[File:London Stansted Airport - Baggage reclaim.jpg|thumb|The Arrivals hall in the Terminal building, which was extended in 2008.]]\nBeginning in 1966, after Stansted was placed under BAA control, the airport was used by holiday charter operators wishing to escape the higher costs associated with operating from Heathrow and Gatwick.\n[[File:London Stansted Airport Air View.jpg|thumb|View of Stansted from the air.]]\n\nStansted had been held in reserve as a third London airport since the 1950s. However, after a public inquiry at Chelmsford In 1966-67 the Government set up the Roskill Commission to review the need afresh. The Commission for the Third London Airport (the \"[[Roskill Commission]]\") of 1968-71 did not include Stansted as one of its four short-listed sites and recommended that [[Cublington]] in Buckinghamshire should be developed as London's third airport.<ref>Roskill (1971). ''Report, Commission on the Third London Airport''. London: HMSO.</ref> However, the Conservative Government under Ted Heath agreed with a minority recommendation that a site at Foulness in the Thames Estuary, later renamed Maplin, should be developed. But, in 1974, the incoming Labour Government under Harold Wilson cancelled the Maplin project because of the economic situation.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite book|title=Inside London's Airports Policy: Indecision, decision and counter-decision|last=Le Blond|first=Paul|publisher=ICE Publishing|year=2018|isbn=9780727763655|location=London|pages=}}</ref>\n\nStansted was then considered as an option for long term development in the Advisory Committee on Airports Policy (ACAP) and the Study Group on South East Airports (SGSEA) and was selected from a short list of six by the Conservative Government in December 1979. The proposal, for a new terminal associated with the existing runway and the safeguarding of land for a second runway, was considered at the Airports Inquiries of 1981-83. The Inspector's Report was published in 1984 and the decision, announced in a White Paper in 1985, was to approve a plan to develop Stansted in two phases, involving both airfield and terminal improvements that would increase the airport's capacity to 15&nbsp;million passengers per year, but to reject the second runway.<ref name=\"auto\"/> \n\nThe current terminal building was designed by architect [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank|Norman Foster]]. Construction was undertaken by [[John Laing Group|John Laing]] and took place between 1988 and 1991,<ref>Ritchie, p. 173</ref> costing \u00a3100&nbsp;million.<ref>''Above Us The Skies: The Story Of BAA''&nbsp;\u2013 1991 (Michael Donne&nbsp;\u2013 BAA plc), p. 62-63</ref> In 1990 it was awarded the [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture / Mies van der Rohe Award]]. As part of the development, a railway branch was built to the airport, and [[Stansted Airport railway station]] opened in 1991.\n\nLong-haul scheduled services commenced in the early 1990s when [[American Airlines]] operated a transatlantic service between Stansted and [[O'Hare International Airport]], however the route was unprofitable and was withdrawn in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news | title = American Airlines to quit Stansted: Long haul carrier scraps Chicago service |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 1 April 1993 | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/american-airlines-to-quit-stansted-long-haul-carrier-scraps-chicago-service-1452654.html | first=Michael | last=Harrison | accessdate=11 May 2010}}</ref> [[Continental Airlines]] also operated services in the late 1990s from [[Newark Liberty International Airport]], but this service was stopped shortly after the [[September 11 attacks]].\n\nLong-haul services to the United States returned in late 2005, when [[Eos Airlines]] and [[MAXjet Airways]] commenced all-business-class services from Stansted to [[John F.

In 2006, MAXjet expanded their service with flights to [[Washington Dulles International Airport|Washington, D.C.]], [[McCarran International Airport|Las Vegas]] and [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]]. American Airlines began daily flights to Stansted in October 2007 from New York\u2013JFK and was originally expected to operate a second daily flight from April 2008.

Finally, in July 2008 American Airlines withdrew from the airport.\n\n===Latest developments===\nLong haul transatlantic operations made a return to Stansted in June 2010, when [[Sun Country Airlines]] announced a seasonal weekly service from Stansted to [[Minneapolis]]. The flights made a re-fuelling stop-over in [[Gander International Airport|Gander]], Newfoundland and Labrador as the aircraft used for the flight, a Boeing 737-800, would not be able to complete a non-stop westbound flight from Stansted to Minneapolis. The flights operated from 11 June to 15 August 2010. In 2011, Sun Country operated to Gatwick rather than Stansted and were then discontinued due to the price involved in carrying fuel on long haul flights. {{Cn|date=May 2017}}\n\nLong-haul services to Asia commenced in March 2009 <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businesstraveller.com/news/2009/03/09/air-asia-x-launches-flights-between-stansted-and-kl/|title=Air Asia X launches flights between Stansted and KL \u2013 Business Traveller|work=Business Traveller|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> with Malaysian low-cost airline [[AirAsia X]] providing direct flights to [[Kuala Lumpur]]; however, on 24 October 2011, this service moved to Gatwick Airport before being later withdrawn completely.\n\nA major expansion programme to the existing terminal took place between 2007 and 2009, adding nearly {{convert|5900|m2|abbr=on}} of floorspace to give space for additional baggage carousels, a new immigration and passport control hall and a [[hypostyle]] arrivals hall with improved facilities.\n\nIn November 2006, [[Uttlesford]] District Council rejected a [[BAA Limited|BAA]] planning application to increase the permitted number of aircraft movements and to remove the limit on passenger numbers. BAA immediately appealed against the decision and a public inquiry opened lasting from May until October 2007. Planning Inspector Alan Boyland made his recommendations in January 2008. {{Cn|date=May 2017}} Those recommendations were largely followed by the Secretary of State for Transport ([[Geoff Hoon]]) and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government (Hazel Blears), who jointly allowed the applicant's appeal in October 2008.

It replaced the old control tower, which offered poor views of the airfield once the current terminal building was opened in 1991.\n\n===Other infrastructure===\nThere are several cargo buildings and hangars around the airfield. The main cargo centre is located by the control tower and handles most cargo operations, including aircraft such as the [[McDonnell Douglas MD-11]] and the [[Boeing 747]]. There are a small number of hangars on the other side of the runway to the rest of the airport.

Visited 20 June 2011</ref>\n\nThe ATWP had anticipated that a second runway would be operational by 2011, but this date continued to slip. BAA's 2008 planning application envisaged operation commencing in 2015, and in 2009, BAA revised the anticipated opening date to 2017.\n\nPrior to the United Kingdom's May 2010 general election, all three major political parties pledged not to approve a second runway. Soon after the election, the new government confirmed this, and BAA withdrew its application for planning permission, having spent nearly \u00a3200&nbsp;million preparing for the public inquiry and buying up properties.\n\nThe public inquiry into BAA's second runway application had been scheduled to start on 15 April 2009, but the start was delayed by Secretary of State [[Hazel Blears]] to allow time for BAA and the Government to consider the implications of the March 2009 Competition Commission's ruling that BAA must sell Stansted within two years. As 2011 drew to a close, BAA was still appealing against the Competition Commission ruling. On 20 August 2012, after losing a case at the Court of Appeal, BAA agreed to cease challenging the Competition Commission's ruling and to sell Stansted.\n\nOn 10 February 2010, Secretary of State [[John Denham (politician)|John Denham]], in an open letter, concluded that the inquiry could not reasonably start until after the General Election. In addition, he commented that the planning application documents were nearly two years old and would require updating. Eventually, BAA realised the futility of pursuing its G2 application in the context of the new government policy and withdrew it on 24 May 2010.<ref name=\"withdraw\"/>\n\n====Stop Stansted Expansion (SSE)====\nThe [[advocacy group]] Stop Stansted Expansion (\"SSE\"), formed in 2002 as a working group of the North West Essex and East Herts Preservation Association, in response to the Government's consultation on expanding UK airports and, particularly, expansion plans for Stansted Airport subsequently defined in the Air Transport [[White Paper]] in December 2003.<ref>[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100519093443/http:/www.dft.gov.uk/about/strategy/whitepapers/air/ [ARCHIVED CONTENT&#93; The Future of Air Transport \u2013 White Paper and the Civil Aviation Bill].

SSE was a major participant in the 2007 \"G1\" public inquiry and had committed to be a major participant in the anticipated inquiry into the 'G2' second runway proposal. Following the withdrawal of the G2 planning application the group called upon BAA to sell the homes it had bought to support the planned expansion.\n\nIn September 2012, as a result of pressure from the aviation industry, the Government set up the Airports Commission, chaired by Sir Howard Davies,<ref>[https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/airports-commission Airports Commission]. GOV.UK. Retrieved 16 August 2013.</ref> to consider what, if anything, needed to be done to maintain the UK's status as a global aviation hub. The Commission concluded that an additional runway would be required for South East England and that it should be added to either Heathrow or Gatwick. Following the 2015 election the Commission made a final recommendation to expand Heathrow subject to certain environmental constraints.\n\nThroughout 2013 the Airports Commission published discussion papers and invited submissions from key stakeholders on the main issues it wished to consider. SSE made several thorough submissions. SSE also accepted an invitation to give oral evidence and make a presentation to the Commission on aviation demand forecasting and connectivity at a public evidence session held in Manchester in July 2013.<ref>Stansted Airport Airfield Fire Services 30 March 1998 Emerald Airways HS748 engine exploded on take off whilst carrying the Leeds United football team, aircraft written off but no one injured.

MAG has invested \u00a340&nbsp;million and the remainder was invested by other commercial partners. The redevelopment included relocation of the security area, doubling the amount of seating and improving the information displays. The new Departure Lounge offers a food court, a number of new shops and an Escape Lounge, however the remodelling has drawn heavy criticism due to the length of time it takes to walk through the shopping areas to get to the departure gates.\n\nSatellite One has also been redeveloped with the aim to attract more long-haul airlines to Stansted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |title=Transport Secretary Launches \u00a380 Million Terminal Redevelopment |date=20 June 2013 |publisher=London Stansted Airport |accessdate=11 February 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221234429/http://www.stanstedairport.com/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/transport-secretary-launches-%C2%A380-million-terminal-redevelopment |archivedate=21 February 2014  }}</ref>\n\n===New Arrivals Terminal===\nAn arrivals terminal is planned to be built at Stansted, with construction due to begin in 2018, taking three years to complete.
