It included worker [[strike action|strikes]], peasant unrest, and military [[mutiny|mutinies]]. It led to constitutional reform (namely the \"[[October Manifesto]]\"), including the establishment of the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]], the [[multi-party system]], and the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]].\n\nThe 1905 revolution was spurred by the Russian defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese war]] (1904\u20131905), but also by the growing realization by the people of the need for reform, after politicians such as [[Sergei Witte]] failed to accomplish this. While the [[Nicholas II|Tsar]] managed to keep his rule, the events foreshadowed those of the [[Russian revolution]]s in 1917, which resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy, execution of the imperial family, and creation of the [[Soviet Union]] by the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nSome historians contend that the 1905 revolution set the stage for the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]]s, and allowed for [[Bolshevism]] to emerge as a distinct political movement in Russia, although it was still a minority.

Newly emancipated peasants earned too little and were not allowed to sell or mortgage their allotted land. Ethnic minorities resented the government because of its \"Russification\", discrimination and repression, such as banning them from voting, serving in the [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] or Navy, and limiting their attendance in schools. A nascent industrial working class resented the government for doing too little to protect them, as it banned strikes and labor unions. Finally, radical ideas fomented and spread after a relaxation of discipline in the universities allowed a new consciousness to grow among students.\n\nTaken individually, these issues might not have affected the course of Russian history, but together they created the conditions for a potential revolution.<ref>{{cite book |last = Harcave |first = Sidney |title = The Russian Revolution |year = 1970 |publisher = Collier Books |location = London |oclc = 293897 }}</ref> \n<blockquote>\"At the turn of the century, discontent with the Tsar\u2019s dictatorship was manifested not only through the growth of political parties dedicated to the overthrow of the monarchy but also through industrial strikes for better wages and working conditions, protests and riots among peasants, university demonstrations, and the assassination of government officials, often done by Socialist Revolutionaries.\"<ref>{{cite book |last = Defronzo |first = James |title = Revolutions and Revolutionary Moments |year = 2011 |publisher = Westview Press |location = New York |isbn = 978-1-85109-798-2 }}</ref><!--could only find isbn for 2006 ed.--></blockquote>\n[[File:Subdivisions of the Russian Empire in 1897 (uyezd level).svg|thumb|right|250px|Subdivisions of the Russian Empire in 1897 ([[uyezd]] level)]]\nBecause the Russian economy was tied to European finances, the contraction of Western money markets in 1899\u20131900 plunged Russian industry into a deep and prolonged crisis; it outlasted the dip in European industrial production.

The minister of interior [[Vyacheslav von Plehve|Plehve]] said in 1903 that, after the agrarian problem, the most serious issues plaguing the country were those of the Jews, the schools, and the workers, in that order.<ref>Harcave 1990, 21</ref>\n\nOne of the major contributing factors that changed Russia from a country in unrest to a country in revolt was \"[[Bloody_Sunday_(1905)|Bloody Sunday]]\". Loyalty to the tsar Nicholas II was lost when his soldiers fired upon people led by [[Georgy Gapon]] on 22 January 1905, who were attempting to present a petition to the tsar.\n\n===Agrarian problem===\n\nEvery year, thousands of nobles in debt mortgaged their estates to the noble land bank or sold them to municipalities, merchants, or peasants. By the time of the revolution, the nobility had sold off one-third of its land and mortgaged another third. The government hoped to make peasants\u2014freed by the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]]\u2014a politically conservative, land-holding class by enacting laws to enable them to buy land from nobility and pay small installments over many decades.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 19\">Harcave 1970, 19</ref>\n\nThe land, known as \"allotment land\", would not be owned by individual peasants, but by the community of peasants; individual peasants would have rights to strips of land that were assigned to them under the [[open field system]]. Unfortunately, a peasant could not sell or mortgage his land, so in practice he could not renounce his rights to his land and thus he would be required to pay his share of redemption dues to the village commune.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 19\" /> This plan was meant to prevent [[proletariat|proletarianisation]] of the peasants. However, the peasants were not given enough land to provide for their needs.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\">Harcave 1970, 20</ref> \"Their earnings were often so small that they could neither buy the food they needed nor keep up the payment of taxes and redemption dues they owed the government for their land allotments. By 1903 their total arrears in payments of taxes and dues was 118 million rubles.\"<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" /> The situation became worse. Masses of hungry peasants roamed the countryside looking for work and sometimes walked hundreds of kilometres to find it. Desperate peasants proved capable of violence.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" /> \"In the provinces of [[Kharkov]] and [[Poltava]] in 1902, thousands of them, ignoring restraints and authority, burst out in a rebellious fury that led to extensive destruction of property and looting of noble homes before troops could be brought to subdue and punish them.\"<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" />\n\nThese violent outbreaks caught the attention of the government, so it created many committees to investigate their causes.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" /> The committees concluded that no part of the countryside was prosperous; some parts, especially the fertile areas known as \"[[Chernozem|black-soil region]]\", were in decline.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 21\">Harcave 1970, 21</ref> Although cultivated acreage had increased in the last half century, the increase had not been proportionate to the growth of peasant populations, which had doubled.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 21\" /> \"There was general agreement at the turn of the century that Russia faced a grave and intensifying agrarian crisis due mainly to rural overpopulation with an annual excess of fifteen to eighteen live births over deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.\"<ref name=pipes>{{cite book |last = Pipes |first = Richard |title = A Concise History of the Russian Revolution |year = 1996 |publisher = Vintage |location = New York |pages = 8 }}</ref> The investigations revealed many difficulties but could not find solutions that were both sensible and \"acceptable\" to the government.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 21\" />\n\n===Nationality problem===\n[[File:Russia ethnic.JPG|thumb|Ethnic map of European Russia before World War I]]\nRussia was a multi-ethnic empire.

After the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, the Russian state was compelled to take into account public opinion, but the government failed to gain the public's support.<ref name=\"Weeks 2004, 475\">Weeks 2004, 475</ref> Another motive for Russification policies was the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising of 1863]]. Unlike other minority nationalities, the Poles, in the eyes of the Tsar, were a direct threat to the empire's stability. After the rebellion was crushed, the government implemented policies to reduce Polish cultural influences.<ref name=\"Weeks 2004, 475\"/> In the 1870s the government began to distrust German elements on the western border. The Russian government felt that the unification of Germany would upset the power balance among the great powers of Europe and that Germany would use its strength against Russia. The government thought that the borders would be defended better if the borderland were more \"Russian\" in character.<ref>Weeks 2004, 475\u2013476</ref> The culmination of cultural diversity created a cumbersome nationality problem that plagued the Russian government in the years leading up to the revolution.\n\n===Labour problem===\n\nThe economic situation in Russia before the revolution presented a grim picture. The government had experimented with ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalist policies, but this strategy largely failed to gain traction within the Russian economy until the 1890s. Meanwhile, \"agricultural productivity stagnated, while international prices for grain dropped, and Russia\u2019s foreign debt and need for imports grew. War and military preparations continued to consume government revenues. At the same time, the peasant taxpayers' ability to pay was strained to the utmost, leading to widespread famine in 1891.\"<ref>Skocpol 1979, 90</ref>\n\nIn the 1890s, under Finance Minister [[Sergei Witte]], a crash governmental programme was proposed to promote industrialization. His policies included heavy government expenditures for railroad building and operations, subsidies and supporting services for private industrialists, high protective tariffs for Russian industries (especially heavy industry), an increase in exports, currency stabilization, and encouragement of foreign investments.<ref name=\"Skocpol 1979, 91\">Skocpol 1979, 91</ref> His plan was successful and during the 1890s \"Russian industrial growth averaged 8 percent per year. Railroad mileage grew from a very substantial base by 40 percent between 1892 and 1902.\"{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref name=\"Skocpol 1979, 91\"/> Ironically, Witte's success in implementing this program helped spur the 1905 revolution and eventually the [[1917 revolution]] because it exacerbated social tensions. \"Besides dangerously concentrating a proletariat, a professional and a rebellious student body in centers of political power, industrialization infuriated both these new forces and the traditional rural classes.\"{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref>Skocpol 1979, 92</ref> The government policy of financing industrialization through taxing peasants forced millions of peasants to work in towns. The \"peasant worker\" saw his labour in the factory as the means to consolidate his family's economic position in the village and played a role in determining the social consciousness of the urban proletariat. The new concentrations and flows of peasants spread urban ideas to the countryside, breaking down isolation of peasants on communes.<ref name=perrie>{{cite journal |last = Perrie |first = Maureen |title = The Russian Peasant Movement of 1905\u20131907: Its Social Composition and Revolutionary Significance |journal = Past and Present |date = November 1972 |volume = 57 |pages = 124\u2013125 |doi = 10.1093/past/57.1.123 }}</ref>\n\nIndustrial workers began to feel dissatisfaction with the Tsarist government despite the protective labour laws the government decreed. Some of those laws included the prohibition of children under 12 from working, with the exception of night work in glass factories.  Employment of children aged 12 to 15 was prohibited on Sundays and holidays. Workers had to be paid in cash at least once a month, and limits were placed on the size and bases of fines for workers who were tardy. Employers were prohibited from charging workers for the cost of lighting of the shops and plants.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 22\"/> Despite these labor protections, the workers believed that the laws were not enough to free them from unfair and inhumane practices. At the start of the 20th century, Russian industrial workers worked on average an 11-hour day (10 hours on Saturday), factory conditions were perceived as grueling and often unsafe, and attempts at independent unions were often not accepted.<ref>John Simkin (ed), \"[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUS1905.htm%20 1905 Russian Revolution] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504044801/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUS1905.htm |date=4 May 2012 }}\", Spartacus Educational, undated.</ref> Many workers were forced to work beyond the maximum of 11 and a half hours per day.

Dissatisfaction turned into despair for many impoverished workers, which made them more sympathetic to radical ideas.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 23\"/> These discontented, radicalized workers became key to the revolution by participating in illegal strikes and revolutionary protests.\n\nThe government responded by arresting labour agitators and enacting more \"paternalistic\" legislation.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 24\">Harcave 1970, 24</ref> Introduced in 1900 by [[Sergei Zubatov]], head of the Moscow security department, \"police socialism\" planned to have workers form workers' societies with police approval to \"provide healthful, fraternal activities and opportunities for cooperative self-help together with 'protection' against influences that might have inimical effect on loyalty to job or country\".{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 24\"/> Some of these groups organized in Moscow, Odessa, Kiev, [[Nikolayev (Ukraine)]], and Kharkov, but these groups and the idea of police socialism failed.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 24\"/>\n\nIn 1900\u20131903, the period of industrial depression caused many firm bankruptcies and a reduction in the employment rate. Employees were restive: they would join legal organizations but turn the organizations toward an end that the organizations' sponsors did not intend. Workers used legitimate means to organize strikes or to draw support for striking workers outside these groups.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 24\"/> A strike that began in 1902 by workers in the railroad shops in [[Vladikavkaz]] and [[Rostov-on-Don]] created such a response that by the next summer, 225,000 in various industries in southern Russia and [[Transcaucasia]] were on strike.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 25\">Harcave 1970, 25</ref> These were not the first illegal strikes in the country's history but their aims, and the political awareness and support among workers and non-workers, made them more troubling to the government than earlier strikes.

Students of universities, other schools of higher learning, and occasionally of secondary schools and theological seminaries were part of this group.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 25\"/>\n\nStudent radicalism began around the time [[Tsar Alexander II]] came to power.

The 1860s was a time when the emergence of a new public sphere was created in social life and professional groups.

The atmosphere of the early 1860s gave rise to political engagement by students outside universities that became a tenet of student radicalism by the 1870s. Student radicals described \"the special duty and mission of the student as such to spread the new word of liberty. Students were called upon to extend their freedoms into society, to repay the privilege of learning by serving the people, and to become in Nikolai Ogarev's phrase 'apostles of knowledge'.\"{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}}<ref name=\"Morrissey 1998, 23\">Morrissey 1998, 23</ref> During the next two decades, universities produced a significant share of Russia's revolutionaries.

Many socialists view this as a period when the rising revolutionary movement was met with rising reactionary movements. As [[Rosa Luxemburg]] stated in ''The Mass Strike'', when collective strike activity was met with what is perceived as repression from an autocratic state, economic and political demands grew into and reinforced each other.<ref>Rosa Luxemburg, ''The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions'', 1906 [English translation Patrick Lavin, 1925]. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1906/mass-strike/ch04.htm Chapter 4, \"The Interaction of the Political and the Economic Struggle.\"]</ref>\n\nRussian progressives formed the Union of [[Zemstvo]] Constitutionalists in 1903 and the Union of Liberation in 1904, which called for a constitutional monarchy. Russian socialists formed two major groups: the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], following the [[Narodnik|Russian populist]] tradition, and the [[Marxist]] [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]].\n\nIn the autumn of 1904, liberals started a series of banquets, nominally celebrating the 40th anniversary of the liberal court statutes, but actually an attempt to circumvent laws against political gatherings (modeled on the ''[[campagne des banquets]]'' leading up to the [[French Revolution of 1848]]). The banquets resulted in calls for political reforms and a constitution. On {{OldStyleDate|13 December|1904|30 November}}, the [[Moscow City Duma]] passed a resolution demanding establishment of an elected national legislature, full [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of religion]]. Similar resolutions and appeals from other city dumas and zemstvo councils followed.\n\nTsar [[Nicholas II]] made a move to fulfill many of these demands, appointing liberal [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky]] Minister of the Interior after the assassination of [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]]. On {{OldStyleDate|25 December|1904|12 December}}, the Tsar issued a manifesto promising the broadening of the Zemstvo and more authority local municipal councils, insurance for industrial workers, the emancipation of [[Inorodtsy]] and the abolition of censorship. The crucial demand of representative national legislature was missing in the manifesto.\n\nWorker strikes in Caucasus broke out in March 1902 and strikes on the railway originating from pay disputes took on other issues and drew in other industries, culminating in a general strike at Rostov-on-Don in November. Daily meetings of 15,000 to 20,000 heard openly revolutionary appeals for the first time, before a massacre defeated the strikes. But reaction to the massacres brought political demands to purely economic ones. Luxemburg described the situation in 1903 by saying: \"the whole of South Russia in May, June and July was aflame\",<ref>Rosa Luxemburg, ''The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions'', 1906 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1906/mass-strike/ch03.htm Chapter 3, \"Development of the Mass Strike Movement in Russia\"].</ref> including Baku where separate wage struggles culminated in a citywide general strike, and Tiflis, where commercial workers gained a reduction in the working day, and were joined by factory workers. In 1904, massive strike waves broke out in Odessa in the spring, Kiev in July, and Baku in December. This all set the stage for the strikes in St. Petersburg in December 1904 to January 1905 seen as the first step in the 1905 revolution.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Years !!

The event became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], and is considered by many scholars as the start of the active phase of the revolution.\n\nThe events in St. Petersburg provoked public indignation and a series of massive strikes that spread quickly throughout the industrial centers of the Russian Empire. Polish socialists\u2014both the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] and the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|SDKPiL]]\u2014called for a general strike. By the end of January 1905, over 400,000 workers in [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] were on strike (see [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u20131907)]]). Half of European Russia's industrial workers went on strike in 1905, and 93.2% in Poland.<ref>Robert Blobaum, ''Feliks Dzierzynski and the SDKPiL: A Study of the Origins of Polish Communism'', page 123</ref> There were also strikes in [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] coast. In [[Riga]], 130 protesters were killed on {{OldStyleDate|26 January|1905|13 January}}, and in [[Warsaw]] a few days later over 100 strikers were shot on the streets. By February, there were strikes in the [[Caucasus]], and by April, in the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] and beyond. In March, all higher academic institutions were forcibly closed for the remainder of the year, adding radical students to the striking workers. A strike by railway workers on {{OldStyleDate|21 October|1905|8 October}} quickly developed into a general strike in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. This prompted the setting up of the short-lived [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]] of Workers' Delegates, an admixture of [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]] headed by Khrustalev-Nossar and despite the Iskra split would see the likes of [[Julius Martov]] and [[Georgi Plekhanov]] spar with [[Lenin]].

Witte was dispatched to make peace, negotiating the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]] (signed {{OldStyleDate|5 September|1905|23 August}}). In 1905, there were naval mutinies at [[Sevastopol]] (see [[Sevastopol Uprising]]), [[Vladivostok]], and [[Kronstadt]], peaking in June with the [[Russian battleship Potemkin#The mutiny|mutiny aboard the battleship ''Potemkin'']]. The mutineers eventually surrendered the battleship to Romanian authorities on 8 July in exchange for asylum, then the Romanians returned her to Imperial Russian authorities on the following day.<ref>Neal Bascomb, ''[[Red Mutiny: Eleven Fateful Days on the Battleship Potemkin]]'', pp. 286\u201399</ref> Some sources claim over 2,000 sailors died in the suppression.<ref>Bascomb, N (2007).

He appointed a government commission \"to enquire without delay into the causes of discontent among the workers in the city of St Petersburg and its suburbs\"{{attribution needed|date=December 2016}} in view of the strike movement. The commission was headed by Senator NV&nbsp;Shidlovsky, a member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]], and included officials, chiefs of government factories, and private factory owners. It was also meant to have included workers' delegates elected according to a two-stage system. Elections of the workers delegates were, however, blocked by the socialists who wanted to divert the workers from the elections to the armed struggle. On {{OldStyleDate|5 March|1905|20 February}}, the Commission was dissolved without having started work. Following the assassination of his uncle, the [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich]], on {{OldStyleDate|17 February|1905|4 February}}, the Tsar made new concessions. On {{OldStyleDate|2 March|1905|18 February}} he published the ''[[Alexander Bulygin|Bulygin Rescript]]'', which promised the formation of a consultative assembly, religious tolerance, freedom of speech (in the form of language rights for the Polish minority) and a reduction in the peasants' redemption payments. On {{OldStyleDate|24 and 25 May|1905|11 and 12 May}}, about 300 Zemstvo and municipal representatives held three meetings in Moscow, which passed a resolution, asking for popular representation at the national level. On {{OldStyleDate|6 June|1905|24 May}}, [[Nicholas II]] had received a Zemstvo deputation. Responding to speeches by Prince [[Sergei Trubetskoi]] and Mr Fyodrov, the Tsar confirmed his promise to convene an assembly of people's representatives.\n\n== Height of the Revolution ==\n\u25cfA revolution broke out when soldiers fired on 200 000 workers who had marched the Winter Palace in St Petersburg \n[[File:Demonstration1905Novorossysk.jpg|thumb|Mass protests in [[Novorossiysk]]]]\n\n[[Tsar Nicholas II]] agreed on {{OldStyleDate|2 March||18 February}} to the creation of a [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]] but with consultative powers only. When its slight powers and limits on the electorate were revealed, unrest redoubled. The [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]] was formed and called for a general strike in October, refusal to pay taxes, and the withdrawal of bank deposits.\n\nIn June and July 1905, [[Russian Peasants' uprising of 1905\u20136|there were many peasant uprisings]] in which peasants seized land and tools.<ref name=\"barnes2003\">Paul Barnes, R Paul Evans, Peris Jones-Evans (2003).

It closely followed the demands of the Zemstvo Congress in September, granting basic [[civil rights]], allowing the formation of political parties, extending the franchise towards [[universal suffrage]], and establishing the Duma as the central legislative body. The Tsar waited and argued for three days, but finally signed the manifesto on {{OldStyleDate|30 October|1905|17 October}}, citing his desire to avoid a massacre and his realisation that there was insufficient military force available to pursue alternative options. He regretted signing the document, saying that he felt \"sick with shame at this betrayal of the dynasty&nbsp;... the betrayal was complete\".\n\nWhen the manifesto was proclaimed, there were spontaneous demonstrations of support in all the major cities. The strikes in [[Saint Petersburg]] and elsewhere officially ended or quickly collapsed. A political [[amnesty]] was also offered. The concessions came hand-in-hand with renewed, and brutal, action against the unrest. There was also a backlash from the conservative elements of society, with right-wing attacks on strikers, left-wingers, and Jews.\n\nWhile the Russian liberals were satisfied by the [[October Manifesto]] and prepared for upcoming Duma elections, radical socialists and revolutionaries denounced the elections and called for an armed uprising to destroy the Empire.\n\n[[File:Tiflis railway strike 1905.jpg|thumb|A locomotive overturned by striking workers at the main railway depot in [[Tiflis]] in 1905]]\n\nSome of the November uprising of 1905 in [[Sevastopol]], headed by retired naval Lieutenant [[Pyotr Schmidt]], was directed against the government, while some was undirected. It included terrorism, worker strikes, peasant unrest and military mutinies, and was only suppressed after a fierce battle. The [[Trans-Baikal]] railroad fell into the hands of striker committees and demobilised soldiers returning from [[Manchuria]] after the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]]. The Tsar had to send a special detachment of loyal troops along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to restore order.\n\nBetween {{OldStyleDate|5 and 7 December||22 and 24 November}}, there was a general strike by Russian workers. The government sent troops on 7 December, and a bitter street-by-street fight began. A week later, the [[Semyonovsky Regiment]] was deployed, and used artillery to break up demonstrations and to shell workers' districts. On {{OldStyleDate|18 December||5 December}}, with around a thousand people dead and parts of the city in ruins, the workers surrendered. After [[Moscow Uprising of 1905|a final spasm in Moscow]], the uprisings ended in December 1905. According to figures presented in the Duma by Professor [[Maksim Kovalevsky]], by April 1906, more than 14,000 people had been executed and 75,000 imprisoned.<ref>Larned, J. N.

Russians celebrating the granting of the [[October Manifesto]] by Nicholas II, which led to the granting of the 1906 Constitution.]]\nFollowing the Revolution of 1905, the Tsar made last attempts to save his regime, and offered reforms similar to most rulers when pressured by a revolutionary movement. The military remained loyal throughout the Revolution of 1905, as shown by their shooting of revolutionaries when ordered by the Tsar, making overthrow difficult. These reforms were outlined in a precursor to the Constitution of 1906 known as the [[October Manifesto]] which created the [[Imperial Duma]]. The [[Russian Constitution of 1906]], also known as the Fundamental Laws, set up a multiparty system and a limited constitutional monarchy. The revolutionaries were quelled and satisfied with the reforms, but it was not enough to prevent the [[1917 revolution]] that would later topple the Tsar's regime.\n\n===Creation of Duma and Stolypin===\nThere had been earlier attempts in establishing a Russian Duma before the October Manifesto, but these attempts faced dogged resistance.  One attempt in July 1905, called the [[Bulygin Duma]], tried to reduce the assembly into a consultative body.  It also proposed limiting voting rights to those with a higher property qualification, excluding industrial workers.  Both sides&mdash;the opposition and the conservatives&mdash;were not pleased with the results.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Sohrabi |first = Nader |date = May 1995 |title = Historicizing Revolutions: Constitutional Revolutions in the Ottoman Empire, Iran, Russia, 1905\u20131908 |jstor = 2782676 |journal = American Journal of Sociology |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |volume = 100 |issue = 6 |pages = 1424\u20131425 |doi = 10.1086/230667 }}</ref> Another attempt in August 1905 was almost successful, but that too died when Nicholas insisted on the Duma's functions be relegated to an advisory position.<ref>{{cite book |last = Sixsmith |first = Martin |title = Russia:A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East |publisher = The Overlook Press,Peter Mayer Publishers, Inc. |location = New York |isbn = 978-1-4683-0501-2 |pages = 171 |date = 31 December 2013 }}</ref> The October Manifesto, aside from granting the population the freedom of speech and assembly, proclaimed that no law would be passed without examination and approval by the [[Imperial Duma]].

Even three days before the Duma's first session, on 24 April 1906, the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws]] further limited the assembly's movement by giving the tsar the sole power to appoint/dismiss ministers.<ref>Nader Sohrabi, Historicizing Revolutions, pages 1426</ref> Adding insult was the indication that the Tsar alone had control over many facets of political reins&mdash;all without the Duma's expressed permission.  The trap seemed perfectly set for the unsuspecting Duma: by the time the assembly convened in 27 April, it quickly found itself unable to do much without violating the Fundamental Laws.  Defeated and frustrated, the majority of the assembly voted no confidence and handed in their resignations after a few weeks on 13 May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Nader Sohrabi, Historicizing Revolutions, pages 1427</ref>\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432 - \u0422\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u044f II \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f I \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b \u0432 \u0417\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435.jpg|thumb|Speech by Emperor Nicholas II on the opening of the [[First State Duma]] of the Russian Empire, 27 April 1906]]\nThe attacks on the Duma were not confined to its legislative powers.  By the time the Duma opened, it was missing crucial support from its populace, thanks in no small part to the government's return to Pre-Manifesto levels of suppression.  The Soviets were forced to lay low for a long time, while the [[zemstvos]] turned against the Duma when the issue of land appropriation came up.   The issue of land appropriation was the most contentious of the Duma's appeals.  The Duma proposed that the government distribute its treasury, \"monastic and imperial lands\", and seize private estates as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The Duma, in fact, was preparing to alienate some of its more affluent supporters, a decision that left the assembly without the necessary political power to be efficient.\n\nOf course, Nicholas II remained wary of having to share power with reform-minded bureaucrats.  When the pendulum in 1906 elections swung to the left, Nicholas immediately ordered the Duma's dissolution just after 73 days.<ref>Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 173</ref> Hoping to further squeeze the life out of the assembly, he appointed a tougher prime minister in [[Petr Stolypin]] as the liberal Witte's replacement.  Much to Nicholas's chagrin, Stolypin attempted to bring about acts of reform (land reform), while retaining measures favorable to the regime (stepping up the number of executions of revolutionaries).  After the revolution subsided, he was able to bring economic growth back to Russia's industries, a period which lasted until 1914.  But Stolypin's efforts did nothing to prevent the collapse of the monarchy, nor seemed to satisfy the conservatives.  Stolypin died from a bullet wound by a revolutionary, [[Dmitry Bogrov]], on 5 September 1911.<ref>Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 174</ref>\n\n===October Manifesto===\n\nEven after Bloody Sunday and defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, Nicholas II had been slow to offer a meaningful solution to the social and political crisis.  At this point, he became more concerned with his personal affairs such as the illness of his son, whose struggle with [[haemophilia]] was overseen by [[Rasputin]]. Nicholas also refused to believe that the population was demanding changes in the autocratic regime, seeing \"public opinion\" as mainly the \"intelligentsia\"<ref>Martin Sixsmith, ''Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East'', pages 171</ref> and believing himself to be the patronly 'father figure' to the Russian people. [[Sergei Witte]], the minister of Russia, frustratingly argued with the Tsar that an immediate implementation of reforms was needed to retain order in the country.  It was only after the Revolution started picking up steam that Nicholas was forced to make concessions by writing the October Manifesto.\n\nIssued on 17 October 1905, the Manifesto stated that the government would grant the population reforms such as the right to vote and to convene in assemblies.  Its main provisions were:\n# The granting of the population \"inviolable personal rights\" including freedom of conscience, speech, and assemblage\n# Giving the population who were previously cut off from doing so participation in the newly formed Duma\n# Ensuring that no law would be passed without the consent of the Imperial Duma.<ref>Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 171</ref>\n\nOf course, despite what seemed to be a moment for celebration for Russia's population and the reformists, the Manifesto was rife with problems.  Aside from the absence of the word \"constitution\", one issue with the manifesto was its timing.   By October 1905, Nicholas was already dealing with a revolution.  Another problem surfaced in the conscience of Nicholas himself:  Witte said in 1911 that the manifesto was written only to get the pressure off the monarch's back, that it was not a \"voluntary act\".<ref>{{cite journal |last = Kropotkin |first = G. M. |date = Spring 2008 |title = The Ruling Bureaucracy and the \"New Order\" of Russian Statehood After the Manifesto of 17 October 1905 |journal =  Russian Studies in History|volume = 46 |issue = 4 |pages = 6\u201333 |doi = 10.2753/RSH1061-1983460401 }}</ref> In fact, the writers hoped that the Manifesto would sow discord into \"the camp of the autocracy\u2019s enemies\" and bring order back to Russia.<ref>G. M. Kropotkin, ''The Ruling Bureaucracy and the \"New Order\" of Russian Statehood'', pages 9</ref>\n\nOne immediate effect it did have, for a while, was the start of the Days of Freedom, a six-week period from 17 October to early December.  This period witnessed an unprecedented level of freedom on all publications\u2014revolutionary papers, brochures, etc.\u2014even though the tsar officially retained the power to censor provocative material.  This opportunity allowed the press to address the tsar, and government officials, in a harsh, critical tone previously unheard of.  The freedom of speech also opened the floodgates for meetings and organized political parties.  In Moscow alone, over 400 meetings took place in the first four weeks.  Some of the political parties that came out of these meetings were the [[Constitutional Democrats]] (Kadets), [[Social Democrats]], [[Socialist Revolutionaries]], [[Octobrists]], and the far-rightist Union of Russian People.<ref>Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', page 1407</ref>\n\nAmong all the groups that benefited most from the Days of Freedoms were the labor unions.  In fact, the Days of Freedom witnessed unionization in the history of the Russian Empire at its apex.  At least 67 unions were established in Moscow, as well as 58 in St. Petersburg; the majority of both combined were formed in November 1905 alone.  For the [[Soviets]], it was a watershed period of time: nearly 50 of the unions in St. Petersburg came under Soviet control, while in Moscow, the Soviets had around 80000 members.  This large sector of power allowed the Soviets enough clout to form their own militias.  In St. Petersburg alone, the Soviets claimed around 6,000 armed members with the purpose of protecting the meetings.<ref>Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', pages 1407\u20131408</ref>\n\nPerhaps empowered in their newfound window of opportunity, the St. Petersburg Soviets, along with other socialist parties, called for armed struggles against the Tsarist government, a war call that no doubt alarmed the government.  Not only were the workers motivated, but the Days of Freedom also had an earthquake-like effect on the peasant collective as well.  Seeing an opening in the autocracy's waning authority thanks to the Manifesto, the peasants, with a political organization, took to the streets in revolt.  In response, the government exerted its forces in campaigns to subdue and repress both the peasants and the workers.  Consequences were now in full force: with a pretext in their hands, the government spent the month of December 1905 regaining the level of authority once lost to [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]].<ref>Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', pages 1409</ref>\n\nIronically, the writers of the October Manifesto were caught off guard by the surge in revolts.  One of the main reasons for writing the October Manifesto bordered on the government's \"fear of the revolutionary movement\".<ref name=\"G.M. Kropotkin pages 23\">G. M. Kropotkin, The Ruling Bureaucracy and the \"New Order\" of Russian Statehood, pages 23</ref> In fact, many officials believed this fear was practically the sole reason for the Manifesto's creation in the first place.  Among those more scared was [[Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov]], governor general of [[St. Petersburg]] and deputy minister of the interior.  Trepov urged Nicholas II to stick to the principles in the Manifesto, for \"every retreat&nbsp;... would be hazardous to the dynasty\".<ref name=\"G.M. Kropotkin pages 23\"/>\n\n===Russian Constitution of 1906===\nThe [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] was published on the eve of the convocation of the First Duma. The new Fundamental Law was enacted to institute promises of the October Manifesto as well as add new reforms. The Tsar was confirmed as absolute leader, with complete control of the executive, foreign policy, church, and the armed forces. The structure of the Duma was changed, becoming a lower chamber below the Council of Ministers, and was half-elected, half-appointed by the Tsar. Legislations had to be approved by the Duma, the Council, and the Tsar to become law. The Fundamental State Laws were the \"culmination of the whole sequence of events set in motion in October 1905 and which consolidated the new ''status quo''\". The introduction of The Russian Constitution of 1906 was not simply an institution of the October Manifesto. The introduction of the constitution states (and thus emphasizes) the following:\n* The Russian State is one and indivisible.\n* The [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], while comprising as inseparable part of the Russian State, is governed in its internal affairs by special decrees based on special legislation.\n* The Russian language is the common language of the state, and its use is compulsory in the army, the navy and all state and public institutions. The use of local (regional) languages and dialects in state and public institutions are determined by special legislation.\n\nThe Constitution did not mention any of the provisions of the October Manifesto. While it did enact the provisions laid out previously, its sole purpose seems again to be the propaganda for the monarchy and to simply not fall back on prior promises. The provisions and the new constitutional monarchy did not satisfy Russians and Lenin. The Constitution lasted until the fall of the empire in 1917.\n\n== Rise of Political Violence ==\nThe years 1904 and 1907 saw a decline of mass movements, strikes and protests, and a rise of overt political violence. Combat groups such as the [[SR Combat Organization]] carried out many assassinations targeting civil servants and police, and robberies. Between 1906 and 1909, revolutionaries killed 7,293 people, of whom 2,640 were officials, and wounded 8,061.<ref>Galina Mikha\u012dlovna Ivanova, Carol Apollonio Flath and Donald J.

The [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] were formed, led by captain [[Johan Kock]]. During the general strike, the ''[[Red Declaration]]'', written by Finnish politician and journalist [[Yrj\u00f6 M\u00e4kelin]], was published in ''[[Tampere]],'' demanding dissolution of the [[Senate of Finland]], universal suffrage, [[Freedom (political)|political freedoms]], and abolition of censorship. [[Leo Mechelin]], leader of the constitutionalists, crafted the ''November Manifesto'': the revolution resulted in the abolition of the [[Diet of Finland]] and of the four [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], and to the creation of the modern [[Parliament of Finland]]. It also resulted in a temporary halt to the [[Russification of Finland|Russification policy]] that Russia had started in 1899.\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|12 August|1906|30 July}}, Russian artillerymen and military engineers [[Sveaborg Rebellion|rose in revolt]] in the fortress of [[Sveaborg]] (later called [[Suomenlinna]]), Helsinki. The Finnish Red Guards supported the [[Sveaborg Rebellion]] with a general strike, but the mutiny was quelled within 60 hours by loyal troops and ships of the [[Baltic Fleet]].\n\n== Estonia ==\n<!--[[File:Tallinn Monument to the Revolution of 1905.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Monument to the victims of the Revolution in Tallinn]]-->\nIn the [[Governorate of Estonia]], Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal suffrage, and for national autonomy. On {{OldStyleDate|29 October||16 October}}, the Russian army opened fire in a meeting on a street market in [[Tallinn]] in which about 8 000-10 000 people participated, killing 94 and injuring over 200. The October Manifesto was supported in Estonia and the [[Estonian flag]] was displayed publicly for the first time. [[Jaan T\u00f5nisson]] used the new political freedoms to widen the rights of Estonians by establishing the first Estonian political party \u2013 ''National Progress Party''.\n\nAnother, more radical political organisation, the ''Estonian Social Democratic Workers' Union'' was founded as well. The moderate supporters of T\u00f5nisson and the more radical supporters of [[Jaan Teemant]] could not agree about how to continue with the revolution, and only agreed that both wanted to limit the rights of [[Baltic Germans]] and to end Russification. The radical views were publicly welcomed and in December 1905, martial law was declared in Tallinn. A total of 160 manors were looted, resulting in ca. 400 workers and peasants being killed by the army. Estonian gains from the revolution were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.\n\n== Latvia ==\n[[File:Two Struggling Soldiers memorial in Riga (8228844765).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Bloody Sunday Monument in Riga on the [[Daugava]]]]\nFollowing the shooting of demonstrators in St. Petersburg, a wide-scale general strike began in [[Riga]]. On {{OldStyleDate|26 January||13 January}}, Russian army troops opened fire on demonstrators killing 73 and injuring 200 people. During the middle of 1905, the focus of revolutionary events moved to the countryside with mass meetings and demonstrations. 470 new parish administrative bodies were elected in 94% of the parishes in Latvia. The Congress of Parish Representatives was held in Riga in November. In autumn 1905, armed conflict between the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] nobility and the Latvian peasants began in the rural areas of [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] and [[Governorate of Courland|Courland]]. In Courland, the peasants seized or surrounded several towns.

Special punitive expeditions were dispatched in mid-December to suppress the movement. They executed 1170 people without trial or investigation and burned 300 peasant homes. Thousands were exiled to [[Siberia]]. Many Latvian intellectuals only escaped by fleeing to Western Europe or USA.

It included worker [[strike action|strikes]], peasant unrest, and military [[mutiny|mutinies]]. It led to constitutional reform (namely the \"[[October Manifesto]]\"), including the establishment of the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]], the [[multi-party system]], and the [[Russian Constitution of 1906]].\n\nThe 1905 revolution was spurred by the Russian defeat in the [[Russo-Japanese war]] (1904\u20131905), but also by the growing realization by the people of the need for reform, after politicians such as [[Sergei Witte]] failed to accomplish this. While the [[Nicholas II|Tsar]] managed to keep his rule, the events foreshadowed those of the [[Russian revolution]]s in 1917, which resulted in the overthrow of the monarchy, execution of the imperial family, and creation of the [[Soviet Union]] by the [[Bolsheviks]].\n\nSome historians contend that the 1905 revolution set the stage for the 1917 [[Russian Revolution]]s, and allowed for [[Bolshevism]] to emerge as a distinct political movement in Russia, although it was still a minority. [[Lenin]], as [[Premier of the Soviet Union|head of the USSR]] later on, called it \"The Great Dress Rehearsal,\" without which the \"victory of the [[October Revolution]] in 1917 would have been impossible\".<ref name=\"Ascher1994\">{{cite book|first=Abraham|last=Ascher|title=The Revolution of 1905: Russia in Disarray|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9J9Dt6EQHs8C&pg=PA1|year=1994|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-2327-5|pages=1\u20132}}</ref>\n\n==Causes==\n\nAccording to Sidney Harcave, author of ''The Russian Revolution of 1905'' (1970), four problems in Russian society contributed to the revolution. Newly emancipated peasants earned too little and were not allowed to sell or mortgage their allotted land. Ethnic minorities resented the government because of its \"Russification\", discrimination and repression, such as banning them from voting, serving in the [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] or Navy, and limiting their attendance in schools. A nascent industrial working class resented the government for doing too little to protect them, as it banned strikes and labor unions. Finally, radical ideas fomented and spread after a relaxation of discipline in the universities allowed a new consciousness to grow among students.\n\nTaken individually, these issues might not have affected the course of Russian history, but together they created the conditions for a potential revolution.<ref>{{cite book |last = Harcave |first = Sidney |title = The Russian Revolution |year = 1970 |publisher = Collier Books |location = London |oclc = 293897 }}</ref> \n<blockquote>\"At the turn of the century, discontent with the Tsar\u2019s dictatorship was manifested not only through the growth of political parties dedicated to the overthrow of the monarchy but also through industrial strikes for better wages and working conditions, protests and riots among peasants, university demonstrations, and the assassination of government officials, often done by Socialist Revolutionaries.\"<ref>{{cite book |last = Defronzo |first = James |title = Revolutions and Revolutionary Moments |year = 2011 |publisher = Westview Press |location = New York |isbn = 978-1-85109-798-2 }}</ref><!--could only find isbn for 2006 ed.--></blockquote>\n[[File:Subdivisions of the Russian Empire in 1897 (uyezd level).svg|thumb|right|250px|Subdivisions of the Russian Empire in 1897 ([[uyezd]] level)]]\nBecause the Russian economy was tied to European finances, the contraction of Western money markets in 1899\u20131900 plunged Russian industry into a deep and prolonged crisis; it outlasted the dip in European industrial production. This setback aggravated social unrest during the five years preceding the revolution of 1905.<ref name=\"skocpol\">{{cite book |last = Skocpol |first = Theda |title = States and Social Revolutions: A Comparative Analysis of France, Russia and China |url = https://archive.org/details/statessocialrevo0000skoc |url-access = registration |year = 1979 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge |pages = [https://archive.org/details/statessocialrevo0000skoc/page/93 93] |isbn = 978-0-521-22439-0 }}</ref>\n\nThe government finally recognized these problems, albeit in a shortsighted and narrow-minded way. The minister of interior [[Vyacheslav von Plehve|Plehve]] said in 1903 that, after the agrarian problem, the most serious issues plaguing the country were those of the Jews, the schools, and the workers, in that order.<ref>Harcave 1990, 21</ref>\n\nOne of the major contributing factors that changed Russia from a country in unrest to a country in revolt was \"[[Bloody_Sunday_(1905)|Bloody Sunday]]\". Loyalty to the tsar Nicholas II was lost when his soldiers fired upon people led by [[Georgy Gapon]] on 22 January 1905, who were attempting to present a petition to the tsar.\n\n===Agrarian problem===\n\nEvery year, thousands of nobles in debt mortgaged their estates to the noble land bank or sold them to municipalities, merchants, or peasants. By the time of the revolution, the nobility had sold off one-third of its land and mortgaged another third. The government hoped to make peasants\u2014freed by the [[Emancipation reform of 1861]]\u2014a politically conservative, land-holding class by enacting laws to enable them to buy land from nobility and pay small installments over many decades.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 19\">Harcave 1970, 19</ref>\n\nThe land, known as \"allotment land\", would not be owned by individual peasants, but by the community of peasants; individual peasants would have rights to strips of land that were assigned to them under the [[open field system]]. Unfortunately, a peasant could not sell or mortgage his land, so in practice he could not renounce his rights to his land and thus he would be required to pay his share of redemption dues to the village commune.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 19\" /> This plan was meant to prevent [[proletariat|proletarianisation]] of the peasants. However, the peasants were not given enough land to provide for their needs.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\">Harcave 1970, 20</ref> \"Their earnings were often so small that they could neither buy the food they needed nor keep up the payment of taxes and redemption dues they owed the government for their land allotments. By 1903 their total arrears in payments of taxes and dues was 118 million rubles.\"<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" /> The situation became worse. Masses of hungry peasants roamed the countryside looking for work and sometimes walked hundreds of kilometres to find it. Desperate peasants proved capable of violence.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" /> \"In the provinces of [[Kharkov]] and [[Poltava]] in 1902, thousands of them, ignoring restraints and authority, burst out in a rebellious fury that led to extensive destruction of property and looting of noble homes before troops could be brought to subdue and punish them.\"<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" />\n\nThese violent outbreaks caught the attention of the government, so it created many committees to investigate their causes.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 20\" /> The committees concluded that no part of the countryside was prosperous; some parts, especially the fertile areas known as \"[[Chernozem|black-soil region]]\", were in decline.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 21\">Harcave 1970, 21</ref> Although cultivated acreage had increased in the last half century, the increase had not been proportionate to the growth of peasant populations, which had doubled.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 21\" /> \"There was general agreement at the turn of the century that Russia faced a grave and intensifying agrarian crisis due mainly to rural overpopulation with an annual excess of fifteen to eighteen live births over deaths per 1,000 inhabitants.\"<ref name=pipes>{{cite book |last = Pipes |first = Richard |title = A Concise History of the Russian Revolution |year = 1996 |publisher = Vintage |location = New York |pages = 8 }}</ref> The investigations revealed many difficulties but could not find solutions that were both sensible and \"acceptable\" to the government.<ref name=\"Harcave 1970, 21\" />\n\n===Nationality problem===\n[[File:Russia ethnic.JPG|thumb|Ethnic map of European Russia before World War I]]\nRussia was a multi-ethnic empire.

After the emancipation of the serfs in 1861, the Russian state was compelled to take into account public opinion, but the government failed to gain the public's support.<ref name=\"Weeks 2004, 475\">Weeks 2004, 475</ref> Another motive for Russification policies was the [[January Uprising|Polish uprising of 1863]]. Unlike other minority nationalities, the Poles, in the eyes of the Tsar, were a direct threat to the empire's stability. After the rebellion was crushed, the government implemented policies to reduce Polish cultural influences.<ref name=\"Weeks 2004, 475\"/> In the 1870s the government began to distrust German elements on the western border. The Russian government felt that the unification of Germany would upset the power balance among the great powers of Europe and that Germany would use its strength against Russia. The government thought that the borders would be defended better if the borderland were more \"Russian\" in character.<ref>Weeks 2004, 475\u2013476</ref> The culmination of cultural diversity created a cumbersome nationality problem that plagued the Russian government in the years leading up to the revolution.\n\n===Labour problem===\n\nThe economic situation in Russia before the revolution presented a grim picture. The government had experimented with ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalist policies, but this strategy largely failed to gain traction within the Russian economy until the 1890s.

Many socialists view this as a period when the rising revolutionary movement was met with rising reactionary movements. As [[Rosa Luxemburg]] stated in ''The Mass Strike'', when collective strike activity was met with what is perceived as repression from an autocratic state, economic and political demands grew into and reinforced each other.<ref>Rosa Luxemburg, ''The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions'', 1906 [English translation Patrick Lavin, 1925]. [http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1906/mass-strike/ch04.htm Chapter 4, \"The Interaction of the Political and the Economic Struggle.\"]</ref>\n\nRussian progressives formed the Union of [[Zemstvo]] Constitutionalists in 1903 and the Union of Liberation in 1904, which called for a constitutional monarchy. Russian socialists formed two major groups: the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]], following the [[Narodnik|Russian populist]] tradition, and the [[Marxist]] [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]].\n\nIn the autumn of 1904, liberals started a series of banquets, nominally celebrating the 40th anniversary of the liberal court statutes, but actually an attempt to circumvent laws against political gatherings (modeled on the ''[[campagne des banquets]]'' leading up to the [[French Revolution of 1848]]). The banquets resulted in calls for political reforms and a constitution. On {{OldStyleDate|13 December|1904|30 November}}, the [[Moscow City Duma]] passed a resolution demanding establishment of an elected national legislature, full [[freedom of the press]], and [[freedom of religion]]. Similar resolutions and appeals from other city dumas and zemstvo councils followed.\n\nTsar [[Nicholas II]] made a move to fulfill many of these demands, appointing liberal [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky]] Minister of the Interior after the assassination of [[Vyacheslav von Plehve]]. On {{OldStyleDate|25 December|1904|12 December}}, the Tsar issued a manifesto promising the broadening of the Zemstvo and more authority local municipal councils, insurance for industrial workers, the emancipation of [[Inorodtsy]] and the abolition of censorship. The crucial demand of representative national legislature was missing in the manifesto.\n\nWorker strikes in Caucasus broke out in March 1902 and strikes on the railway originating from pay disputes took on other issues and drew in other industries, culminating in a general strike at Rostov-on-Don in November. Daily meetings of 15,000 to 20,000 heard openly revolutionary appeals for the first time, before a massacre defeated the strikes. But reaction to the massacres brought political demands to purely economic ones. Luxemburg described the situation in 1903 by saying: \"the whole of South Russia in May, June and July was aflame\",<ref>Rosa Luxemburg, ''The Mass Strike, the Political Party and the Trade Unions'', 1906 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/luxemburg/1906/mass-strike/ch03.htm Chapter 3, \"Development of the Mass Strike Movement in Russia\"].</ref> including Baku where separate wage struggles culminated in a citywide general strike, and Tiflis, where commercial workers gained a reduction in the working day, and were joined by factory workers. In 1904, massive strike waves broke out in Odessa in the spring, Kiev in July, and Baku in December. This all set the stage for the strikes in St. Petersburg in December 1904 to January 1905 seen as the first step in the 1905 revolution.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Years !!

The event became known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], and is considered by many scholars as the start of the active phase of the revolution.\n\nThe events in St. Petersburg provoked public indignation and a series of massive strikes that spread quickly throughout the industrial centers of the Russian Empire. Polish socialists\u2014both the [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]] and the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|SDKPiL]]\u2014called for a general strike. By the end of January 1905, over 400,000 workers in [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] were on strike (see [[Revolution in the Kingdom of Poland (1905\u20131907)]]). Half of European Russia's industrial workers went on strike in 1905, and 93.2% in Poland.<ref>Robert Blobaum, ''Feliks Dzierzynski and the SDKPiL: A Study of the Origins of Polish Communism'', page 123</ref> There were also strikes in [[Finland]] and the [[Baltic states|Baltic]] coast. In [[Riga]], 130 protesters were killed on {{OldStyleDate|26 January|1905|13 January}}, and in [[Warsaw]] a few days later over 100 strikers were shot on the streets. By February, there were strikes in the [[Caucasus]], and by April, in the [[Ural Mountains|Urals]] and beyond. In March, all higher academic institutions were forcibly closed for the remainder of the year, adding radical students to the striking workers. A strike by railway workers on {{OldStyleDate|21 October|1905|8 October}} quickly developed into a general strike in Saint Petersburg and Moscow. This prompted the setting up of the short-lived [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]] of Workers' Delegates, an admixture of [[Bolsheviks]] and [[Mensheviks]] headed by Khrustalev-Nossar and despite the Iskra split would see the likes of [[Julius Martov]] and [[Georgi Plekhanov]] spar with [[Lenin]].

The commission was headed by Senator NV&nbsp;Shidlovsky, a member of the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]], and included officials, chiefs of government factories, and private factory owners. It was also meant to have included workers' delegates elected according to a two-stage system. Elections of the workers delegates were, however, blocked by the socialists who wanted to divert the workers from the elections to the armed struggle. On {{OldStyleDate|5 March|1905|20 February}}, the Commission was dissolved without having started work. Following the assassination of his uncle, the [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Aleksandrovich]], on {{OldStyleDate|17 February|1905|4 February}}, the Tsar made new concessions. On {{OldStyleDate|2 March|1905|18 February}} he published the ''[[Alexander Bulygin|Bulygin Rescript]]'', which promised the formation of a consultative assembly, religious tolerance, freedom of speech (in the form of language rights for the Polish minority) and a reduction in the peasants' redemption payments.

The Tsar waited and argued for three days, but finally signed the manifesto on {{OldStyleDate|30 October|1905|17 October}}, citing his desire to avoid a massacre and his realisation that there was insufficient military force available to pursue alternative options. He regretted signing the document, saying that he felt \"sick with shame at this betrayal of the dynasty&nbsp;... the betrayal was complete\".\n\nWhen the manifesto was proclaimed, there were spontaneous demonstrations of support in all the major cities. The strikes in [[Saint Petersburg]] and elsewhere officially ended or quickly collapsed. A political [[amnesty]] was also offered. The concessions came hand-in-hand with renewed, and brutal, action against the unrest. There was also a backlash from the conservative elements of society, with right-wing attacks on strikers, left-wingers, and Jews.\n\nWhile the Russian liberals were satisfied by the [[October Manifesto]] and prepared for upcoming Duma elections, radical socialists and revolutionaries denounced the elections and called for an armed uprising to destroy the Empire.\n\n[[File:Tiflis railway strike 1905.jpg|thumb|A locomotive overturned by striking workers at the main railway depot in [[Tiflis]] in 1905]]\n\nSome of the November uprising of 1905 in [[Sevastopol]], headed by retired naval Lieutenant [[Pyotr Schmidt]], was directed against the government, while some was undirected.

The [[Trans-Baikal]] railroad fell into the hands of striker committees and demobilised soldiers returning from [[Manchuria]] after the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]]. The Tsar had to send a special detachment of loyal troops along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] to restore order.\n\nBetween {{OldStyleDate|5 and 7 December||22 and 24 November}}, there was a general strike by Russian workers.

The military remained loyal throughout the Revolution of 1905, as shown by their shooting of revolutionaries when ordered by the Tsar, making overthrow difficult. These reforms were outlined in a precursor to the Constitution of 1906 known as the [[October Manifesto]] which created the [[Imperial Duma]]. The [[Russian Constitution of 1906]], also known as the Fundamental Laws, set up a multiparty system and a limited constitutional monarchy. The revolutionaries were quelled and satisfied with the reforms, but it was not enough to prevent the [[1917 revolution]] that would later topple the Tsar's regime.\n\n===Creation of Duma and Stolypin===\nThere had been earlier attempts in establishing a Russian Duma before the October Manifesto, but these attempts faced dogged resistance.  One attempt in July 1905, called the [[Bulygin Duma]], tried to reduce the assembly into a consultative body.  It also proposed limiting voting rights to those with a higher property qualification, excluding industrial workers.  Both sides&mdash;the opposition and the conservatives&mdash;were not pleased with the results.<ref>{{cite journal |last = Sohrabi |first = Nader |date = May 1995 |title = Historicizing Revolutions: Constitutional Revolutions in the Ottoman Empire, Iran, Russia, 1905\u20131908 |jstor = 2782676 |journal = American Journal of Sociology |publisher = The University of Chicago Press |volume = 100 |issue = 6 |pages = 1424\u20131425 |doi = 10.1086/230667 }}</ref> Another attempt in August 1905 was almost successful, but that too died when Nicholas insisted on the Duma's functions be relegated to an advisory position.<ref>{{cite book |last = Sixsmith |first = Martin |title = Russia:A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East |publisher = The Overlook Press,Peter Mayer Publishers, Inc. |location = New York |isbn = 978-1-4683-0501-2 |pages = 171 |date = 31 December 2013 }}</ref> The October Manifesto, aside from granting the population the freedom of speech and assembly, proclaimed that no law would be passed without examination and approval by the [[Imperial Duma]].

A decree on 20 February 1906 transformed the [[State Council of Imperial Russia|State Council]], the advisory body, into a second chamber with legislative powers \"equal to those of the Duma\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Not only did this transformation violate the Manifesto, but the Council became a buffer zone between the tsar and Duma, slowing whatever progress the latter could achieve.  Even three days before the Duma's first session, on 24 April 1906, the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws]] further limited the assembly's movement by giving the tsar the sole power to appoint/dismiss ministers.<ref>Nader Sohrabi, Historicizing Revolutions, pages 1426</ref> Adding insult was the indication that the Tsar alone had control over many facets of political reins&mdash;all without the Duma's expressed permission.  The trap seemed perfectly set for the unsuspecting Duma: by the time the assembly convened in 27 April, it quickly found itself unable to do much without violating the Fundamental Laws.  Defeated and frustrated, the majority of the assembly voted no confidence and handed in their resignations after a few weeks on 13 May.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Nader Sohrabi, Historicizing Revolutions, pages 1427</ref>\n\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043b\u044f\u043a\u043e\u0432 - \u0422\u0440\u043e\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0447\u044c \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u044f II \u0432\u043e \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f \u043e\u0442\u043a\u0440\u044b\u0442\u0438\u044f I \u0433\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0434\u0443\u043c\u044b \u0432 \u0417\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0435\u043c \u0434\u0432\u043e\u0440\u0446\u0435.jpg|thumb|Speech by Emperor Nicholas II on the opening of the [[First State Duma]] of the Russian Empire, 27 April 1906]]\nThe attacks on the Duma were not confined to its legislative powers.  By the time the Duma opened, it was missing crucial support from its populace, thanks in no small part to the government's return to Pre-Manifesto levels of suppression.  The Soviets were forced to lay low for a long time, while the [[zemstvos]] turned against the Duma when the issue of land appropriation came up.   The issue of land appropriation was the most contentious of the Duma's appeals.  The Duma proposed that the government distribute its treasury, \"monastic and imperial lands\", and seize private estates as well.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> The Duma, in fact, was preparing to alienate some of its more affluent supporters, a decision that left the assembly without the necessary political power to be efficient.\n\nOf course, Nicholas II remained wary of having to share power with reform-minded bureaucrats.  When the pendulum in 1906 elections swung to the left, Nicholas immediately ordered the Duma's dissolution just after 73 days.<ref>Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 173</ref> Hoping to further squeeze the life out of the assembly, he appointed a tougher prime minister in [[Petr Stolypin]] as the liberal Witte's replacement.  Much to Nicholas's chagrin, Stolypin attempted to bring about acts of reform (land reform), while retaining measures favorable to the regime (stepping up the number of executions of revolutionaries).  After the revolution subsided, he was able to bring economic growth back to Russia's industries, a period which lasted until 1914.  But Stolypin's efforts did nothing to prevent the collapse of the monarchy, nor seemed to satisfy the conservatives.  Stolypin died from a bullet wound by a revolutionary, [[Dmitry Bogrov]], on 5 September 1911.<ref>Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 174</ref>\n\n===October Manifesto===\n\nEven after Bloody Sunday and defeat in the Russo-Japanese War, Nicholas II had been slow to offer a meaningful solution to the social and political crisis.  At this point, he became more concerned with his personal affairs such as the illness of his son, whose struggle with [[haemophilia]] was overseen by [[Rasputin]]. Nicholas also refused to believe that the population was demanding changes in the autocratic regime, seeing \"public opinion\" as mainly the \"intelligentsia\"<ref>Martin Sixsmith, ''Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East'', pages 171</ref> and believing himself to be the patronly 'father figure' to the Russian people. [[Sergei Witte]], the minister of Russia, frustratingly argued with the Tsar that an immediate implementation of reforms was needed to retain order in the country.  It was only after the Revolution started picking up steam that Nicholas was forced to make concessions by writing the October Manifesto.\n\nIssued on 17 October 1905, the Manifesto stated that the government would grant the population reforms such as the right to vote and to convene in assemblies.  Its main provisions were:\n# The granting of the population \"inviolable personal rights\" including freedom of conscience, speech, and assemblage\n# Giving the population who were previously cut off from doing so participation in the newly formed Duma\n# Ensuring that no law would be passed without the consent of the Imperial Duma.<ref>Martin Sixsmith, Russia: A 1,000 Year Chronicle of the Wild East, pages 171</ref>\n\nOf course, despite what seemed to be a moment for celebration for Russia's population and the reformists, the Manifesto was rife with problems.  Aside from the absence of the word \"constitution\", one issue with the manifesto was its timing.   By October 1905, Nicholas was already dealing with a revolution.  Another problem surfaced in the conscience of Nicholas himself:  Witte said in 1911 that the manifesto was written only to get the pressure off the monarch's back, that it was not a \"voluntary act\".<ref>{{cite journal |last = Kropotkin |first = G.

M. Kropotkin, ''The Ruling Bureaucracy and the \"New Order\" of Russian Statehood'', pages 9</ref>\n\nOne immediate effect it did have, for a while, was the start of the Days of Freedom, a six-week period from 17 October to early December.  This period witnessed an unprecedented level of freedom on all publications\u2014revolutionary papers, brochures, etc.\u2014even though the tsar officially retained the power to censor provocative material.  This opportunity allowed the press to address the tsar, and government officials, in a harsh, critical tone previously unheard of.  The freedom of speech also opened the floodgates for meetings and organized political parties.  In Moscow alone, over 400 meetings took place in the first four weeks.  Some of the political parties that came out of these meetings were the [[Constitutional Democrats]] (Kadets), [[Social Democrats]], [[Socialist Revolutionaries]], [[Octobrists]], and the far-rightist Union of Russian People.<ref>Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', page 1407</ref>\n\nAmong all the groups that benefited most from the Days of Freedoms were the labor unions.  In fact, the Days of Freedom witnessed unionization in the history of the Russian Empire at its apex.  At least 67 unions were established in Moscow, as well as 58 in St. Petersburg; the majority of both combined were formed in November 1905 alone.  For the [[Soviets]], it was a watershed period of time: nearly 50 of the unions in St. Petersburg came under Soviet control, while in Moscow, the Soviets had around 80000 members.  This large sector of power allowed the Soviets enough clout to form their own militias.  In St. Petersburg alone, the Soviets claimed around 6,000 armed members with the purpose of protecting the meetings.<ref>Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', pages 1407\u20131408</ref>\n\nPerhaps greatly washed up in their newfound window of opportunity, the St. Petersburg Soviets, along with other socialist parties, called for armed struggles against the Tsarist government, a war call that no doubt alarmed the government.  Not only were the workers charged up, but the Days of Freedom also had an earthquake-like effect on the peasant collective as well.  Seeing an opening in the autocracy's waning authority thanks to the Manifesto, the peasants, with a political organization, took to the streets in revolt.  In response, the government exerted its forces in campaigns to subdue and repress both the peasants and the workers.  Consequences were now in full force: with a pretext in their hands, the government spent the month of December 1905 regaining the level of authority once lost to [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]].<ref>Nader Sohrabi, ''Historicizing Revolutions'', pages 1409</ref>\n\nIronically, the writers of the October Manifesto were caught off guard by the surge in revolts.  One of the main reasons for writing the October Manifesto bordered on the government's \"fear of the revolutionary movement\".<ref name=\"G.M. Kropotkin pages 23\">G. M. Kropotkin, The Ruling Bureaucracy and the \"New Order\" of Russian Statehood, pages 23</ref> In fact, many officials believed this fear was practically the sole reason for the Manifesto's creation in the first place.  Among those more scared was [[Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov]], governor general of [[St. Petersburg]] and deputy minister of the interior.  Trepov urged Nicholas II to stick to the principles in the Manifesto, for \"every retreat&nbsp;... would be hazardous to the dynasty\".<ref name=\"G.M. Kropotkin pages 23\"/>\n\n===Russian Constitution of 1906===\nThe [[Russian Constitution of 1906]] was published on the eve of the convocation of the First Duma. The new Fundamental Law was enacted to institute promises of the October Manifesto as well as add new reforms. The Tsar was confirmed as absolute leader, with complete control of the executive, foreign policy, church, and the armed forces. The structure of the Duma was changed, becoming a lower chamber below the Council of Ministers, and was half-elected, half-appointed by the Tsar. Legislations had to be approved by the Duma, the Council, and the Tsar to become law. The Fundamental State Laws were the \"culmination of the whole sequence of events set in motion in October 1905 and which consolidated the new ''status quo''\". The introduction of The Russian Constitution of 1906 was not simply an institution of the October Manifesto. The introduction of the constitution states (and thus emphasizes) the following:\n* The Russian State is one and indivisible.\n* The [[Grand Duchy of Finland]], while comprising as inseparable part of the Russian State, is governed in its internal affairs by special decrees based on special legislation.\n* The Russian language is the common language of the state, and its use is compulsory in the army, the navy and all state and public institutions. The use of local (regional) languages and dialects in state and public institutions are determined by special legislation.\n\nThe Constitution did not mention any of the provisions of the October Manifesto. While it did enact the provisions laid out previously, its sole purpose seems again to be the propaganda for the monarchy and to simply not fall back on prior promises. The provisions and the new constitutional monarchy did not satisfy Russians and Lenin. The Constitution lasted until the fall of the empire in 1917.\n\n== Rise of Political Violence ==\nThe years 1904 and 1907 saw a decline of mass movements, strikes and protests, and a rise of overt political violence. Combat groups such as the [[SR Combat Organization]] carried out many assassinations targeting civil servants and police, and robberies. Between 1906 and 1909, revolutionaries killed 7,293 people, of whom 2,640 were officials, and wounded 8,061.<ref>Galina Mikha\u012dlovna Ivanova, Carol Apollonio Flath and Donald J.

The [[Red Guards (Finland)|Red Guards]] were formed, led by captain [[Johan Kock]]. During the general strike, the ''[[Red Declaration]]'', written by Finnish politician and journalist [[Yrj\u00f6 M\u00e4kelin]], was published in ''[[Tampere]],'' demanding dissolution of the [[Senate of Finland]], universal suffrage, [[Freedom (political)|political freedoms]], and abolition of censorship. [[Leo Mechelin]], leader of the constitutionalists, crafted the ''November Manifesto'': the revolution resulted in the abolition of the [[Diet of Finland]] and of the four [[Estates of the realm|Estates]], and to the creation of the modern [[Parliament of Finland]]. It also resulted in a temporary halt to the [[Russification of Finland|Russification policy]] that Russia had started in 1899.\n\nOn {{OldStyleDate|12 August|1906|30 July}}, Russian artillerymen and military engineers [[Sveaborg Rebellion|rose in revolt]] in the fortress of [[Sveaborg]] (later called [[Suomenlinna]]), Helsinki. The Finnish Red Guards supported the [[Sveaborg Rebellion]] with a general strike, but the mutiny was quelled within 60 hours by loyal troops and ships of the [[Baltic Fleet]].\n\n== Estonia ==\n<!--[[File:Tallinn Monument to the Revolution of 1905.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Monument to the victims of the Revolution in Tallinn]]-->\nIn the [[Governorate of Estonia]], Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal suffrage, and for national autonomy. On {{OldStyleDate|29 October||16 October}}, the Russian army opened fire in a meeting on a street market in [[Tallinn]] in which about 8 000-10 000 people participated, killing 94 and injuring over 200. The October Manifesto was supported in Estonia and the [[Estonian flag]] was displayed publicly for the first time. [[Jaan T\u00f5nisson]] used the new political freedoms to widen the rights of Estonians by establishing the first Estonian political party \u2013 ''National Progress Party''.\n\nAnother, more radical political organisation, the ''Estonian Social Democratic Workers' Union'' was founded as well. The moderate supporters of T\u00f5nisson and the more radical supporters of [[Jaan Teemant]] could not agree about how to continue with the revolution, and only agreed that both wanted to limit the rights of [[Baltic Germans]] and to end Russification. The radical views were publicly welcomed and in December 1905, martial law was declared in Tallinn. A total of 160 manors were looted, resulting in ca. 400 workers and peasants being killed by the army. Estonian gains from the revolution were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.\n\n== Latvia ==\n[[File:Two Struggling Soldiers memorial in Riga (8228844765).jpg|thumb|right|100px|Bloody Sunday Monument in Riga on the [[Daugava]]]]\nFollowing the shooting of demonstrators in St. Petersburg, a wide-scale general strike began in [[Riga]]. On {{OldStyleDate|26 January||13 January}}, Russian army troops opened fire on demonstrators killing 73 and injuring 200 people. During the middle of 1905, the focus of revolutionary events moved to the countryside with mass meetings and demonstrations. 470 new parish administrative bodies were elected in 94% of the parishes in Latvia. The Congress of Parish Representatives was held in Riga in November. In autumn 1905, armed conflict between the [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] nobility and the Latvian peasants began in the rural areas of [[Governorate of Livonia|Livonia]] and [[Governorate of Courland|Courland]]. In Courland, the peasants seized or surrounded several towns.

The [[2016 Summer Olympics|most recent Olympics]] were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) organises the Games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] event, [[gold medal]]s are awarded for first place, [[silver medal]]s are awarded for second place, and [[bronze medal]]s are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] were created out of the success of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Olympics have increased in scope from a 42 competition event programme with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]].\n\nThe Summer Olympics has been hosted on five continents by a total of nineteen countries.

The [[2024 Summer Olympics]] will be held in [[Paris]], France, for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city's last Summer Olympics in 1924. The IOC has also selected [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to host its third Summer Games in [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].\n\nTo date, only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games \u2013 [[Australia]], [[France]], Great Britain, Greece, and [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]].

Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. Female athletes were not allowed to compete, though one woman, [[Stamata Revithi]], ran the marathon course on her own, saying \"If the committee doesn't let me compete I will go after them regardless\".<ref name=Revithi>{{cite journal | author=Tarasouleas, Athanasios |date=Summer 1993 | title = The Female Spiridon Loues  | journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 11\u201312 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n3/JOHv1n3e.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1896 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, was an international [[multi-sport event]] which was celebrated in [[Athens]], Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the [[Modern era]]. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although [[Greece]] had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. 11 Americans placed first in their events vs. the 10 from Greece.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Swifter, Higher, Stronger|last = Macy|first = Sue|publisher = National Geographic|year = 2004|isbn = 0-7922-6667-6|location = Washington D.C, United States|pages = [https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16 16]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16}}</ref> [[Ancient Greece]] was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a French [[pedagogue]] and historian, in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] was also established during this congress.\n\nDespite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. [[Panathinaiko Stadium]], the first big stadium in the modern world, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<ref name=\"Y153\">Young (1996), 153 {{fcn|date=November 2019}}</ref> The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spiridon Louis]], a water carrier. He won in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds, setting off wild celebrations at the stadium. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four gold medals.\n\nGreek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nFour years later the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris attracted more than four times as many athletes, including 20 women, who were allowed to officially compete for the first time, in [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|croquet]], [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics|golf]], [[Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics|sailing]], and [[Tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics|tennis]]. The Games were integrated with the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World's Fair]] and lasted over 5 months. It is still disputed which events exactly were ''Olympic'', since few or maybe even none of the events were advertised as such at the time.\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Field (Missouri)|Francis Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] during the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]]]\n[[File:Dorando Pietri 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Dorando Pietri finishes the modern marathon at the current distance]]\n\nTensions caused by the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]] and the difficulty of getting to [[St. Louis]] may have contributed to the fact that very few top-ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]].<ref name=athletes_number>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[1906 Intercalated Games|A series of smaller games]] were held in Athens in 1906. The IOC does not currently recognise these games as being official Olympic Games, although many historians do. The 1906 Athens games were the first of an alternating series of games to be held in Athens, but the series failed to materialise. The games were more successful than the 1900 and 1904 games, with over 900 athletes competing, and contributed positively to the success of future games.\n\nThe [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 London Games]] saw numbers rise again, as well as the first running of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] over its now-standard distance of 42.195&nbsp; km (26 miles 385 yards). The first Olympic Marathon in 1896 (a male-only race) was raced at a distance of 40&nbsp; km (24 miles 85 yards). The new marathon distance was chosen to ensure that the race finished in front of the box occupied by the British royal family. Thus the marathon had been {{convert|40|km|1|abbr=on}} for the first games in 1896, but was subsequently varied by up to {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} due to local conditions such as street and stadium layout. At the six Olympic games between 1900 and 1920, the marathon was raced over six distances. The Games saw [[Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] winning 146 medals, 99 more than second-placed [[United States at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Americans]], its best result to this day.\n\nAt the end of the 1908 marathon, the Italian runner [[Dorando Pietri]] was first to enter the stadium, but he was clearly in distress and collapsed of exhaustion before he could complete the event. He was helped over the finish line by concerned race officials, but later he was disqualified, and the gold medal was awarded to [[Johnny Hayes|John Hayes]], who had trailed him by around 30 seconds.\n\nThe Games continued to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to [[1912 Summer Olympics|Stockholm in 1912]], including the great all-rounder [[Jim Thorpe]], who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, and saw his medals stripped for this 'breach' of [[Amateur sports#Olympics|amateurism]] after complaints from [[Avery Brundage]]. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 years after his death. The Games at Stockholm were the first to fulfil Pierre de Coubertin's original idea. For the first time since the Games started in 1896 were all five inhabited continents represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.\n\nThe scheduled [[1916 Summer Olympics]] were cancelled following the onset of [[World War I]].\n\n===Interwar era===\nThe [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp games]] in war-ravaged Belgium were a subdued affair, but again drew a record number of competitors. This record only stood until 1924, when the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] involved 3,000 competitors, the greatest of whom was Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]]. The \"[[Flying Finn]]\" won three team gold medals and the individual 1,500 and 5,000 meter runs, the latter two on the same day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paavo Nurmi \u2013 THE FLYING FINN \u2013 Life Story |url=https://paavonurmi.fi/en/life-story/ |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam games]] was notable for being the first games which allowed females to compete at track & field athletics, and benefited greatly from the general prosperity of the times alongside the first appearance of [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of the games, from [[the Coca-Cola Company]]. The 1928 games saw the introduction of a standard medal design with the IOC choosing [[Giuseppe Cassioli]]'s depiction of Greek goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] and a winner being carried by a crowd of people. This design was used up until 1972.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Los Angeles games]] were affected by the [[Great Depression]], which contributed to the low number of competitors.\n\nThe [[1936 Berlin Games]] were seen by the German government as a golden opportunity to promote their ideology. The ruling [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party commissioned film-maker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] to film the games. The result, ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', was widely considered to be a masterpiece, despite [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s theories of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] racial superiority being repeatedly shown up by \"non-Aryan\" athletes. In particular, African-American sprinter and long jumper [[Jesse Owens]] won four gold medals. The [[1936 Berlin Games]] also saw the introduction of the Torch Relay.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7330949.stm|title=The Olympic torch's shadowy past|publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 August 2008 | date=5 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nDue to World War II, the [[1940 Summer Olympics|Games of 1940]] (due to be held in [[Tokyo]] and temporarily relocated to [[Helsinki]] upon the outbreak of war) were cancelled. The [[1944 Summer Olympics|Games of 1944]] were due to be held in London but were also cancelled; instead, London hosted the first games after the end of the war, in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]].\n\n===After World War II===\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|first post-war Games]] were held in 1948 in London, with both Germany and Japan excluded. Dutch sprinter [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] won four gold medals on the track, emulating Owens' achievement in Berlin.\n\nAt the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Games]] in [[Helsinki]] the [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|USSR team]] competed for the first time and immediately became one of the dominant teams (finishing second both in the number of gold and overall medals won). Soviet immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\". The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|USSR]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis, hence violating amateur rules.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

Having first won both the 10,000 and 5,000-meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other leaders, Z\u00e1topek led from about halfway, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.\n\nThe [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Games]] were largely successful, barring a [[water polo]] match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, which the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] caused to end as [[Blood in the Water match|a pitched battle between the teams]]. Due to a [[foot-and-mouth disease]] outbreak in Britain at the time and the strict quarantine laws of Australia, the equestrian events were held in Stockholm.\n\nAt the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]] a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as [[Muhammad Ali]], arrived on the scene. Ali would later throw his gold medal away in disgust after being refused service in a [[Jim Crow laws|whites-only]] restaurant in his home town of [[Louisville, Kentucky]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Wallechinsky | first=David |author2=Jamie Loucky  | year=2008 | title=The Complete Book of the Olympics, 2008 Edition | publisher=[[Aurum Press]] | isbn=978-1-84513-330-6 | pages=453\u2013454 }}</ref> He was awarded a new medal 36 years later at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Olympics]] in [[Atlanta]]. Other performers of note in 1960 included [[Wilma Rudolph]], a gold medallist in the 100 meters, 200 meters and 4 \u00d7 100 meters relay events.\n\nThe [[1964 Summer Olympics|1964 Games]] held in Tokyo are notable for heralding the modern age of telecommunications. These games were the first to be broadcast worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites. The 1964 Games were thus a turning point in the global visibility and popularity of the Olympics. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka [[Anton Geesink]] created quite a stir when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating [[Akio Kaminaga]] in front of his home crowd.\n\nPerformances at the 1968 [[Mexico City]] [[1968 Summer Olympics|games]] were affected by the altitude of the host city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1968 |title=Games of the XIX Olympiad |work=olympic.org |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> The 1968 Games also introduced the now-universal [[Fosbury flop]], a technique which won American high jumper [[Dick Fosbury]] the gold medal. In the medal award ceremony for the men's 200 meter race, [[black American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] (gold) and [[John Carlos]] (bronze) took a stand for [[civil rights]] by raising their [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black-gloved fists]] and wearing black socks in lieu of shoes. They were banned by the IOC. [[V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1]], in protest to the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people but was made an outcast by the Soviet-dominated government.\n\nPolitics again intervened at [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]] in 1972, with [[Munich massacre|lethal consequences]]. A Palestinian terrorist group named [[Black September (group)|Black September]] invaded the Olympic village and broke into the apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held 9 others as hostages. The terrorists demanded that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused their demand, a tense stand-off ensued while negotiations continued. Eventually, the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the firefight that followed, 15 people, including the nine Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists, were killed. After much debate, it was decided that the Games would continue, but proceedings were obviously dominated by these events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1972 |title=Games of the XX Olympiad |work=olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer [[Mark Spitz]], [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] (of Finland)'s back-to-back gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, and the winning of three gold medals by Soviet gymnastic star [[Olga Korbut]] - who achieved a historic backflip off the high bar. Korbut, however, failed to win the all-around, losing to her teammate [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]].\n\nThere was no such tragedy in [[Montreal]] in 1976, but bad planning and fraud led to the Games' cost far exceeding the budget. [[1976 Summer Olympics|The Montreal Games]] were the most expensive in Olympic history, until the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], costing over $5&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|CA|5|1976|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|CA}}). For a time, it seemed that the Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, the belief that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, may have contributed to the delays, poor construction and excessive costs. In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia \"was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial.\"<ref>Schneider, Stephen;(April 2009).Ice: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada. p.551. {{ISBN|0-470-83500-1}}:</ref> There was also a boycott by African nations to protest against [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|a recent tour]] of [[apartheid]]-run South Africa by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]]. The Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] won the women's individual all-around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores, this giving birth to a gymnastics dynasty in [[Romania]]. She also won two other individual events, with two perfect scores in the balance beam and all perfect scores in the uneven bars. [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] repeated his double gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, making him the first athlete to ever win the distance double twice.<!--\n\nDeleted image removed: [[File:1980 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|right|Closing Ceremony of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], in Moscow, [[Soviet Union]], with bear cub [[Misha]], the mascot of that year's games, flying into the sky.]] -->\n\n===End of the 20th century===\nFollowing the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], 66 nations, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan, boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 games]] held in Moscow. Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games \u2013 the smallest number since 1956. The boycott contributed to the 1980 Games being a less publicised and less competitive affair, which was dominated by the host country.\n\nIn 1984 the Soviet Union and 13 Soviet allies reciprocated by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. [[Romania]], notably, was one of the nations in the Eastern Bloc that did attend the 1984 Olympics. These games were perhaps the first games of a new era to make a profit. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=NO BOYCOTT BLUES|url=https://www.olympic.org/los-angeles-1984|website=olympic.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}</ref> The Games were also the first time mainland China (People's Republic) participated.\n\nAccording to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".<ref name=DG2011>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 0292739575 |page= 66 }}</ref> On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

Despite splendid drug-free performances by many individuals, the number of people who failed screenings for performance-enhancing chemicals overshadowed the games.\n\nThe [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Games]] featured the admittance of players from one of the North American top leagues, the NBA, exemplified by but not limited to US basketball's \"[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]\". The 1992 games also saw the reintroduction to the Games of several smaller European states which had been incorporated into the Soviet Union since World War II. At these games, gymnast [[Vitaly Scherbo]] set an inaugural medal record of five individual gold medals at a Summer Olympics, and equaled the inaugural record set by [[Eric Heiden]] at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]].\n\nBy then the process of choosing a location for the Games had become a commercial concern; there were widespread allegations of corruption potentially affecting the IOC's decision process.\n\nAn the Atlanta [[1996 Summer Olympics]], the highlight was [[200 meters]] runner [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] annihilating the world record in front of a home crowd. Canadians savoured [[Donovan Bailey]]'s recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when [[Muhammad Ali]], clearly affected by [[Parkinson's disease]], lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place in the basketball arena. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb exploded]] during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], was arrested.\n\n[[File:Sydney olympic stadium track and field.jpg|left|thumb|The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney, Australia, known as the \"Games of the New Millennium\".]]\n\nThe [[2000 Summer Olympics]] was held in Sydney, Australia, and showcased individual performances by local favorite [[Ian Thorpe]] in the pool, Briton [[Steve Redgrave]] who won a rowing gold medal in an unprecedented fifth consecutive Olympics, and [[Cathy Freeman]], an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] whose triumph in the [[400 meters]] united a packed stadium. [[Eric Moussambani|Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani]], a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, received wide media coverage when he completed the 100 meter freestyle swim in by far the slowest time in Olympic history. He nevertheless won the heat as both his opponents had been disqualified for false starts. His female compatriot [[Paula Barila Bolopa]] also received media attention for her record-slow and struggling but courageous performance. The Sydney Games also saw the first appearance of a joint North and South Korean contingent at the opening ceremonies, though they competed as different countries. Controversy occurred in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics when the vaulting horse was set to the wrong height during the All-Around Competition.\n\n===Start of the 21st century===\nIn [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]] the Games returned to their birthplace in [[Athens]], Greece. Greece spent at least $7.2&nbsp;billion on the Games, including $1.5&nbsp;billion on security. Michael Phelps won his first medals in Olympic Games tallying 6 gold and 2 bronze medals. Pyrros Dimas, winning a bronze medal, became the most decorated weightlifter of all time with 3 golds and 1 bronze in Olympic Games.

The fencing program was expanded to include all six events for both men and women. Women had not previously been able to compete in team foil or sabre events, although women's team \u00e9p\u00e9e and men's team foil were dropped for these Games.

In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"Happy and Glorious\". The host nation won 29 gold medals, the best haul for Great Britain since the 1908 Games in London. The United States returned to the top of the medal table after China dominated in 2008. The IOC had removed [[baseball]] and [[softball]] from the 2012 program. On a commercial level, the Games were successful as they were the first in history to completely sell out every ticket, with as many as 1 million applications for 40,000 tickets for both the Opening Ceremony and the 100m Men's Sprint Final. Such was the demand for tickets to all levels of each event, there was controversy when seats set aside for sponsors and National Delegations went unused in the early days. A system of reallocation was put in place so the empty seats were filled throughout the Games.\n\n[[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil hosted the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], becoming the third city in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to host the Olympiads after Melbourne, Australia, in 1956 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000, the second city in Latin America and  first South American city to host the Olympics. The preparation for these Games was overshadowed by [[Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics|controversies]], including the political instability of Brazil's federal government; the country's economic crisis; health and safety concerns surrounding the [[Zika virus]] and significant pollution in the [[Guanabara Bay]]; and a [[Doping in Russia|state-sponsored doping scandal]] involving [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]], which affected the participation of its athletes in the Games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8282518.stm |title=BBC SPORT, Olympics, Rio to stage 2016 Olympic Games |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2009|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe [[2020 Summer Olympics|next summer games]] were originally scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9  at the [[Tokyo|Tokyo Metropolitan Region]], [[Japan]].

There is a general rule that a maximum of three individual athletes may represent each nation per competition. National Olympic Committees (NOCs) may enter a limited number of qualified competitors in each event, and the NOC decides which qualified competitors to select as representatives in each event if more have attained the benchmark than can be entered.<ref name=\"olympians\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Governance/National-Olympic-Committees/|title=National Olympic Committees (NOCs)|work=Olympic.org|publisher=[[IOC]]|access-date=21 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074558/http://www.olympic.org/en/content/The-IOC/Governance/National-Olympic-Committees/|archive-date=15 June 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nNations most often qualify teams for team sports through continental qualifying tournaments, in which each continental association is given a certain number of spots in the Olympic tournament.

This contrasts with the Winter Olympics, which ignore the cancelled Winter Games of 1940 & 1944 in their numeric count.''\n{{Refend}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col|colwidth=27em}}\n* [[List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games]]\n* [[Lists of Olympic medalists]]\n* [[Olympic Games ceremony]]\n* [[Olympic Games scandals and controversies]]\n* [[Olympic Stadium]]\n* [[Summer Paralympic Games]]\n* [[Paralympic Games]]\n* [[Winter Olympic Games]]\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.olympic.org Official Site of the Olympic Movement]\n* [http://www.bladesplace.id.au/olympic-games-candidates.html Candidate Cities for future Olympic Games]\n\n{{Olympic Games}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{Olympic Games results}}\n{{Olympic Summer Games Host Cities}}\n{{Multi-sport events}}\n{{Portal bar|Olympics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Summer Olympic Games| ]]\n[[Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1896]]\n[[Category:Olympic Games|*]]\n[[Category:Quadrennial sporting events]]\n[[Category:Summer multi-sport events]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|a list of Summer Olympic Games|#List of Summer Olympic Games{{!}}the list below}}\n{{redirect|Olympic Summer Games|the video game|Olympic Summer Games (video game)}}\n{{short description|International multi-sport event}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2014}}\n{{Infobox\n| above = Summer Olympic Games\n| bodyclass = hlist nowraplinks\n| image1= [[File:Olympic rings without rims.svg|180px]]\n| image2= [[File:Pira Ol\u00edmpica Rio 2016 -

The [[2016 Summer Olympics|most recent Olympics]] were held in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil. The [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC) organises the Games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] event, [[gold medal]]s are awarded for first place, [[silver medal]]s are awarded for second place, and [[bronze medal]]s are awarded for third place; this tradition began in 1904. The [[Winter Olympic Games]] were created out of the success of the Summer Olympics.\n\nThe Olympics have increased in scope from a 42 competition event programme with fewer than 250 male competitors from 14 nations in [[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]], to 306 events with 11,238 competitors (6,179 men, 5,059 women) from 206 nations in [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]].\n\nThe Summer Olympics has been hosted on five continents by a total of nineteen countries. The Games have been held four times in the [[United States at the Olympics|United States]] ([[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]], [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]], [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], and [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]]), three times in the [[Great Britain at the Olympics|United Kingdom]] ([[1908 Summer Olympics|1908]], [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]], and [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012]]), twice each in [[Greece at the Olympics|Greece]] ([[1896 Summer Olympics|1896]] and [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]]), [[France at the Olympics|France]] ([[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]] and [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924]]), [[Germany at the Olympics|Germany]] ([[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]] and [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972]]), and [[Australia at the Olympics|Australia]] ([[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]), and once each in [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]] ([[1912 Summer Olympics|1912]]), [[Belgium at the Olympics|Belgium]] ([[1920 Summer Olympics|1920]]), [[Netherlands at the Olympics|Netherlands]] ([[1928 Summer Olympics|1928]]), [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]] ([[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]]), [[Italy at the Olympics|Italy]] ([[1960 Summer Olympics|1960]]), [[Japan at the Olympics|Japan]] ([[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]), [[Mexico at the Olympics|Mexico]] ([[1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]), [[Canada at the Olympics|Canada]] ([[1976 Summer Olympics|1976]]), [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] ([[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]]), [[South Korea at the Olympics|South Korea]] ([[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]), [[Spain at the Olympics|Spain]] ([[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]]), [[China at the Olympics|China]] ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]), and [[Brazil at the Olympics|Brazil]] ([[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]).\n\nThe IOC has selected [[Tokyo]], Japan, for a second time, to host the [[2020 Summer Olympics]] (due to take place in 2021). The [[2024 Summer Olympics]] will be held in [[Paris]], France, for a third time, exactly one hundred years after the city's last Summer Olympics in 1924. The IOC has also selected [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to host its third Summer Games in [[2028 Summer Olympics|2028]].\n\nTo date, only five countries have participated in every Summer Olympic Games \u2013 [[Australia]], [[France]], Great Britain, Greece, and [[Switzerland at the Olympics|Switzerland]].

The other countries that have hosted the Summer Olympics are [[Belgium at the Olympics|Belgium]], [[Brazil at the Olympics|Brazil]], [[China at the Olympics|China]], [[Canada at the Olympics|Canada]], [[Finland at the Olympics|Finland]], [[Italy at the Olympics|Italy]], [[Mexico at the Olympics|Mexico]], [[Netherlands at the Olympics|Netherlands]], [[South Korea at the Olympics|South Korea]], [[Spain at the Olympics|Spain]], [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], and [[Sweden at the Olympics|Sweden]]; each of these countries has hosted the Summer Games on just one occasion.\n\n[[Asia]] has hosted the Summer Olympics three times, in Tokyo, Japan ([[1964 Summer Olympics|1964]]), [[Seoul]], South Korea ([[1988 Summer Olympics|1988]]), and [[Beijing]], China ([[2008 Summer Olympics|2008]]); Asia will host the Games for the fourth time. Tokyo was for the second time slated to be the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics; however, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, the Summer Olympics have been postponed to twelve months from the original scheduled date. Historically, the Summer Olympics has been held predominantly in [[English-speaking countries]] and [[Europe|European nations]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schaffer|first1=Kay|title=The Olympics at the Millennium: Power, Politics, and the Games|date=2000|page=271}}</ref> Tokyo will be the first city outside these regions to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice; it will also be the largest city ever to have hosted the Games, [[Tokyo#1943\u2013present|having grown considerably since 1964]].\n\nThe [[2016 Summer Olympics|2016 Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, were the inaugural Summer Olympics to be held in [[South America]] and the first that was held completely during the local \"[[winter]]\" season. The only two countries in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to have hosted the Summer Olympics have been Australia ([[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]] and [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000]]) and Brazil ([[2016 Summer Olympics|2016]]). [[Africa]] has yet to host a Summer Olympics.\n\n[[Stockholm]], Sweden, has hosted events at two Summer Olympics, having been sole host of the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Games]], and hosting the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|equestrian events]] at the [[1956 Summer Olympics]] (which they are credited as jointly hosting with [[Melbourne]], Australia).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1956|title=Melbourne / Stockholm 1956|publisher=[[IOC]] |accessdate=5 September 2008}}</ref> [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands, has also hosted events at two Summer Olympic Games, having been sole host of the [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Games]] and previously hosting two of the [[Sailing at the 1920 Summer Olympics|sailing races]] at the [[1920 Summer Olympics]].

He based his Olympics on the [[Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games]], which had been contested in [[Much Wenlock]] since 1850.<ref name=Wenlock>{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Jeffrey |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/shropshire/features/2004/08/william_penny_brookes.shtml |title=Father of the modern Olympics |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> The first edition of de Coubertin's games, held in [[1896 Summer Olympics|Athens in 1896]], attracted just 245 competitors, of whom more than 200 were Greek, and only 14 countries were represented. Nevertheless, no international events of this magnitude had been organised before. Female athletes were not allowed to compete, though one woman, [[Stamata Revithi]], ran the marathon course on her own, saying \"If the committee doesn't let me compete I will go after them regardless\".<ref name=Revithi>{{cite journal | author=Tarasouleas, Athanasios |date=Summer 1993 | title = The Female Spiridon Loues  | journal=Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 11\u201312 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n3/JOHv1n3e.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1896 Summer Olympics]], officially known as the Games of the Olympiad, was an international [[multi-sport event]] which was celebrated in [[Athens]], Greece, from 6 to 15 April 1896. It was the first Olympic Games held in the [[Modern era]]. About 100,000 people attended for the opening of the games. The athletes came from 14 nations, with most coming from Greece. Although [[Greece]] had the most athletes, the U.S. finished with the most champions. 11 Americans placed first in their events vs. the 10 from Greece.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Swifter, Higher, Stronger|last = Macy|first = Sue|publisher = National Geographic|year = 2004|isbn = 0-7922-6667-6|location = Washington D.C, United States|pages = [https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16 16]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/swifterhigherstr00macy/page/16}}</ref> [[Ancient Greece]] was the birthplace of the Olympic Games, consequently Athens was perceived to be an appropriate choice to stage the inaugural modern Games. It was unanimously chosen as the host city during a congress organised by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], a French [[pedagogue]] and historian, in Paris, on 23 June 1894. The [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] was also established during this congress.\n\nDespite many obstacles and setbacks, the 1896 Olympics were regarded as a great success. The Games had the largest international participation of any sporting event to that date. [[Panathinaiko Stadium]], the first big stadium in the modern world, overflowed with the largest crowd ever to watch a sporting event.<ref name=\"Y153\">Young (1996), 153 {{fcn|date=November 2019}}</ref> The highlight for the Greeks was the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] victory by their compatriot [[Spiridon Louis]], a water carrier. He won in 2 hours 58 minutes and 50 seconds, setting off wild celebrations at the stadium. The most successful competitor was German [[sport wrestling|wrestler]] and [[gymnastics|gymnast]] [[Carl Schuhmann]], who won four gold medals.\n\nGreek officials and the public were enthusiastic about the experience of hosting an Olympic Games. This feeling was shared by many of the athletes, who even demanded that Athens be the permanent Olympic host city. The IOC intended for subsequent Games to be rotated to various host cities around the world. The [[1900 Summer Olympics|second Olympics]] was held in Paris.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1896/ |title= 1896 Athina Summer Games |publisher= Sports Reference |accessdate=31 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nFour years later the [[1900 Summer Olympics]] in Paris attracted more than four times as many athletes, including 20 women, who were allowed to officially compete for the first time, in [[Croquet at the 1900 Summer Olympics|croquet]], [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics|golf]], [[Sailing at the 1900 Summer Olympics|sailing]], and [[Tennis at the 1900 Summer Olympics|tennis]]. The Games were integrated with the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Paris World's Fair]] and lasted over 5 months. It is still disputed which events exactly were ''Olympic'', since few or maybe even none of the events were advertised as such at the time.\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Field (Missouri)|Francis Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] during the [[1904 Summer Olympics]]]]\n[[File:Dorando Pietri 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Dorando Pietri finishes the modern marathon at the current distance]]\n\nTensions caused by the [[Russo\u2013Japanese War]] and the difficulty of getting to [[St. Louis]] may have contributed to the fact that very few top-ranked athletes from outside the US and Canada took part in the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Games]].<ref name=athletes_number>{{cite web|title=The Olympic Summer Games Factsheet|url=http://www.olympic.org/Documents/Reference_documents_Factsheets/The_Olympic_Summer_Games.pdf|publisher=International Olympic Committee|accessdate=5 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[1906 Intercalated Games|A series of smaller games]] were held in Athens in 1906. The IOC does not currently recognise these games as being official Olympic Games, although many historians do. The 1906 Athens games were the first of an alternating series of games to be held in Athens, but the series failed to materialise. The games were more successful than the 1900 and 1904 games, with over 900 athletes competing, and contributed positively to the success of future games.\n\nThe [[1908 Summer Olympics|1908 London Games]] saw numbers rise again, as well as the first running of the [[marathon (sport)|marathon]] over its now-standard distance of 42.195&nbsp; km (26 miles 385 yards). The first Olympic Marathon in 1896 (a male-only race) was raced at a distance of 40&nbsp; km (24 miles 85 yards). The new marathon distance was chosen to ensure that the race finished in front of the box occupied by the British royal family. Thus the marathon had been {{convert|40|km|1|abbr=on}} for the first games in 1896, but was subsequently varied by up to {{convert|2|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} due to local conditions such as street and stadium layout. At the six Olympic games between 1900 and 1920, the marathon was raced over six distances. The Games saw [[Great Britain at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Great Britain]] winning 146 medals, 99 more than second-placed [[United States at the 1908 Summer Olympics|Americans]], its best result to this day.\n\nAt the end of the 1908 marathon, the Italian runner [[Dorando Pietri]] was first to enter the stadium, but he was clearly in distress and collapsed of exhaustion before he could complete the event. He was helped over the finish line by concerned race officials, but later he was disqualified, and the gold medal was awarded to [[Johnny Hayes|John Hayes]], who had trailed him by around 30 seconds.\n\nThe Games continued to grow, attracting 2,504 competitors, to [[1912 Summer Olympics|Stockholm in 1912]], including the great all-rounder [[Jim Thorpe]], who won both the decathlon and pentathlon. Thorpe had previously played a few games of baseball for a fee, and saw his medals stripped for this 'breach' of [[Amateur sports#Olympics|amateurism]] after complaints from [[Avery Brundage]]. They were reinstated in 1983, 30 years after his death. The Games at Stockholm were the first to fulfil Pierre de Coubertin's original idea. For the first time since the Games started in 1896 were all five inhabited continents represented with athletes competing in the same stadium.\n\nThe scheduled [[1916 Summer Olympics]] were cancelled following the onset of [[World War I]].\n\n===Interwar era===\nThe [[1920 Summer Olympics|1920 Antwerp games]] in war-ravaged Belgium were a subdued affair, but again drew a record number of competitors. This record only stood until 1924, when the [[1924 Summer Olympics|Paris Games]] involved 3,000 competitors, the greatest of whom was Finnish runner [[Paavo Nurmi]]. The \"[[Flying Finn]]\" won three team gold medals and the individual 1,500 and 5,000 meter runs, the latter two on the same day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paavo Nurmi \u2013 THE FLYING FINN \u2013 Life Story |url=https://paavonurmi.fi/en/life-story/ |accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam games]] was notable for being the first games which allowed females to compete at track & field athletics, and benefited greatly from the general prosperity of the times alongside the first appearance of [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship of the games, from [[the Coca-Cola Company]]. The 1928 games saw the introduction of a standard medal design with the IOC choosing [[Giuseppe Cassioli]]'s depiction of Greek goddess [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] and a winner being carried by a crowd of people. This design was used up until 1972.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Los Angeles games]] were affected by the [[Great Depression]], which contributed to the low number of competitors.\n\nThe [[1936 Berlin Games]] were seen by the German government as a golden opportunity to promote their ideology. The ruling [[Nazism|Nazi]] Party commissioned film-maker [[Leni Riefenstahl]] to film the games. The result, ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'', was widely considered to be a masterpiece, despite [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s theories of [[Aryan race|Aryan]] racial superiority being repeatedly shown up by \"non-Aryan\" athletes. In particular, African-American sprinter and long jumper [[Jesse Owens]] won four gold medals. The [[1936 Berlin Games]] also saw the introduction of the Torch Relay.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7330949.stm|title=The Olympic torch's shadowy past|publisher=BBC |accessdate=4 August 2008 | date=5 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nDue to World War II, the [[1940 Summer Olympics|Games of 1940]] (due to be held in [[Tokyo]] and temporarily relocated to [[Helsinki]] upon the outbreak of war) were cancelled. The [[1944 Summer Olympics|Games of 1944]] were due to be held in London but were also cancelled; instead, London hosted the first games after the end of the war, in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]].\n\n===After World War II===\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|first post-war Games]] were held in 1948 in London, with both Germany and Japan excluded. Dutch sprinter [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] won four gold medals on the track, emulating Owens' achievement in Berlin.\n\nAt the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Games]] in [[Helsinki]] the [[USSR at the Summer Olympics|USSR team]] competed for the first time and immediately became one of the dominant teams (finishing second both in the number of gold and overall medals won). Soviet immediate success might be explained by the advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\". The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|USSR]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but many of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis, hence violating amateur rules.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976117-1,00.html|title=Traditions Pro Vs.

Having first won both the 10,000 and 5,000-meter races, he also entered the marathon, despite having never previously raced at that distance. Pacing himself by chatting with the other leaders, Z\u00e1topek led from about halfway, slowly dropping the remaining contenders to win by two and a half minutes, and completed a trio of wins.\n\nThe [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Melbourne Games]] were largely successful, barring a [[water polo]] match between Hungary and the Soviet Union, which the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Soviet invasion of Hungary]] caused to end as [[Blood in the Water match|a pitched battle between the teams]]. Due to a [[foot-and-mouth disease]] outbreak in Britain at the time and the strict quarantine laws of Australia, the equestrian events were held in Stockholm.\n\nAt the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]] a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as [[Muhammad Ali]], arrived on the scene.

These games were the first to be broadcast worldwide on television, enabled by the recent advent of communication satellites. The 1964 Games were thus a turning point in the global visibility and popularity of the Olympics. Judo debuted as an official sport, and Dutch judoka [[Anton Geesink]] created quite a stir when he won the final of the open weight division, defeating [[Akio Kaminaga]] in front of his home crowd.\n\nPerformances at the 1968 [[Mexico City]] [[1968 Summer Olympics|games]] were affected by the altitude of the host city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1968 |title=Games of the XIX Olympiad |work=olympic.org |publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> The 1968 Games also introduced the now-universal [[Fosbury flop]], a technique which won American high jumper [[Dick Fosbury]] the gold medal. In the medal award ceremony for the men's 200 meter race, [[black American]] athletes [[Tommie Smith]] (gold) and [[John Carlos]] (bronze) took a stand for [[civil rights]] by raising their [[1968 Olympics Black Power salute|black-gloved fists]] and wearing black socks in lieu of shoes. They were banned by the IOC. [[V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1]], in protest to the 1968 [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviet-led invasion]] of [[Czechoslovakia]] and the controversial decision by the judges on the [[Balance Beam]] and [[Floor (gymnastics)|Floor]], turned her head down and away from the [[Soviet]] flag whilst the anthem played during the medal ceremony. She returned home as a heroine of the Czechoslovak people but was made an outcast by the Soviet-dominated government.\n\nPolitics again intervened at [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich]] in 1972, with [[Munich massacre|lethal consequences]]. A Palestinian terrorist group named [[Black September (group)|Black September]] invaded the Olympic village and broke into the apartment of the Israeli delegation. They killed two Israelis and held 9 others as hostages. The terrorists demanded that Israel release numerous prisoners. When the Israeli government refused their demand, a tense stand-off ensued while negotiations continued. Eventually, the captors, still holding their hostages, were offered safe passage and taken to an airport, where they were ambushed by German security forces. In the firefight that followed, 15 people, including the nine Israeli athletes and five of the terrorists, were killed. After much debate, it was decided that the Games would continue, but proceedings were obviously dominated by these events.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.org/uk/games/past/index_uk.asp?OLGT=1&OLGY=1972 |title=Games of the XX Olympiad |work=olympic.org|publisher=International Olympic Committee |accessdate=6 May 2006}}</ref> Some memorable athletic achievements did occur during these Games, notably the winning of a then-record seven gold medals by United States swimmer [[Mark Spitz]], [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] (of Finland)'s back-to-back gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, and the winning of three gold medals by Soviet gymnastic star [[Olga Korbut]] - who achieved a historic backflip off the high bar. Korbut, however, failed to win the all-around, losing to her teammate [[Ludmilla Tourischeva]].\n\nThere was no such tragedy in [[Montreal]] in 1976, but bad planning and fraud led to the Games' cost far exceeding the budget. [[1976 Summer Olympics|The Montreal Games]] were the most expensive in Olympic history, until the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], costing over $5&nbsp;billion (equivalent to ${{Inflation|CA|5|1976|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|CA}}). For a time, it seemed that the Olympics might no longer be a viable financial proposition. In retrospect, the belief that contractors (suspected of being members of the Montreal Mafia) skimmed large sums of money from all levels of contracts while also profiting from the substitution of cheaper building materials of lesser quality, may have contributed to the delays, poor construction and excessive costs. In 1988, one such contractor, Giuseppe Zappia \"was cleared of fraud charges that resulted from his work on Olympic facilities after two key witnesses died before testifying at his trial.\"<ref>Schneider, Stephen;(April 2009).Ice: The Story of Organized Crime in Canada. p.551. {{ISBN|0-470-83500-1}}:</ref> There was also a boycott by African nations to protest against [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|a recent tour]] of [[apartheid]]-run South Africa by the [[New Zealand national rugby union team]]. The Romanian gymnast [[Nadia Com\u0103neci]] won the women's individual all-around gold medal with two of four possible perfect scores, this giving birth to a gymnastics dynasty in [[Romania]]. She also won two other individual events, with two perfect scores in the balance beam and all perfect scores in the uneven bars. [[Lasse Vir\u00e9n]] repeated his double gold in the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters, making him the first athlete to ever win the distance double twice.<!--\n\nDeleted image removed: [[File:1980 Summer Olympics Closing Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=0.65|right|Closing Ceremony of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], in Moscow, [[Soviet Union]], with bear cub [[Misha]], the mascot of that year's games, flying into the sky.]] -->\n\n===End of the 20th century===\nFollowing the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]], 66 nations, including the United States, Canada, West Germany, and Japan, boycotted the [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980 games]] held in Moscow. Eighty nations were represented at the Moscow Games \u2013 the smallest number since 1956. The boycott contributed to the 1980 Games being a less publicised and less competitive affair, which was dominated by the host country.\n\nIn 1984 the Soviet Union and 13 Soviet allies reciprocated by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles. [[Romania]], notably, was one of the nations in the Eastern Bloc that did attend the 1984 Olympics. These games were perhaps the first games of a new era to make a profit. Although a boycott led by the Soviet Union depleted the field in certain sports, 140 National Olympic Committees took part, which was a record at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=NO BOYCOTT BLUES|url=https://www.olympic.org/los-angeles-1984|website=olympic.org|access-date=2017-01-06}}</ref> The Games were also the first time mainland China (People's Republic) participated.\n\nAccording to British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]], a [[KGB]] colonel stated that the agency's officers had posed as anti-doping authorities from the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] to undermine [[doping test]]s and that Soviet athletes were \"rescued with [these] tremendous efforts\".<ref name=DG2011>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0292739575 |title= Drug Games: The International Olympic Committee and the Politics of Doping |first= Thomas M. |last= Hunt |year= 2011 |publisher= University of Texas Press |isbn= 0292739575 |page= 66 }}</ref> On the topic of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], a 1989 Australian study said \"There is hardly a medal winner at the Moscow Games, certainly not a gold medal winner, who is not on one sort of drug or another: usually several kinds.

Despite splendid drug-free performances by many individuals, the number of people who failed screenings for performance-enhancing chemicals overshadowed the games.\n\nThe [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Games]] featured the admittance of players from one of the North American top leagues, the NBA, exemplified by but not limited to US basketball's \"[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]\". The 1992 games also saw the reintroduction to the Games of several smaller European states which had been incorporated into the Soviet Union since World War II. At these games, gymnast [[Vitaly Scherbo]] set an inaugural medal record of five individual gold medals at a Summer Olympics, and equaled the inaugural record set by [[Eric Heiden]] at the [[1980 Winter Olympics]].\n\nBy then the process of choosing a location for the Games had become a commercial concern; there were widespread allegations of corruption potentially affecting the IOC's decision process.\n\nAn the Atlanta [[1996 Summer Olympics]], the highlight was [[200 meters]] runner [[Michael Johnson (sprinter)|Michael Johnson]] annihilating the world record in front of a home crowd. Canadians savoured [[Donovan Bailey]]'s recording gold medal run in the 100-meter dash. This was popularly felt to be an appropriate recompense for the previous national disgrace involving Ben Johnson. There were also emotional scenes, such as when [[Muhammad Ali]], clearly affected by [[Parkinson's disease]], lit the Olympic torch and received a replacement medal for the one he had discarded in 1960. The latter event took place in the basketball arena. The atmosphere at the Games was marred, however, when a [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing|bomb exploded]] during the celebration in Centennial Olympic Park. In June 2003, the principal suspect in this bombing, [[Eric Robert Rudolph]], was arrested.\n\n[[File:Sydney olympic stadium track and field.jpg|left|thumb|The [[2000 Summer Olympics]] held in Sydney, Australia, known as the \"Games of the New Millennium\".]]\n\nThe [[2000 Summer Olympics]] was held in Sydney, Australia, and showcased individual performances by local favorite [[Ian Thorpe]] in the pool, Briton [[Steve Redgrave]] who won a rowing gold medal in an unprecedented fifth consecutive Olympics, and [[Cathy Freeman]], an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] whose triumph in the [[400 meters]] united a packed stadium. [[Eric Moussambani|Eric \"the Eel\" Moussambani]], a swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, received wide media coverage when he completed the 100 meter freestyle swim in by far the slowest time in Olympic history. He nevertheless won the heat as both his opponents had been disqualified for false starts. His female compatriot [[Paula Barila Bolopa]] also received media attention for her record-slow and struggling but courageous performance. The Sydney Games also saw the first appearance of a joint North and South Korean contingent at the opening ceremonies, though they competed as different countries. Controversy occurred in the Women's Artistic Gymnastics when the vaulting horse was set to the wrong height during the All-Around Competition.\n\n===Start of the 21st century===\nIn [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004]] the Games returned to their birthplace in [[Athens]], Greece. Greece spent at least $7.2&nbsp;billion on the Games, including $1.5&nbsp;billion on security. Michael Phelps won his first medals in Olympic Games tallying 6 gold and 2 bronze medals. Pyrros Dimas, winning a bronze medal, became the most decorated weightlifter of all time with 3 golds and 1 bronze in Olympic Games. Although unfounded reports of potential terrorism drove crowds away from the preliminary competitions of the first weekend of the games (14\u201315 August), attendance picked up as the games progressed. A third of the tickets failed to sell,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2008-07-28-olympics-tickets_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Tickets to Olympic events in Beijing sold out | date=28 July 2008 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}</ref> but ticket sales still topped figures from Seoul and Barcelona Olympics.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} IOC President Jacques Rogge characterised Greece's organisation as outstanding and its security precautions as flawless.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/3609818.stm | publisher=BBC | title=Rogge hails Athens success | date=29 August 2004 | accessdate=19 August 2016}}</ref> The Athens Games witnessed all 202 NOCs participate with over 11,000 participants.\n\nThe [[2008 Summer Olympics]] was held in Beijing, People's Republic of China. Several new events were held, including the new discipline of [[BMX]] for both men and women. For the first time, women competed in the [[steeplechase (athletics)|steeplechase]]. The fencing program was expanded to include all six events for both men and women. Women had not previously been able to compete in team foil or sabre events, although women's team \u00e9p\u00e9e and men's team foil were dropped for these Games. Marathon swimming events, over the distance of {{convert|10|km|1|abbr=on}}, were added. In addition, the doubles events in table tennis were replaced by team events.<ref name=2008program>{{cite news |url = http://olympic.org/uk/news/olympic_news/full_story_uk.asp?id=1797 |title = Beijing 2008: Games program Finalized |publisher=International Olympic Committee |date = 27 April 2006 |accessdate =10 May 2006}}</ref> American swimmer [[Michael Phelps]] set a record for gold medals at a single Games with eight, and tied the record of most gold medals by a single competitor previously held by both Heiden and Scherbo. Another major star of the Games was Jamaican sprinter [[Usain Bolt]], who became the first male athlete ever to set world records in the finals of both the 100 and 200&nbsp; metres in the same Games. Equestrian events were held in Hong Kong.\n\nLondon held the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], becoming the first city to host the Olympic Games three times. In his closing address, Jacques Rogge described the Games as \"Happy and Glorious\". The host nation won 29 gold medals, the best haul for Great Britain since the 1908 Games in London. The United States returned to the top of the medal table after China dominated in 2008. The IOC had removed [[baseball]] and [[softball]] from the 2012 program. On a commercial level, the Games were successful as they were the first in history to completely sell out every ticket, with as many as 1 million applications for 40,000 tickets for both the Opening Ceremony and the 100m Men's Sprint Final. Such was the demand for tickets to all levels of each event, there was controversy when seats set aside for sponsors and National Delegations went unused in the early days. A system of reallocation was put in place so the empty seats were filled throughout the Games.\n\n[[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil hosted the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], becoming the third city in the [[Southern Hemisphere]] to host the Olympiads after Melbourne, Australia, in 1956 and Sydney, Australia, in 2000, the second city in Latin America and  first South American city to host the Olympics. The preparation for these Games was overshadowed by [[Concerns and controversies at the 2016 Summer Olympics|controversies]], including the political instability of Brazil's federal government; the country's economic crisis; health and safety concerns surrounding the [[Zika virus]] and significant pollution in the [[Guanabara Bay]]; and a [[Doping in Russia|state-sponsored doping scandal]] involving [[Russia at the 2016 Summer Olympics|Russia]], which affected the participation of its athletes in the Games.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/olympic_games/8282518.stm |title=BBC SPORT, Olympics, Rio to stage 2016 Olympic Games |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2009|accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref> \n\nThe [[2020 Summer Olympics|next summer games]] were originally scheduled to take place from July 24 to August 9  at the [[Tokyo|Tokyo Metropolitan Region]], [[Japan]].

There is a general rule that a maximum of three individual athletes may represent each nation per competition.

Surfactants may act as [[detergent]]s, [[wetting]] agents, [[emulsion#Emulsifiers|emulsifiers]], [[foaming agent]]s, and [[dispersant]]s.\n\n{{toc limit|4}}\n\n==Etymology and definition==\n{{wikt | surfactant}}\nThe word ''surfactant'' is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''surface-active agent''.<ref name=\"Rosen MJ\">\n{{Cite book\n |vauthors= Rosen MJ, Kunjappu JT |lastauthoramp= yes\n |title= Surfactants and Interfacial Phenomena\n |edition= 4th |year= 2012\n |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=1rCdNIzB78AC&printsec=frontcover\n |isbn= 978-1-118-22902-6 |location= Hoboken, New Jersey\n |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |page= 1 |url-status= live\n |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170108051750/https://books.google.com/books?id=1rCdNIzB78AC&printsec=frontcover\n |archive-date= 8 January 2017 |df= dmy-all \n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[United States National Library of Medicine]]'s [[Medical Subject Headings |Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)]] vocabulary reserves ''surfactant'' for the meaning \"[[pulmonary surfactant]]\". For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.\n\n[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

The toxicity of [[Quaternary ammonium cation|quaternary ammonium compounds]], which are [[antibacterial]] and [[antifungal]], varies. Dialkyldimethylammonium chlorides ([[DDAC]], [[DSDMAC]]) used as [[fabric softener]]s have low [[LD50]] (5 g/kg) and are essentially non-toxic, while the [[disinfectant]] alkylbenzyldimethylammonium chloride has an LD50 of 0.35 g/kg. Prolonged exposure to surfactants can irritate and damage the skin because surfactants disrupt the [[lipid membrane]] that protects skin and other cells. Skin irritancy generally increases in the series non-ionic, amphoteric, anionic, cationic surfactants.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nSurfactants are routinely deposited in numerous ways on land and into water systems, whether as part of an intended process such as environmental remediation and enhanced oil recovery applications<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mohammadnejad|first=Hamed|last2=Liao|first2=Shuchi|last3=Marion|first3=Bonnie A.|last4=Pennell|first4=Kurt D|last5=Abriola|first5=Linda M.|date=2020-03-27|title=Development and validation of a two-stage kinetic sorption model for polymer and surfactant transport in porous media|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.0c00123|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|language=en|pages=acs.est.0c00123|doi=10.1021/acs.est.0c00123|issn=0013-936X}}</ref> or as industrial and household waste.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network. The process has been successfully used to prepare organs such as the liver and heart for transplant in rats.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|title=Progress Toward an Artificial Liver Transplant&nbsp;\u2013 NIH Research Matters|last=Wein|first=Harrison|date=28 June 2010|publisher=National Institutes of Health (NIH)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120805083144/http://www.nih.gov/researchmatters/june2010/06282010liver.htm|archive-date=5 August 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Pulmonary surfactant]]s are also naturally secreted by type II cells of the lung [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in [[mammals]].\n\n===Quantum dot preparation===\nSurfactants are used with [[quantum dot]]s in order to manipulate growth.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Synthesis and Characterization of Monodisperse Nanocrystals and Close-Packed Nanocrystal Assemblies |journal=Annual Review of Materials Research |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=545\u2013610 |year=2000 |doi=10.1146/annurev.matsci.30.1.545|bibcode = 2000AnRMS..30..545M |last1=Murray |first1=C.

For the more general meaning, ''surface active agent/s'' is the heading.\n\n[[Image:Micelle scheme-en.svg|thumb|right|[[Schematic]] diagram of a [[micelle]]&nbsp;\u2013 the [[lipophilic]] tails of the surfactant ions remain inside the oil because they interact more strongly with oil than with water. The [[Chemical polarity|polar]] \"heads\" of the surfactant molecules coating the micelle interact more strongly with water, so they form a [[hydrophilic]] outer layer that forms a barrier between micelles. This inhibits the oil droplets, the hydrophobic cores of micelles, from merging into fewer, larger droplets (\"emulsion breaking\") of the micelle. The compounds that coat a micelle are typically [[amphiphilic]] in nature, meaning that micelles may be stable either as droplets of aprotic solvents such as oil in water, or as protic solvents such as water in oil. When the droplet is aprotic it is sometimes{{when|date=February 2019}} known as a reverse micelle.]]\n\n==Composition and structure==\nSurfactants are usually [[organic compound]]s that are [[amphiphilic]], meaning they contain both [[hydrophobic]] groups (their ''tails'') and [[hydrophilic]] groups (their ''heads'').<ref name=\"The Lipid Chronicles\">{{cite web|title=Bubbles, Bubbles, Everywhere, But Not a Drop to Drink|url=http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|work=The Lipid Chronicles|access-date=1 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426082602/http://www.samuelfurse.com/2011/11/bubbles-bubbles-everywhere-but-not-a-drop-to-drink/|archive-date=26 April 2012|df=dmy-all|date=2011-11-11}}</ref> Therefore, a surfactant contains both a water-insoluble (or oil-soluble) component and a water-soluble component. Surfactants will diffuse in water and [[Adsorption|adsorb]] at [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]] between air and water or at the interface between oil and water, in the case where water is mixed with oil. The water-insoluble hydrophobic group may extend out of the bulk water phase, into the air or into the oil phase, while the water-soluble head group remains in the water phase.\n\nWorld production of surfactants is estimated at 15 Mton/y, of which about half are [[soap]]s.  Other surfactants produced on a particularly large scale are linear [[alkylbenzene sulfonates]] (1700 kton/y), [[lignin sulfonate]]s (600 kton/y), [[fatty alcohol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (700 ktons/y), and [[alkylphenol]] [[ethoxylate]]s (500 kton/y).<ref name=Ullmann>Kurt Kosswig \"Surfactants\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2005, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a25_747}}</ref>\n[[File:sodium stearate.png|thumb|Sodium stearate, the most common component of most soap, which comprises about 50% of commercial surfactants]]\n[[File:Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate skeletal.svg|Sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate.png|thumb|4-(5-Dodecyl) benzenesulfonate, a linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, one of the most common surfactants]]\n\n===Structure of surfactant phases in water===\nIn the bulk aqueous phase, surfactants form aggregates, such as [[micelles]], where the hydrophobic tails form the core of the aggregate and the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the surrounding liquid. Other types of aggregates can also be formed, such as spherical or cylindrical micelles or [[lipid bilayer]]s. The shape of the aggregates depends on the chemical structure of the surfactants, namely the balance in size between the hydrophilic head and hydrophobic tail. A measure of this is the [[hydrophilic-lipophilic balance]] (HLB).Surfactants reduce the [[surface tension]] of water by [[Adsorption|adsorbing]] at the liquid-air interface. The relation that links the surface tension and the surface excess is known as the [[Gibbs isotherm]].\n\n===Dynamics of surfactants at interfaces===\nThe dynamics of surfactant adsorption is of great importance for practical applications such as in foaming, emulsifying or coating processes, where bubbles or drops are rapidly generated and need to be stabilized. The dynamics of adsorption depend on the [[diffusion coefficient]] of the surfactant. As the interface is created, the adsorption is limited by the diffusion of the surfactant to the interface. In some cases, there can exist an energetic barrier to adsorption or desorption of the surfactant. If such a barrier limits the adsorption rate, the dynamics are said to be \u2018kinetically limited'. Such energy barriers can be due to steric or electrostatic repulsions.\nThe [[surface rheology]] of surfactant layers, including the elasticity and viscosity of the layer, play an important role in the stability of foams and emulsions.\n\n===Characterization of interfaces and surfactant layers===\nInterfacial and surface tension can be characterized by classical methods such as the\n-pendant or [[spinning drop method]].\nDynamic surface tensions, i.e. surface tension as a function of time, can be obtained by the [[Maximum bubble pressure method|maximum bubble pressure apparatus]]\n\nThe structure of surfactant layers can be studied by [[ellipsometry]] or X-Ray reflectivity.\n\n[[Surface rheology]] can be characterized by the oscillating drop method or shear surface rheometers such as double-cone, double-ring or magnetic rod shear surface rheometer.\n\n==Classification==\nThe \"tails\" of most surfactants are fairly similar, consisting of a [[hydrocarbon]] chain, which can be branched, linear, or aromatic. [[Fluorosurfactant]]s have [[fluorocarbon]] chains. [[Siloxane surfactant]]s have [[siloxane]] chains.\n\nMany important surfactants include a polyether chain terminating in a highly [[Chemical polarity|polar]] anionic group. The polyether groups often comprise ethoxylated ([[polyethylene oxide]]-like) sequences inserted to increase the hydrophilic character of a surfactant. [[Polypropylene oxide]]s conversely, may be inserted to increase the lipophilic character of a surfactant.\n\nSurfactant molecules have either one tail or two; those with two tails are said to be ''double-chained''.\n\n[[File:TensideHyrophilHydrophob.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Surfactant classification according to the composition of their head: non-ionic, anionic, cationic, amphoteric.]]\n\nMost commonly, surfactants are classified according to polar head group. A non-ionic surfactant has no charged groups in its head. The head of an ionic surfactant carries a net positive, or negative charge. If the charge is negative, the surfactant is more specifically called anionic; if the charge is positive, it is called cationic. If a surfactant contains a head with two oppositely charged groups, it is termed [[Zwitterion|zwitterionic]].  Commonly encountered surfactants of each type include:\n\n===Anionic: sulfate, sulfonate, and phosphate, carboxylate derivatives ===\n[[Anion]]ic surfactants contain anionic functional groups at their head, such as [[organosulfate|sulfate]], [[sulfonate]], [[phosphate]], and [[carboxylic acid|carboxylate]]s.\nProminent alkyl sulfates include [[ammonium lauryl sulfate]], [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (sodium dodecyl sulfate, SLS, or SDS), and the related alkyl-ether sulfates [[sodium laureth sulfate]] (sodium lauryl ether sulfate or SLES), and [[sodium myreth sulfate]].\n\nOthers include:\n*[[Docusate]] (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate) \n*[[perfluorooctanesulfonic acid|Perfluorooctanesulfonate]] (PFOS)\n*[[Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid|Perfluorobutanesulfonate]]\n* Alkyl-aryl ether phosphates\n* Alkyl ether phosphates\n\nCarboxylates are the most common surfactants and comprise the carboxylate salts (soaps), such as [[sodium stearate]].  More specialized species include [[sodium lauroyl sarcosinate]] and carboxylate-based fluorosurfactants such as [[perfluorononanoic acid|perfluorononanoate]], [[Perfluorooctanoic acid|perfluorooctanoate]] (PFOA or PFO).\n\n===Cationic head groups===\npH-dependent primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s; primary and secondary amines become positively charged at pH < 10:<ref>{{Cite web | title = Bordwell pKa Table (Acidity in DMSO) | url = http://www.chem.wisc.edu/areas/reich/pkatable/index.htm | date =  2012| accessdate =|first = Hans J.|last = Reich|publisher = University of Wisconsin }}</ref> [[octenidine dihydrochloride]].\n\nPermanently charged [[quaternary ammonium salts]]: [[cetrimonium bromide]] (CTAB), [[cetylpyridinium chloride]] (CPC), [[benzalkonium chloride]] (BAC), [[benzethonium chloride]] (BZT), [[dimethyldioctadecylammonium chloride]], and [[DODAB|dioctadecyldimethylammonium bromide]] (DODAB).\n\n===Zwitterionic surfactants===\n[[Zwitterion]]ic ([[amphoteric]]) surfactants have both cationic and anionic centers attached to the same molecule.  The cationic part is based on primary, secondary, or tertiary [[amine]]s or quaternary ammonium cations.  The anionic part can be more variable and include sulfonates, as in the [[hydroxysultaine|sultaines]] [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]] (3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate) and [[cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine]]. [[Betaine]]s such as [[cocamidopropyl betaine]] have a carboxylate with the ammonium. The most common biological zwitterionic surfactants have a phosphate anion with an amine or ammonium, such as the [[phospholipids]] [[phosphatidylcholine|phosphatidylserine]], [[phosphatidylethanolamine]], [[phosphatidylcholine]], and [[sphingomyelin]]s.\n\n=== Non-ionic ===\n\nNon-ionic surfactants have covalently bonded oxygen-containing hydrophilic groups, which are bonded to hydrophobic parent structures. The water-solubility of the oxygen groups is the result of [[hydrogen bonding]]. Hydrogen bonding decreases with increasing temperature, and the water solubility of non-ionic surfactants therefore decreases with increasing temperature.\n\nNon-ionic surfactants are less sensitive to water hardness than anionic surfactants, and they foam less strongly. The differences between the individual types of non-ionic surfactants are slight, and the choice is primarily governed having regard to the costs of special properties (e.g., effectiveness and efficiency, toxicity, dermatological compatibility, [[biodegradation|biodegradability]]) or permission for use in food.<ref name=\"Ullmann\" />\n\n==== Ethoxylates ====\n\n===== Fatty alcohol ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Narrow-range ethoxylate]]\n* [[Octaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n* [[Pentaethylene glycol monododecyl ether]]\n\n===== Alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEs or APEOs) =====\n\n* [[Nonoxynols]]\n* [[Triton X-100]]\n\n===== Fatty acid ethoxylates =====\nFatty acid ethoxylates are a class of very versatile surfactants, which combine in a single molecule the characteristic of a weakly anionic, pH-responsive head group with the presence of stabilizing and temperature responsive ethyleneoxide units.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chiappisi|first=Leonardo|date=December 2017|title=Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether carboxylic acids: An overview of a neglected class of surfactants with multiresponsive properties|journal=Advances in Colloid and Interface Science|volume=250|pages=79\u201394|doi=10.1016/j.cis.2017.10.001|pmid=29056232}}</ref>\n\n===== Special ethoxylated fatty esters and oils =====\n\n===== Ethoxylated amines and/or fatty acid amides =====\n\n* [[Polyethoxylated tallow amine]]\n* [[Cocamide monoethanolamine]]\n* [[Cocamide diethanolamine]]\n\n===== Terminally blocked ethoxylates =====\n\n* [[Poloxamer]]s\n\n==== Fatty acid esters of polyhydroxy compounds ====\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of glycerol =====\n\n* [[Glycerol monostearate]]\n* [[Glycerol monolaurate]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sorbitol =====\n\n[[Sorbitan#Esters|Spans]]:\n\n* [[Sorbitan monolaurate]] \n* [[Sorbitan monostearate]] \n* [[Sorbitan tristearate]]\n\n[[Polysorbate|Tweens]]:\n\n* [[Tween 20]]\n* [[Tween 40]]\n* [[Tween 60]]\n* [[Tween 80]]\n\n===== Fatty acid esters of sucrose =====\n\n===== Alkyl polyglucosides =====\n{{main|Alkyl polyglycoside}}\n* [[Decyl glucoside]]\n* [[Lauryl glucoside]]\n* [[Octyl glucoside]]\n\n==== Amine oxides ====\n\n* [[Lauryldimethylamine oxide]]\n\n==Surfactants in biology==\n[[Image:1-Oleoyl-2-almitoyl-phosphatidylcholine Structural Formulae V.1.png|thumb|300px|[[Phosphatidylcholine]], found in lecithin, is a pervasive biological surfactant.

Popular surfactants in the biochemistry laboratory are [[sodium lauryl sulfate]] (SDS) and [[cetyl trimethylammonium bromide]] (CTAB). Detergents are key reagents to [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extract]] protein by lysis of the cells and tissues: They disorganize the membrane's lipidic bilayer (SDS, [[Triton X-100]], [[Triton X-114|X-114]], [[CHAPS detergent|CHAPS]], [[Cholate|DOC]], and [[NP-40]]), and solubilize proteins. Milder detergents such as [[n-Octyl beta-D-thioglucopyranoside|octyl thioglucoside]], [[octyl glucoside]] or [[maltosides|dodecyl maltoside]] are used to solubilize membrane proteins such as [[enzymes]] and [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] without [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturing]] them. Non-solubilized material is harvested by centrifugation or other means. For [[electrophoresis]], for example, proteins are classically treated with SDS to denature the native [[protein structure|tertiary and quaternary structures]], allowing the separation of proteins according to their [[molecular weight]].\n\nDetergents have also been used to decellularise organs. This process maintains a matrix of proteins that preserves the structure of the organ and often the microvascular network.

|1|mm|inch| abbr=off| sp=us}} wide and composed of just two things:\n[[Ectoderm|skin cells]] and [[Cardiac muscle cell|heart muscle cells]], both of which are derived from [[Stem cell|stem cells]] harvested from early ([[Blastula|blastula stage]]) frog embryos.<ref name=PNAS />\nThe skin cells provide rigid support and the heart cells act as small motors, contracting and expanding in volume to propel the xenobot forward.\nThe shape of a xenobot's body, and its distribution of skin and heart cells, are automatically designed in simulation to perform a specific task, using a process of trial and error (an [[Evolutionary algorithm|evolutionary algorithm]]).\nXenobots have been designed to walk, swim, push pellets, carry payloads, and work together in a swarm to aggregate debris scattered along the surface of their dish into neat piles.\nThey can survive for weeks without food and heal themselves after lacerations.<ref name=PNAS />\n\n== Potential Applications ==\n\nCurrently, xenobots are primarily used as a scientific tool to understand how cells cooperate to build complex bodies during [[morphogenesis]].<ref name=Wired />\nHowever, the behavior and [[biocompatibility]] of current xenobots suggest several potential applications to which they may be put in the future.\n\nGiven that xenobots composed of solely of frog cells, they are biodegradable.\nAnd as swarms of xenobots tend to work together to push microscopic pellets in their dish into central piles,<ref name=PNAS />\nit has been speculated that future xenobots might be able do the same thing with [[microplastics]] in the ocean: \nfind and aggregate tiny bits of plastic into a large ball of plastic that a traditional boat or drone can gather and bring to a recycling center.\nUnlike traditional technologies, xenobots do not add additional pollution as they work and degrade: \nthey behave using energy from fat and protein naturally stored in their tissue, which lasts about a week, at which point they simply turn into dead skin cells.<ref name=PNAS />\n\nIn future clinical applications, such as targeted drug delivery, xenobots could be made from a human patient\u2019s own cells, which would bypass the immune response challenges of other kinds of [[microbots|micro-robotic]] delivery systems. \nSuch xenobots could potentially be used to scrape plaque from [[Artery|arteries]], and with additional cell types and bioengineering, locate and treat disease.\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Artificial life]]\n[[Category:Futures studies]]\n[[Category:Emerging

Periodically, the show was taken on the road and broadcast from various other locations across the [[United States]]. The show was broadcast weekly, each Saturday at 10:00 AM [[time zone|CT]] ([[UTC-6]]) for two hours, and repeated throughout the week by syndication. Since the beginning of 2009, the entire show has also been available over the Internet as a [[podcast]]. The show aired its final WPR/PRI radio broadcast on June 25, 2016, with prior episodes archived on the show's website. Starting in the fall of 2016, Whad'ya Know became available online as a podcast.<ref>[http://www.wpr.org/wpr-michael-feldman-will-end-production-michael-feldmans-whadya-know-june-30-2016 \"WPR & Michael Feldman Will End Production Of \"Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know?\" On June 30, 2016\"]. Wisconsin Public Radio, March 3, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Game format==\nJust as Feldman's quickness and comedic rhythms are reminiscent of [[Groucho Marx]], the game is reminiscent of Marx's ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' quiz show in that it is designed more to give the host a chance to interact with the players than to be a serious test of their knowledge. Feldman often comments that the ''Whad'Ya Know'' quiz is not a trivia quiz, but rather one of \"general knowledge.\" When the show is recorded from its home base at Monona Terrace in Madison, Wisconsin, the call-in number used is 1-800-942-5669. With this number, the announcer would also give the telephonic [[mnemonic]] 1-800-WHA-KNOW or 1-800-WHAK-NOW. While on the road, phone number changes are handled in the same fashion, often resulting in humorous, nonsensical words or phrases.\n\nTwice during the show, usually towards the end of each hour, the ''Whad'ya Know'' quiz is played. The game is played with a two-member team: the first member being selected by Feldman from the audience, and the second from a radio audience caller. The caller must correctly answer a qualifying question before being added to the team.\n\nThe two contestants then play the main game. To win, they must answer three questions correctly before getting three wrong. Six categories for questions are presented:\n*Current Events\n*People\n*Places\n*Things You Should Have Learned In School (Had You Been Paying Attention)\n*Science\n*Odds and Ends\n\nThe players take turns choosing a category for each question, beginning with the call-in player.  Feldman reads the questions (often multiple-choice), and the team collaborates to come up with an answer. If correct, the team earns one point.  Teams are kept apprised of their point status by the announcer. When the team earns three points, bells signal that they have won the game.  To ensure that the team will win, Feldman frequently offers hints or slyly lets them know when they are on the wrong track.  As a result, it is rare for a team to lose.\n\nThe winning team is awarded a set of prizes. If a team earns three points without missing a single question, they have the option of going for the \"[[Mother lode|Mother Lode]]\" by answering two more questions correctly without missing one, or else a fictitious penalty is put upon them (usually made up on the spot by the announcer and related to a joke from earlier in the show). If successful (and they almost always are), the contestants win a larger prize package\u2014once called \"The Giant Kielbasa\", but that term has fallen out of use.\n\n==Segments==\nAlong with the Whad'Ya Know Quiz, music from the Whad'Ya Know Trio (often new arrangements or original compositions), and interviews with both celebrities and audience members, other segments have become recurring staples to the show's format.\n\n===All the News that Isn't===\nThe show traditionally opens with a parody reading of \"All the News that Isn't,\" a list of fictional headlines taken from real current events.  If the show is on the road, the headlines will typically involve local headlines from the city and state in which the show is being broadcast.\n\n===Disclaimers===\nPrior to the playing of the first Quiz, an audience member is given a list of the four disclaimers to read, which state who can or cannot play the quiz. The disclaimers, read on the air every week, remain constant, with the exception of disclaimer 2, which is a short joke referencing a current event:\n\n#\"All questions used on ''Whad'ya Know?'' have been painstakingly researched, although the answers have not.  Ambiguous, misleading, or poorly worded questions are par for the course.  Listeners who are sticklers for the truth should get their own shows.\"\n#Here the audience member reads a short statement making light of a current event. (Sometimes this quip takes the third position rather than the second.)\n#\"Persons employed by the [[Public Radio International|International House of Radio]] or its member stations are lucky to be working at all, let alone tying up the office phones trying to play the quiz.  Listeners who have won recently should sit on their hands and let someone else have a chance for a change.\"\n#\"All opinions expressed on ''Whad'ya Know?'' are well-reasoned and insightful.  Needless to say, they are not those of the International House of Radio, its member stations, or lackeys.  Anyone who says otherwise is itching for a fight.\"\n\n===Thanks for the memos===\nUsually at the beginning of the show's second hour, Feldman reads some \"actual memos sent in to us by actual listeners\" that often contain some sort of humorous content or [[blooper]]. This section of the show is not limited to [[memorandum|memoranda]] per se, but also includes [[typographical error|typos]] in newspaper headlines and other publications.\n\n===Town of the week===\nEach week at the end of the show, a town (selected on the prior week's show by an audience member throwing a dart at a rearranged map of the United States) is honored as the Town of the Week. The announcer gives a biographical description of the town, usually including the history of the town, famous landmarks, local sports teams, and other must-see places (with Feldman frequently interjecting comments). Feldman then has a phone conversation with a randomly selected citizen of that town to further discuss what life is like there.\n\nAs this is usually the last portion of the show, following the second Quiz session, this part of the show is frequently postponed when time runs out. This has led to many towns waiting for their chance to be honored for many weeks on end.\n\n===Whad'Ya Idol===\nDuring March 2007, ''Whad'Ya Know'' featured a special program, \"Whad'Ya Idol\".  Contestants sent in short song clips and listeners voted.  The winner, Aaron Kaufman, performed his song, \"All My Life\", live on the show on April 14.  The three other finalists were \"The Girl with the Cotton Candy Hair\" by Oliver Brown, \"Drinking Her Pretty\" by Pedro Peterson, and \"The Faith Within\" by J Scott Rakozy.\n\n==Related products==\n[[Out of the Box Publishing]] has produced a spin-off party game, ''Whad'Ya Know'', designed by its co-founder, [[John Kovalic]].  On former shows, this game has sometimes been added to the prizes awarded to the winners of the quiz.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.notmuch.com''Whad\u2019Ya Know?'' official website (archived)]\n* ''[http://www.audible.com/wyk  Whad'ya Know?]'' at [[Audible.com]]\n* [https://whadyaknow.net/ ''Whad'ya Know? 2.0'' official website]\n\n{{Public Radio International}}\n\n[[Category:1985 radio programme debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:1990s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:2000s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:2010s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:American comedy radio programs]]\n[[Category:Public Radio International programs]]\n[[Category:Wisconsin culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{italic title}}\n{{Infobox radio show\n| show_name          = Whad'Ya Know\n| image              = Whad'YaKnowLogo.png\n| imagesize          = 140px\n| caption            = \n| format             = Quiz/comedy\n| audio_format       = [[Stereophonic]]\n| record_location    = [[Monona Terrace]]<br>[[Madison, Wisconsin]]\n| runtime            = c. 110 min.\n| creator            = \n| developer          = \n| producer           = \n| executive_producer = \n| presenter          = [[Michael Feldman]]\n| announcer          = [[Jim Packard (radio host)|Jim Packard]] (1985\u20132012)<br />Sara Nics (2012-2015)<br />Stephanie Lee (2015-2016)\n| opentheme          = \n| endtheme           = \n| country            = United States\n| language           = [[English language|English]]\n| home_station       = [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] (1985\u20132016)\n| syndicates         = [[Public Radio International]] (1985\u20132016)\n| first_aired        = 1985\n| last_aired         = ''present''\n| num_episodes       = \n| website            = [https://whadyaknow.net/ www.whadyaknow.net]\n| podcast            = '''[https://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510012 Podcast]'''\n}}\n\n'''''Whad'Ya Know?'''''

Since the beginning of 2009, the entire show has also been available over the Internet as a [[podcast]]. The show aired its final WPR/PRI radio broadcast on June 25, 2016, with prior episodes archived on the show's website. Starting in the fall of 2016, Whad'ya Know became available online as a podcast.<ref>[http://www.wpr.org/wpr-michael-feldman-will-end-production-michael-feldmans-whadya-know-june-30-2016 \"WPR & Michael Feldman Will End Production Of \"Michael Feldman's Whad'Ya Know?\" On June 30, 2016\"]. Wisconsin Public Radio, March 3, 2016.</ref>\n\n==Game format==\nJust as Feldman's quickness and comedic rhythms are reminiscent of [[Groucho Marx]], the game is reminiscent of Marx's ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' quiz show in that it is designed more to give the host a chance to interact with the players than to be a serious test of their knowledge. Feldman often comments that the ''Whad'Ya Know'' quiz is not a trivia quiz, but rather one of \"general knowledge.\" When the show is recorded from its home base at Monona Terrace in Madison, Wisconsin, the call-in number used is 1-800-942-5669. With this number, the announcer would also give the telephonic [[mnemonic]] 1-800-WHA-KNOW or 1-800-WHAK-NOW. While on the road, phone number changes are handled in the same fashion, often resulting in humorous, nonsensical words or phrases.\n\nTwice during the show, usually towards the end of each hour, the ''Whad'ya Know'' quiz is played. The game is played with a two-member team: the first member being selected by Feldman from the audience, and the second from a radio audience caller. The caller must correctly answer a qualifying question before being added to the team.\n\nThe two contestants then play the main game. To win, they must answer three questions correctly before getting three wrong. Six categories for questions are presented:\n*Current Events\n*People\n*Places\n*Things You Should Have Learned In School (Had You Been Paying Attention)\n*Science\n*Odds and Ends\n\nThe players take turns choosing a category for each question, beginning with the call-in player.  Feldman reads the questions (often multiple-choice), and the team collaborates to come up with an answer. If correct, the team earns one point.  Teams are kept apprised of their point status by the announcer. When the team earns three points, bells signal that they have won the game.  To ensure that the team will win, Feldman frequently offers hints or slyly lets them know when they are on the wrong track.  As a result, it is rare for a team to lose.\n\nThe winning team is awarded a set of prizes. If a team earns three points without missing a single question, they have the option of going for the \"[[Mother lode|Mother Lode]]\" by answering two more questions correctly without missing one, or else a fictitious penalty is put upon them (usually made up on the spot by the announcer and related to a joke from earlier in the show). If successful (and they almost always are), the contestants win a larger prize package\u2014once called \"The Giant Kielbasa\", but that term has fallen out of use.\n\n==Segments==\nAlong with the Whad'Ya Know Quiz, music from the Whad'Ya Know Trio (often new arrangements or original compositions), and interviews with both celebrities and audience members, other segments have become recurring staples to the show's format.\n\n===All the News that Isn't===\nThe show traditionally opens with a parody reading of \"All the News that Isn't,\" a list of fictional headlines taken from real current events.  If the show is on the road, the headlines will typically involve local headlines from the city and state in which the show is being broadcast.\n\n===Disclaimers===\nPrior to the playing of the first Quiz, an audience member is given a list of the four disclaimers to read, which state who can or cannot play the quiz. The disclaimers, read on the air every week, remain constant, with the exception of disclaimer 2, which is a short joke referencing a current event:\n\n#\"All questions used on ''Whad'ya Know?'' have been painstakingly researched, although the answers have not.  Ambiguous, misleading, or poorly worded questions are par for the course.  Listeners who are sticklers for the truth should get their own shows.\"\n#Here the audience member reads a short statement making light of a current event. (Sometimes this quip takes the third position rather than the second.)\n#\"Persons employed by the [[Public Radio International|International House of Radio]] or its member stations are lucky to be working at all, let alone tying up the office phones trying to play the quiz.  Listeners who have won recently should sit on their hands and let someone else have a chance for a change.\"\n#\"All opinions expressed on ''Whad'ya Know?'' are well-reasoned and insightful.  Needless to say, they are not those of the International House of Radio, its member stations, or lackeys.  Anyone who says otherwise is itching for a fight.\"\n\n===Thanks for the memos===\nUsually at the beginning of the show's second hour, Feldman reads some \"actual memos sent in to us by actual listeners\" that often contain some sort of humorous content or [[blooper]]. This section of the show is not limited to [[memorandum|memoranda]] per se, but also includes [[typographical error|typos]] in newspaper headlines and other publications.\n\n===Town of the week===\nEach week at the end of the show, a town (selected on the prior week's show by an audience member throwing a dart at a rearranged map of the United States) is honored as the Town of the Week. The announcer gives a biographical description of the town, usually including the history of the town, famous landmarks, local sports teams, and other must-see places (with Feldman frequently interjecting comments). Feldman then has a phone conversation with a randomly selected citizen of that town to further discuss what life is like there.\n\nAs this is usually the last portion of the show, following the second Quiz session, this part of the show is frequently postponed when time runs out. This has led to many towns waiting for their chance to be honored for many weeks on end.\n\n===Whad'Ya Idol===\nDuring March 2007, ''Whad'Ya Know'' featured a special program, \"Whad'Ya Idol\".  Contestants sent in short song clips and listeners voted.  The winner, Aaron Kaufman, performed his song, \"All My Life\", live on the show on April 14.  The three other finalists were \"The Girl with the Cotton Candy Hair\" by Oliver Brown, \"Drinking Her Pretty\" by Pedro Peterson, and \"The Faith Within\" by J Scott Rakozy.\n\n==Related products==\n[[Out of the Box Publishing]] has produced a spin-off party game, ''Whad'Ya Know'', designed by its co-founder, [[John Kovalic]].  On former shows, this game has sometimes been added to the prizes awarded to the winners of the quiz.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.notmuch.com''Whad\u2019Ya Know?'' official website (archived)]\n* ''[http://www.audible.com/wyk  Whad'ya Know?]'' at [[Audible.com]]\n* [https://whadyaknow.net/ ''Whad'ya Know? 2.0'' official website]\n\n{{Public Radio International}}\n\n[[Category:1985 radio programme debuts]]\n[[Category:1980s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:1990s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:2000s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:2010s American radio programs]]\n[[Category:American comedy radio programs]]\n[[Category:Public Radio International programs]]\n[[Category:Wisconsin culture]]\n", "name_user": "Stefanmedia", "label": "safe", "comment": "Changed \"Was\" to lowercase at the very beginning of the article.
