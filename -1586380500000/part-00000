{"title_page": "Life estate", "text_new": "{{Property law}}\n\nIn [[common law]] and [[statutory law]], a '''life estate''' (or life tenancy) is the ownership of land for the duration of a person's life.  In legal terms, it is an [[estate (law)|estate]] in [[real property]] that ends at death when ownership of the property may revert to the original owner, or it may pass to another person.  The owner of a life estate is called a \"life tenant\".\n\nIn the combined jurisdiction of England and Wales [[Law of Property Act 1925|since 1925]] a freehold estate intended to be 'held' as a life interest takes effect only as an interest enjoyed in equity, specifically as an [[interest in possession trust]].  The other type of land ownership is leasehold and although most long leases are for a period of between 99 and [[999 year lease|999 years]] 'leases for life' will be interpreted in often unpredictable ways as either as a licence or a lease.\n\n==Principles==\n{{refimprove|date = July 2015}}\nThe ownership of a life estate is of limited duration because it ends at the death of a person. Its owner is the '''life tenant''' (typically also the 'measuring life') and it carries with it right to enjoy certain benefits of ownership of the property, chiefly income derived from rent or other uses of the property and the right of occupation, during his or her possession.  Because a life estate ceases to exist at the death of the measuring person's life, the life tenant, a temporary owner, may short-term let but cannot sell, give or bequeath the property indefinitely (including assuming it could pass to [[heir]]s ([[intestate]])) or creating a purported document leaving it to [[devisee]]s ([[testate]]).\n\nA life estate ''[[pur autre vie]]'' ([[Law French]], \"for the life of another\") is held for the rest of the lifetime of a person who does not hold the estate.  This form of life estate arises where a life tenant has disposed of the property, assuming such a disposal does not trigger any special forfeiture under the life interest instrument.  It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the measuring life that of someone other than the life tenant's life. A life estate ''pur autre vie'' is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.\n*First, when the owner of property conveys his interest in that property to another person, for the life of a third person. For example, if A conveys land to B during the life of C, then B owns the land for as long as C lives; if B dies before C, B's heirs will inherit the land, and will continue to own it for as long as C lives.\n*Second, if A conveys land to C for life, C can then sell the life estate to B. Again, B and B's heirs will own the land for as long as C lives.\n*In either scenario, once C dies, the ownership of the land will revert to A. If A has died, ownership will revert to A's heirs. The right to succeed to ownership of the property upon the expiration of the life estate is called a ''remainder''.  The remainder interest may be granted to a third party (A to B for life, with a remainder interest in C), or it may remain with the grantor.\n\nA clear distinction should be made with an [[leasehold estate|estate for (a) term of years]], interpreted as lease or licence.\n\nAt death, assuming no mis-dealings to certain innocent purchasers, the property involved in a life estate falls into the ownership of the [[remainderman]] ({{abbreviation|pl.|plural}} ''remaindermen'') or reverts to its grantor (all of which confusingly can be called 'reversions' and 'reversioners').  There is a small market for reversions in real estate, which necessitates a buyer to carry out enhanced documentary due diligence and physical checks.<ref>[http://www.mortgageintroducer.com/blogengine/post/Home-reversions-and-their-place-in-the-market.aspx Home Reversions and their place in the market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325212949/http://mortgageintroducer.com/blogengine/post/Home-reversions-and-their-place-in-the-market.aspx |date=2015-03-25 }} Chris Prior. ''Mortgage Introducer'' 18 February 2014.  Retrieved 2015-03-12</ref>\n\nA land owner of an estate cannot give a \"greater interest\" in the estate than he or she owns.  That is, a life estate owner cannot give complete and indefinite ownership ([[fee simple]]) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when the person who is the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's life [an embedded life estate], then Charlie's life estate interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or ''pur autre vie'' interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons under the terms of the will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as \"A conveys X to B until A dies\" and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.\n\nIf a life tenant purports to transfer the underlying 'reversionary' interest, which a life tenant never has, this constitutes an actionable breach of trust for damages and may constitute criminal [[fraud]] however may not entitle the ultimate reversioner (or substituted beneficiaries) to be able to obtain a court declaration that the property is their own if that property is in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value without notice ([[bona fide purchaser]]).\n\nFinancial and physical responsibility falls to the life tenant under the legal doctrine of [[waste (law)|waste]], which prohibits life tenants from damaging or devaluing the asset.  In short, as the life tenant's ownership is temporary, failing to maintain or reasonably protect the asset resulting in its diminution in value, or indeed, destruction constitutes a cause of action for the reversioner.\n\nA further limitation is the [[rule against perpetuities]] in many states and countries which prohibits long-running pre-19th-century style successions of life tenancies and may result in the premature and compensation-entitling termination of such successive life interests.  In England and Wales this is fixed at one lifetime, or 80 years whichever is longer.\n\nSelling property while keeping a life estate is commonly known in France as \"'''viager'''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33326787|title=The deal to sell your home and get paid to stay|last=Williamson|first=Lucy|date=2015-07-01|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref> where it is used more often than elsewhere, most famously in the case of [[Jeanne Calment]], the longest lived human ever recorded.\n\n==Uses of a life estate==\nIn the United States, a life estate is typically used as a tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid [[probate]] and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. An advantage of such a transfer is that it makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A disadvantage is the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill, if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, he could sell the estate prematurely to an [[bona fide purchaser|innocent purchaser]] such as when Al is on vacation. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. \"Beneficiary deeds\" have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.\n\nThe intestacy laws of certain American states, such as [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/AR/ARintcalc.htm Arkansas], [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/DE/DEintcalc.htm Delaware], and [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/RI/RIintcalc.htm Rhode Island] limit the surviving spouse's rights (inheritance) to the deceased spouse's real estate to a life estate.  [[Louisiana]], applying [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], has a similar default provision in intestate successions for community property called a [[usufruct]], which is only over community property and ends with the earlier of death or remarriage.\n\nThe intestacy laws of England and Wales from 1 October 2014 provide for \u00a3250,000 (or the whole non-joint estate if less) and 50% of any excess to the spouse, remainder to adult children.  This abolished the remaining 50% being enjoyed as a life interest which had applied from the 1920s.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/20/wills-inheritance-changes-intestacy-rules \"Family Finances: Wills and inheritance: how changes to the intestacy rules affect you\"] Jill Papworth and Patrick Collinson.  Retrieved 2015-03-12.</ref>\n\nThe surviving spouse (and rarely, others) benefit from [[concurrent estate|survivorship]] of any joint property.\n\nThe arrangement in the first paragraph would in the UK be interpreted as an interest in possession trust and is usually avoided as for inheritance tax is considered 'reservation of benefit' requiring fully backdated sums of annual income tax on whatever market rent ought to have been paid to the legal owner, in England and Wales for continued enjoyment of the asset.<ref name=tcgt/>\n\n==Duration of a life estate==\nLife estates are measured either by the life of the property recipient (''pur sa vie''), or by the life of some other person (''pur autre vie'').\n\n==Validity of a life estate==\n{{see also|Equity (law)|Maxims of equity}}\n\n===At law and in equity (US)===\nLife estates in real estate are still created today.

In legal terms, it is an [[estate (law)|estate]] in [[real property]] that ends at death when ownership of the property may revert to the original owner, or it may pass to another person.  The owner of a life estate is called a \"life tenant\".\n\nIn the combined jurisdiction of England and Wales [[Law of Property Act 1925|since 1925]] a freehold estate intended to be 'held' as a life interest takes effect only as an interest enjoyed in equity, specifically as an [[interest in possession trust]].  The other type of land ownership is leasehold and although most long leases are for a period of between 99 and [[999 year lease|999 years]] 'leases for life' will be interpreted in often unpredictable ways as either as a licence or a lease.\n\n==Principles==\n{{refimprove|date = July 2015}}\nThe ownership of a life estate is of limited duration because it ends at the death of a person. Its owner is the '''life tenant''' (typically also the 'measuring life') and it carries with it right to enjoy certain benefits of ownership of the property, chiefly income derived from rent or other uses of the property and the right of occupation, during his or her possession.  Because a life estate ceases to exist at the death of the measuring person's life, the life tenant, a temporary owner, may short-term let but cannot sell, give or bequeath the property indefinitely (including assuming it could pass to [[heir]]s ([[intestate]])) or creating a purported document leaving it to [[devisee]]s ([[testate]]).\n\nA life estate ''[[pur autre vie]]'' ([[Law French]], \"for the life of another\") is held for the rest of the lifetime of a person who does not hold the estate.  This form of life estate arises where a life tenant has disposed of the property, assuming such a disposal does not trigger any special forfeiture under the life interest instrument.  It also arises where the grantor chooses to make the measuring life that of someone other than the life tenant's life. A life estate ''pur autre vie'' is most commonly created in one of two circumstances.\n*First, when the owner of property conveys his interest in that property to another person, for the life of a third person. For example, if A conveys land to B during the life of C, then B owns the land for as long as C lives; if B dies before C, B's heirs will inherit the land, and will continue to own it for as long as C lives.\n*Second, if A conveys land to C for life, C can then sell the life estate to B. Again, B and B's heirs will own the land for as long as C lives.\n*In either scenario, once C dies, the ownership of the land will revert to A. If A has died, ownership will revert to A's heirs. The right to succeed to ownership of the property upon the expiration of the life estate is called a ''remainder''.  The remainder interest may be granted to a third party (A to B for life, with a remainder interest in C), or it may remain with the grantor.\n\nA clear distinction should be made with an [[leasehold estate|estate for (a) term of years]], interpreted as lease or licence.\n\nAt death, assuming no mis-dealings to certain innocent purchasers, the property involved in a life estate falls into the ownership of the [[remainderman]] ({{abbreviation|pl.|plural}} ''remaindermen'') or reverts to its grantor (all of which confusingly can be called 'reversions' and 'reversioners').  There is a small market for reversions in real estate, which necessitates a buyer to carry out enhanced documentary due diligence and physical checks.<ref>[http://www.mortgageintroducer.com/blogengine/post/Home-reversions-and-their-place-in-the-market.aspx Home Reversions and their place in the market] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325212949/http://mortgageintroducer.com/blogengine/post/Home-reversions-and-their-place-in-the-market.aspx |date=2015-03-25 }} Chris Prior. ''Mortgage Introducer'' 18 February 2014.  Retrieved 2015-03-12</ref>\n\nA land owner of an estate cannot give a \"greater interest\" in the estate than he or she owns.  That is, a life estate owner cannot give complete and indefinite ownership ([[fee simple]]) to another person because the life tenant's ownership in the property ends when the person who is the measuring life dies. For instance, if Ashley conveyed to Bob for the life of Bob, and Bob conveys a life estate to another person, Charlie, for Charlie's life [an embedded life estate], then Charlie's life estate interest would last only until Charlie or Bob dies. Charlie's life interest or ''pur autre vie'' interest (interest for the life of another, whichever has applied) and most often the remaining rights of ownership in the property (the 'reversionary interest') devolve to the persons under the terms of the will/rules of intestacy/declaration of trust/trust deed (UK) or will/rules of intestacy/'grant or deed of life interest' (or similar) (U.S.) in remainder or revert to the original grantee, depending on terms of Ashley. Such a life estate in the U.S. can also be conveyed for the life of the grantor, such as \"A conveys X to B until A dies\" and in the UK by trust transferring upon trust or assigning rather than conveying X.\n\nIf a life tenant purports to transfer the underlying 'reversionary' interest, which a life tenant never has, this constitutes an actionable breach of trust for damages and may constitute criminal [[fraud]] however may not entitle the ultimate reversioner (or substituted beneficiaries) to be able to obtain a court declaration that the property is their own if that property is in the hands of an innocent purchaser for value without notice ([[bona fide purchaser]]).\n\nFinancial and physical responsibility falls to the life tenant under the legal doctrine of [[waste (law)|waste]], which prohibits life tenants from damaging or devaluing the asset.  In short, as the life tenant's ownership is temporary, failing to maintain or reasonably protect the asset resulting in its diminution in value, or indeed, destruction constitutes a cause of action for the reversioner.\n\nA further limitation is the [[rule against perpetuities]] in many states and countries which prohibits long-running pre-19th-century style successions of life tenancies and may result in the premature and compensation-entitling termination of such successive life interests.  In England and Wales this is fixed at one lifetime, or 80 years whichever is longer.\n\nSelling property while keeping a life estate is commonly known in France as \"'''viager'''\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-33326787|title=The deal to sell your home and get paid to stay|last=Williamson|first=Lucy|date=2015-07-01|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=1 July 2015}}</ref> where it is used more often than elsewhere, most famously in the case of [[Jeanne Calment]], the longest lived human ever recorded.\n\n==Uses of a life estate==\nIn the United States, a life estate is typically used as a tool of an estate planning. A life estate can avoid [[probate]] and ensure that an intended heir will receive title to real property. For example, Al owns a home and desires that Bill inherit it after Al's death. Al can effectuate that desire by transferring title to the home to Bill and retaining a life estate in the home. Al keeps a life estate and Bill receives a vested fee simple remainder. As soon as Al dies, the life estate interest merges with Bill's remainder, and Bill has a fee simple title. An advantage of such a transfer is that it makes the use of a will unnecessary and eliminates the need to probate the asset. A disadvantage is the small risk of a fraud on the part of beneficiary Bill, if he could easily show in a particular jurisdiction an unfettered fee simple, he could sell the estate prematurely to an [[bona fide purchaser|innocent purchaser]] such as when Al is on vacation. A second disadvantage to the grantor is that provision for any remainderman (or men) (party C) is irrevocable without the remainderman's consent. \"Beneficiary deeds\" have been statutorily created in some states to address this issue.\n\nThe intestacy laws of certain American states, such as [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/AR/ARintcalc.htm Arkansas], [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/DE/DEintcalc.htm Delaware], and [http://www.mystatewill.com/states/RI/RIintcalc.htm Rhode Island] limit the surviving spouse's rights (inheritance) to the deceased spouse's real estate to a life estate.  [[Louisiana]] applying an itemised ([[civil law (legal system)|civil law]]) code has alike default provisions for succession, called [[usufruct]].\n\nThe intestacy laws of England and Wales from 1 October 2014 provide for \u00a3250,000 (or the whole non-joint estate if less) and 50% of any excess to the spouse, remainder to adult children.  This abolished the remaining 50% being enjoyed as a life interest which had applied from the 1920s.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/sep/20/wills-inheritance-changes-intestacy-rules \"Family Finances: Wills and inheritance: how changes to the intestacy rules affect you\"] Jill Papworth and Patrick Collinson.  Retrieved 2015-03-12.</ref>\n\nThe surviving spouse (and rarely, others) benefit from [[concurrent estate|survivorship]] of any joint property.\n\nThe arrangement in the first paragraph would in the UK be interpreted as an interest in possession trust and is usually avoided as for inheritance tax is considered 'reservation of benefit' requiring fully backdated sums of annual income tax on whatever market rent ought to have been paid to the legal owner, in England and Wales for continued enjoyment of the asset.<ref name=tcgt/>\n\n==Duration of a life estate==\nLife estates are measured either by the life of the property recipient (''pur sa vie''), or by the life of some other person (''pur autre vie'').\n\n==Validity of a life estate==\n{{see also|Equity (law)|Maxims of equity}}\n\n===At law and in equity (US)===\nLife estates in real estate are still created today.

He would serve as the Prime Minister for three successive ministries and parliamentary terms until his resignation on 27 June 2007. His Cabinet was reshuffled for each new parliament along with a few minor changes during each term.\n\n==Formation==\nAfter eighteen years in opposition, Labour ousted the Conservatives at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|May 1997 election]] with a 179-seat majority. The Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], who turned 44 years old days after leading Labour to victory, was the youngest Prime Minister of the twentieth century. He was surpassed as the youngest Prime Minister by [[David Cameron]] who in 2010 became Prime Minister at the age of 43.\n\nBlair quickly wiped away memories of the troubled Labour governments led by [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] in the 1960s and 70's as the economic recovery continued and unemployment continued to fall. While other developed countries, notably Japan, were hit by a [[Early 2000s recession|financial crisis]] during Blair's first term in office, the British economy remained strong.\n\nIn September 2000, however, [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|protests against fuel prices]] intensified across the country and the new Leader of the Conservative Party [[William Hague]] exploited the situation by pointing out to voters just how much fuel prices had risen under Labour. This sparked a brief Conservative lead in the opinion polls \u2013 the first time in eight years \u2013 but once the fuel shortages and consequent protests ended, Labour led the opinion polls once more. Blair was so confident of re-election that he called a [[2001 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 3 May, but this was postponed until 7 June due to the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|foot and mouth crisis]]. This led to a brief crisis in the agricultural and tourism industries, but did little to shake a still-strong economy and the electorate responded by re-electing Blair with an only slightly-reduced majority.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis in Japan at the end of the 1990s, there was a brief recession in other parts of the developed world including Germany,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2003770.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Germany's recession ends |date=23 May 2002}}</ref> Italy and France in the early-2000s, but once again, the UK avoided recession and continued to enjoy a strong economy and low unemployment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3165999.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=French economy in trouble |date=20 August 2003}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the next general election was on the horizon, Labour were looking well positioned for a record third successive term in government. Unemployment remained low and the economy remained strong with more than a decade of unbroken growth, and education and healthcare had changed for the better as a result of expenditure by Labour.\n\nHowever, the Labour government had attracted controversy by sending British troops to [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|fight in Afghanistan]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]] on the United States in 2001, and even more so when it joined the American-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] eighteen months later \u2013 particularly when it emerged that the ousted Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]]'s alleged weapons of mass destruction were never found, and serious questions were raised about the issue of going to war. Although the dictatorship regimes in both of these countries were swiftly ended by British and American troops, the remaining British forces were not withdrawn from Iraq until 2009 and not from Afghanistan until 2014.\n\nSoon after the controversial invasion of Iraq in 2003, Labour support in the opinion polls fell and the Conservatives drew level with them in at least one poll during 2003. However, this did little to end speculation about the future of their unpopular leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and in October 2003, he lost a vote of no confidence and was replaced by [[Michael Howard]], who stood unopposed for the leadership role and took control without a leadership contest.\n\nThe [[2005 United Kingdom general election|election]] on 5 May 2005 saw Labour win a historic third successive term in power, though their majority now stood at 66 seats \u2013 compared to 167 four years earlier \u2013 and they failed to gain any new seats.

He would serve as the Prime Minister for three successive ministries and parliamentary terms until his resignation on 27 June 2007. His Cabinet was reshuffled for each new parliament along with a few minor changes during each term.\n\n==Formation==\nAfter eighteen years in opposition, Labour ousted the Conservatives at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|May 1997 election]] with a 179-seat majority. The Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], who turned 44 years old days after leading Labour to victory, was the youngest Prime Minister of the twentieth century. He was surpassed as the youngest Prime Minister by [[David Cameron]] who in 2010 became Prime Minister at the age of 43.\n\nBlair quickly wiped away memories of the troubled Labour governments led by [[Harold Wilson]] and [[James Callaghan]] in the 1960s and 70's as the economic recovery continued and unemployment continued to fall. While other developed countries, notably Japan, were hit by a [[Early 2000s recession|financial crisis]] during Blair's first term in office, the British economy remained strong.\n\nIn September 2000, however, [[Fuel protests in the United Kingdom|protests against fuel prices]] intensified across the country and the new Leader of the Conservative Party [[William Hague]] exploited the situation by pointing out to voters just how much fuel prices had risen under Labour. This sparked a brief Conservative lead in the opinion polls \u2013 the first time in eight years \u2013 but once the fuel shortages and consequent protests ended, Labour led the opinion polls once more. Blair was so confident of re-election that he called a [[2001 United Kingdom general election|general election]] for 3 May, but this was postponed until 7 June due to the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak|foot and mouth crisis]]. This led to a brief crisis in the agricultural and tourism industries, but did little to shake a still-strong economy and the electorate responded by re-electing Blair with an only slightly-reduced majority.\n\nFollowing the financial crisis in Japan at the end of the 1990s, there was a brief recession in other parts of the developed world including Germany,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/2003770.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Germany's recession ends |date=23 May 2002}}</ref> Italy and France in the early-2000s, but once again, the UK avoided recession and continued to enjoy a strong economy and low unemployment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3165999.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=French economy in trouble |date=20 August 2003}}</ref>\n\nBy the time the next general election was on the horizon, Labour were looking well positioned for a record third successive term in government. Unemployment remained low and the economy remained strong with more than a decade of unbroken growth, and education and healthcare had changed for the better as a result of expenditure by Labour.\n\nHowever, the Labour government had attracted controversy by sending British troops to [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|fight in Afghanistan]] in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September terrorist attacks]] on the United States in 2001, and even more so when it joined the American-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] eighteen months later \u2013 particularly when it emerged that the ousted Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]]'s alleged weapons of mass destruction were never found, and serious questions were raised about the issue of going to war. Although the dictatorship regimes in both of these countries were swiftly ended by British and American troops, the remaining British forces were not withdrawn from Iraq until 2009 and not from Afghanistan until 2014.\n\nSoon after the controversial invasion of Iraq in 2003, Labour support in the opinion polls fell and the Conservatives drew level with them in at least one poll during 2003. However, this did little to end speculation about the future of their unpopular leader [[Iain Duncan Smith]] and in October 2003, he lost a vote of no confidence and was replaced by [[Michael Howard]], who stood unopposed for the leadership role and took control without a leadership contest.\n\nThe [[2005 United Kingdom general election|election]] on 5 May 2005 saw Labour win a historic third successive term in power, though their majority now stood at 66 seats \u2013 compared to 167 four years earlier \u2013 and they failed to gain any new seats. Blair had already declared that the new term in parliament would be his last.\n\n==Ministries==\nThese are the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|cabinets]] under Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] (from May 1997 to June 2007).\n\n===First Blair ministry===\nThe first Blair ministry lasted from May 1997 to June 2001.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

One is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years.\n\nResearchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times.<ref name=\"Mooney 1900 393\"/> They may have moved south into [[Muscogee Creek]] territory and settled at the sites of [[mound]]s built by the [[Mississippian culture]] and earlier moundbuilders. In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several Mississippian culture sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Mounds]]. However, other evidence{{Clarify|date=February 2019}} shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.\n\nThe Connestee people, believed to be ancestors of the Cherokee, occupied western North Carolina circa 200 to 600 CE.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/08/21/answer-man-did-cherokee-live-biltmore-estate-lands-early-settlers/581792001/|title=Answer Man: Did the Cherokee live on Biltmore Estate lands?

People created new art forms such as [[shell gorget]]s, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\n\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern [[flint corn]]. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]].\n\n==Early cultures==\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered people of the [[Mississippian culture]], the ancestors to later tribes in the Southeast such as the [[Muscogee]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through what was later characterized as Cherokee country by English colonists based on their historical encounter. De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day western Georgia and eastern Tennessee, recording them as ruled by the [[Coosa chiefdom]]. It is now considered to be a chiefdom ancestral to the [[Muscogee Creek people]], who are from a different language and cultural group. The Spanish recorded a '''Chalaque''' nation as living around the [[Keowee River]] where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet.<ref>Mooney</ref> As some of this work was not translated into English until the 20th century, alternative views had developed among English-speaking historians, related to the limited understanding by English colonists of historic Native American cultures in the Southeast. In addition, the dominance of English colonists in the Southeast led to a discounting of Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.\n\nThe American writer [[John Howard Payne]] wrote about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was [[hereditary]] and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.\n\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the ''[[Ani-kutani]]''.<ref name = \"Irwina-1992\">Irwin 1992.</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.<ref>Mooney, p. 392.</ref> By the time that Mooney was studying the people, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/>\n\nAnother major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c5\u13eb\u13cd\u13a9}}), Cherokee [[medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the ''didanvwisgi'' learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/> Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\n\nUnlike most other Native Americans in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]], an indication of their migration from another area. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. This view is supported by the Cherokee [[oral history]] tradition. According to the scholars' theory, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], another Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the Southeast in historic times, and the Cherokee broke off from the major group during its northern <!-- Have not read theory of Iroquois migration to the north - not typical of patterns across the continent --> migration.\n\nOther historians hold that, judging from linguistic and cultural data, the Tuscarora people migrated South from other Iroquoian-speaking people in the Great Lakes region in ancient times. After extended harsh warfare in the Southeast, in the 1700s, the Tuscarora left the area and \"returned\" to the New York area, counting their tribal migration complete by 1722. The Iroquois Five Nations accepted the Tuscarora as the Sixth Nation of [[Haudenosaunee|their political confederacy]], known as the ''Haudenosaunee''.<ref>[http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_041100_tuscarora.htm David Landy, \"Tuscarora\"], ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians'', Cengage Learning Website, Houghton Mifflin Company, accessed January 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nLinguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago.

In 1735 the Cherokee were estimated to have sixty-four towns and villages, and 6,000 fighting men.  In 1738 and 1739 [[smallpox]] epidemics broke out among the Cherokee, who had no natural immunity to the new infectious disease.  Nearly half their population died within a year.  Hundreds of other Cherokee committed [[suicide]] due to their losses and disfigurement from the disease.\n[[File:Three Cherokee.jpg|thumb|250px|right|After the [[Anglo-Cherokee War]], bitterness remained between the two groups. In 1765, [[Henry Timberlake]] took three of the former Cherokee adversaries to London to help cement the newly declared friendship.]]\n\nAmerican colonist [[Henry Timberlake]] described the Cherokee people as he saw them in 1761:\n\n{{quote|The Cherokees are of a middle stature, of an olive colour, tho' generally painted, and their skins stained with gun-powder, pricked into it in very pretty figures. The hair of their head is shaved, tho' many of the old people have it plucked out by the roots, except a patch on the hinder part of the head, about twice the bigness of a crown-piece, which is ornamented with beads, feathers, [[wampum]], stained deers hair, and such like baubles. The ears are slit and stretched to an enormous size, putting the person who undergoes the operation to incredible pain, being unable to lie on either side for nearly forty days. To remedy this, they generally slit but one at a time; so soon as the patient can bear it, they wound round with wire to expand them, and are adorned with silver pendants and rings, which they likewise wear at the nose. This custom does not belong originally to the Cherokees, but taken by them from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.\n\nThey that can afford it wear a collar of wampum, which are beads cut out of clam-shells, a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and [[moccasins|mockasons]] ([[sic]]), which are shoes of a make peculiar to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills; a large mantle or match-coat thrown over all complete their dress at home ...<ref name=Timberlake>{{cite web|last=Timberlake|first=Henry|title=Memoirs of Henry Timberlake|publisher=London 1765, pp. 49-51}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in [[North Georgia]]. The Cherokee were victorious in the [[Battle of Taliwa]].  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the [[Seven Years' War]], which was fought across Europe and was called the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front. These included [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.  Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 [[Anglo-Cherokee War]].<ref name=\"Rozema, pp. 17\u201323\">Rozema, pp. 17\u201323.</ref>\n\nKing George III's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes.

The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773\u20131774).\n\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. [[Overhill Cherokee]] [[Nancy Ward]], [[Dragging Canoe]]'s cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill towns]]. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\n\n[[Dragging Canoe]] and his band settled along [[Chickamauga Creek]] near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where they established 11 new towns. [[Chickamauga Town]] was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]] to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a [[Cherokee\u2013American wars|guerrilla war]] against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]], signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck rivers]] (i.e. the [[Cumberland Plateau]]) to [[Tennessee]].\n\n====Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century====\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see [[Scottish Indian trade]]).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].<ref>Mooney, James. ''History, Myths, and Scared Formulas of the Cherokee'', p. 83. (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900).</ref>\n\nNotable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]], Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of [[James Vann]]), Daniel Ross (father of [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]]), John Walker Sr., John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts Jr.]]), [[Chisholm Tavern (Knoxville)|John D.

Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\n\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], Irish from [[Ulster]] who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as [[Simon Girty]].\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Acculturation====\nThe Cherokee lands between the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]].  The [[deerskin trade]] was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\n[[File:Major ridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Major Ridge in 1834, from ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.]]\n\n[[George Washington]] sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]].  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The [[deerskin trade]] brought [[white-tailed deer]] to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with [[spinning wheel]]s and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.\n\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788\u20131801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801\u20131811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]].  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of [[James Vann]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[Charles R. Hicks]] advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries from [[North Carolina]] to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later [[Congregationalist]] missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] school in [[Connecticut]].\n\nIn 1806 a [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] was built through Cherokee land. Chief [[James Vann]] opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and built a [[Chief Vann House Historic Site|cotton-plantation]] on a spur of the road from [[Athens, Georgia]] to [[Nashville]].  His son [[Joseph Vann|'Rich Joe' Vann]] developed the plantation to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, cultivated by 150 slaves.

Cherokee warriors led by [[Major Ridge]] played a major role in General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. Major Ridge moved his family to [[Rome, Georgia]], where he built a [[Chieftains (Rome, Georgia)|substantial house]], developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the [[Oostanaula River]].  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\n\nAround 1809 [[Sequoyah]] began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced [[Cherokee syllabary]], the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of [[Mesoamerican scripts|Central America]].  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\n\n[[File:New Echota.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee National Council building, [[New Echota]]]]\n\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] (near present-day [[Calhoun, Georgia]]).

They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son [[John Ridge]]. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the [[Vermont]] missionary [[Samuel Worcester]] and Major Ridge's nephew [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], who had taken the name of his [[Elias Boudinot|white benefactor]], a leader of the [[Continental Congress]] and [[New Jersey]] Congressman.

These were the \n\"[[Old Settlers]]\", the first of the Cherokee to make their way to what would eventually become [[Indian Territory]] (modern day [[Oklahoma]]).  This effort was headed by Indian Agent [[Return J. Meigs Sr.|Return J.

Georgia Governor [[George Troup]] and his cousin [[William McIntosh]], chief of the Lower Creek, signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)|Treaty of Indian Springs]] in 1825, ceding the last [[Muscogee (Creek)]] lands claimed by Georgia.  The state's northwestern border reached the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], the border of the Cherokee Nation.  In 1829, gold was discovered at [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The [[Georgia Gold Rush]] was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.  When [[Andrew Jackson]] was inaugurated as President in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to a new Indian Territory.\n\nJackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that \"...the [[Mohegan]], the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansett]], and the [[Lenape|Delaware]]\" had suffered.<ref>Wishart, p. 120</ref>  There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques.

John Ross traveled to Washington, D.C., and won support from [[National Republican Party]] leaders [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. [[Samuel Worcester]] campaigned on behalf of the Cherokee in New England, where their cause was taken up by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (see [[Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren|Emerson's 1838 letter to Martin Van Buren]]). In June 1830, a delegation led by Chief Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Cherokee Nation v.

In ''[[Worcester v.

His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a [[Georgia Land Lottery|Land Lottery]], and the state militia occupied [[New Echota]].  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]], a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim.

In Indian Territory, the national council of those who supported the Union voted to abolish slavery in the Cherokee Nation in 1863, but they were not the majority slaveholders and the vote had little effect on those supporting the Confederacy.\n\nWatie was elected Principal Chief of the pro-Confederacy majority. A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Arkansas]], capturing Union supply trains and [[steamboats]], and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862. He became a Brigadier General of the [[Confederate States]]; the only other American Indian to hold the rank in the American Civil War was [[Ely S. Parker]] with the Union Army.  On June 25, 1865, two months after [[Robert E. Lee]] surrendered at [[Appomattox Court House National Historical Park|Appomattox]], Stand Watie became the last Confederate General to stand down.\n\n====Reconstruction and late 19th century====\n[[File:Group of Cherokee, Yankton, and Sisseton 1909.jpg|thumb|left|William Penn (Cherokee), His Shield (Yanktonai), Levi Big Eagle (Yanktonai), Bear Ghost (Yanktonai) and Black Moustache (Sisseton).]]\nAfter the Civil War, the U.S. government required the Cherokee Nation to sign a new treaty, because of its alliance with the Confederacy. The U.S. required the 1866 Treaty to provide for the [[abolitionism in the United States|emancipation]] of all Cherokee slaves, and full citizenship to all Cherokee [[freedmen]] and all African Americans who chose to continue to reside within tribal lands, so that they \"shall have all the rights of native Cherokees.\"<ref>[http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm \"Treaty with the Cherokee, 1866.\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100630013134/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/VOL2/treaties/che0942.htm |date=June 30, 2010 }} ''Oklahoma Historical Society: Indian Affairs: Laws and Treaties. Vol. 2, Treaties.'' (retrieved January 10, 2010)</ref> Both before and after the Civil War, some Cherokee intermarried or had relationships with African Americans, just as they had with whites. Many Cherokee Freedmen have been active politically within the tribe.\n\nThe US government also acquired [[easement]] rights to the western part of the territory, which became the [[Oklahoma Territory]], for the construction of railroads. Development and settlers followed the railroads. By the late 19th century, the government believed that Native Americans would be better off if each family owned its own land. The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\n\nThe [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the [[Indian Territory]] proposed the creation of the [[State of Sequoyah]] as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian Territories]] entered the union as the state of [[Oklahoma]].\n[[File:CherokeeOTSA.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue)]]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural institutions===\nThe [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]], Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative.

Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was [[matrifocal]]; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.<ref>Perdue (1999), pp. 44, 57\u20138</ref>\n\nIt was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture.<ref name=\"Perdue 1999, p. 176\"/> As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yarbough |first=Fay |title=Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=38 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013406 [p. 388] |doi=10.1353/jsh.2004.0144 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the U.S. government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. [[Common law marriage]]s were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the [[Dawes Rolls]], prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Native Americans.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Cherokee ethnobotany]]\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times different, roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced [[gender binary]], with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the [[clan]]s. As in many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, Cherokee women are honored as life-givers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1954047274/|title=Sons of Selu: Masculinity and Gendered Power in Cherokee Society, 1775-1846 - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> As givers and nurturers of life via childbirth and the growing of plants, and community leaders as clan mothers, women are traditionally community leaders in Cherokee communities.

However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to [[Unicode]], the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\n\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ''ditiyohihi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af}}), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is ''didaniyisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9}}) which means \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\n\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ga-so-li-ne}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1}}). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word {{lang|chr|nowata}} is a [[Delaware languages|Delaware Indian]] word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is {{lang|del|nu-wi-ta}} which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town ''Amadikanigvnagvna'' ({{lang|chr|\u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be}})  which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\n\nOther examples of borrowed words are {{lang|chr|kawi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a7\u13eb}}) for ''coffee'' and {{lang|chr|watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13e9\u13e5}}) for ''watch'' (which led to {{lang|chr|utana watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5}}) or \"big watch\" for ''clock'').\n\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background:#fff;\"| \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9: \u13c2\u13a6\u13d3 \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb \u13c2\u13a8\u13ab\u13d3\u13b8\u13be \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c2\u13e0\u13f1 \u13a4\u13be\u13d5\u13bf \u13da\u13f3\u13a7\u13db \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2. \u13a8\u13e5\u13c1\u13b3 \u13a4\u13be\u13d3\u13c5\u13d6\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c3\u13df\u13cd\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13cc\u13ca \u13a8\u13d2 \u13e7\u13c2\u13b8\u13eb\u13cd\u13d3\u13c1\u13d7 \u13a0\u13be\u13df\u13c5\u13e2 \u13a0\u13d3\u13c5\u13d9 \u13ac\u13d7.<ref name=\"Omniglot\">{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm |title=Cherokee syllabary |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |date=1998\u20132009 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\" | [[Cherokee language|Tsalagi]]: {{lang|chr|Nigada aniyvwi nigeguda'lvna ale unihloyi unadehna duyukdv gesv'i.

They established a governmental system modeled on that of the United States, with an elected principal chief, senate, and house of representatives. On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government. Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established. In 1825, the National Council extended citizenship to the children of Cherokee men married to white women.

The Cherokee Nation includes numerous members who have African-American, Latino American, Asian American, European-American, and other ancestry. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-sixteenth Cherokee blood quantum (genealogical descent, equivalent to one great-great-grandparent) and an ancestor on the Baker Roll. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-quarter Keetoowah Cherokee blood quantum (equivalent to one grandparent), and the UKB does not allow members that have relinquished their membership to re-enroll in the UKB.<ref>[http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html Enrollment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609034110/http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html |date=June 9, 2010 }} ''United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees.''

Before 1975, they were considered a part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served not only as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but at the same time held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in [[Rusk County, Texas]] were excluded from citizenship. Their ancestors did not appear on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, registered under the Dawes Commission. However, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or [[Old settler (Cherokee)|Old settler]] rolls.\n\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation following the death of John Ross in 1866, today there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They do have treaty rights going back to the [[Treaty of Bird's Fort]]. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by [[William Penn Adair]] and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are in fact members of the Cherokee Nation. Only some 800 are stuck in limbo without status as Cherokees. Many of them still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.\n\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government which gave individual allotments to Cherokees.  State recognized Tribes require varying levels of genealogical proof that applicants are of Cherokee descent. Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Such facts were pointed out by Cherokee citizens of CN during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document that was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. However, the tribe does not have the power to change its membership procedures and maintain federal recognition. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It then forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.<ref>* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/aoc.htm Act of Congress Roll, 1854]\n* [http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/default.aspx (Pre-convention \u2013 1999) Oral and Written Testimonies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104091145/http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/Default.aspx |date=January 4, 2011 }}\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/census.htm Cherokee Census Rolls, a follow-up]\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/chapman.htm Chapman Roll Eastern Cherokees, 1851]\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 Treaty with the Cherokee, 1817] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150436/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 |date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Cherokee Freedmen===\n{{Main|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNSeal.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The seal of the Cherokee Nation.]] -->\n\nThe Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the [[Antebellum Period]], were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866. This was in the wake of the [[American Civil War]], when the US emancipated slaves and passed US constitutional amendments granting freedmen citizenship in the United States.\n\nIn 1988, the federal court in the Freedmen case of ''[[Nero v. Cherokee Nation]]'' held that Cherokees could decide citizenship requirements and exclude freedmen. On March 7, 2006, the Cherokee Nation Judicial Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Cherokee Freedmen were eligible for Cherokee citizenship.

One is that the Cherokee, an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]]-speaking people, are relative latecomers to Southern [[Appalachia]], who may have migrated in late prehistoric times from northern areas around the Great Lakes, the traditional territory of the  ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'' nations and other Iroquoian-speaking peoples. Another theory is that the Cherokee had been in the Southeast for thousands of years.\n\nResearchers in the 19th century recorded conversations with elders who recounted an oral tradition of the Cherokee people migrating south from the [[Great Lakes]] region in ancient times.<ref name=\"Mooney 1900 393\"/> They may have moved south into [[Muscogee Creek]] territory and settled at the sites of [[mound]]s built by the [[Mississippian culture]] and earlier moundbuilders. In the 19th century, European-American settlers mistakenly attributed several Mississippian culture sites in Georgia to the Cherokee, including [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]] and [[Etowah Indian Mounds|Etowah Mounds]]. However, other evidence{{Clarify|date=February 2019}} shows that the Cherokee did not reach this part of Georgia until the late 18th century and could not have built the mounds.\n\nThe Connestee people, believed to be ancestors of the Cherokee, occupied western North Carolina circa 200 to 600 CE.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/08/21/answer-man-did-cherokee-live-biltmore-estate-lands-early-settlers/581792001/|title=Answer Man: Did the Cherokee live on Biltmore Estate lands?

People created new art forms such as [[shell gorget]]s, adopted new technologies, and developed an elaborate cycle of religious ceremonies.\n\nDuring the Mississippian culture-period (800 to 1500 CE), local women developed a new variety of maize (corn) called eastern [[flint corn]]. It closely resembled modern corn and produced larger crops. The successful cultivation of corn surpluses allowed the rise of larger, more complex chiefdoms consisting of several villages and concentrated populations during this period. Corn became celebrated among numerous peoples in religious ceremonies, especially the [[Green Corn Ceremony]].\n\n==Early cultures==\nMuch of what is known about pre-18th-century Native American cultures has come from records of Spanish expeditions. The earliest ones of the mid-16th-century encountered people of the [[Mississippian culture]], the ancestors to later tribes in the Southeast such as the [[Muscogee]] and [[Catawba (tribe)|Catawba]]. Specifically in 1540-41, a Spanish expedition led by [[Hernando de Soto]] passed through what was later characterized as Cherokee country by English colonists based on their historical encounter. De Soto's expedition visited villages in present-day western Georgia and eastern Tennessee, recording them as ruled by the [[Coosa chiefdom]]. It is now considered to be a chiefdom ancestral to the [[Muscogee Creek people]], who are from a different language and cultural group. The Spanish recorded a '''Chalaque''' nation as living around the [[Keowee River]] where North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia meet.<ref>Mooney</ref> As some of this work was not translated into English until the 20th century, alternative views had developed among English-speaking historians, related to the limited understanding by English colonists of historic Native American cultures in the Southeast. In addition, the dominance of English colonists in the Southeast led to a discounting of Spanish sources for some time in their construction of history of the area.\n\nThe American writer [[John Howard Payne]] wrote about pre-19th-century Cherokee culture and society. The Payne papers describe the account by Cherokee elders of a traditional two-part societal structure. A \"white\" organization of elders represented the seven clans. As Payne recounted, this group, which was [[hereditary]] and priestly, was responsible for religious activities, such as healing, purification, and prayer. A second group of younger men, the \"red\" organization, was responsible for warfare. The Cherokee considered warfare a polluting activity. After warfare, the warriors required purification by the priestly class before participants could reintegrate into normal village life. This hierarchy had disappeared long before the 18th century.\n\nResearchers have debated the reasons for the change. Some historians believe the decline in priestly power originated with a revolt by the Cherokee against the abuses of the priestly class known as the ''[[Ani-kutani]]''.<ref name = \"Irwina-1992\">Irwin 1992.</ref> [[Ethnography|Ethnographer]] [[James Mooney]], who studied the Cherokee in the late 1880s, was the first to trace the decline of the former hierarchy to this revolt.<ref>Mooney, p. 392.</ref> By the time that Mooney was studying the people, the structure of Cherokee religious practitioners was more informal, based more on individual knowledge and ability than upon heredity.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/>\n\nAnother major source of early cultural history comes from materials written in the 19th century by the ''didanvwisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c5\u13eb\u13cd\u13a9}}), Cherokee [[medicine man|medicine men]], after [[Sequoyah]]'s creation of the [[Cherokee syllabary]] in the 1820s. Initially only the ''didanvwisgi'' learned to write and read such materials, which were considered extremely powerful in a spiritual sense.<ref name=\"Irwina-1992\"/> Later, the syllabary and writings were widely adopted by the Cherokee people.\n\nUnlike most other Native Americans in the American Southeast at the start of the historic era, the Cherokee spoke an [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian language]], an indication of their migration from another area. Since the [[Great Lakes]] region was the territory of most Iroquoian-language speakers, scholars have theorized that the Cherokee migrated south from that region. This view is supported by the Cherokee [[oral history]] tradition. According to the scholars' theory, the [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]], another Iroquoian-speaking people who inhabited the Southeast in historic times, and the Cherokee broke off from the major group during its northern <!-- Have not read theory of Iroquois migration to the north - not typical of patterns across the continent --> migration.\n\nOther historians hold that, judging from linguistic and cultural data, the Tuscarora people migrated South from other Iroquoian-speaking people in the Great Lakes region in ancient times. After extended harsh warfare in the Southeast, in the 1700s, the Tuscarora left the area and \"returned\" to the New York area, counting their tribal migration complete by 1722. The Iroquois Five Nations accepted the Tuscarora as the Sixth Nation of [[Haudenosaunee|their political confederacy]], known as the ''Haudenosaunee''.<ref>[http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/naind/html/na_041100_tuscarora.htm David Landy, \"Tuscarora\"], ''Encyclopedia of North American Indians'', Cengage Learning Website, Houghton Mifflin Company, accessed January 12, 2010.</ref>\n\nLinguistic analysis shows a relatively large difference between Cherokee and the northern Iroquoian languages, suggesting they had migrated long ago.

This custom does not belong originally to the Cherokees, but taken by them from the Shawnese, or other northern nations.\n\nThey that can afford it wear a collar of wampum, which are beads cut out of clam-shells, a silver breast-plate, and bracelets on their arms and wrists of the same metal, a bit of cloth over their private parts, a shirt of the English make, a sort of cloth-boots, and [[moccasins|mockasons]] ([[sic]]), which are shoes of a make peculiar to the Americans, ornamented with porcupine-quills; a large mantle or match-coat thrown over all complete their dress at home ...<ref name=Timberlake>{{cite web|last=Timberlake|first=Henry|title=Memoirs of Henry Timberlake|publisher=London 1765, pp. 49-51}}</ref>}}\n\nFrom 1753 to 1755, battles broke out between the Cherokee and Muscogee over disputed hunting grounds in [[North Georgia]]. The Cherokee were victorious in the [[Battle of Taliwa]].  British soldiers built forts in Cherokee country to defend against the French in the [[Seven Years' War]], which was fought across Europe and was called the [[French and Indian War]] on the North American front. These included [[Fort Loudoun (Tennessee)|Fort Loudoun]] near Chota.  In 1756 the Cherokee were allies of the British in the French and Indian War.  Serious misunderstandings arose quickly between the two allies, resulting in the 1760 [[Anglo-Cherokee War]].<ref name=\"Rozema, pp. 17\u201323\">Rozema, pp. 17\u201323.</ref>\n\nKing George III's [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]] forbade British settlements west of the Appalachian crest, as his government tried to afford some protection from colonial encroachment to the Cherokee and other tribes.

Retrieved September 21, 2009.</ref> [[Daniel Boone]] and his party tried to settle in Kentucky, but the Shawnee, [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Mingo]], and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party that included Boone's son.  The American Indians used this territory as a hunting ground by right of conquest; it had hardly been inhabited for years.  The conflict in Kentucky sparked the beginning of what was known as [[Dunmore's War]] (1773\u20131774).\n\nIn 1776, allied with the Shawnee led by [[Cornstalk]], Cherokee attacked settlers in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina in the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars#The Second Cherokee War|Second Cherokee War]]. [[Overhill Cherokee]] [[Nancy Ward]], [[Dragging Canoe]]'s cousin, warned settlers of impending attacks. Provincial militias retaliated, destroying more than 50 Cherokee towns. North Carolina militia in 1776 and 1780 invaded and destroyed the [[Overhill Cherokee|Overhill towns]]. In 1777, surviving Cherokee town leaders signed treaties with the new states.\n\n[[Dragging Canoe]] and his band settled along [[Chickamauga Creek]] near present-day [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]], where they established 11 new towns. [[Chickamauga Town]] was his headquarters and the colonists tended to call his entire band the [[Chickamauga Cherokee|Chickamauga]] to distinguish them from other Cherokee. From here he fought a [[Cherokee\u2013American wars|guerrilla war]] against settlers, which lasted from 1776 to 1794. These are known informally as the Cherokee\u2013American wars, but this is not an historians' term.  The first Treaty of [[Tellico Blockhouse]], signed November 7, 1794, finally brought peace between the Cherokee and Americans, who had achieved independence from the British Crown. In 1805, the Cherokee ceded their lands between the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] and [[Duck River (Tennessee)|Duck rivers]] (i.e. the [[Cumberland Plateau]]) to [[Tennessee]].\n\n====Scots (and other Europeans) among the Cherokee in the 18th century====\nThe traders and British government agents dealing with the southern tribes in general, and the Cherokee in particular, were nearly all of Scottish ancestry, with many documented as being from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. A few were Scots-Irish, English, French, and German (see [[Scottish Indian trade]]).  Many of these men married women from their host peoples and remained after the fighting had ended. Some had mixed-race children who would later become significant leaders among the Five Civilized Tribes of the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]].<ref>Mooney, James. ''History, Myths, and Scared Formulas of the Cherokee'', p. 83. (Washington: Government Printing Office, 1900).</ref>\n\nNotable traders, agents, and refugee Tories among the Cherokee included [[John Stuart (loyalist)|John Stuart]], Henry Stuart, Alexander Cameron, John McDonald, John Joseph Vann (father of [[James Vann]]), Daniel Ross (father of [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]]), John Walker Sr., John McLemore (father of Bob), William Buchanan, John Watts (father of [[John Watts (Cherokee chief)|John Watts Jr.]]), [[Chisholm Tavern (Knoxville)|John D.

Some attained the honorary status of minor chiefs and/or members of significant delegations.\n\nBy contrast, a large portion of the settlers encroaching on the Native American territories were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], Irish from [[Ulster]] who were of Scottish descent and had been part of the English plantation of northern Ireland. They also tended to support the Revolution. But in the back country, there were also Scots-Irish who were Loyalists, such as [[Simon Girty]].\n\n===19th century===\n\n====Acculturation====\nThe Cherokee lands between the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] rivers were remote enough from white settlers to remain independent after the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]].  The [[deerskin trade]] was no longer feasible on their greatly reduced lands, and over the next several decades, the people of the fledgling [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]] began to build a new society modeled on the white Southern United States.\n[[File:Major ridge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Portrait of Major Ridge in 1834, from ''[[History of the Indian Tribes of North America]]''.]]\n\n[[George Washington]] sought to 'civilize' Southeastern American Indians, through programs overseen by the [[Indian Agent]] [[Benjamin Hawkins]].  He encouraged the Cherokee to abandon their communal land-tenure and settle on individual farmsteads, which was facilitated by the destruction of many American Indian towns during the [[American Revolutionary War]].  The [[deerskin trade]] brought [[white-tailed deer]] to the brink of extinction, and as pigs and cattle were introduced, they became the principal sources of meat.  The government supplied the tribes with [[spinning wheel]]s and cotton-seed, and men were taught to fence and plow the land, in contrast to their traditional division in which crop cultivation was woman's labor.  Americans instructed the women in weaving.  Eventually Hawkins helped them set up smithys, gristmills and cotton plantations.\n\nThe Cherokee organized a national government under Principal Chiefs [[Little Turkey]] (1788\u20131801), [[Black Fox (Cherokee chief)|Black Fox]] (1801\u20131811), and [[Pathkiller]] (1811\u20131827), all former warriors of [[Dragging Canoe]].  The 'Cherokee triumvirate' of [[James Vann]] and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s [[Major Ridge|The Ridge]] and [[Charles R. Hicks]] advocated acculturation, formal education, and modern methods of farming.  In 1801 they invited [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionaries from [[North Carolina]] to teach Christianity and the 'arts of civilized life.'  The Moravians and later [[Congregationalist]] missionaries ran boarding schools, and a select few students were educated at the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] school in [[Connecticut]].\n\nIn 1806 a [[Federal Road (Cherokee lands)|Federal Road]] from [[Savannah, Georgia]] to [[Knoxville, Tennessee]] was built through Cherokee land. Chief [[James Vann]] opened a tavern, inn and ferry across the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] and built a [[Chief Vann House Historic Site|cotton-plantation]] on a spur of the road from [[Athens, Georgia]] to [[Nashville]].  His son [[Joseph Vann|'Rich Joe' Vann]] developed the plantation to {{convert|800|acre|km2}}, cultivated by 150 slaves.  He exported cotton to England, and owned a [[steamboat]] on the [[Tennessee River]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2726&hl=y |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Chief Vann House |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=September 23, 2005 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Cherokee allied with the U.S. against the nativist and pro-British [[Red Stick]] faction of the Upper Creek in the [[Creek War]] during the [[War of 1812]]. Cherokee warriors led by [[Major Ridge]] played a major role in General [[Andrew Jackson]]'s victory at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]]. Major Ridge moved his family to [[Rome, Georgia]], where he built a [[Chieftains (Rome, Georgia)|substantial house]], developed a large plantation and ran a ferry on the [[Oostanaula River]].  Although he never learned English, he sent his son and nephews to New England to be educated in mission schools. His interpreter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], the descendant of several generations of Cherokee women and Scots fur-traders, built a plantation and operated a trading firm and a ferry at Ross' Landing ([[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]). During this period, divisions arose between the acculturated elite and the great majority of Cherokee, who clung to traditional ways of life.\n\nAround 1809 [[Sequoyah]] began developing a written form of the Cherokee language. He spoke no English, but his experiences as a silversmith dealing regularly with white settlers, and as a warrior at Horseshoe Bend, convinced him the Cherokee needed to develop writing. In 1821, he introduced [[Cherokee syllabary]], the first written syllabic form of an American Indian language outside of [[Mesoamerican scripts|Central America]].  Initially his innovation was opposed by both Cherokee traditionalists and white missionaries, who sought to encourage the use of English. When Sequoyah taught children to read and write with the syllabary, he reached the adults. By the 1820s, the Cherokee had a higher rate of literacy than the whites around them in Georgia.\n\n[[File:New Echota.jpg|thumb|left|Cherokee National Council building, [[New Echota]]]]\n\nIn 1819, the Cherokee began holding council meetings at New Town, at the headwaters of the [[Oostanaula River|Oostanaula]] (near present-day [[Calhoun, Georgia]]). In November 1825, New Town became the capital of the Cherokee Nation, and was renamed [[New Echota]], after the [[Overhill Cherokee]] principal town of [[Chota (Cherokee town)|Chota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ngeorgia.com/ang/New_Echota_Historic_Site |title=New Echota Historic Site |publisher=Ngeorgia.com |date=June 5, 2007 |accessdate=April 17, 2010}}</ref> Sequoyah's syllabary was adopted. They had developed a police force, a judicial system, and a National Committee.\n\nIn 1827, the Cherokee Nation drafted a Constitution modeled on the United States, with executive, legislative and judicial branches and a system of checks and balances. The two-tiered legislature was led by Major Ridge and his son [[John Ridge]]. Convinced the tribe's survival required English-speaking leaders who could negotiate with the U.S., the legislature appointed [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]] as Principal Chief. A printing press was established at New Echota by the [[Vermont]] missionary [[Samuel Worcester]] and Major Ridge's nephew [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], who had taken the name of his [[Elias Boudinot|white benefactor]], a leader of the [[Continental Congress]] and [[New Jersey]] Congressman.

The [[Texas Cherokees]] were mostly neutral during the [[Texas War of Independence]].  In 1836, they signed a treaty with Texas President [[Sam Houston]], an adopted member of the Cherokee tribe.

These were the \n\"[[Old Settlers]]\", the first of the Cherokee to make their way to what would eventually become [[Indian Territory]] (modern day [[Oklahoma]]).  This effort was headed by Indian Agent [[Return J. Meigs Sr.|Return J. Meigs]], and was finalized with the signing of the [[Jackson and McMinn Treaty]], giving the Old Settlers undisputed title to the lands designated for their use.<ref name=\"Tenn\">[https://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/entries/treaties/ ''Treaties'']; Tennessee Encyclopedia, online; accessed October 2019</ref>\n\nDuring this time, Georgia focused on removing the Cherokee's neighbors, the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Lower Creek]].  Georgia Governor [[George Troup]] and his cousin [[William McIntosh]], chief of the Lower Creek, signed the [[Treaty of Indian Springs (1825)|Treaty of Indian Springs]] in 1825, ceding the last [[Muscogee (Creek)]] lands claimed by Georgia.  The state's northwestern border reached the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]], the border of the Cherokee Nation.  In 1829, gold was discovered at [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]], on Cherokee land claimed by Georgia.  The [[Georgia Gold Rush]] was the first in U.S. history, and state officials demanded that the federal government expel the Cherokee.  When [[Andrew Jackson]] was inaugurated as President in 1829, Georgia gained a strong ally in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].  In 1830 Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]], authorizing the forcible relocation of American Indians east of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] to a new Indian Territory.\n\nJackson claimed the removal policy was an effort to prevent the Cherokee from facing extinction as a people, which he considered the fate that \"...the [[Mohegan]], the [[Narragansett tribe|Narragansett]], and the [[Lenape|Delaware]]\" had suffered.<ref>Wishart, p. 120</ref>  There is, however, ample evidence that the Cherokee were adapting modern farming techniques.  A modern analysis shows that the area was in general in a state of economic surplus and could have accommodated both the Cherokee and new settlers.<ref>Wishart 1995.</ref>\n\nThe Cherokee brought their grievances to a US judicial review that set a precedent in [[Indian country]].  John Ross traveled to Washington, D.C., and won support from [[National Republican Party]] leaders [[Henry Clay]] and [[Daniel Webster]]. [[Samuel Worcester]] campaigned on behalf of the Cherokee in New England, where their cause was taken up by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (see [[Emerson's letter to Martin Van Buren|Emerson's 1838 letter to Martin Van Buren]]). In June 1830, a delegation led by Chief Ross defended Cherokee rights before the U.S. Supreme Court in ''[[Cherokee Nation v. Georgia]]''.\n\nIn 1831 Georgia militia arrested [[Samuel Worcester]] for residing on Indian lands without a state permit, imprisoning him in [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]].  In ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'' (1832), the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] [[Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] ruled that American Indian nations were \"distinct, independent political communities retaining their original natural rights,\" and entitled to federal protection from the actions of state governments that infringed on their [[sovereignty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2720 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: \"Worcester v.

His landslide reelection in 1832 emboldened calls for Cherokee removal. Georgia sold Cherokee lands to its citizens in a [[Georgia Land Lottery|Land Lottery]], and the state militia occupied [[New Echota]].  The Cherokee National Council, led by John Ross, fled to [[Red Clay State Park|Red Clay]], a remote valley north of Georgia's land claim. Ross had the support of Cherokee traditionalists, who could not imagine removal from their ancestral lands.\n\n[[File:Cherokee beadwork sampler 1840 ohs.jpg|thumb|upright=1|Cherokee [[beadwork]] sampler, made at [[Dwight Presbyterian Mission|Dwight Mission]], Indian Territory, 19th century, collection of the [[Oklahoma History Center]] ]]\n\nA small group known as the \"Ridge Party\" or the \"Treaty Party\" saw relocation as inevitable and believed the Cherokee Nation needed to make the best deal to preserve their rights in Indian Territory. Led by [[Major Ridge]], [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]], they represented the Cherokee elite, whose homes, plantations and businesses were confiscated, or under threat of being taken by white squatters with Georgia land-titles. With capital to acquire new lands, they were more inclined to accept relocation. On December 29, 1835, the \"Ridge Party\" signed the [[Treaty of New Echota]], stipulating terms and conditions for the removal of the Cherokee Nation.

On June 22, 1839, a party of twenty-five Ross supporters assassinated Major Ridge, John Ridge and Elias Boudinot.  The party included Daniel Colston, John Vann, Archibald, James and Joseph Spear. Boudinot's brother [[Stand Watie]] fought and survived that day, escaping to [[Arkansas]].\n\nIn 1827, [[Sequoyah]] had led a delegation of Old Settlers to Washington, D.C. to negotiate for the exchange of Arkansas land for land in Indian Territory. After the Trail of Tears, he helped mediate divisions between the Old Settlers and the rival factions of the more recent arrivals. In 1839, as President of the Western Cherokee, Sequoyah signed an Act of Union with John Ross that reunited the two groups of the Cherokee Nation.\n\n=====Eastern Band=====\n[[File:C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief.jpg|thumb|left|upright|C\u00f3l-lee, a Band Chief, painted by [[George Catlin]], 1834]]\n\nThe Cherokee living along the [[Oconaluftee River]] in the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] were the most conservative and isolated from European\u2013American settlements.

A master of hit-and-run cavalry tactics, Watie fought those Cherokee loyal to John Ross and Federal troops in [[Indian Territory]] and [[Arkansas]], capturing Union supply trains and [[steamboats]], and saving a Confederate army by covering their retreat after the [[Battle of Pea Ridge]] in March 1862.

The [[Dawes Act]] of 1887 provided for the breakup of commonly held tribal land into individual household allotments. Native Americans were registered on the Dawes Rolls and allotted land from the common reserve. The U.S. government counted the remainder of tribal land as \"surplus\" and sold it to non-Cherokee individuals.\n\nThe [[Curtis Act of 1898]] dismantled tribal governments, courts, schools, and other civic institutions. For Indian Territory, this meant abolition of the Cherokee courts and governmental systems. This was seen as necessary before the Oklahoma and Indian territories could be admitted as a combined state. In 1905, the [[Five Civilized Tribes]] of the [[Indian Territory]] proposed the creation of the [[State of Sequoyah]] as one to be exclusively Native American, but failed to gain support in Washington, D.C.. In 1907, the [[Oklahoma Territory|Oklahoma]] and [[Indian Territory|Indian Territories]] entered the union as the state of [[Oklahoma]].\n[[File:CherokeeOTSA.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of present-day Cherokee Nation Tribal Jurisdiction Area (dark blue)]]\n\nBy the late 19th century, the Eastern Band of Cherokee were laboring under the constraints of a [[Racial segregation|segregated]] society. In the aftermath of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], conservative white Democrats regained power in North Carolina and other southern states. They proceeded to effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)|disenfranchise]] all blacks and many poor whites by new constitutions and laws related to voter registration and elections. They passed [[Jim Crow laws]] that divided society into \"white\" and \"colored\", mostly to control freedmen. Cherokee and other Native Americans were classified on the colored side and suffered the same racial segregation and disenfranchisement as former slaves. They also often lost their historical documentation for identification as Indians, when the Southern states classified them as colored.  Blacks and Native Americans would not have their constitutional rights as U.S. citizens enforced until after the [[Civil Rights Movement]] secured passage of civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, and the federal government began to monitor voter registration and elections, as well as other programs.\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Cultural institutions===\nThe [[Qualla Arts and Crafts Mutual]], Inc., of Cherokee, North Carolina is the oldest continuing Native American art co-operative.

Advancement to leadership positions was generally subject to approval by the women elders.  In addition, the society was [[matrifocal]]; customarily, a married couple lived with or near the woman's family, so she could be aided by her female relatives.  Her oldest brother was a more important mentor to her sons than was their father, who belonged to another clan. Traditionally, couples, particularly women, can divorce freely.<ref>Perdue (1999), pp. 44, 57\u20138</ref>\n\nIt was unusual for a Cherokee man to marry a European-American woman.  The children of such a union were disadvantaged, as they would not belong to the nation.  They would be born outside the clans and traditionally were not considered Cherokee citizens. This is because of the matrilineal aspect of Cherokee culture.<ref name=\"Perdue 1999, p. 176\"/> As the Cherokee began to adopt some elements of European-American culture in the early 19th century, they sent elite young men, such as [[John Ridge]] and [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] to American schools for education. After Ridge had married a European-American woman from Connecticut and Boudinot was engaged to another, the Cherokee Council in 1825 passed a law making children of such unions full citizens of the tribe, as if their mothers were Cherokee. This was a way to protect the families of men expected to be leaders of the tribe.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Yarbough |first=Fay |title=Legislating Women's Sexuality: Cherokee Marriage Laws |journal=Journal of Social History |volume=38 |year=2004 |issue=2 |pages=385\u2013406 [p. 388] |doi=10.1353/jsh.2004.0144 }}</ref>\n\nIn the late nineteenth century, the US government put new restrictions on marriage between a Cherokee and non-Cherokee, although it was still relatively common. A European-American man could legally marry a Cherokee woman by petitioning the federal court, after gaining approval of ten of her blood relatives.  Once married, the man had status as an \"Intermarried White,\" a member of the Cherokee tribe with restricted rights; for instance, he could not hold any tribal office. He remained a citizen of and under the laws of the United States. [[Common law marriage]]s were more popular. Such \"Intermarried Whites\" were listed in a separate category on the registers of the [[Dawes Rolls]], prepared for allotment of plots of land to individual households of members of the tribe, in the early twentieth-century federal policy for [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]] of the Native Americans.\n\n===Ethnobotany===\nSee [[Cherokee ethnobotany]]\n\n=== Gender roles ===\nMen and women have historically played important yet, at times different, roles in Cherokee society. Historically, these roles have tended to support the idea of a balanced [[gender binary]], with gender determining social and ceremonial roles. Historically, women have primarily been the heads of households, owning the home and the land, farmers of the family's land, and \"mothers\" of the [[clan]]s. As in many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] cultures, Cherokee women are honored as life-givers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/1954047274/|title=Sons of Selu: Masculinity and Gendered Power in Cherokee Society, 1775-1846 - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|language=en|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> As givers and nurturers of life via childbirth and the growing of plants, and community leaders as clan mothers, women are traditionally community leaders in Cherokee communities.

However, since the fairly recent addition of the Cherokee syllables to [[Unicode]], the Cherokee language is experiencing a renaissance in its use on the Internet.\n\nBecause of the polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language, new and descriptive words in Cherokee are easily constructed to reflect or express modern concepts. Examples include ''ditiyohihi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d8\u13f2\u13af\u13af}}), which means \"he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose,\" meaning \"attorney.\" Another example is ''didaniyisgi'' ({{lang|chr|\u13d7\u13d3\u13c2\u13f1\u13cd\u13a9}}) which means \"the final catcher\" or \"he catches them finally and conclusively,\" meaning \"policeman.\"\n\nMany words, however, have been borrowed from the English language, such as ''gasoline'', which in Cherokee is {{lang|chr|ga-so-li-ne}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a6\u13d0\u13b5\u13c1}}). Many other words were borrowed from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 20th century. One example relates to a town in Oklahoma named \"Nowata\". The word {{lang|chr|nowata}} is a [[Delaware languages|Delaware Indian]] word for \"welcome\" (more precisely the Delaware word is {{lang|del|nu-wi-ta}} which can mean \"welcome\" or \"friend\" in the Delaware Language). The white settlers of the area used the name \"nowata\" for the township, and local Cherokees, being unaware the word had its origins in the Delaware Language, called the town ''Amadikanigvnagvna'' ({{lang|chr|\u13a0\u13b9\u13d7\u13a7\u13c2\u13ac\u13be\u13ac\u13be}})  which means \"the water is all gone from here\", i.e. \"no water\".\n\nOther examples of borrowed words are {{lang|chr|kawi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a7\u13eb}}) for ''coffee'' and {{lang|chr|watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13e9\u13e5}}) for ''watch'' (which led to {{lang|chr|utana watsi}} ({{lang|chr|\u13a4\u13d4\u13be \u13e9\u13e5}}) or \"big watch\" for ''clock'').\n\nThe following table is an example of Cherokee text and its translation:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| style=\"background:#fff;\"| \u13e3\u13b3\u13a9: \u13c2\u13a6\u13d3 \u13a0\u13c2\u13f4\u13eb \u13c2\u13a8\u13ab\u13d3\u13b8\u13be \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c2\u13e0\u13f1 \u13a4\u13be\u13d5\u13bf \u13da\u13f3\u13a7\u13db \u13a8\u13d2\u13a2. \u13a8\u13e5\u13c1\u13b3 \u13a4\u13be\u13d3\u13c5\u13d6\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13a4\u13c3\u13df\u13cd\u13d7 \u13a0\u13b4 \u13cc\u13ca \u13a8\u13d2 \u13e7\u13c2\u13b8\u13eb\u13cd\u13d3\u13c1\u13d7 \u13a0\u13be\u13df\u13c5\u13e2 \u13a0\u13d3\u13c5\u13d9 \u13ac\u13d7.<ref name=\"Omniglot\">{{cite web |url=http://www.omniglot.com/writing/cherokee.htm |title=Cherokee syllabary |accessdate=May 14, 2009 |date=1998\u20132009 }}</ref>\n|-\n| style=\"background:#ddd;\" | [[Cherokee language|Tsalagi]]: {{lang|chr|Nigada aniyvwi nigeguda'lvna ale unihloyi unadehna duyukdv gesv'i.

On April 10, 1810 the seven Cherokee clans met and began the abolition of blood vengeance by giving the sacred duty to the new Cherokee National government. Clans formally relinquished judicial responsibilities by the 1820s when the Cherokee Supreme Court was established.

The Cherokee Nation includes numerous members who have African-American, Latino American, Asian American, European-American, and other ancestry. The Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-sixteenth Cherokee blood quantum (genealogical descent, equivalent to one great-great-grandparent) and an ancestor on the Baker Roll. The United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians requires a minimum one-quarter Keetoowah Cherokee blood quantum (equivalent to one grandparent), and the UKB does not allow members that have relinquished their membership to re-enroll in the UKB.<ref>[http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html Enrollment.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609034110/http://www.keetoowahcherokee.org/enrollment.html |date=June 9, 2010 }} ''United Keetoowah Band of Cherokees.''

Before 1975, they were considered a part of the Cherokee Nation, as reflected in briefs filed before the Indian Claims Commission. At one time W.W. Keeler served not only as Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, but at the same time held the position as Chairman of the Texas Cherokee and Associated Bands (TCAB) Executive Committee.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Cherokee constitution in 1976, TCAB descendants whose ancestors had remained a part of the physical Mount Tabor Community in [[Rusk County, Texas]] were excluded from citizenship. Their ancestors did not appear on the Final Rolls of the Five Civilized Tribes, registered under the Dawes Commission. However, most if not all TCAB descendants did have an ancestor listed on either the Guion-Miller or [[Old settler (Cherokee)|Old settler]] rolls.\n\nWhile most Mount Tabor residents returned to the Cherokee Nation following the death of John Ross in 1866, today there is a sizable group that is well documented but outside that body. It is not actively seeking a status clarification. They do have treaty rights going back to the [[Treaty of Bird's Fort]]. From the end of the Civil War until 1975, they were associated with the Cherokee Nation. The TCAB formed as a political organization in 1871 led by [[William Penn Adair]] and Clement Neely Vann. Descendants of the Texas Cherokees and the Mount Tabor Community joined together to try to gain redress from treaty violations, stemming from the Treaty of Bowles Village in 1836. Today, most Mount Tabor descendants are in fact members of the Cherokee Nation. Only some 800 are stuck in limbo without status as Cherokees. Many of them still reside in Rusk and Smith counties of east Texas.\n\nOther remnant populations continue to exist throughout the Southeast United States and individually in the states surrounding Oklahoma. Many of these people trace descent from persons enumerated on official rolls such as the Guion-Miller, Drennan, Mullay and Henderson Rolls, among others. Other descendants trace their heritage through the treaties of 1817 and 1819 with the federal government which gave individual allotments to Cherokees.  State recognized Tribes require varying levels of genealogical proof that applicants are of Cherokee descent. Current enrollment guidelines of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma have been approved by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Such facts were pointed out by Cherokee citizens of CN during the Constitutional Convention held to ratify a new governing document. The document that was eventually ratified by a small portion of the electorate. However, the tribe does not have the power to change its membership procedures and maintain federal recognition. Any changes to the tribe's enrollment procedures must be approved by the Department of Interior. Under 25 CFR 83 the Office of Federal Acknowledgment is required to first apply its own anthropological, genealogical, and historical research methods to any request for change by the tribe. It then forwards its recommendations to the Assistant Secretary - Indian Affairs for consideration.<ref>* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/aoc.htm Act of Congress Roll, 1854]\n* [http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/default.aspx (Pre-convention \u2013 1999) Oral and Written Testimonies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104091145/http://www.cherokee.org/Government/254/Page/Default.aspx |date=January 4, 2011 }}\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/census.htm Cherokee Census Rolls, a follow-up]\n* [http://www.tngennet.org/cherokee_by_blood/chapman.htm Chapman Roll Eastern Cherokees, 1851]\n* [http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 Treaty with the Cherokee, 1817] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103150436/http://digital.library.okstate.edu/kappler/Vol2/treaties/che0140.htm#mn11 |date=November 3, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Cherokee Freedmen===\n{{Main|Cherokee Freedmen Controversy}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CNSeal.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The seal of the Cherokee Nation.]] -->\n\nThe Cherokee freedmen, descendants of African American slaves owned by citizens of the Cherokee Nation during the [[Antebellum Period]], were first guaranteed Cherokee citizenship under a treaty with the United States in 1866. This was in the wake of the [[American Civil War]], when the US emancipated slaves and passed US constitutional amendments granting freedmen citizenship in the United States.\n\nIn 1988, the federal court in the Freedmen case of ''[[Nero v. Cherokee Nation]]'' held that Cherokees could decide citizenship requirements and exclude freedmen. On March 7, 2006, the Cherokee Nation Judicial Appeal Tribunal ruled that the Cherokee Freedmen were eligible for Cherokee citizenship. This ruling proved controversial; while the Cherokee Freedman had historically been recorded as \"citizens\" of the Cherokee Nation at least since 1866 and the later [[Dawes Commission]] Land Rolls, the ruling \"did not limit membership to people possessing Cherokee blood\".<ref name=\"Freedman-Decision\">{{cite web |title=Freedman Decision |url=http://www.cherokee.org/docs/news/Freedman-Decision.pdf |accessdate=March 10, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213034721/http://www.cherokee.org/docs/news/Freedman-Decision.pdf |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> This ruling was consistent with the 1975 Constitution of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, in its acceptance of the Cherokee Freedmen on the basis of historical citizenship, rather than documented blood relation.\n\nOn March 3, 2007 a constitutional amendment was passed by a Cherokee vote limiting citizenship to Cherokees on the Dawes Rolls for those listed as Cherokee by blood on the Dawes roll, which did not include partial Cherokee descendants of slaves, Shawnee and Delaware.<ref>[http://www.cherokeecourts.com/Portals/5/44%20-%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment%20and%20Brief%20in%20Support.pdf Cherokee Constitutional Amendment March 3, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304002421/http://www.cherokeecourts.com/Portals/5/44%20-%20Motion%20for%20Summary%20Judgment%20and%20Brief%20in%20Support.pdf |date=March 4, 2009 }}.</ref> The Cherokee Freedmen had 90 days to appeal this amendment vote which disenfranchised them from Cherokee citizenship and file appeal within the Cherokee Nation Tribal Council, which is currently pending in ''Nash, et al. v.

The 'boy poet' spent the formative decade (from 1948\u20131958) in [[Mullumbimby]], prior to moving to [[Tweed Heads]] in 1959. At Mullumbimby he became a passionate orchid collector (from the surrounding rainforests).\n\nBefore attending Mullumbimby High School (at age 12) his mother told him his name was Edwin and not Peter, and he'd have to change for school banking, which was quite destabilising, an adjustment that was not properly made until he went to Murwillumbah High School (in 1959).\n\nA scholarship to Armidale Teachers' College (1960\u20131961) provided his 'escape' from rural poverty, and was a period of aesthetic flowering. An appointment to [[The Forest High School (New South Wales)|The Forest High School]], [[Frenchs Forest]] (1962) enabled him to complete a (part-time) science degree at the [[University of New South Wales]] (in Chemistry and Botany).\n\nHis first brief marriage (to Margaret Dawn Macintyre in 1968) coinciding with his appointment as a lecturer at Armidale Teachers' College, was his second age of poetic awakening. \nIn 1972 he had returned to Sydney (into his 'garret phase' of verse), to work at The Australian Museum, quite literally the 'House of the Muses', and 'as [he] fell so painfully out of love [his] verse improved', and he has written ever since that time. When the child of that failed marriage (James Richmond Wilson, b. 1970) was accidentally killed in a road accident a lot more grief was sublimated into verse.\n\nHis first significant success in Literary Journals was with Poetry Australia (with a number of poems published over a range of years). His second lasting marriage (to Cheryl Lillian Turnham in 1975), coincided with his Literary Hoax in opposition to quotas (in which he had a poem published under the female pseudonym of 'Eileen' in  [[Kate Jennings]]' ''Mother I'm Rooted'', an Anthology of Australian Women Poets)).   As a result of this he was sin-binned in some quarters for a score of years.\n\nIn 1980 he moved to the Royal Botanic Gardens Sydney, the closest thing to a rainforest in the city. Because of the 'Eileen' incident a lot of doors had closed to him, so in 1982 he set up Woodbine Press, a then subsidiary of Edwards & Shaw, with Dick Edwards (of Edwards & Shaw) as his silent partner. Banyan, his first book of poems, was printed with hot metal by Edwards & Shaw in their last year of business. Since then he has published twenty seven books, through Woodbine Press and other outlets (including Hale & Iremonger, Kangaroo Press, Rainforest Publishing, Kardoorair Press,<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kardoorair.com.au/Kardoorair_Press_Home.html | title=Kardoorair Press | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929104629/http://www.kardoorair.com.au/Kardoorair_Press_Home.html | archivedate=September 29, 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and the Royal Botanic Gardens Trust).\n\nEdwin Wilson retired from paid work in 2003, as a Research Associate of the Gardens, working with Phil Spence on a breeding program using high altitude New Guinea [[Latouria]]-type orchid hybrids, to try to bring cold-tolerance (that is, grow at Sydney equivalent latitudes without a glasshouse) into bench quality plants.

The incident involved the murder of four girls and a boy in so-called honour killing after a video of their private celebration emerged on the internet. The video featured a boy dancing while four girls were also seen clapping in the clip, along with another boy recording the video on his mobile phone. All girls and the boy seen dancing were murdered after the video was made public.\n\n==Events==\nThe video was originally shot at a mixed gathering of a wedding celebration in Sartai, a remote village in Kohistan. The video that was circulated among villagers before it was shared with the [[jirga]], in one of the most conservative parts of the province was immediately taken as dishonourble and a violation of the norms of the tribal area.\n\nThe incident made it to the mainstream media in 2012 when Muhammad Afzal Kohistani, the brother of one of the boys in the video, alleged that the women were all killed in May 2012 on orders of the jirga, consisting of 40-50 members led by clerics. However, in the wake of this news, officials from the area denied the killing of the women claiming that all people were alive. The case was disposed off<ref>{{cite news |title=Four Kohistan women alive, says Farzana Bari |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/724649 |work=DAWN.COM |date=7 June 2012 |language=en}}</ref> when rights activists went to the village to meet the girls as ordered by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]].\n\nAfzal Kohistani, in response to this report, asserted<ref>{{cite news |title=Four Kohistan women alive, says Farzana Bari |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/724649 |work=DAWN.COM |date=7 June 2012 |language=en}}</ref> that the women in fact have been killed and imposters were presented to the investigations team, disrupting the judicial process.\n\nKohistani filed an application to reopen the case, as a result of which three of his brothers - including the two boys in the video - were shot dead<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhatti |first1=Haseeb |title=Girls in 2011 Kohistan video were killed, Supreme Court told |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1455038 |work=DAWN.COM |date=2 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref> in early January 2013.

However, the police failed to recover the girls and bring them in court, that probed a second notice being produced the same year.\n\nThe defence lawyer argued that the girls wouldn't be brought in court because of the local restrictions making it a matter of honour and shame. After rejection of the argument from Justice Ejaz Afzal, some underage girls were produced in court to prove that the girls were alive but in 2016, rights activist Farzana Bari disputed<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dawn.com |first1=Naveed Siddiqui | |title=Kohistan video case: Girls declared alive by SC had actually been killed, says Bari |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1291398 |work=DAWN.COM |date=21 October 2016 |language=en}}</ref> the claim saying that the girls seen in the video have been killed, and the ones brought to court are different girls.\n\n\"Photos of the girls taken during the commission session were given to a Reuters' journalist, Katharine Houreld, who got the matching done through a renowned independent British agency 'Digital Barriers'.

The incident involved the murder of four girls and a boy in so-called honour killing after a video of their private celebration emerged on the internet. The video featured a boy dancing while four girls were also seen clapping in the clip, along with another boy recording the video on his mobile phone. All girls and the boy seen dancing were murdered after the video was made public.\n\n==Events==\nThe video was originally shot at a mixed gathering of a wedding celebration in Sartai, a remote village in Kohistan. The video that was circulated among villagers before it was shared with the [[jirga]], in one of the most conservative parts of the province was immediately taken as dishonourble and a violation of the norms of the tribal area.\n\nThe incident made it to the mainstream media in 2012 when Muhammad Afzal Kohistani, the brother of one of the boys in the video, alleged that the women were all killed in May 2012 on orders of the jirga, consisting of 40-50 members led by clerics. However, in the wake of this news, officials from the area denied the killing of the women claiming that all people were alive. The case was disposed off<ref>{{cite news |title=Four Kohistan women alive, says Farzana Bari |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/724649 |work=DAWN.COM |date=7 June 2012 |language=en}}</ref> when rights activists went to the village to meet the girls as ordered by the [[Supreme Court of Pakistan]].\n\nAfzal Kohistani, in response to this report, asserted<ref>{{cite news |title=Four Kohistan women alive, says Farzana Bari |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/724649 |work=DAWN.COM |date=7 June 2012 |language=en}}</ref> that the women in fact have been killed and imposters were presented to the investigations team, disrupting the judicial process.\n\nKohistani filed an application to reopen the case, as a result of which three of his brothers - including the two boys in the video - were shot dead<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bhatti |first1=Haseeb |title=Girls in 2011 Kohistan video were killed, Supreme Court told |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1455038 |work=DAWN.COM |date=2 January 2019 |language=en}}</ref> in early January 2013.

It is a free public meetup with other fans of the band in their area, where traditionally they would gather in Parks and other public spaces.\nThe first meetup was in the Kensington Gardens in London and the band, recognising how much effort had been put in to it, showed up too.<ref>https://twitter.com/PalayeRoyale/status/1002193740566552583?s=19</ref> This can be seen on Palaye Royal's Royal Television series (now 'Bastards TV'<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yr61dgUPYok</ref>) Season 1 episode 20.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5LOQta4Vig&list=PLoSzskfpYHHMv9ilLNcFv9QCq_PUMfdBG&index=27</ref>\nThe fans of the band still continue to organise and host these events all over the world.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Art rock musical groups]]\n[[Category:Canadian indie rock groups]]\n[[Category:Canadian garage rock groups]]\n[[Category:Glam rock groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 2008]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Toronto]]\n[[Category:Musical groups from Las Vegas]]\n", "name_user": "Lorafoutch", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added a memeber", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaye_Royale"}
